# Annif for LLMs4Subjects
Here we use an extreme multilabel text classification (XMTC) approaches implemented in Annif - together with LLM-based approaches for data preparation - for the shared task 5 of SemEval'25. Attention is also paid to hyperparameter optimization.
DVC is used to manage the data sets and to coordinate the training and evaluation processes.
