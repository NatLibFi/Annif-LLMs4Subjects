Changes in the Legal Status of the Commissariat à l'énergie atomique (CEA)
This provision in the Ordinance of 18 October 19451 is the birth certificate for the Atomic Energy Commission (hereinafter CEA, Commissariat à l’énergie atomique), a public entity whose legal nature has, for a long time now, been unique and the subject of debate. On 18 October 2009, the CEA will nevertheless celebrate its 64th anniversary.
