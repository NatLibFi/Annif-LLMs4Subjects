6. Non-market and Organizational Research
Modern laboratory experimental methods were heavily inﬂuenced by research in the worlds of non-market, public choice and political science. In the early 1970s these areas held much new theory and the conﬂicts among theories, including conﬂicts across disciplinary boundaries were visible. The public economics and political science worlds are worlds without prices, property rights and exchanges other than through voting. Multiple agents are involved as opposed to the two, typical of game theory experiments and preferences do not depend upon your own actions but instead could depend on the action of others. So, an individual could become benefited or harmed while taking no actions at all.
