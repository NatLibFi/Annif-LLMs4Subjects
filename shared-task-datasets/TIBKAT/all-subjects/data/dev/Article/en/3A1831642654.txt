Chapter 21 International differences in industrial organization
Some of the most conspicuous and intriguing international differences in institutions lie in the control, ownership, and integration of enterprises. It is widely accepted that Coase's classic questionWhy does the boundary between the firm and the market fall where it does?is answered by identifying the transactioncost advantages that may attach to either the market or the firm as allocators of resources. The actual boundaries are drawn in a Darwinian process by which the more efficient institution displaces the less efficient one. If this Darwinian competition worked the same way in every country and the transactioncost efficiencies of firms and markets have been independent of laws, cultural traits, and other distinguishing traits of nationhood, then the allocation between firms and markets should be expected to differ only inessentially from country to country. If industrial groups' roles are related to the diversification and internalization, they also show affinity for the problem of agency in the ownership and control of firms. The concept of agency provides the tool needed to analyze the split between ownership and control in the large, public corporation, and it suggests the sort of device that might be expected to emerge to avert the slippage in diffuse agency relationships.
