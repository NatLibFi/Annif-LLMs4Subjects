The Radioactive Waste Directive : a necessary step in the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste in the European Union
Council Directive 2011/70/Euratom of 19 July 2011 establishing a Community framework for the responsible and safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste1 (Waste Directive) was adopted with the support of all member states of the European Union. Following the adoption of the Council Directive establishing a Community framework for the nuclear safety of nuclear installations in 2009 (Safety Directive), the Waste Directive represents another important step towards building and strengthening the most advanced possible legal framework for nuclear energy in Europe.
