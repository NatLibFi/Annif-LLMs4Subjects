Country review: Ukraine
This report* was the basis of a two hour and a half peer review in the OECD Global Forum on Competition (GFC) on 21 February 2008. It assesses the development and application of competition law and policy in Ukraine, focusing on activities over the previous five years (2003-07). The report concludes that Ukraine has a comprehensive and well-designed competition law and, in the AMC, an effectively managed and well-regarded agency to enforce it. The report also identifies an array of problems confronting Ukraine in the competition law arena, and makes various remedial proposals, including recommendations dealing with the AMC’s budget allocation, autonomy, investigative tools, transparency, enforcement priorities, and relationships with other law enforcement agencies. Additional recommendations in the report focus on the competition law’s merger notification requirements and procedures, state aid legislation, penalties for unlawful conduct and penalty collection procedures, competition advocacy, harmonization with the European Union’s competition laws, and the elimination of conflicting provisions in Ukraine’s Commercial Code.
