Chapter 9. New Technologies and Cultural Consumption
New technologies affect cultural consumption in several ways. Technological change lowers the cost of cultural consumption, inducing substitution and/or increasing demand, in both cases increasing consumer welfare. Technological change can also impact dynamically, inducing increased variety supplied both by professionals and amateurs, and facilitating the exploration of new cultural consumption experiences. In cultural production, as in other sectors, the ultimate beneficiaries of technological change are consumers.
