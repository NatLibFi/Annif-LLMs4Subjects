Chapter 3 Residential mobility and household location modelling
This chapter describes the concept of residential mobility and household location modeling. It focuses on the nature of household location and attempts to link the two underlying components of housing markets and residential mobility and migration. There has been a tendency to separate the investigations of housing markets and the studies of migration and mobility. It investigates a number of the models which have been used to link markets and mobility. Several different modeling strategies have been used to examine housing markets and migration and the review of these approaches includes linear programming models, gravity and entropy models, log-linear models, discrete choice and random utility models, behavioral and search models, elimination-by-aspects models and microsimulation models. In this way, this chapter gives an overview of the state of the art in residential mobility and household locational modeling. The chapter concludes with prospects and some suggestions for future research.
