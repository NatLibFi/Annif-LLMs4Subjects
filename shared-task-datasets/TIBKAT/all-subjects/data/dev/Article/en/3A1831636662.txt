Chapter 42 The land market and government intervention
Two kinds of government intervention in the land market are considered. The first is the control of development, of which the most studied form is zoning, but we also consider the designation of conservation areas and the effects of growth controls. Growth control may raise the price of land, allowing an infrastructure charge to be made or growth may be limited by charging impact fees. The second kind of intervention aims to increase the supply of land, either by direct action, as in the Netherlands, through compulsory purchase or eminent domain, or through the reallocation of land ownership as in land readjustment schemes.
