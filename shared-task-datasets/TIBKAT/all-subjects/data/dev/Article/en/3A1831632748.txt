Chapter 78 Quasi-experimental Evaluation of Regional Employment Subsidies
Although certain government policies might be tested in controlled experiments during a pilot phase, such tests are rarely undertaken. Ideally, a policy could be tried, when feasible and meaningful, on a random subset of areas, firms or consumers exposed to the policy and be compared with the remaining subset over a significant period of time. The results reported here are from a test where the Swedish government introduced a regional employment policy in a limited part of a fairly homogeneous area with high chronic unemployment, hence creating a non-random division into an experiment region and a control region. Once the decision was made to introduce the policy, a quasi- experimental evaluation of the policy was proposed to the government; and, as a result, the government agreed to leave the two regions intact for a period of three years to allow this evaluation to take place and cover a non-trivial period of time a quite unusual, perhaps unprecedented, step for a government to take.
