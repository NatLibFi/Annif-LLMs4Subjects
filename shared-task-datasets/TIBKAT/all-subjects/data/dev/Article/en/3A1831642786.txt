Chapter 12 Product differentiation
Any set of commodities closely related in consumption and/or in production may be regarded as differentiated products. Close relation in consumption depends on consumers' tastes. Elementary scientific methodology tells that theories aspiring to empirical relevance must be consistent with the observed facts. For this reason, awkward facts are to be welcomed; indeed, the more awkward they are, the greater are the constraints that they place on theorizing. Seven of the most important awkward facts that are available to constrain theorizing about product differentiation are described in the chapter. A complete model of product differentiation would specify (1) the set of possible products, (2) the technology associated with each product, (3) the tastes of consumers over the set of possible products, and (4) an equilibrium concept. There is little debate over the cost aspects of relevant models. Of the assumptions that are typically made, some are needed to accommodate one or another of the awkward facts, while others are employed merely for analytical convenience.
