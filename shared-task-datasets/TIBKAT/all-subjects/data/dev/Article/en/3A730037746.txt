International Legal Instruments Promoting Synergies in Nuclear Safety, Security and Safeguards : Myth or Reality?
With the discovery of radioactivity and ionizing radiation at the turn of the twentieth century, mankind broke new ground in science and technology. These discoveries, which we now call the “dawn of the nuclear age”,1 paved the way for hundreds of scientists and engineers in their quest to improve our standard of living through progress in science.
