Competition Law and Policy in Turkey
This report served as the basis of a peer review of the Turkish Competition Authority (TCA) held in the 2005 OECD Global Forum on Competition. It concluded that the TCA has achieved significant progress since its establishment in 1997. While noting the particular strengths of the TCA, the report makes a wide range of recommendations to address the full array of still persisting competition law and policy issues in Turkey. These recommendations are expected to improve the effectiveness of the implementation of competition law and policy in Turkey.
