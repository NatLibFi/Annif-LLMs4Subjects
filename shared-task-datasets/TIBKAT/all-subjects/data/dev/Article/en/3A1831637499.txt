Chapter 1 Advances in regional economics
This chapter focuses on the advances made in regional economics. Regional economics analyzes the spatial dispersion and coherence of economic activities. Although it is a fairly recent discipline, the history of economics shows various early attempts to explicitly address spatial issuesfor e.g., in comparative costtheories and international trade theories. Initially, much of the field of regional economics was based on an analogy to general economics, the main difference being the explicit treatment of geographical space as a source of various locationallocation phenomena. Illustrative examples in this context are linear programming models for transportation analysis, spatial substitution problems in neoclassical production theories, inter-regional input-output analysis, and so forth. In a later stage, however, more emphasis was placed on the indigenous features of geographical space and its implications for the spatio-temporal evolution of complex spatial economic systems. Currently, regional economics appears to be a rich discipline with a great many linkages to urban economic problems, transportation problems, and natural resource problems.
