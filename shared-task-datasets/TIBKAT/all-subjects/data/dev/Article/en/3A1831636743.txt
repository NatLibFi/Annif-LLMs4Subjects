Chapter 34 Introduction: Applied urban economics
There has been an outpouring of high quality applied research in urban economics as in other specialties in the past decade. The reasons for the rapid growth of applied research are not difficult to identify: better theoretical frameworks within which applied research is undertaken; better econometric techniques and software; more and better data; and, probably most important, ever cheaper and more widely distributed computing power within the research community that provides easier access to, and analysis of, data. Data and research output now move around the world at the speed of light, and thousands of scholars in dozens of countries can access the US census and many other data sources. Not only is more high quality applied research being done but also it is now being done in many more institutions than it was a decade or two ago. The computer has reduced the inequality among academic institutions in their capability to do applied research.
