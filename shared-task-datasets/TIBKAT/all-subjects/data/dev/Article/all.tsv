Modellierung sektorenübergreifender Systemdienstleistungen bei gekoppelt betriebenem Strom- und Gassektor ¤ Aufgrund der steigenden Einspeisung elektrischer Leistung durch erneuerbare Energieanlagen und der gleichzeitig voranschreitenden schrittweisen Abschaltung von konventionellen Kohlekraftwerken, steigen die Anforderungen an eine zuverlässige, kostengünstige und klimafreundliche Bereitstellung von Flexibilitäten zum Erhalt der Systemstabilität. Mit der Gesamtsystembetrachtung aus Strom- und Gassektor können durch die Kopplung neue Freiheitsgrade erschlossen werden. In diesem Beitrag wird vorgestellt, wie eine sektorenübergreifende Erbringung von Systemdienstleistungen vom Strom- zum Gasnetz in einem dynamischen Energiesystemmodell im Zeitbereich der Mittelzeitdynamik abgebildet werden kann. Anhand von numerischen Fallstudien wird am Beispiel von Thüringen für verschiedene Szenarien ausgewertet, inwiefern durch eine sektorenübergreifende Betrachtung Flexibilitätspotenziale realisiert und die Betriebsgrenzen und somit die Stabilitätsbedingungen beider Sektoren eingehalten werden können.	<gnd:4068598-6>
6. Non-market and Organizational Research ¤ Modern laboratory experimental methods were heavily inﬂuenced by research in the worlds of non-market, public choice and political science. In the early 1970s these areas held much new theory and the conﬂicts among theories, including conﬂicts across disciplinary boundaries were visible. The public economics and political science worlds are worlds without prices, property rights and exchanges other than through voting. Multiple agents are involved as opposed to the two, typical of game theory experiments and preferences do not depend upon your own actions but instead could depend on the action of others. So, an individual could become benefited or harmed while taking no actions at all.	<gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4124477-1>
A comparison of structural productivity levels in the major industrialised countries ¤ Hourly labour productivity, along with average hours worked, the employment rate and the working-age population as a share of the total population, is one of the accounting aggregates that determine per capita GDP. Yet according to many analyses, hourly labour productivity in several European countries is much the same as or even higher than in the United States, while per capita GDP is markedly lower (see Cette 2004, 2005 for a summary of this work).	<gnd:4014957-2> <gnd:4066493-4>
Chapter 3 Residential mobility and household location modelling ¤ This chapter describes the concept of residential mobility and household location modeling. It focuses on the nature of household location and attempts to link the two underlying components of housing markets and residential mobility and migration. There has been a tendency to separate the investigations of housing markets and the studies of migration and mobility. It investigates a number of the models which have been used to link markets and mobility. Several different modeling strategies have been used to examine housing markets and migration and the review of these approaches includes linear programming models, gravity and entropy models, log-linear models, discrete choice and random utility models, behavioral and search models, elimination-by-aspects models and microsimulation models. In this way, this chapter gives an overview of the state of the art in residential mobility and household locational modeling. The chapter concludes with prospects and some suggestions for future research.	<gnd:4182752-1> <gnd:4076601-9> <gnd:4121573-4>
Chapter 13. Local Interactions ¤ Local interactions refer to social and economic phenomena where individuals' choices are influenced by the choices of others who are close to them socially or geographically. This represents a fairly accurate picture of human experience. Furthermore, since local interactions imply particular forms of externalities, their presence typically suggests government action. I survey and discuss existing theoretical work on economies with local interactions and point to areas for further research.	<gnd:4027266-7> <gnd:4132883-8> <gnd:4079351-5> <gnd:4066514-8> <gnd:4120990-4>
Chapter 22 Economics of general practice ¤ General (or family) practice and its role within primary care is increasingly regarded as the key to achieving efficiency and equity in many health care systems. This is particularly relevant where general practitioners (GPs) act as gatekeepers to specialist care. This chapter outlines the main economic issues in general practice. Within the context of gatekeeping, the first half of the chapter examines literature on agency, patient choice and preferences for GP services, and the utilisation of GP services. Given that much demand is determined by supply, this is followed by an examination of the determinants of referral behaviour, the effects of payment systems, and GPs as firms (partnerships and vertical integration). Overall, there has been little research by economists in these areas. This needs to be rectified giving the growing importance of primary care in many health care systems.	<gnd:4130935-2>
The drivers of public expenditure on health and long-term care : An integrated approach ¤ Public expenditures on health and long-term care (hereafter, LTC) are a matter of concern for governments in most OECD countries. These expenditures have recently accelerated and are putting pressure on public budgets, adding to that arising from insufficiently reformed retirement schemes and other forms of social spending. The growth of public spending on health and long-term care in OECD countries has been limited for some time via the implementation of cost-containment policies. These policies acted essentially through wage moderation, price controls and postponement of investment in the case of health care. A large share of long-term care has been informally provided by families. However, the scope for containing health and LTC expenditures along these lines is narrowing.	<gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4014957-2>
Chapter 22 International money and international monetary arrangements ¤ This chapter examines the current research on the basic purpose and functions of international monetary arrangements. The terms and conditions under which assets denominated in different currencies may be exchanged for each other are related both to the intrinsic worth or “purchasing power” of the different currencies and to restrictions imposed by the issuers of currencies, as influenced by the agreed rules of the system. At the heart of such a system are the rules for financing and adjusting payments imbalances to insure continued convertibility. Research is done on the demand for reserve assets that is in principle dependent on the design of the system, because it depends upon the chosen mix between adjustment and financing of payments imbalances. Thus one considers the effects of floating exchange rates, the degree of capital mobility, central bank intervention in exchange markets, and the use of private bank financing of payments imbalances on the demand for reserve assets. The chapter also discusses the optimal design of international monetary arrangements. There is a potentially wide choice of degree of flexibility of exchange rates and degree of reliance on markets as opposed to institutions. Given national preferences and behavior, recent analysis discusses how national policies interact under different sets of international monetary arrangements. Such analysis leads to proposals for changes in the design of the system to improve the international distribution of income, to improve control over the growth of international reserve assets, and to improve the macroeconomic performance of the world economy as it is affected by the interaction of national economic policies.	<gnd:4065468-0> <gnd:4065365-1>
Chapter 77 Pre-testing International Climate Change Policies: Methods and Results ¤ A subset of the world's countries may wish to commit themselves to stringent emission targets in an attempt to inﬂuence other countries to follow suit, thereby bringing about a significant reduction in the threat to the global climate. Moreover, if the pioneering countries were to connect a tradable quota system to these commitments, they would be in a position to provide information not only about the practicability and efficiency properties of this policy instrument but also about the general economic implications of the commitments made. If the set of countries were small, which seems quite likely in the case of pioneering agreements, this action could reveal, in particular, how efficient a small market for quota trade would be. Furthermore, it could also show, for a set of similarly developed countries as the only participants, whether the common presumption that their costs would be too similar for any significant amount of trade gains to arise were in fact correct.	<gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4252654-1>
Chapter 6 Sectoral economics ¤ This chapter discusses a common set of methods that are not currently in wide use in either microeconomics or macroeconomics, but constitute a core of the methodology for models in many different sectors of the economy. The chapter also provides an overview of the varieties of sectoral models, and discusses the ways in which some of the methods of sectoral economics can be used to great advantage in microeconomics or macroeconomics. It is now possible to estimate entire models and to solve these models using nonlinear programming or stochastic control theory methods. These methods permit the consideration of accurate models and the inclusion in the analysis of the effects of uncertainty. The progress in sectoral modeling is based on the foundation of earlier work in activity analysis, linear programming, and the solution of models with economies of scale that permits the development and solution of realistic models with many commodities, processes, productive units, plants, and markets.	<gnd:4011152-0> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4112736-5>
International Production Relocation and Exports of Services ¤ This paper explores the relationship between the relocation of international production and exports of services from the United States using a number of different panel data estimators for six different categories of services. A conventional export demand relationship is augmented by three different measures of the extent of international production relocation by US-based parent companies in service and non-service industries. Our results reveal considerable heterogeneity in the relationship...	<gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4014957-2>
Chapter 61 Using Randomization in Development Economics Research: A Toolkit ¤ This paper is a practical guide (a toolkit) for researchers, students and practitioners wishing to introduce randomization as part of a research design in the field. It first covers the rationale for the use of randomization, as a solution to selection bias and a partial solution to publication biases. Second, it discusses various ways in which randomization can be practically introduced in a field settings. Third, it discusses designs issues such as sample size requirements, stratification, level of randomization and data collection methods. Fourth, it discusses how to analyze data from randomized evaluations when there are departures from the basic framework. It reviews in particular how to handle imperfect compliance and externalities. Finally, it discusses some of the issues involved in drawing general conclusions from randomized evaluations, including the necessary use of theory as a guide when designing evaluations and interpreting results.	<gnd:4066438-7> <gnd:4213090-6>
A Note on Benefit Security ¤ A reoccurring motif in pension literature and policy is the search for “benefit security” – that is, assurance to members of a pension regime that, at the end of the working career, they will get some reasonably predictable outcome, either as a pension (benefit stream) or a lump sum. The purpose of this note is to present a simple “thought experiment” to explore this matter and how market mechanisms might be brought more to bear...	<gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4068097-6>
Chapter 21 Not-for-profit ownership and hospital behavior ¤ The for-profit hospital is in the minority numerically in all developed countries. Although the for-profits' market share has been quite stable for decades, for-profit chains have grown in share and influence in the United States. By contrast, for-profit chains have made few inroads in other countries. The literature on hospital ownership addresses three fundamental questions. First, why do private not-for-profit organizations dominate the hospital industry? Second, how do private not-for-profits differ from for-profits in their behavior? Third, is the private not-for-profit form more efficient in this industry? The main difference between for-profit and private not-for-profit organizations is in the distribution of accounting profit. The latter do not distribute profits to equity holders and enjoy some competitive advantages, including tax exemptions and the ability to receive private donations. Various reasons for why the not-for-profit form is dominant are explored. Reasons involve: transactions costs of various ownership forms; fiduciary relationships between patients and providers; public goods; implicit and explicit subsidies; inertia; cartelization; and lack of profit opportunities. The review concludes that there is merit in an number of explanations, but no single explanation works perfectly. Certainly the transactions cost of various ownership forms must provide a partial explanation for observed patterns of hospital ownership. There is a rich empirical literature on hospital behavior. This chapter discusses comparative evidence by hospital ownership form on hospital cost, profitability, pricing and cost-shifting, uncompensated care, diffusion of technology, quality of care, and hospital capital funds and investment. In recent years, changes in hospital ownership have been common in the United States. Changes have occurred in all directions — from private not-for-profit to for-profit and the reverse, for example. Comparing hospital behavior before and after the conversion, the fact that a hospital converted seems to be more important than the type of ownership change that occurred. As competition among hospitals increases, differences in behavior among hospitals with different ownership forms should narrow. Privately owned hospitals in the U.S. were more alike than different. Private not-for-profit hospitals will have less latitude than previously to produce outputs they deem to be socially worthy. The chapter ends with the author's agenda for future research.	<gnd:4130935-2>
Chapter 3 Games with perfect information ¤ This chapter discusses the games with perfect information (PI). The most seriously played PI-games are Chess and Go. But there are numerous other interesting PI-games: Checkers, Chinese Checkers, Halma, Nim, Hex, their misre variants, etc. Perfect information means that at each time only one of the players moves, that the game depends only on their choices, they remember the past, and in principle they know all possible futures of the game. For example War is not a PI-game since the generals move simultaneously, and Bridge and Backgammon are not PI-games because chance plays a role in them. However, some cases of Pursuit and Evasion can be studied by means of PI-games, in spite of the simultaneity and continuity of the movements of the players. The chapter focuses on infinite PI-games. The theory of infinite PI-games is motivated by its beauty and manifold connections with other parts of mathematics. They give also a natural mathematical theory for some garnes of pursuit and evasion. Finite and infinite PI-games are also used in model theory and in recursion theory.	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4056243-8>
Chapter 16. The Fiscal Impact of Immigrants : Taxes and Benefits ¤ This chapter provides a comprehensive look at the different ways of estimating the fiscal impact of immigration, discusses the evidence for different countries, and proposes ideas for future research. The evidence regarding the direction of the fiscal impact of immigration (i.e., fiscal burden or blessing) is mixed, but most analysis suggests that the impact is a small share of the fiscal budgets of most host countries. In most cases the estimated impact is less than 1% of GDP. The majority of the analysis has been static (i.e., analysis for a single fiscal year), even though there is wide acceptance that a longitudinal perspective is necessary in order to assess the fiscal impact of immigration. The majority of the existing dynamic analyses provide a partial equilibrium perspective that fails to provide a comprehensive picture of this complex topic. There is also broad agreement that the composition of the immigrant population is more important than the level of immigration, but there is scarce research that focuses on the composition question. This includes a lack of research that distinguishes the impact of those who migrated after going through a selection process based on skills (e.g., work visas) and those who arrived through other channels (e.g., free movement, family reunification, asylum, etc.). Finally, a large share of the work in the area has been conducted by think-tanks and other policy focused groups. Most of these organizations have a set agenda in favor or against increased immigration. Unsurprisingly, those organizations with a favorable view of immigration tend to find that immigrants make a positive contribution to public finances, while those campaigning for reduced immigration tend to find the contrary.	<gnd:4069332-6> <gnd:4120730-0> <gnd:4501977-0>
Chapter 14 Valuing the Environment as a Factor of Production ¤ This chapter explores the theory and practice of measuring the economic costs and benefits of environmental changes that influence production, both in the context of firms and of households. The theory uses models of household and firm decision making to map the influence of environmental changes to changes in human welfare. The goal is to measure, by compensating or equivalent changes in incomes, the welfare effects on people, in their roles as owners of firms, owners of factors of production, and consumers. The developing country context is most common for valuing the environment as an input, because agriculture and natural resource extraction are so much more important than in industrialized countries. When households or firms produce goods for sale on the market, and the environment influences the costs of production, we show the circumstances when one can use information embodied in the supply curve of the marketed good or the demand curve for an input into the production of the good to extract welfare measures for environmental change. When the environment affects the cost of production of goods households produce and consume, we show the restrictions on production technology that will permit welfare measure for changes in the environment. We also look at circumstances that permit the calculations of bounds for the exact welfare measures. We explore welfare measurement under a variety of institutional structures, including government support for agricultural commodities and open-access fisheries. Exact welfare measurement makes extensive demands for data. Because these demands are not often met in practice, researchers resort to a variety of approximations of welfare measures. We assess these approximations, comparing them with the more exact measures.	<gnd:4061616-2> <gnd:4006340-9> <gnd:4061638-1>
Chapter 11 Military expenditure and developing countries ¤ Military expenditure in developing countries raises complex questions regarding growth, development, security and governance. This chapter provides an analytical survey of the effects and causes of defense spending in developing economies. Using stylized facts, theoretical models and empirical results, it discusses some core aspects of the interrelationship between defense and development. The chapter emphasizes two major issues in the field: economic growth and defense spending; security and development. Although the issues are placed in a broad framework, the focus of the chapter is on economic aspects of the interaction of military expenditures with growth and developmental factors.	<gnd:4132793-7>
Chapter 20. Term Structure of Uncertainty in the Macroeconomy ¤ Dynamic economic models make predictions about impulse responses that characterize how macroeconomic processes respond to alternative shocks over different horizons. From the perspective of asset pricing, impulse responses quantify the exposure of macroeconomic processes and other cash flows to macroeconomic shocks. Financial markets provide compensations to investors who are exposed to these shocks. Adopting an asset pricing vantage point, we describe and apply methods for computing exposures to macroeconomic shocks and the implied compensations represented as elasticities over alternative payoff horizons. The outcome is a term structure of macroeconomic uncertainty.	<gnd:4121333-6> <gnd:4037174-8>
Chapter 67 Rural Poverty and Income Dynamics in Southeast Asia ¤ Many rural households in Asia have been able to move out of poverty in the presence of increasing scarcity of farmland, initially by increasing rice income through the adoption of modern rice technology and gradually diversifying their income sources away from farm to nonfarm activities. Increased participation in nonfarm employment has been more pronounced among the more educated children, whose education is facilitated by an increase in farm income brought about by the spread of modern rice technology. An important lesson for poverty reduction is to increase agricultural productivity through the development and adoption of modern technology, which subsequently stimulates the development of the nonfarm sector, thereby providing employment opportunities for the rural labor force. This chapter explores the key processes of long-term poverty reduction in Southeast Asia using the Philippines and Thailand as case studies.

Chapter 7. Regional Computable General Equilibrium Modeling ¤ Over the past three decades the field of regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling has flourished, growing from a handful of top-down, single-region and low-dimensioned multiregional models, to a mature field, in which output of large-scale general-purpose multiregional CGE models has become a standard input to policy deliberations in a growing number of countries. Researchers have ensured that innovations in theory, data construction and model application have matched growth in both computing power and the appetite of government decision makers for expanding levels of policy-relevant regional and sectoral detail. This chapter focuses on the development of the field, its current state, and its accomplishments in elucidating important research questions and policy issues in regional economics. We begin by discussing the development of regional CGE modeling as a subdiscipline of CGE modeling, expanding on the distinguishing attributes of regional CGE models. We then discuss policy applications of regional CGE models, demonstrating the power of such models to answer important policy questions and providing an application-driven motivation for our discussion of the innovations in the field. We consider the key theoretical features of multiregional CGE models, identifying the many ways researchers have modeled the behavior of economic agents in a multiregional context. The paucity of data at the regional level suitable for CGE modeling has long been a constraint and so we discuss methods for populating a multiregional models database. We then undertake simulations with a large-scale CGE model and show how output of the model can be communicated in a way that does not presume knowledge of the details of the underlying model. We note that effective communication of the results of regional CGE modeling studies, based on a correct interpretation of the model mechanisms which underlie them, is a prerequisite for its acceptance in policy circles.	<gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4210294-7> <gnd:4224214-9> <gnd:4065341-9> <gnd:4079351-5> <gnd:4066493-4>
Chapter 14 Bankruptcy Law ¤ Bankruptcy is the legal process whereby financially distressed firms, individuals, and occasionally governments resolve their debts. The bankruptcy process for firms plays a central role in economics, because competition drives inefficient firms out of business, thereby raising the average efficiency level of those remaining. The main economic function of corporate bankruptcy is to reduce the cost of default by having a government-sponsored procedure that resolves all debts simultaneously. The main economic function of personal bankruptcy is to provide partial consumption insurance to individual debtors and therefore reduce the social cost of debt. This chapter surveys theoretical and empirical research on both types of bankruptcy.	<gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4048737-4> <gnd:4066510-0> <gnd:4135492-8> <gnd:4117663-7>
Chapter 10 Human nature and sociality in economics ¤ Since homo sapiens is a social animal, one might expect human nature the set of psychological propensities with which our species is naturally endowed to equip human beings to live in social groups. In this chapter, we consider the implications of this idea for economics and game theory. We begin by discussing four classic accounts of the forces that hold human societies together those of Hobbes, Hume, Rousseau, and Smith, who focus respectively on rational self-interest, convention, collective reasoning, and natural fellow-feeling. Turning to the modern literature, we review some of the ways in sociality has been introduced into decision and game theory by means of assumptions about non-self-interested preferences specifically, assumptions about altruism, warm glow, inequality aversion and reciprocity. We identify some of the limitations of these theories as explanatory devices, and suggest that these limitations derive from a common source: that sociality is being represented within a framework of methodological individualism. We then discuss more radical approaches to explaining social interaction, based on the concepts of expressive rationality and team reasoning. Finally, we pose the fundamental question of whether it is possible to explain social interaction all the way down without going beyond the bounds of methodological individualism.	<gnd:4184535-3> <gnd:4057542-1> <gnd:4020511-3> <gnd:4302876-7> <gnd:4129281-9>
Chapter 4 Voting procedures ¤ Voting procedures focus on the aggregation of individuals' preferences to produce collective decisions. In practice, a voting procedure is characterized by ballot responses and the way ballots are tallied to determine winners. Voters are assumed to have clear preferences over candidates and attempt to maximize satisfaction with the election outcome by their ballot responses. Such responses can include strategic misrepresentation of preferences. Voting procedures are formalized by social choice functions, which map ballot response profiles into election outcomes. We discuss broad classes of social choice functions as well as special cases such as plurality rule, approval voting, and Borda's point-count method. The simplest class is voting procedures for two-candidate elections. Conditions for social choice functions are presented for simple majority rule, the class of weighted majority rules, and for what are referred to as hierarchical representative systems. The second main class, which predominates in the literature, embraces all procedures for electing one candidate from three or more contenders. The multicandidate elect-one social choice functions in this broad class are divided into nonranked one-stage procedures, nonranked multistage procedures, ranked voting methods, and positional scoring rules. Nonranked methods include plurality check-one voting and approval voting, where each voter casts either no vote or a full vote for each candidate. On ballots for positional scoring methods, voters rank candidates from most preferred to least preferred. Topics for multicandidate methods include axiomatic characterizations, susceptibility to strategic manipulation, and voting paradoxes that expose questionable aspects of particular procedures. Other social choice functions are designed to elect two or more candidates for committee memberships from a slate of contenders. Proportional representation methods, including systems that elect members sequentially from a single ranked ballot with vote transfers in successive counting stages, are primary examples of this class.	<gnd:4143069-4> <gnd:4022393-0> <gnd:4079351-5> <gnd:4166306-8>
Chapter 25. Institutions and Laws in the Labor Market ¤ This chapter examines the impact of wage-setting institutions and government policies on wages and employment, focusing on the OECD countries. There is considerable evidence that centralized collective bargaining, minimum wages and antidiscrimination policies raise the relative wages of the low paid. Evidence of the impact of these institutions and other policies such as mandated severance pay, advance notice or unemployment insurance is more mixed with some studies finding negative employment effects while others do not. This may reflect the adoption by many OECD countries of off-setting policies, such as public employment, temporary employment contracts and active labor market programs, which, while they may have reduced the adverse relative employment effects of their less flexible labor market institutions on the low skilled, appear not to have prevented high overall unemployment. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Chapter 22 Political economics and macroeconomic policy ¤ This chapter surveys the recent literature on the theory of macroeconomic policy. We study the effect of various incentive constraints on the policy making process, such as lack of credibility, political opportunism, political ideology, and divided government. The survey is organized in three parts. Part I deals with monetary policy in a simple Phillips curve model: it covers credibility issues, political business cycles, and optimal design of monetary institutions. Part II deals with fiscal policy in a dynamic general equilibrium set up: the main topics here are credibility of tax policy, and political determinants of budget deficits. Part III studies economic growth in models with endogenous fiscal policy.	<gnd:4121333-6> <gnd:4037174-8>
Chapter 6 Capital theory and trade theory ¤ In a major survey of the theory of international trade, dynamic trade theory calls for further, systematic analysis and synthesis, and notes the negligible dent made so far by intermediate and capital goods in the theoretical models employed by analysts of international trade. This chapter surveys the progress that has now been made in incorporating capital goods into trade theory and discusses the dynamic models of trade and growth. Within this model, it is possible to develop a treatment of welfare economics that broadly follows the well-known static theory of the gains from trade although with some important features peculiar to intertemporal theory. Few positive-economic results are obtainable within such a general model. The chapter also provides two alternative ways of simplifying the general model so as to obtain useful results: reducing the number of goods, factors, and time-periods ill the model, or considering only steady states. Results in particular cases, which turn out to be similar to the standard results in models without capital, may not be sufficient to show that capital makes no difference. The chapter provides steady-state analysis: when a comparative dynamic result in steady state is formally very similar to a comparative static result in a timeless model it tempts to give the former result the same title as the latter, but such terminology may sometimes be misleading.	<gnd:4065468-0> <gnd:4065365-1>
Chapter 1. Culture, Entrepreneurship, and Growth ¤ We discuss the two-way link between culture and economic growth. We present a model of endogenous technical change where growth is driven by the innovative activity of entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship is risky and requires investments that affect the steepness of the lifetime consumption profile. As a consequence, the occupational choice of entrepreneurship hinges on risk tolerance and patience. Parents expecting their children to become entrepreneurs have an incentive to instill these two values in their children. Cultural transmission is Beckerian, i.e. parents are driven by the desire to maximize their children’s happiness. We also consider, in an extension, a paternalistic motive for preference transmission. The growth rate of the economy depends on the fraction of the population choosing an entrepreneurial career. How many entrepreneurs there are in a society hinges, in turn, on parental investments in children’s patience and risk tolerance. There can be multiple balanced growth paths, where in faster-growing countries more people exhibit an “entrepreneurial spirit.” We discuss applications of models of endogenous preferences to the analysis of socio-economic transformations, such as the British Industrial Revolution. We also discuss empirical studies documenting the importance of culture and preference heterogeneity for economic growth.	<gnd:4128160-3>
Chapter 7. Cities and the Environment ¤ This chapter surveys recent literature examining the relationship between environmental amenities and urban growth. In this survey, we focus on the role of both exogenous attributes such as climate and coastal access and endogenous attributes such as local air pollution and green space. A city's greenness is a function of its natural beauty and is an emergent property of the types of households and firms that locate within its borders and the types of local and national regulations enacted by voters. We explore four main issues related to sustainability and environmental quality in cities. First, we introduce a household locational choice model to highlight the role that environmental amenities play in shaping where households locate within a city. We then analyze how ongoing suburbanization affects the carbon footprint of cities. Third, we explore how the system of cities is affected by urban environmental amenity dynamics and we explore the causes of these dynamics. Fourth, we review the recent literature on the private costs and benefits of investing in “green” buildings. Throughout this survey, we pay careful attention to empirical research approaches and highlight what are open research questions. While much of the literature focuses on cities in the developed world, we anticipate that similar issues will be of increased interest in developing nation's cities.	<gnd:4239568-9> <gnd:4182752-1> <gnd:4121573-4> <gnd:4076601-9>
Chapter 4 Repeated games with complete information ¤ The theory of repeated games is concerned with the analysis of behavior in long-term interactions as opposed to one-shot situations; in this framework new objects occur in the form of threats, cooperative plans, signals, etc. that are deeply related to “real life” phenomena like altruism, reputation or cooperation. More precisely, repeated games with complete information, also called supergames, describe situations where a play corresponds to a sequence of plays of the same stage game and where the payoffs are some long-run average of the stage payoffs. Note that unlike general repeated games [see, for example, Mertens, Sorin and Zamir (1992) ] the stage game is the same (the state is constant; compare with stochastic games; see the chapter on ‘stochastic games’ in a forthcoming volume of this Handbook) and known to the players (the state is certain; compare with games of incomplete information, Chapters 5 and 6 in this Handbook).	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4056243-8>
The "Incentive" Concept as Developed in the Nuclear Safety Conventions and its Possible Extension to Other Sectors ¤ On 26 April 1986, the international nuclear community experienced a dramatic “wake-up call” when the reactor core of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, situated in the former Ukrainian Republic of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, melted down. Due to the large volume of radioactive elements which were released into the atmosphere and spread around the globe, particularly across the northern hemisphere, the accident has been categorised as “by far the most devastating in the history of nuclear power”.1 The incident served to dramatically and vividly remind the world of the potentially devastating national and transboundary consequences which may follow a nuclear accident, and it dispelled the myth that nuclear incidents create predominantly national safety risks. Suddenly all countries, even those without nuclear power capacity or situated in relative geographic isolation from nuclear sites, were forced to realise the risks that could be thrust upon them by a nuclear accident, even one occurring in a far distant state. Chernobyl demonstrated that despite the stationary nature of such plants, thanks to global wind currents external damage could be considerable.	<gnd:4068925-6>
Chapter 23. Labor and Credit Networks in Developing Economies ¤ The past decade has witnessed a surge of interest in the economic analysis of networks. This chapter is concerned with the role played by labor and credit networks in shaping economic activity in developing countries. The problem of identifying network effects on economic outcomes is first discussed, followed by solutions to this problem that have been put forward in the literature. This chapter concludes by discussing the static and dynamic inefficiencies that can be associated with community-based networks as well as their effect on growth and mobility in developing countries.	<gnd:4066514-8> <gnd:4132883-8> <gnd:4027266-7> <gnd:4079351-5> <gnd:4120990-4>
A Public Debt Management Perspective on Proposals for Restrictions on Short Selling of Sovereign Debt ¤ New restrictions on short-selling sovereign debt need to be supported by concrete evidence that links systematically unrestricted short-selling activities to fraud, abuse or market manipulation. OECD debt managers noted that there is plenty of empirical evidence on the benefits of short selling, including more liquidity, pricing efficiency and better allocated risk. However, solid evidence in the form of empirical data on market instability unambiguously caused by unrestricted short-selling activities (to be counted as ‘costs’) seems to be lacking. Debt managers also noted that the reporting requirements will be costly from a purely administrative point of view. A ban on uncovered short selling transactions of sovereign debt would make risk management more difficult and expensive, with detrimental effects on market efficiency, liquidity and funding costs for sovereigns. Moreover, it is unlikely that such bans would have a stabilising effect in government securities markets during a crisis. Rather than containing the crisis, a ban on short selling of government debt is likely to worsen the situation. The paper concludes that OECD debt managers have a range of tested tools at their disposal for dealing with temporary or chronic dysfunctional measures in sovereign debt markets, ranging from ‘quantity measures’, such as openings, to ‘pricing measures’ such as dynamic fails charges.

Chapter 12 Product differentiation ¤ Any set of commodities closely related in consumption and/or in production may be regarded as differentiated products. Close relation in consumption depends on consumers' tastes. Elementary scientific methodology tells that theories aspiring to empirical relevance must be consistent with the observed facts. For this reason, awkward facts are to be welcomed; indeed, the more awkward they are, the greater are the constraints that they place on theorizing. Seven of the most important awkward facts that are available to constrain theorizing about product differentiation are described in the chapter. A complete model of product differentiation would specify (1) the set of possible products, (2) the technology associated with each product, (3) the tastes of consumers over the set of possible products, and (4) an equilibrium concept. There is little debate over the cost aspects of relevant models. Of the assumptions that are typically made, some are needed to accommodate one or another of the awkward facts, while others are employed merely for analytical convenience.	<gnd:4133311-1>
Chapter 9. Algorithmic Mechanism Design : Through the lens of Multiunit auctions ¤ Mechanism design is a subfield of game theory that aims to design games whose equilibria have desired properties such as achieving high efficiency or high revenue. Algorithmic mechanism design is a subfield that lies on the border of mechanism design and computer science and deals with mechanism design in algorithmically complex scenarios that are often found in computational settings such as the Internet. The central challenge in algorithmic mechanism design is the tension between the computational constraints and the game-theoretic ones. This survey demonstrates both the tension and ways of addressing it by focusing on a single simple problem: multiunit auctions. A variety of issues will be discussed: representation, computational hardness, communication, convexity, approximations, Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanisms and their generalizations, single-parameter settings vs. multiparameter settings, and the power of randomness.	<gnd:4056243-8> <gnd:4066528-8>
Chapter 22. The Labor Market Integration and Impacts of US Immigrants ¤ Over the last several decades, two of the most significant developments in the US labor market have been: (1) rising inequality, and (2) growth in both the size and the diversity of immigration flows. Because a large share of new immigrants arrive with very low levels of schooling, English proficiency, and other skills that have become increasingly important determinants of success in the US labor market, an obvious concern is that such immigrants are a poor fit for the restructured American economy. In this chapter, we first place this concern in context by briefly describing the history of US immigration policy and immigrant flows. We then evaluate the concern by discussing evidence for the United States on three relevant topics: the labor market integration of immigrants, the socio-economic attainment of the US-born descendants of immigrants, and the impact of immigration on the earnings and employment opportunities of native workers. We show that immigrants have little trouble finding paid employment and that the wages they earn are commensurate with their skills. Overall, the US-born second generation has achieved educational parity with mainstream society; for some Hispanic groups, however, this is not the case. Finally, we survey the pertinent academic literature and conclude that, on the whole, immigration to the US has not had large adverse consequences for the labor market opportunities of native workers.	<gnd:4501977-0> <gnd:4120730-0> <gnd:4069332-6>
Chapter 27 Antitrust and competition in health care markets ¤ In this chapter we review issues relating to antitrust and competition in health care markets. The chapter begins with a brief review of antitrust legislation. We then discuss whether and how health care is different from other industries in ways that might affect the optimality of competition. The chapter then focuses on the main areas in which antitrust has been applied to health care: hospital mergers, monopsony, and foreclosure. In each of these sections we review the relevant antitrust cases, discuss the issues that have arisen in those cases, and then review the relevant economics literature and suggest some new methods for analyzing these issues.	<gnd:4130935-2>
Economic opening and the demand for skills in developing countries : A review of theory and evidence ¤ A policy reform such as trade liberalisation can accelerate structural change in an economy, causing an exogenous shift in relative factor demands. For some developing countries, the result may be an increase in skills demand associated with the adoption of newly available foreign technology and lower-cost imported capital goods. This demand shift may be permanent or only temporary, but in either case the skills supply should eventually increase in response to higher returns. One concern, however, is that with an initially highly skewed distribution of education the skilled labour supply adjustment may be prolonged; likewise any transitional increase in skill-based wage inequality.	<gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4113450-3>
Chapter 11 Consumption ¤ Consumption is the largest component of GDP. Since the 1950s, the life cycle and the permanent income models have constituted the main analytical tools to the study of consumption behaviour, both at the micro and at the aggregate level. Since the late 1970s the literature has focused on versions of the model that incorporate the hypothesis of Rational Expectations and a rigorous treatment of uncertainty. In this chapter, I survey the most recent contribution and assess where the life cycle model stands. My reading of the evidence and of recent developments leads me to stress two points: (i) the model can only be tested and estimated using a flexible specification of preferences and individual level data; (ii) it is possible to construct versions of the model that are not rejected by the data. One of the main problems of the approach used in the literature to estimate preferences is the lack of a ‘consumption function’. A challenge for future research is to use preference parameter estimates to construct such functions.	<gnd:4037174-8> <gnd:4121333-6>
Chapter 16. Technological Innovation and the Theory of the Firm : The Role of Enterprise-Level Knowledge, Complementarities, and (Dynamic) Capabilities ¤ The firm is the central actor for the effectuation of innovation and technological change. The large industrial laboratories of the previous century have given way to more organizationally and geographically diffuse sources of technology, placing even greater emphasis on the coordination skills of managers. Dynamic capabilities are the skills, procedures, organizational structures, and decision rules that firms utilize to create and capture value. Managers must be able to sense opportunities, craft a business model to capitalize on them, and reconfigure their organizations, and sometimes their industries, as the business environment and technology shift. The key employees in this regard are experts (literati and numerati), whose management requires limited hierarchy, flexible teams, and performance-based incentives. To encompass these realities, the theory of the firm needs to be augmented to account for opportunity as well as opportunism, coordination beyond the boundaries of the firm as well as within it, variations in the level of capability across firms, and the frequent superiority of the firm over markets for the creation, transfer, and protection of intangible assets. Complementarities and cospecialization are advanced as two emerging concepts of particular relevance to a theory of the innovating enterprise earning above-normal returns.	<gnd:4059252-2>
International nuclear law in the 25 years between Chernobyl and Fukushima and beyond ¤ This issue of the Nuclear Law Bulletin opens with a paper dedicated both to legal developments since the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant 25 years ago and possible legal implications of the accidents at Fukushima Daiichi which occurred after Japan was struck by a devastating earthquake on 11 March 2011.	<gnd:4068925-6>

Chapter 33 Culture in International Trade ¤ Cultural allegiances whether inherited, imposed or chosen, affect economic activity. Many of these cultural layers – ethnic background, religion, language, ideological orientation, and artistic interests – spill over national boundaries. Cultural ideas travel the world along many routes from the Silk Road to modern electronic networks. Historically, peripatetic artists, composers and writers have responded to shifting patronage and market opportunities. More recently, firms in the cultural industries develop and produce content and distribute it as widely as the market will bear. Visual and performing arts and the cultural industries have both common and distinct international economic dimensions. In trade agreements, countries voluntarily limit their policy options in return for restrictions on the choices of the other member countries. Arguments for protection versus openness for cultural activities are more complex and nuanced than for other economic sectors because of a wide range of views on how international cultural policy affects individuals and the national culture. The inclusion of GATS and TRIPS in the WTO made the WTO a more important influence on international cultural policy than its GATT predecessor. UNESCO continues to play a complementary role. The Florence agreement (1950) encourages the free flow of cultural products and a convention addresses illicit trade in cultural property, a heritage issue. Currently, UNESCO is the focus of efforts to create a rules-based convention to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions, which is designed to either separate international cultural policy governance from the WTO or strengthen the bargaining position of cultural industry interests in WTO negotiations. These discussions take place in circumstances where there are serious shortcomings in the measurement of trade in cultural goods and services.	<gnd:4315813-4> <gnd:4268059-1>
Competition Issues in the Electricity Sector ¤ Electricity markets are prone to the exercise of market power due to a combination of factors including: inelastic demand, lack of extensive practical storage of electricity, transmission congestion, transmission loop flows and capacity constraints coupled with diversity in the marginal costs of different types of generators. The level of market power can vary rapidly in time according to changes in transmission congestion and fluctuating load levels. Given the propensity of the electricity market to market power, horizontal structural separation (or divestiture) of the generation market is a key policy tool. Some structural separation has been carried out, but on a relatively limited scale. But congestion segments electricity markets and contributes to the exercise of generator market power. This effect can provide the incentive for building new generation capacity. So a balance must be found between providing an...	<gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4065839-9> <gnd:4121924-7>
Chapter 9. New Technologies and Cultural Consumption ¤ New technologies affect cultural consumption in several ways. Technological change lowers the cost of cultural consumption, inducing substitution and/or increasing demand, in both cases increasing consumer welfare. Technological change can also impact dynamically, inducing increased variety supplied both by professionals and amateurs, and facilitating the exploration of new cultural consumption experiences. In cultural production, as in other sectors, the ultimate beneficiaries of technological change are consumers.	<gnd:4315813-4> <gnd:4268059-1>
Chapter 5 Retirement from the labor force ¤ The chapter presents some basic facts on retirement patterns and examines some reasons for the changes in behavior over time and differences across groups. Retirement is an important phenomenon in life-cycle labor supply. Not only does it mean a complete withdrawal from the labor force, but it also turns on a number of institutional facets such as social security and private pensions. The chapter explores a number of theoretical models and discusses empirical results. The chapter presents a close look at pensions and social security and concludes by analyzing life-cycle savings behavior and looking at the status of retirees. The goal of the chapter is to lay out the important issues in retirement behavior, rather than to draw definitive conclusions on the state of knowledge. A quick look at the data reveals that the most important trend among older workers in the United States is the decline in age of retirement. Because there has been a simultaneous increase in the real income of the population, an obvious conjecture is that most of this reflects an income effect that induces workers to take more leisure. The discussion of pensions focuses on one empirical relationship and a number of theoretical ones. The most important empirical point is that the actuarial value of private pensions first rises, but then declines once the worker continues to work beyond a certain point.	<gnd:4122827-3> <gnd:4322126-9>
Chapter 14. Guest or Temporary Foreign Worker Programs ¤ The purpose of guest or temporary foreign worker programs (TFWPs) is to add workers to the labor force but not permanent residents to the population, meaning that TFWPs are based on the principle of rotating foreign workers in and out of the country. A third of the roughly 115 million foreign-born workers in the world’s 3.5 billion strong labor force in 2013 were guest workers, including up to a third in Gulf oil-exporting and other Middle Eastern countries. The US immigration reforms debated over the past decade would expand current and create new guest worker programs.	<gnd:4120730-0> <gnd:4069332-6> <gnd:4501977-0>
Chapter 30 The Economics of Climate Policy ¤ Economics has played an increasingly important role in shaping policy, in the United States and elsewhere. This chapter reviews some of the dimensions of the economic approach to analyzing, understanding, and developing solutions to the problem of climate change. We then turn to the issue of designing regulatory instruments to control the problem. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the political economy of greenhouse gas control in an international context.	<gnd:4078523-3> <gnd:4061638-1>
Chapter 15 Monte carlo simulation and numerical integration ¤ This chapter discusses simulation methods that are both important and useful in the solution of integration problems, and discusses the principles for the practical application of simulation in economics with a focus on integration problems. The simulation methods are generally straightforward for the investigator to implement, relying on an understanding of a few principles of simulation and the structure of the problem at hand. By contrast, deterministic methods require much larger problem-specific investments in numerical methods. Simulation methods can provide solutions for two related integration problems. One integration problem arises in model solution for agents whose expected utilities cannot be expressed as a closed function of state and decision variables. The other occurs, when the investigator combines sources of uncertainty about models to draw conclusions about policy. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which make use of samples that are neither independently nor identically distributed, have greatly expanded the scope of integration problems with convenient practical solutions.	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4011152-0> <gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4112736-5>
Chapter 8. Social Norms ¤ Social norms are customary or ideal forms of behavior to which individuals in a group try to conform. From an analytical standpoint, the key feature of social norms is that they induce a positive feedback loop between individual and group behavior: the more widely that a norm is practiced by members of a group, the more strongly others are motivated to practice it too. In this chapter we show how to model this type of process using evolutionary game theory. The theory suggests that norm dynamics have several distinctive features. First, behavior within a group will be more uniform than if people optimized solely according to their personal preferences, that is, individual choices will be shifted in the direction of the average choice ( conformity warp ); second, there will be greater variability between groups than within groups ( local conformity/global diversity ); third, norm dynamics tend to be characterized by long periods of inertia punctuated by occasional large changes ( punctuated equilibrium ). We study these and other effects in the context of three examples: contractual norms in agriculture, norms of medical practice, and body weight norms.	<gnd:4079351-5> <gnd:4120990-4> <gnd:4132883-8> <gnd:4066514-8> <gnd:4027266-7>
Chapter 6 The Theory of Public Enforcement of Law ¤ This chapter surveys the theory of the public enforcement of law—the use of governmental agents (regulators, inspectors, tax auditors, police, prosecutors) to detect and to sanction violators of legal rules. The theoretical core of the analysis addresses the following basic questions: Should the form of the sanction imposed on a liable party be a fine, an imprisonment term, or a combination of the two? Should the rule of liability be strict or fault-based? If violators are caught only with a probability, how should the level of the sanction be adjusted? How much of society's resources should be devoted to apprehending violators? A variety of extensions of the central theory are then examined, including: activity level; errors; the costs of imposing fines; general enforcement; marginal deterrence; the principal-agent relationship; settlements; self-reporting; repeat offenders; imperfect knowledge about the probability and magnitude of sanctions; corruption; incapacitation; costly observation of wealth; social norms; and the fairness of sanctions.	<gnd:4048737-4> <gnd:4066510-0> <gnd:4135492-8> <gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4117663-7>
Chapter Two. Causes and Consequences of Regional Variations in Health Care ¤ There are widespread differences in health care spending and utilization across regions of the US as well as in other countries. Are these variations caused by demand-side factors such as patient preferences, health status, income, or access? Or are they caused by supply-side factors such as provider financial incentives, beliefs, ability, or practice norms? In this chapter, I first consider regional health care differences in the context of a simple demand and supply model, and then focus on the empirical evidence documenting causes of variations. While demand factors are important—health in particular—there remains strong evidence for supply-driven differences in utilization. I then consider evidence on the causal impact of spending on outcomes, and conclude that it is less important how much money is spent, and far more important how the money is spent—whether for highly effective treatments such as beta blockers or anti-retroviral treatments for AIDS patients, or ineffective treatments such as feeding tubes for advanced dementia patients.	<gnd:4130935-2>
Chapter 31 Social choice ¤ This chapter discusses social choice and aggregation of individual preferences into a social-welfare ordering. The axiom of independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) and Arrow's impossibility result are presented in the chapter. Two ways of overcoming the impossibility is proposed. One is to restrict the preferences to be single-peaked in which case majority voting yields a satisfactory aggregation, and the other is to require that the social-welfare relation be only acyclic: Nakamura's theorem sets narrow limits to the decisiveness of society's preferences. The chapter describes the GibbardSatterthwaite impossibility result and its relation to Arrow's and presents the connection between the IIA axiom and strategyproofness on any restricted domain. The chapter focuses on voting in strong and Nash equilibrium along with the voting by veto example where the strong equilibrium outcomes are consistent with the sophisticated ones. Implementation of arbitrary choice correspondences by strong and Nash equilibrium is discussed in the chapter. Implementability in Nash equilibrium is almost always characterized by the strong monotonicity property. Implementability in strong equilibrium, on the other hand, relies on the concept of effectivity functions.	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4056243-8>
Chapter 25. Immigrants in Israel ¤ Israel perceives the immigration of Jews as one of its major goals and thus it applies no selection rules towards them. Jewish immigration to Israel hailed from Arab countries as well as European countries. While immigration has shaped the rate of growth of Israel's Jewish population it has also created socio-economic diversity within the Jewish population. The great range of geographical origins and cultural backgrounds of immigrants make the study of the determinants and the consequences of immigration particularly interesting and there is a comprehensive literature on various aspects of Jewish immigration. Although traditionally immigration to Israel used to refer to immigration of Jews, since the early 1990s a substantial number of low-skilled temporary foreign workers entered the country. In addition, the phenomenon of asylum seekers who enter the country also expanded in the last decade. While immigration policy legislation towards Jewish migrants was formed soon after its independence, Israel still lacks a coherent immigration policy towards labor migrants and asylum seekers.	<gnd:4069332-6> <gnd:4120730-0> <gnd:4501977-0>
Chapter 11. Macroeconomics and Household Heterogeneity ¤ The goal of this chapter is to study how, and by how much, household income, wealth, and preference heterogeneity amplify and propagate a macroeconomic shock. We focus on the US Great Recession of 2007–09 and proceed in two steps. First, using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we document the patterns of household income, consumption, and wealth inequality before and during the Great Recession. We then investigate how households in different segments of the wealth distribution were affected by income declines, and how they changed their expenditures differentially during the aggregate downturn. Motivated by this evidence, we study several variants of a standard heterogeneous household model with aggregate shocks and an endogenous cross-sectional wealth distribution. Our key finding is that wealth inequality can significantly amplify the impact of an aggregate shock, and it does so if the distribution features a sufficiently large fraction of households with very little net worth that sharply increase their saving (ie, they are not hand-to mouth) as the recession hits. We document that both these features are observed in the PSID. We also investigate the role that social insurance policies, such as unemployment insurance, play in shaping the cross-sectional income and wealth distribution, and through it, the dynamics of business cycles.	<gnd:4121333-6> <gnd:4037174-8>

Chapter 50 Fairness in Ultimatum Bargaining ¤ Although fairness concerns may be relevant, they appear to be too simple an explanation for why game theory's strong predictions for ultimatum games are so rarely supported. Self interested offerers want to avoid rejections; unpredicted, non-equilibrium behavior is more valuable and effective than equilibrium behavior. Previous ultimatum bargaining researchers tended to conclude that unpredicted outcomes resulted from fairness concerns. In a series of studies, we operationally defined fairness and tested its effects. The accumulated data from our projects document quite clearly that concerns for fairness provide little explanatory value for offerers and only a small part of the explanation for respondents' rejections: the simple cognitive reactions associated with fairness concerns may explain some idiosyncratic rejections; additional, emotional reactions make wounded pride and spite a more compelling explanation for unexpected rejections.	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4124477-1>
Chapter 24 Increasing returns, imperfect competition and the positive theory of international trade ¤ This focuses on increasing returns, imperfect competition, and the positive theory of international trade. It describes the integrated-economy approach to international trade. It is common in the expositions of the international trade theory to start by imagining two isolated countries, which then are allowed to begin trade with each other. The integrated economy approach goes in the reverse direction, starting from a unified economy and then breaking it up. Using the integrated economy approach, it can be shown that the details of particular monopolistic competition models of trade, such as the form of product differentiation, do not matter when it comes to the description of the motives for and pattern of trade. In addition, a picture of trade can be easily offered in which both economies of scale and comparative advantage are the motives for trade. The chapter presents a restatement of the integrated-economy approach to the trade theory and presents a survey of other developments that cannot be treated within that approach. It also discusses the achievements and limits of the new trade theory.	<gnd:4065468-0> <gnd:4065365-1>
Chapter 59 Strategic aspects of political systems ¤ Early results on the emptiness of the core and the majority-rule-chaos results led to the recognition of the importance of modeling institutional details in political processes. A sample of the literature on game-theoretic models of political phenomena that ensued is presented. In the case of sophisticated voting over certain kinds of binary agendas, such as might occur in a legislative setting, equilibria exist and can be nicely characterized. Endogenous choice of the agenda can sometimes yield “sophisticated sincerity”, where equilibrium voting behavior is indistinguishable from sincere voting. Under some conditions there exist agenda-independent outcomes. Various kinds of “structure-induced equilibria” are also discussed. Finally, the effect of various types of incomplete information is considered. Incomplete information of how the voters will behave leads to probabilistic voting models that typically yield utilitarian outcomes. Uncertainty among the voters over which is the preferred outcome yields the pivotal voting phenomenon, in which voters can glean information from the fact that they are pivotal. The implications of this phenomenon are illustrated by results on the Condorcet Jury problem, where voters have common interests but different information.	<gnd:4056243-8> <gnd:4066528-8>
Chapter 8 Copies of Artworks: The Case of Paintings and Prints ¤ In his essay on imitation in the arts, Adam Smith considers that the exact copy of an artwork always deserves less merit than the original. But the hierarchy between copies and originals has changed over time. So has the perception of copies by lawyers, philosophers, art historians and curators. The development of a market for copies is part of a wider contemporary questioning of the boundaries between originality and copy. We analyze whether and how the various actors in the art market (artists, collectors, lawyers, curators, art historians and philosophers) contribute to valuing and creating or, at times, to killing copies. Artists and collectors have never belittled copies. Art historians think that copies have an important role in preserving the memory of lost artworks, and in educating young artists, but nevertheless consider copies better left to the reserves of museums. Lawyers are ambivalent and judicial precedents bear testimony to the ambiguous legal status of copies. Contemporary art historians and art philosophers have influenced curators and museums to organize exhibitions that make use of copies, giving them a new life.	<gnd:4315813-4> <gnd:4268059-1>
Chapter 42 The land market and government intervention ¤ Two kinds of government intervention in the land market are considered. The first is the control of development, of which the most studied form is zoning, but we also consider the designation of conservation areas and the effects of growth controls. Growth control may raise the price of land, allowing an infrastructure charge to be made or growth may be limited by charging impact fees. The second kind of intervention aims to increase the supply of land, either by direct action, as in the Netherlands, through compulsory purchase or eminent domain, or through the reallocation of land ownership as in land readjustment schemes.	<gnd:4076601-9> <gnd:4121573-4> <gnd:4182752-1>
Chapter 24. Immigration in Europe : Trends, Policies, and Empirical Evidence ¤ This chapter summarizes the main trends, policies, and empirical evidence regarding immigration in Europe. We start by providing descriptive evidence on long-term immigration trends and current characteristics of the immigrant populations in various important European destination countries and Europe as a whole. We then discuss key policy issues in the European context, focusing on access to citizenship, asylum seeking, border enforcement, amnesties, and policies to attract talent. In the second part of the chapter, we provide a survey of the large and growing literature on the recent European immigration experience, focusing on two key questions: What has been the socio-economic performance of immigrants in their destination countries and how has immigration impacted these countries’ economies and native populations? We find large and highly persistent gaps in the economic performance of immigrants relative to natives in most destination countries, with only few instances of encouraging progress. Overall, there is little evidence of a detrimental effect of immigration on the economies of the host countries, which appear to respond to immigrant inflows through mechanisms more complex than simple factor price adjustments.	<gnd:4501977-0> <gnd:4120730-0> <gnd:4069332-6>
Chapter 49 Game theory and industrial organization ¤ In this article, we consider how important developments in game theory have contributed to the theory of industrial organization. Our goal is not to survey the theory of industrial organization; rather, we consider the contribution of game theory through a careful discussion of a small number of topics within the industrial organization field. We also identify some points in which developments in the theory of industrial organization have contributed to game theory. The topics that we consider are: commitment in two-stage games and the associated theories of strategic-trade policy and entry deterrence; asymmetric-information games and the associated theories of limit pricing and predation; repeated games with public moves and the associated theory of collusion in markets with public demand fluctuations; mixed-strategy equilibria and purification theory and the associated theory of sales; and repeated games with imperfect monitoring and the associated theory of collusion and price wars. We conclude with a general assessment concerning the contribution of game theory to industrial organization.	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4056243-8>
Trade integration, industry concentration and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows ¤ This paper examines the pattern of industry location in Central European Economies during transition with a view of determining whether the geographical concentration of industries has increased, which factors determine location and, finally, whether industrial policies have played a role.	<gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4113450-3>
The Impact of Pension Funds on Financial Markets ¤ This paper empirically explores the impact of pension funds on market volatility, equity prices, government and corporate bond yields for a panel of 24 countries. The results show a positive and statistically significant relationship between market volatility and pension assets. It complements micro evidence (Dennis and Strickland, 2002) as well as macro findings (Davis, 2004). In addition, equity prices are found to be positively correlated with pension funds, a finding observable for both OECD countries and emerging market economies (EMEs) and present in both the short and long terms. Furthermore, there is evidence indicating a negative link between pension fund assets and both corporate and government bond yields. This might be due to the sizeable buying effects of pension funds, particularly when governments have the tendency to use pension funds to finance implicit pension debts when the traditional pay-as-you-go systems shift to funded systems.	<gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4067488-5>
Longevity Risk and Private Pensions ¤ This paper examines how uncertainty regarding future mortality and life expectancy outcomes, i.e. longevity risk, affects employer-provided defined benefit (DB) private pension plans liabilities. For this purpose, it examines the different approaches that private pension plans follow in practice when incorporating longevity risk in their actuarial calculations. Unfortunately, most pension funds do not fully account for future improvements in mortality and life expectancy. The paper then presents estimations of the range of increase in the net present value of annuity payments for a theoretical DB pension fund. Finally, the paper discusses several policy issues on how to deal with longevity risk emphasising the need for a common approach. In this regard, it argues, following Antolin (2007), that to assess uncertainty and associated risks adequately, a stochastic approach to model mortality and life expectancy is preferable because it permits to attach probabilities to different forecasts.	<gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4068097-6>
Chapter 7 Learning dynamics ¤ This chapter provides a survey of the recent work on learning in the context of macroeconomics. Learning has several roles. First, it provides a boundedly rational model of how rational expectations can be achieved. Secondly, learning acts as a selection device in models with multiple REE (rational expectations equilibria). Third, the learning dynamics themselves may be of interest. While there are various approaches to learning in macroeconomics, the emphasis here is on adaptive learning schemes in which agents use statistical or econometric techniques in self-referential stochastic systems. Careful attention is given to learning in models with multiple equilibria. The methodological tool is to set up the economic system under learning as a SRA (stochastic recursive algorithm) and to analyze convergence by the method of stochastic approximation based on an associated differential equation. Global stability, local stability and instability results for SRAs are presented. For a wide range of solutions to economic models the stability conditions for REE under statistical learning rules are given by the expectational stability principle, which is treated as a unifying principle for the results presented. Both linear and nonlinear economic models are considered and in the univariate linear case the full set of solutions is discussed. Applications include the Muth cobweb model, the Cagan model of inflation, asset pricing with risk neutrality, the overlapping generations model, the seignorage model of inflation, models with increasing social returns, IS-LM-Phillips curve models, the overlapping contract model, and the Real Business Cycle model. Particular attention is given to the local stability conditions for convergence when there are indeterminacies, bubbles, multiple steady states, cycles or sunspot solutions. The survey also discusses alternative approaches and recent developments, including Bayesian learning, eductive approaches, genetic algorithms, heterogeneity, misspecified models and experimental evidence.	<gnd:4037174-8> <gnd:4121333-6>
Chapter 31 Regional economic integration ¤ This chapter presents details on regional economic integration. It reviews and evaluates some of the voluminous literature, theoretical and applied, on the economic effects of regional integration agreements (RIAs). These effects are organized into three types: allocation effects, accumulation effects, and location effects. The first consists of RIAs' impact on the static allocation of resources, in settings with both perfect and imperfect competition. The second encompasses RIAs' impact on the accumulation of productive factors and covers both medium- and long-run growth effects. The third studies the impact of an RIA on the spatial allocation of resources; this analysis draws on the recent economic geography literature. The chapter also discusses the methods and results of empirical evaluations of RIAs, concentrating on North American free trade area NAFTA and the European community (EC). It also elaborates other issues, including the structure of RIAs and the implications of RIAs for the world trading system.	<gnd:4065365-1> <gnd:4065468-0>
Chapter 28 Cultural Heritage: Economic Analysis and Public Policy ¤ This chapter shows how economic theory and public policy analysis can illuminate decision-making relating to cultural heritage. We argue that from an economic viewpoint the appropriate conceptualisation of heritage is as a capital asset. Regarding heritage as cultural capital invites consideration of sustainability aspects, in parallel with the treatment of natural capital in economic theory, allowing us to derive a sustainability rule for cultural capital accumulation. The application of cost–benefit analysis to heritage investment appraisal is discussed, with particular reference to the assessment of non-market benefits. Turning to policy issues, we examine ways in which governments intervene in heritage markets, with particular attention to listing and other forms of regulation. Questions of institutional design, financing and policy delivery in a multi-jurisdictional framework are discussed, and finally the role of the private sector is considered, with emphasis on the possibility of crowding out and the incentive effects of public policy on private behaviour in the heritage field.	<gnd:4315813-4> <gnd:4268059-1>

Chapter 6. Allocative and Remitted Wages : New Facts and Challenges for Keynesian Models ¤ Modern monetary business-cycle models rely heavily on price and wage rigidity. While there is substantial evidence that prices do not adjust frequently, there is much less evidence on whether wage rigidity is an important feature of real world labor markets. While real average hourly earnings are not particularly cyclical, and do not react significantly to monetary policy shocks, systematic changes in the composition of employed workers and implicit contracts within employment arrangements make it difficult to draw strong conclusions about the importance of wage rigidity. We augment a workhorse monetary DSGE model by allowing for endogenous changes in the composition of workers and also by explicitly allowing for a difference between allocative wages and remitted wages. Using both individual-level and aggregate data, we study and extend the available evidence on the cyclicality of wages and we pay particular attention to the response of wages to identified monetary policy shocks. Our analysis suggests several broad conclusions: (i) in the data, composition bias plays a modest but noticeable role in cyclical compensation patterns; (ii) empirically, both the wages for newly hired workers and the “user cost of labor” respond strongly to identified monetary policy innovations; and (iii) a model with implicit contracts between workers and firms and a flexible allocative wage replicates these patterns well. We conclude that price rigidity likely plays a substantially more important role than wage rigidity in governing economic fluctuations.	<gnd:4121333-6> <gnd:4037174-8>
Guidelines for Insurers' Governance ¤ On 28 April 2005, the OECD Council approved the Recommendation on Guidelines for Insurers’ Governance. Guidelines were first endorsed by the OECD Insurance and Private Pensions Committee in collaboration and wide consultation with the 30 member countries’ governmental experts in the insurance sector as well as the insurance and reinsurance industry. These guidelines were also deemed fully compatible and consistent with the OECD Revised Principles on Corporate Governance by its Steering Group in October 2004.	<gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4067488-5>
Chapter 3. Migration and the Demographic Shift ¤ This chapter investigates the two-way relationship between population aging and international migration. After documenting the trends for both, we review the supply-push and demand-pull determinants of migration, focusing particularly on the role of age and aging. We subsequently analyze the implications of migration in the context of aging for labor markets, as well as for health and public budgets, including in the context of political economy. Although immigration is sometimes suggested as a solution for the aging problem, the existing academic literature from different fields is more cautious about its role and potential. While some suggest that large-scale, selective immigration might contribute to alleviating demographic pressures, in general, researchers conclude that migration alone is not likely to play a significant role.	<gnd:4006294-6> <gnd:4334479-3>
The wage premium on tertiary education : New estimates for 21 OECD countries ¤ This study focuses on the single most important component of the private return on tertiary education, the gross wage premium. There are at least two additional reasons for paying particular attention to wage premia. First, the wage premium earned by existing graduates is easy to observe, so high-school leavers can be assumed to take it into account when deciding for or against enrolment in tertiary education. Second, to the extent that wages reflect marginal labour productivity, estimates of wage premia are sometimes used to assess the quality of human capital in an economy with a view to correcting simpler measures based on years of schooling or attainment levels.	<gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4014957-2>
Chapter 1. Behavioral Economics of Education : Progress and Possibilities ¤ Behavioral economics attempts to integrate insights from psychology, neuroscience, and sociology in order to better predict individual outcomes and develop more effective policy. While the field has been successfully applied to many areas, education has, so far, received less attention — a surprising oversight, given the field's key interest in long-run decision making and the propensity of youth to make poor long-run decisions. In this chapter, we review the emerging literature on the behavioral economics of education. We first develop a general framework for thinking about why youth and their parents might not always take full advantage of education opportunities. We then discuss how these behavioral barriers may be preventing some students from improving their long-run welfare. We evaluate the recent but rapidly growing efforts to develop policies that mitigate these barriers, many of which have been examined in experimental settings. Finally, we discuss future prospects for research in this emerging field.	<gnd:4006664-2>
How large are competitive pressures in services markets? : Estimation of mark-ups for selected OECD countries ¤ Mark-ups can provide valuable information on competitive pressures in various sectors of the economy, reflecting pressures stemming from rules of conduct imposed by regulators as well as those arising from such factors as trade and FDI or increasing consumer demands in terms of price and quality. This study estimates mark-ups for services industries in European OECD members and its novelty is that it i) allows for non-constant returns to scale, ii) jointly estimates mark-ups for all sectors and in all countries and iii) estimates mark-ups at a detailed level of sectoral disaggregation. The estimation is done for the period 1993-2006 and uses firm level data of the Amadeus database. In general, the estimated mark-ups are higher for professional services, real estate, renting and utilities, while they tend to be substantially lower for construction, computer services, retail and wholesale trade and catering. There is also large variation across countries in terms of the sizes of the estimated mark-ups. Competitive pressures according to these mark-ups should be large in the United Kingdom and most Scandinavian countries, and relatively small in Central European countries, Sweden and Italy.	<gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4014957-2>
Chapter 68 The Combinatorial Auction ¤ This chapter summarizes a market mechanism for a combinatorial sealed-bid auction that was motivated by the airport slot problem under which bidders would submit bids for packages of slots that support their schedules. Under this scheme, the elemental resources would be allocated only in the form of those combinations desired by the bidders. Under this scenario, the purpose of an aftermarket would be to adjust for allocation errors in the primary market (the objective in the experiments reported below), or to adjust for post-primary market changes in demand. Although this form of combinatorial auction was never applied to airport runway rights, the issue of pricing runway slots has arisen in the new century as a means of managing airport congestion. The combinatorial procedure below is not generally incentive compatible; i.e., if any bidder desires multiple units of either packages or elements, or multiple units of any element, then it may be to a bidder's advantage to strategically underbid the true value of a package.	<gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8>
Chapter 9. Regulating Occupational and Product Risks ¤ Market forces, supplemented by government policy, affect how firms and households jointly determine product and workplace safety levels. After developing the economic theory of how labor and product markets pair prices and health risks we then explain the effects of the relevant government policies, including information, tort liability laws, direct regulation of job and product attributes, and mandatory no-fault insurance to compensate injured parties. Each theoretical development is followed by econometric evidence concerning policy induced outcomes. An important finding is that the most influential economic incentives for product and job safety stem from the fact that people tend not to buy hazardous products or accept employment in hazardous jobs unless the price they pay or the wages they are paid compensate for health risks and safety risks. We conclude with policies of future interest, including greater attention to how one is injured or killed and the distributional impacts of policy.	<gnd:4120934-5> <gnd:4135592-1> <gnd:4070864-0> <gnd:4050133-4> <gnd:4186957-6>
Chapter 34 Introduction: Applied urban economics ¤ There has been an outpouring of high quality applied research in urban economics as in other specialties in the past decade. The reasons for the rapid growth of applied research are not difficult to identify: better theoretical frameworks within which applied research is undertaken; better econometric techniques and software; more and better data; and, probably most important, ever cheaper and more widely distributed computing power within the research community that provides easier access to, and analysis of, data. Data and research output now move around the world at the speed of light, and thousands of scholars in dozens of countries can access the US census and many other data sources. Not only is more high quality applied research being done but also it is now being done in many more institutions than it was a decade or two ago. The computer has reduced the inequality among academic institutions in their capability to do applied research.	<gnd:4182752-1> <gnd:4121573-4> <gnd:4076601-9>
Chapter 21 International differences in industrial organization ¤ Some of the most conspicuous and intriguing international differences in institutions lie in the control, ownership, and integration of enterprises. It is widely accepted that Coase's classic questionWhy does the boundary between the firm and the market fall where it does?is answered by identifying the transactioncost advantages that may attach to either the market or the firm as allocators of resources. The actual boundaries are drawn in a Darwinian process by which the more efficient institution displaces the less efficient one. If this Darwinian competition worked the same way in every country and the transactioncost efficiencies of firms and markets have been independent of laws, cultural traits, and other distinguishing traits of nationhood, then the allocation between firms and markets should be expected to differ only inessentially from country to country. If industrial groups' roles are related to the diversification and internalization, they also show affinity for the problem of agency in the ownership and control of firms. The concept of agency provides the tool needed to analyze the split between ownership and control in the large, public corporation, and it suggests the sort of device that might be expected to emerge to avert the slippage in diffuse agency relationships.	<gnd:4133311-1>
Chapter 3 Higher dimensional issues in trade theory ¤ The extensive structure of modern trade theory has been built on a foundation of several extreme assumptions, including that of low and even dimensionality. This chapter is concerned with HeckscherOhlin theory of international trade in higher dimensions. This theory, in its standard two-commodity, two-factor version has dominated international trade theory for over 30 years. But this dominance has long been made uneasy by a widespread suspicion that world commerce does not accord well with the theoretical structure. There are two particular areas of concern. The first stems from the fact that the largest part of world trade involves the exchange of roughly similar products among similar economies, whereas the factor endowment theory, and comparative cost theory, generally teaches to look to international dissimilarities for the causes of trade. A large part of this actual trade is classified as intraindustry even with significant disaggregation. Thus probing its causes requires a high degree of disaggregationthat is, the explicit consideration of a large number of goods. The second area of concern stems from the Leontief Paradox. The sensitivity to higher dimensions of the basic propositions of the modern theory of international trade is the key issue for the practical relevance of the logical structure that has dominated trade theory in the past 30 years.	<gnd:4065468-0> <gnd:4065365-1>
Chapter 13 Income distribution and development ¤ This paper is a review of the post-war literature on income distribution and development. It argues that the literature has cycled from one consensus to another, responding to emerging policy issues and new analysis. On the basis of the review, the paper identifies five areas that will command the attention of analysts in the coming two decades: (i) country case studies rather than cross-country regression analysis; (ii) the phenomenon of increasing inequality; (iii) different levels of disaggregation, particularly distribution between broadly defined groups; (iv) intra-household allocation; and (v) alternative modes of redistribution in face of inequality increasing tendencies.	<gnd:4013887-2> <gnd:4013898-7>

Chapter 25 Agent-based Models of Innovation and Technological Change ¤ This chapter discusses the potential of the agent-based computational economics approach for the analysis of processes of innovation and technological change. It is argued that, on the one hand, several genuine properties of innovation processes make the possibilities offered by agent-based modelling particularly appealing in this field, and that, on the other hand, agent-based models have been quite successful in explaining sets of empirical stylized facts, which are not well accounted for by existing representative-agent equilibrium models. An extensive survey of agent-based computational research dealing with issues of innovation and technological change is given and the contribution of these studies is discussed. Furthermore a few pointers towards potential directions of future research are given.	<gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4011152-0> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4112736-5>
Chapter 9. Neighborhood and Network Effects ¤ In this chapter, we provide an overview of research on neighborhoods and social networks and their role in shaping behavior and economic outcomes. We include a discussion of empirical and theoretical analyses of the role of neighborhoods and social networks in crime, education, and labor-market outcomes. In particular, we discuss in detail identification problems in peer, neighborhood, and network effects and the policy implications of integrating the social and the geographical space, especially for ethnic minorities.	<gnd:4076601-9> <gnd:4182752-1> <gnd:4239568-9> <gnd:4121573-4>
Chapter Twenty. Social Choice with Fuzzy Preferences ¤ Fuzzy set theory has been explicitly introduced to deal with vagueness and ambiguity. One can also use probability theory or techniques borrowed from philosophical logic. In this chapter, we consider fuzzy preferences and we survey the literature on aggregation of fuzzy preferences. We restrict ourselves to “pure aggregation” theory and, accordingly, do not cover strategic aspects of social choice. We present Arrovian aggregation problems in a rather standard framework as well as in a very specific economic environment. We also consider a fuzzy treatment of Sen's impossibility of a Paretian liberal. We distinguish two types of fuzziness: quantitative fuzziness, defined via real numbers, and qualitative fuzziness, defined via linguistic data with a suitable order structure. We outline the thin frontier between impossibility and possibility results.	<gnd:4066735-2> <gnd:4022393-0>
Chapter 6 Axiomatic cost and surplus sharing ¤ The equitable division of a joint cost (or a jointly produced output) among agents with different shares or types of output (or input) commodities, is a central theme of the theory of cooperative games with transferable utility. Ever since Shapley's seminal contribution in 1953, this question has generated some of the deepest axiomatic results of modern microeconomic theory. More recently, the simpler problem of rationing a single commodity according to a profile of claims (reflecting individual needs, or demands, or liabilities) has been another fertile ground for axiomatic analysis. This rationing model is often called the bankruptcy problem in the literature. This chapter reviews the normative literature on these two models, and emphasizes their deep structural link via the Additivity axiom for cost sharing: individual cost shares depend additively upon the cost function. Loosely speaking, an additive cost-sharing method can be written as the integral of a rationing method, and this representation defines a linear isomorphism between additive cost-sharing methods and rationing methods. The simple proportionality rule in rationing thus corresponds to average cost pricing and to the Aumann-Shapley pricing method (respectively for homogeneous or heterogeneous output commodities). The uniform rationing rule, equalizing individual shares subject to the claim being an upper bound, corresponds to serial cost sharing. And random priority rationing corresponds to the Shapley-Shubik method, applying the Shapley formula to the Stand Alone costs. Several open problems are included. The axiomatic discussion of non-additive methods to share joint costs appears to be a promising direction for future research.	<gnd:4166306-8> <gnd:4143069-4> <gnd:4022393-0> <gnd:4079351-5>
Chapter 9 Industrialization and trade ¤ This chapter presents a discussion on a few major recurring themes that have been prominent in the literature on industrialization. The chapter discusses the initial conditions at the beginning of the post-colonial period and their relation to subsequent industrial development. The chapter describes the determinants of the growing relative importance of the sector. Productivity growth and its relation to international trade orientation are discussed at the sectoral level. The chapter also discusses studies of the efficiency of individual firms. The employment effects of industrialization are examined and conclusions are presented. The LewisFeiRanis two-sector model provides a useful guide to the role of manufacturing in the development process of a country without an international trade sector. In the immediate post-war period, the potential for industrial development varied considerably among less developed countries (LDCs). In Brazil, Egypt, and Indiafor example, relatively large manufacturing firms had 60 or 70 years of industrial experience, primarily in food processing and textiles. Two countries, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan, which would later prove quite successful, possessed a considerable base of education and industrial experience. Among the major concerns of analysts of industrial sector, performance has been the failure to create jobs for the burgeoning labor force. The chapter also includes cross-country models, the Hirschman hypothesis, the choice of technology, and so on.	<gnd:4066438-7> <gnd:4213090-6>
Chapter 19. The Impact of International Migration on Economic Growth in the Global Economy ¤ Recent research suggests that the welfare gains that would result from removing restrictions on international migration are large. The long-run impact of a higher level of international migration on the global economy is potentially even larger if it triggers an increase in the global growth rate, but such a growth rate impact is much harder to determine empirically. We estimate regression models of 1950–2010 decadal growth in most countries of the world and show that a country's net migration in any decade has been neither harmful nor beneficial to growth in real income per capita in that decade, in contrast with natural increase (births minus deaths), which has been harmful to growth. When using lags, there is evidence that in rich countries net migration benefits growth in the long run, while natural increase in these countries generates a demographic dividend for growth after about two decades. In developing countries net outward migration also appears to boost growth in the long run. Hence greater cross-border mobility contributes to higher global long-run growth. We reconcile this empirical evidence with exogenous and endogenous growth theories, as well as with theories of economic geography and agglomeration. We consider a wide range of channels through which migrants can influence productivity growth in sending and receiving countries, such as education and training decisions, skill and diversity spillovers, age structure, entrepreneurship, trade, remittances, and clustering.	<gnd:4069332-6> <gnd:4120730-0> <gnd:4501977-0>
Chapter 21. A Unified Theory of the Evolution of International Income Levels ¤ This chapter develops a theory of the evolution of international income levels. In particular, it augments the Hansen–Prescott theory of economic development with the Parente–Prescott theory of relative efficiencies and shows that the unified theory accounts for the evolution of international income levels over the last millennium. The essence of this unified theory is that a country starts to experience sustained increases in its living standard when production efficiency reaches a critical point. Countries reach this critical level of efficiency at different dates not because they have access to different stocks of knowledge, but rather because they differ in the amount of society-imposed constraints on the technology choices of their citizenry.	<gnd:4128160-3>
Chapter 6 Tax policy in open economies ¤ This chapter discusses tax policy in open economies. The chapter discusses the theory of optimum taxation in an economy open to international trade. Most formal models of optimum taxation assume away international trade. Its presence does not alter any basic issues or methods. The economic objectives of the policy remain the same, and can be broadly classified as (i) correcting externalities and distortions, (ii) raising revenue for government expenditure, and (iii) redistributing income. There may also be other non-economic objectives or constraints. The policy instruments to pursue these aims are taxes or subsidies on the activities and transactions in the economy, within limitations imposed by observability of the actions and enforceability of the policies. International trade introduces a new set of possible externalities and distortions, and a new set of transactions to tax or subsidize.	<gnd:4242500-1>
Chapter 30 The rural sector in transition economies ¤ Inefficiencies in agriculture in Eastern and Central Europe and the Soviet Union contributed to the financial collapse of the socialist system. Yet during the transition, agricultural production has declined. Low profits, high real interest rates, slow progress in reforms in some countries, and uncertainty have restricted producers' ability to respond to reforms. When China's collectivized agriculture was dismantled after 1978, producers' incentives improved and the economy remained stable, fueling a large supply response. In several Central European countries where reforms are well advanced, agricultural growth has resumed. The difficulties of ten years of rural transition offer lessons about the high costs of embedded distortions and inflexibility in institutional evolution.	<gnd:4079351-5> <gnd:4073993-4> <gnd:4034402-2> <gnd:4000771-6>
Chapter 1 Advances in regional economics ¤ This chapter focuses on the advances made in regional economics. Regional economics analyzes the spatial dispersion and coherence of economic activities. Although it is a fairly recent discipline, the history of economics shows various early attempts to explicitly address spatial issuesfor e.g., in comparative costtheories and international trade theories. Initially, much of the field of regional economics was based on an analogy to general economics, the main difference being the explicit treatment of geographical space as a source of various locationallocation phenomena. Illustrative examples in this context are linear programming models for transportation analysis, spatial substitution problems in neoclassical production theories, inter-regional input-output analysis, and so forth. In a later stage, however, more emphasis was placed on the indigenous features of geographical space and its implications for the spatio-temporal evolution of complex spatial economic systems. Currently, regional economics appears to be a rich discipline with a great many linkages to urban economic problems, transportation problems, and natural resource problems.	<gnd:4076601-9> <gnd:4121573-4> <gnd:4182752-1>
The Radioactive Waste Directive : a necessary step in the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste in the European Union ¤ Council Directive 2011/70/Euratom of 19 July 2011 establishing a Community framework for the responsible and safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste1 (Waste Directive) was adopted with the support of all member states of the European Union. Following the adoption of the Council Directive establishing a Community framework for the nuclear safety of nuclear installations in 2009 (Safety Directive), the Waste Directive represents another important step towards building and strengthening the most advanced possible legal framework for nuclear energy in Europe.	<gnd:4068925-6>
Chapter 9 Human capital: Migration and rural population change ¤ The movement of labor out of agriculture is a universal concomitant of economic modernization and growth. Traditional migration models overlook many potential interactions between migration and development. Given imperfect markets characterizing most migrant-sending areas, migration and remittances can have far-reaching impacts, both positive and negative, on incomes and production in agricultural households. Linkages through product and factor markets transmit impacts of migration from migrant-sending households to others inside and outside the rural economy. Recent theoretical and empirical studies reveal the complexity of migration determinants and impacts in rural economies, and they point to new arenas for policy intervention.	<gnd:4073993-4> <gnd:4000771-6> <gnd:4034402-2> <gnd:4079351-5>
Postscript to Financial Globalization and Economic Policies ¤ The global financial crisis serves as a reminder of the risks of financial globalization. After grappling with surges of capital inflows earlier in this decade, many emerging market and developing economies experienced a sharp reversal of those inflows in late 2008 as a result of the crisis. Moreover, international financial linkages clearly served as a channel transmitting the financial turmoil from advanced countries to the shores of emerging markets. These developments will re-ignite the fierce debate about the merits of financial globalization and its effects on growth and stability, especially for emerging market and developing countries. As the crisis is still unfolding, it is premature to undertake a detailed analysis of its implications for the debate on financial globalization. Nevertheless, there are two preliminary observations that are pertinent. First, the differential effects of the crisis across countries confirm that it is not just financial openness, but a country's structural features and its precrisis policy choices that have determined the crisis' overall impact on a country. Second, the crisis has not led to a resurgence of capital controls in emerging market economies. Recent research further emphasizes the important role of the composition of capital inflows in determining the extent of pain caused by the crisis on nonfinancial firms	<gnd:4066438-7> <gnd:4213090-6>
Chapter 14. Workplace-Linked Pensions for an Aging Demographic ¤ Pensions and population aging intersect in two ways. First, demographic change threatens the sustainability of traditional pay-as-you-go social security pensions, leaving workplace-linked pensions with a greater role in retirement provision. Second, as the Baby Boom generation enters retirement, new challenges arise around its retirement support. This chapter reviews some of the implications of population aging for workplace pensions in this new environment, outlines market considerations important for workplace-related pension design for the future, and discusses how governments can create an environment supportive of workplace-related pensions, should they wish to do so. We conclude that workplace-linked retirement saving systems will be asked to do even more than in the past, given the financial stress that pay-as-you-go government-run Social Security plans are confronting in the face of an aging demographic. This will require further product innovation and additional research.	<gnd:4006294-6> <gnd:4334479-3>
Chapter 17. Long-Term Economic Growth and the History of Technology ¤ Modern economic growth started in the West in the early nineteenth century. This survey discusses the precise connection between the Industrial Revolution and the beginnings of growth, and connects it to the intellectual and economic factors underlying the growth of useful knowledge. The connections between science, technology and human capital are re-examined, and the role of the eighteenth century Enlightenment in bringing about modern growth is highlighted. Specifically, the paper argues that the Enlightenment changed the agenda of scientific research and deepened the connections between theory and practice.	<gnd:4128160-3>

Chapter 20. The Effects of Technical Change on Labor Market Inequalities ¤ In this chapter we inspect economic mechanisms through which technological progress shapes the degree of inequality among workers in the labor market. A key focus is on the rise of U.S. wage inequality over the past 30 years. However, we also pay attention to how Europe did not experience changes in wage inequality but instead saw a sharp increase in unemployment and an increased labor share of income, variables that remained stable in the U.S. We hypothesize that these changes in labor market inequalities can be accounted for by the wave of capital-embodied technological change, which we also document. We propose a variety of mechanisms based on how technology increases the returns to education, ability, experience, and “luck” in the labor market. We also discuss how the wage distribution may have been indirectly influenced by technical change through changes in certain aspects of the organization of work, such as the hierarchical structure of firms, the extent of unionization, and the degree of centralization of bargaining. To account for the U.S.–Europe differences, we use a theory based on institutional differences between the United States and Europe, along with a common acceleration of technical change. Finally, we briefly comment on the implications of labor market inequalities for welfare and for economic policy.	<gnd:4128160-3>
Chapter 5. The Evidence on Mergers and Acquisitions: A Historical and Modern Report ¤ We review historical and current research on mergers and acquisitions. The literature is extensive. After a discussion of earlier survey articles (our “survey of the surveys”), we provide a review of more than 120 M&amp;A related-articles published in leading finance journals since 2011. A basic important finding in the early M&amp;A literature is that, on average, M&amp;A activity creates wealth. Following this finding, researchers in the 1980s through 2000s studied how the process and the parties in the deals worked, the motivations for M&amp;A, and the sources of the wealth gain. We note that much of the recent work represents straight-forward extensions of earlier research, such as the impact of characteristics of the board of directors on acquiring firm stock returns, but there is also much that is new. For example, the availability of new executive databases has led to research that has been key to understanding the importance of networking and relationships in M&amp;A. Changes in globalization and better understanding of cross-country cultural, political and economic differences has led to using new international databases to test the international generality of relations observed in the US and to examine the factors that come into play in cross-border acquisitions. Importantly, we provide perspective on the historical development of the study of M&amp;A, offer caveats to remember when interpreting the research of others or designing one's own research and note the importance of incrementalism in our overall understanding of the value of research in M&amp;A.	<gnd:4419850-4>
Chapter 7. Endogeneity in Empirical Corporate Finance 1 ¤ This chapter discusses how applied researchers in corporate finance can address endogeneity concerns. We begin by reviewing the sources of endogeneity—omitted variables, simultaneity, and measurement error—and their implications for inference. We then discuss in detail a number of econometric techniques aimed at addressing endogeneity problems, including instrumental variables, difference-in-differences estimators, regression discontinuity design, matching methods, panel data methods, and higher order moments estimators. The unifying themes of our discussion are the emphasis on intuition and the applications to corporate finance.	<gnd:4508395-2> <gnd:4269795-5>
Issues for Trade and Competition in the Global Context ¤ The complex relationship between trade policy and competition policy has been under study in the OECD for many years. In response to the Doha Declaration by WTO Ministers (November 2001), the OECD intensified its efforts, focussing on the topics suggested in Paragraphs 23-25 of the Declaration, i) core principles of non-discrimination, transparency and procedural fairness; ii) effective action against hard core cartels; iii) special and differential treatment/flexibility and progressivity; iv) voluntary co-operation in competition law; v) peer review and other possible compliance mechanisms: vi) capacity building and progressive reinforcement of competition institutions. This paper presents a synthesis of the work that has been done on each of these topics by the OECD Joint Group on Trade and Competition and the Competition Committee. It was discussed on the occasion of the Joint Global Forum on Trade and Competition in May 2003, which brought together participants from over 70 economies, international organisations and non-governmental organisations to dialogue and moved forward the debate. The proceedings of the Forum have been published...	<gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4065839-9> <gnd:4121924-7>
Chapter 20. Migration and Remittances ¤ This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the economics literature on the remittances of international migrants, focusing primarily on empirical studies of their measurement, determinants, and various economic impacts. Given that remittances by international migrants require out-migration to have occurred, one of the major methodological challenges is how to disentangle the effects of migration versus remittances on the economic variables of interest. The various methodological challenges and alternative methodological approaches to the analysis of remittances are also discussed. The chapter begins with a background to the relatively recent interest in remittances in the international economics literature and an examination of the official estimates of the magnitudes and trends of global remittance flows and their size and relative stability in comparison with other international financial flows, combined with a discussion of the various forms that remittances take, the different channels and transfer modes used by migrants, and the different categories of recipient. The chapter then examines the literature on the determinants of remittances and their effects on the recipient households and economies. While the theoretical and empirical literature on the determinants of remittances has been primarily of micro-level analytical concern, the impacts of remittances have been analyzed at both the micro- and macro-levels. The perspective and criteria in terms of which the impact of remittances is assessed accordingly differs between most macro- and micro-level analyses. In the final section policy implications in both source and host countries are discussed.	<gnd:4120730-0> <gnd:4501977-0> <gnd:4069332-6>
Chapter 10. Conflict and Cooperation Within the Family, and Between the State and the Family, in the Provision of Old-Age Security ¤ The early contributions to the microeconomic literature assume that only market goods yield utility, and that the only way adults can secure the consumption of these goods in old age is by saving. The more recent contributions recognize, however, that the elderly derive utility also from goods without a perfect market substitute like the care and attention they might receive from their near and dear, and that the elderly may eventually become too old or infirm to keep control over their own money. According to a branch of the literature, parents negotiate the provision of personal services directly with their children. According to another, such negotiations are made unnecessary by self-enforcing family rules. Fertility, aging, care of the very young and care of the very old are inextricably related issues also at the aggregate level, because a society cannot collectively provide for its aged members by simply accumulating assets. It must also have enough working-age people to man the physical capital and materially take care of the elderly. The link between fertility- and aging-related questions is stronger in the presence of an underfunded public pension system, where current pensions are paid for by current workers. The chapter addresses all these questions and concludes with a discussion of second-best policy in the presence of informational asymmetries.	<gnd:4334479-3> <gnd:4006294-6>
Chapter 1 Introduction: Population and family economics ¤ This chapter provides an overview of the rationale, contents, and organization of the Handbook of Population and Family Economics . Theodore Bergstrom's opening chapter traverses the burgeoning theoretical literature concerned with understanding the rationale for the formation, structure, and dissolution of, and resource allocations within families and households. Yoram Weiss' chapter focuses on family formation and dissolution, while the chapter by Jere Behrman focuses on models that describe the allocation of resources among members of households and the empirical evidence on intrahousehold distribution. The chapter by John Laitner examines the kin-based linkages among adult family members who do not co-reside in households. The second and third parts of the Handbook are concerned with the economics literature that examines fertility, infant mortality and adult mortality, and the interactions between mortality and fertility. The diversity and depth of the work reviewed and presented in the Handbook conveys both the progress that has been made by economists in understanding the forces shaping population processes, including the behavior of families, and many questions empirical and theoretical, that still remain.	<gnd:4123185-5> <gnd:4006294-6> <gnd:4006292-2>
Chapter 2 Games in extensive and strategic forms ¤ This chapterdiscusses formal definitions as well as a few illustrative examples, for the following notions: games in extensive form, games in strategic form, pure and mixed strategies, and equilibrium points. Two classes of games that are of interest are presented: games of perfect information, which always possess equilibria in pure strategies, and games with perfect recall, where mixed strategies may be replaced by behavior strategies. A first basic way of describing a game, called the extensive form is presented. As the name suggests, this is a most detailed description of a game. It tells exactly which player should move, when, what are the choices, the outcomes, the information of the players at every stage, and so on. A second basic way of describing a game is called the strategic form" (also known as normal form or matrix form). There are many situations in which a player's best behavior is to randomize when making his choice. This leads to the concept of a mixed strategy. A pure strategy of a player is a complete plan for his or her choices in all possible contingencies in the game. A mixed strategy means that the player chooses, before the beginning of the game, one such comprehensive plan at random (according to a certain probability distribution). An alternative method of randomization for the player is to make an independent random choice at each one of his or her information sets. These randomization procedures are called behavior strategies. But when a player has what is called perfect recall, the converse also holds: every mixed strategy is fully equivalent to a behavior strategy.	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4056243-8>
Chapter 13 Axiomatizations of the core ¤ The core is, the most intuitive solution concept in cooperative game theory. An intuitively acceptable axiom system for the core might reinforce its position as the most natural" solution. An axiomatization of the core may serve two other, more important goals: (1) by obtaining axioms for the core, those important properties of solutions are singled out that determine the most stable solution in the theory of cooperative games. Thus, the core of transferable utility (TU) games is determined by individual rationality (IR), superadditivity (SUPA), and the reduced garne property (RGP). Also, the core of non-transferable utility (NTU) garnes is characterized by IR and RGP. Furthermore, the converse reduced game property (CRGP) is essential for the axiomatization of the core of TU market games. Four properties, IR, SUPA, RGP, and CRGP, play an important role in the characterization of the core on some important families of games. A solution is acceptable if its axiomatization is similar to that of the core. There are some important examples of this kind: (a) the prenucleolus is characterized by RGP together with the two standard assumptions of symmetry and covariance, (b) the Shapley value is characterized by SUPA and three more weaker axioms, and (c) the prekernel is determined by RGP, CRGP, and three more standard assumptions. The chapter discusses the TU games, several properties of solutions to coalitional games, an axiomatization of the core of balanced games, the core of market games, the results that are generalized to games with coalition structures, the results for NTU games, reduced games of NTU games, axiom system for the core of NTU games, and Keiding's axiomatization of the core of NTU games.	<gnd:4056243-8> <gnd:4066528-8>
Chapter 6. Social Construction of Preferences : Advertising ¤ We examine, with the tools of economics, a fundamental tenet of some of the most recent theoretical work in sociology, which we refer to as the Postmodernist Critique : preferences are socially constructed, firms exploit their monopoly power through advertising in order to create new (false) needs in consumers, and, as a consequence, consumer spending rises, and so does their supply of labor.	<gnd:4132883-8> <gnd:4120990-4> <gnd:4027266-7> <gnd:4066514-8> <gnd:4079351-5>
Changes in the Legal Status of the Commissariat à l'énergie atomique (CEA) ¤ This provision in the Ordinance of 18 October 19451 is the birth certificate for the Atomic Energy Commission (hereinafter CEA, Commissariat à l’énergie atomique), a public entity whose legal nature has, for a long time now, been unique and the subject of debate. On 18 October 2009, the CEA will nevertheless celebrate its 64th anniversary.	<gnd:4068925-6>
Looking Backward, Moving Forward : Licensing New Reactors in the United States ¤ Aresurgence of interest in new nuclear power generation as part of the energy mix has emerged around the world in the past few years. The reasons for this potential “nuclear renaissance” stem from a complex set of considerations, including the environmental benefits of no “greenhouse” gas emissions, the enhanced reliability of nuclear operations, advantageous fuel and operating costs and government incentives, among others. For the first time in a generation, electric generating companies are giving serious consideration to building new commercial nuclear power plants in the United States.	<gnd:4068925-6>
What is the private return to tertiary education? : New evidence from 21 OECD countries ¤ This article provides estimates of the private Internal Rates of Return to tertiary education for women and men in 21 OECD countries, for the years between 1991 and 2005. IRR are computed by estimating labour market premia on cross-country comparable individual-level data. Labour market premia are then adjusted for fiscal factors and costs of education. We find that returns to an additional year of tertiary education are on average above 8% and vary in a range from 4 to 15% in the countries and in the period under study. IRR are relatively homogenous across genders. Overall, a slightly increasing trend is observed over time. The article discusses various policy levers for shaping individual incentives to invest in tertiary education and provides some illustrative quantification of the impact of policy changes on those incentives.	<gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4014957-2>
Chapter 3. Lab Labor: What Can Labor Economists Learn from the Lab? ¤ This chapter surveys the contributions of laboratory experiments to labor economics. We begin with a discussion of methodological issues: when (and why) is a lab experiment the best approach; how do laboratory experiments compare to field experiments; and what are the main design issues? We then summarize the substantive contributions of laboratory experiments to our understanding of principal-agent interactions, social preferences, union-firm bargaining, arbitration, gender differentials, discrimination, job search, and labor markets more generally.	<gnd:4322126-9> <gnd:4122827-3>
Chapter 13. The Microstructure of Housing Markets : Search, Bargaining, and Brokerage ¤ This chapter surveys the literature on the microstructure of housing markets. It considers one-sided search, random matching, and directed search models. It also examines the bargaining that takes place once a match has occurred, with the bargaining taking various forms, including two-party negotiations of different types and multiparty housing auctions. The chapter reviews research on real estate brokers as intermediaries as well, focusing on the role of brokers in the matching and bargaining process, the nature of competition and entry in the brokerage industry, and the incentive issues that are present. The chapter also considers the inefficiencies that pervade the brokerage industry and the related policy debates. These are important issues both because of the inherent importance of housing and brokerage and because of the importance of housing to macroeconomic dynamics.	<gnd:4239568-9> <gnd:4076601-9> <gnd:4182752-1> <gnd:4121573-4>
The Interface between Competition and Consumer Policies ¤ The Global Forum of the OECD Competition Committee debated the Interface between Competition and Consumer Policies in February 2008. The two policies share a common goal: the enhancement of consumer welfare. In this way they are highly complementary. Applied properly, they reinforce one another; Aside from their different approaches to markets, however, there are other differences between competition and consumer policies. These differences present both opportunities and challenges. Applied consistently, each policy ill each make the other more effective, especially in situations of evolving markets. The challenge comes in coordinating them, and in ensuring that they do not work at cross purposes. Institutional design is an important factor in providing effective public policy. With the increasing recognition of the importance of integrating competition policy and consumer policy, there is debate about how to design the most effective institutions for that purpose. Housing the two functions in a single agency offers several advantages, including more centralised control, operational efficiencies and cross-fertilisation between the two disciplines. There could be disadvantages as well, however.	<gnd:4065839-9> <gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4121924-7>
Chapter 1 The concept of development ¤ This chapter discusses the concept of development. It is not hard to see why the concept of development is so essential to economics in general. Economic problems involve logistic issues, and a lot of it is undoubtedly engineering of one kind or another. On the other hand, the success of all this has to be judged ultimately in terms of what it does to the lives of human beings. The enhancement of living conditions must clearly be an essential,if not the essential object of the entire economic exercise and that enhancement is an integral part of the concept of development. Even though the logistic and engineering problems involved in enhancing living conditions in the poor, developing countries might well be very different from those in the rich, developed ones, there is much in common in the respective exercises on the two sides of the divide. The close link between economic development and economic growth is simultaneously a matter of importance as well as a source of considerable confusion. The importance of growth must depend on the nature of the variable the expansion of which is considered and seen as growth. The chapter discusses a number of different sources of contrast that have to be clearly distinguished from each other, while drawing a distinction between development and growth. The well-being of a person can be seen as an evaluation of the functionings achieved by that person. This approach has been implicitly used by Adam Smith and Karl Marx in particular. The concept of development is by no meansunproblematic. The different problems underlying the concept have become clearer over the years based on conceptual discussions as well as from insights emerging from empirical work.	<gnd:4066438-7> <gnd:4213090-6>
Chapter 4. Reputations in Repeated Games ¤ This paper surveys work on reputations in repeated games of incomplete information. We first develop the adverse-selection approach to reputations in the context of a long-lived player, who may be a “normal” type or one of a number of “commitment” types, and who faces a succession of short-lived players. We use entropy-based arguments both to establish a lower bound on the equilibrium payoff of the long-lived player (demonstrating ex ante reputation effects) and to show that this lower bound is asymptotically irrelevant under imperfect monitoring (demonstrating the impermanence of reputation effects). The chapter continues by examining the (necessarily weaker) reputation results that can be established for the case of two long-lived players, and by examining variations in the model under which reputation effects can persist indefinitely. The chapter closes with brief remarks on alternative approaches.	<gnd:4056243-8> <gnd:4066528-8>
Chapter 19. Market Liquidity—Theory and Empirical Evidence ¤ In this paper we survey the theoretical and empirical literatures on market liquidity. We organize both literatures around three basic questions: (a) how to measure illiquidity, (b) how illiquidity relates to underlying market imperfections and other asset characteristics, and (c) how illiquidity affects expected asset returns. Using a unified model from Vayanos and Wang (2010), we survey theoretical work on six main imperfections: participation costs, transaction costs, asymmetric information, imperfect competition, funding constraints, and search—and for each imperfection we address the three basic questions within that model. We review the empirical literature through the lens of the theory, using the theory to both interpret existing results and suggest new tests and analysis.	<gnd:4269795-5> <gnd:4508395-2>
Chapter 3. Health and Economic Growth ¤ This chapter examines the relationship between health and economic growth. Across countries, income per capita is highly correlated with health, as measured by life expectancy or a number of other indicators. Within countries, there is also a correlation between people’s health and income. Finally, over time, the historical evolution of cross-country health differences has largely paralleled the evolution of income differences, with the exception that in the last half century the convergence of health has been much faster than the convergence of income. How are health and income related? Theoretically, there is good reason to believe that causality runs in both directions. Healthier individuals are more productive, learn more in school, and, because they live longer, face enhanced incentives to accumulate human capital. Similarly, higher income for individuals or countries improves health in a variety of ways, ranging from better nutrition to construction of public health infrastructure. Empirically, there is evidence for both of these causal channels being operative, but the magnitude of the effects is limited, at least as they apply to cross-sectional differences among countries or individuals. Apparently, other factors that simultaneously raise income and improve health outcomes, such as institutional quality (for countries) and human capital (for individuals), are responsible for a good deal of the observed health–income correlation. The final section of the chapter discusses measures of aggregate welfare that combine consumption and life expectancy.	<gnd:4128160-3>
Country review: Ukraine ¤ This report* was the basis of a two hour and a half peer review in the OECD Global Forum on Competition (GFC) on 21 February 2008. It assesses the development and application of competition law and policy in Ukraine, focusing on activities over the previous five years (2003-07). The report concludes that Ukraine has a comprehensive and well-designed competition law and, in the AMC, an effectively managed and well-regarded agency to enforce it. The report also identifies an array of problems confronting Ukraine in the competition law arena, and makes various remedial proposals, including recommendations dealing with the AMC’s budget allocation, autonomy, investigative tools, transparency, enforcement priorities, and relationships with other law enforcement agencies. Additional recommendations in the report focus on the competition law’s merger notification requirements and procedures, state aid legislation, penalties for unlawful conduct and penalty collection procedures, competition advocacy, harmonization with the European Union’s competition laws, and the elimination of conflicting provisions in Ukraine’s Commercial Code.	<gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4065839-9> <gnd:4121924-7>
Chapter 40 Food security and food assistance programs ¤ Widespread hunger and malnutrition persist today despite considerable growth in per capita food availability.

Chapter 14. The Financing of R&amp;D and Innovation ¤ Evidence on the “funding gap” for investment innovation is surveyed. The focus is on financial market reasons for underinvestment that exist even when externality-induced underinvestment is absent. We conclude that while small and new innovative firms experience high costs of capital that are only partly mitigated by the presence of venture capital, the evidence for high costs of R&amp;D capital for large firms is mixed. Nevertheless, large established firms do appear to prefer internal funds for financing such investments and they manage their cash flow to ensure this. Evidence shows that there are limits to venture capital as a solution to the funding gap, especially in countries where public equity markets for VC exit are not highly developed. We conclude by suggesting areas for further research.	<gnd:4059252-2>

Chapter 25 The pharmaceutical industry ¤ This Handbook chapter surveys the extensive body of research on the economics of the pharmaceutical industry (with peripheral attention paid also to regulated medical devices). Pharmaceuticals is one of the world's most research-intensive industries, generating a continuing steam of new products that save lives and raise the quality of life. The discovery of new drugs has evolved over time from a decidedly empirical process to one based to a considerable degree upon fundamental scientific knowledge. Rich linkages have emerged between profit-seeking manufacturers and basic research performers such as universities and national laboratories. The safety and efficacy of new pharmaceutical products are stringently regulated in most industrialized nations, adding to clinical testing costs. Because of high expenditures on research, development, and clinical testing and because new products, once proven, might be imitated easily, patent protection is unusually important. The extension of patent protection to third-world nations under Uruguay Round Treaty mandates has precipitated vigorous policy debates. Patents, first-mover advantages, and the lack of good substitutes for significant new drugs often give rise to substantial monopoly power, against which many national governments have counterpoised a diverse panoply of price control mechanisms. When patents expire, however, generic substitutes often introduce vigorous price competition. The extent to which generics capture market share from the branded original drugs depends upon government regulatory policies, the reimbursement strategies of health care insurers, and the organization of health care provider institutions.	<gnd:4130935-2>

Chapter 24. New Developments in Econometric Methods for Labor Market Analysis ¤ Econometric practice in labor economics has changed over the past 10 years as probit, logit, hazard methods, instrumental variables, and fixed effects models have grown in use and selection bias methods have declined in use. To a large degree these trends reflect an increasing preference for methods which are less restrictive, more robust, and freer in functional form than older methods, although not all trends are consistent with this view. The trends also reflect a tension between structural and reduced-form estimation that has not yet been resolved. A major point of the review is that this trend in labor economic practice has paralleled a trend in econometrics involving the use of flexible forms and semi-parametric and non-parametric methods but has not incorporated the lessons from that field. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

New International Evidence on Asset-Price Effects on Investment, and a Survey for Consumption ¤ A survey of the literature on asset price impacts on the real economy shows a much wider range of work on consumption and related wealth effects than on investment. The existence of wealth effects on consumption per se is little contested, but there remains an issue of whether different effects should hold between countries and across assets. On balance we contend that the literature suggests a role for housing and tangible wealth as well as financial wealth as a determination of consumption. In terms of investment there are numerous studies implying that uncertainty and balance sheet effects on investment can both be detected, albeit the latter more in micro than macro studies. In the light of the investment literature, we undertook panel investment functions on a macro basis for up to 23 OECD countries. Developing earlier work, it was found that the main significant effects arising from asset prices come from the financial accelerator, credit channel and Tobin’s Q (especially in the G7) and uncertainty as proxied by asset price volatility (especially in smaller OECD countries). There is also evidence for non-linearities in volatility. Descriptive analysis as well as tentative cross-sectional regression showed that both balance sheet and uncertainty channels played a role in the recent financial crisis, when investment fell sharply, although the simple accelerator was also important. The work has implications for monetary, fiscal and regulatory policies, all of which can impact on asset prices and the financial sector and thus via this channel on the wider economy.	<gnd:4014957-2> <gnd:4066493-4>
Chapter 10 Accounting for Growth in the Information Age ¤ The “killer application” of the new framework for productivity measurement presented in this paper is the impact of information technology (IT) on economic growth. A consensus has emerged that the remarkable behavior of IT prices provides the key to the surge in U.S. economic growth after 1995. The relentless decline in the prices of information technology equipment and software has steadily enhanced the role of IT investment. Productivity growth in IT-producing industries has risen in importance and a productivity revival is underway in the rest of the economy. The surge of IT investment in the United States after 1995 has counterparts in all other industrialized countries. It is essential to use comparable data and methodology in order to provide rigorous international comparisons. A crucial role is played by measurements of IT prices. The U.S. national accounts have incorporated measures of IT prices that hold performance constant since 1985. Schreyer [Schreyer, Paul (2000), “The contribution of information and communication technology to output growth: A study of the G7 Countries”. Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, Paris, May 23] has extended these measures to other industrialized countries by constructing “internationally harmonized prices”. The acceleration in the IT price decline in 1995 triggered a burst of IT investment in all of the G7 nations – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, as well as the U.S. These countries also experienced a rise in productivity growth in the IT-producing industries. However, differences in the relative importance of these industries have generated wide disparities in the impact of IT on economic growth. The role of the IT-producing industries is greatest in the U.S., which leads the G7 in output per capita.	<gnd:4059252-2> <gnd:4128160-3>
Chapter 14 Growth Strategies ¤ This is an attempt to derive broad, strategic lessons from the diverse experience with economic growth in last fifty years. The paper revolves around two key arguments. One is that neoclassical economic analysis is a lot more flexible than its practitioners in the policy domain have generally given it credit. In particular, first-order economic principles – protection of property rights, market-based competition, appropriate incentives, sound money, and so on – do not map into unique policy packages. Reformers have substantial room for creatively packaging these principles into institutional designs that are sensitive to local opportunities and constraints. Successful countries are those that have used this room wisely. The second argument is that igniting economic growth and sustaining it are somewhat different enterprises. The former generally requires a limited range of (often unconventional) reforms that need not overly tax the institutional capacity of the economy. The latter challenge is in many ways harder, as it requires constructing over the longer term a sound institutional underpinning to endow the economy with resilience to shocks and maintain productive dynamism. Ignoring the distinction between these two tasks leaves reformers saddled with impossibly ambitious, undifferentiated, and impractical policy agendas.	<gnd:4059252-2> <gnd:4128160-3>
Chapter 16 Property Value Models ¤ One of the only places where environmental quality is traded on explicit markets is real estate. There are several techniques that can be used to study the effects of environmental quality on property values and infer willingness to pay for improvements. The most commonly used method is the hedonic model. In environmental economics the hedonic model has mainly been applied to the prices of real property and to wages. It assumes that there is a schedule of prices for the differentiated product (i.e., houses) that can be estimated. An alternative set of models postulates that consumers' choices are discrete between houses rather than continuous in characteristics as in the hedonic model. Discrete choice models are applied to estimate consumer preferences. Recently a model has been developed that mixes discrete and continuous decisions and emphasizes the locational equilibrium. This chapter reviews these techniques, with an emphasis on methodological issues and recent developments. Section 2 describes the theoretical models that underlie these techniques. The theoretical hedonic model is developed first, and then the theoretical modifications that are necessary for the discrete choice models are described. The main models are developed for residential properties, but differentiated factors of production are discussed briefly. Section 3 is devoted to the empirical issues involved in estimating a hedonic price schedule. This is the most common type of estimation in property value models. Section 4 discusses the empirical application of the second stage of the hedonic model, the estimation of the underlying preferences. Section 5 covers the two types of discrete choice models that are used in environmental economics, random utility models and random bidding models. Section 6 briefly discusses the new locational equilibrium models, and the final section is devoted to conclusions and directions for further research.	<gnd:4006340-9> <gnd:4061638-1> <gnd:4061616-2>
Chapter 86 Explaining the Comparative Statics in Step-Level Public Good Games ¤ The step-level public good game differs strategically from the linear public good game. In the one-shot linear public good game the dominant strategy is not to contribute. In the one-shot step-level public good game multiple Nash equilibria exist. An inefficient Nash equilibrium involves nobody contributing. There are efficient Nash equilibria in pure strategies where 3 of the n players contribute (i.e., there are exactly enough contributions to reach the threshold). A rational player maximizing expected value will contribute if and only if she estimates the probability that her contribution will be critical for the provision of the public good to be sufficiently high. This chapter distinguishes individual preferences (allowing them to be non-selfish) and individual beliefs about the behavior of others. Both beliefs and preferences are important building blocks for most theories explaining behavior in games.	<gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4015999-1>
Chapter 13 Using Wages to Infer School Quality ¤ This chapter examines the literature that attempts to measure the relationship between labor earnings and the average quality of a state's elementary and secondary schools where school quality is approximated by statewide average characteristics like the teacher–pupil ratio. We present evidence of a number of problems which are difficult, and in our view insurmountable. In short; we argue that the Hedonic approach to inferring school quality is totally unproductive. Even so, we include an annotated bibliography of the various papers that have addressed this topic. The main problems we discuss include: (1) interstate differences in wages are not consistent with a simple school quality–wage relation; we cannot assume a simple national labor market with factor price equalization throughout; (2) interstate migration is differentially selective between state origin and destination pairs and across school completion levels; (3) there need not be a direct relation between the quality of schooling and the wage increments from added schooling; (4) using a single residence state or geographic division for school quality evaluation appears insufficient to resolve the ambiguous link between school quality and wages. In addition, (5) the large majority of empirical studies of school quality represent schools by using characteristics of elementary and secondary schools although a major part of the measured incremental value of schooling refers to wage gains from attending college; (6) the Census-based studies that assume schools are attended in birth states can be wide of the mark; and finally, (7) it is unclear whether the positive correlations between wages and either school expenditures or teachers' wages found in much of this literature is indicative of a causal relationship or whether it captures other economic phenomena that supersede the relationship being suggested.	<gnd:4112628-2> <gnd:4036229-2> <gnd:4006664-2>
Effect of very-large-scale motions on one- and two-point statistics in turbulent pipe flow investigated by direct numerical simulations ¤ Very-large-scale motions appear in the bulk region of turbulent pipe flow. They become increasingly energetic with the Reynolds number and interact with the near-wall turbulence. These structures appear either in the shape of positive (high-speed) or negative (low-speed) streamwise velocity fluctuation. The impact of the sign of the structures on the pipe flow turbulence is analysed in this study by means of conditionally averaged one- and two-point statistics, using data from direct numerical simulations of turbulent pipe flow in a flow domain of length L=42R and friction Reynolds numbers of 180≤Reτ≤1500. Conditionally averaged two-point velocity correlations reveal that low-speed motions are longer and more energetic than their high-speed counterparts. The latter are predominately responsible for the Reynolds number dependency of turbulence statistics in the vicinity of the wall, which is in good agreement with observations of the so-called amplitude modulation in wall-bounded turbulence.	<gnd:4117265-6>
Chapter 30 Arms Industries, Arms Trade, and Developing Countries ¤ This chapter discusses developing (non-high income) states' participation in the production and trade of parts or whole units of major conventional weapons, their integration into a transnationalized global arms industry, and the underlying industrial prerequisites that make that participation and integration possible. Drawing on the vertical boundaries of the firm literature, the chapter provides a theory that explains some aspects of post-Cold War shifts in the composition and location of arms production. The chapter further discusses characteristics of the small arms and light weapons industry. A highly lethal industry with far-ranging adverse effects on public health, education, and institutions of law and order and therefore on work incentives and investment climate, it is suggested that the horizontal boundaries of the firm literature, especially the product-cycle hypothesis, may explain certain features of the spacial and temporal diffusion of small arms production, technology, and supply. Newly emerging literature on small-arms demand is also discussed. Furthermore, the chapter examines the widening presence of non-high income states in the production of weapons of mass destruction. Vertical contracting and R&amp;D/patent-race literatures are applied to the case of nuclear weapons. Major conclusions of the chapter include that data sources are poor, that arms production and trade theory is underdeveloped, and that although non-proliferation regimes may have slowed weapons proliferation, they have failed to stop it. We observe industry entry in all weapons categories and in future may expect to see further increases in industry participation by non-high income states, should they choose to do so. This is the natural consequence of the gradual development of non-high incomes states' production capacities. We also observe, however, that states sometimes exit the arms industry or choose not to participate in it, despite their capacity to do so.	<gnd:4115806-4> <gnd:4132793-7> <gnd:4063255-6> <gnd:4134192-2> <gnd:4065004-2> <gnd:4134037-1>
Chapter 35 A Survey of Peace Economics ¤ Peace economics can be defined as the use of economics to understand the causes and effects of violent conflict in the international system and the ways that conflict can be avoided, managed, or resolved. This chapter surveys major subject areas of peace economics, highlighting seminal as well as current contributions. Particularly noteworthy among the newer developments is how major datasets like the Correlates of War Project have fostered a rapid growth of econometric studies based on relatively large cross-country panels. The topics surveyed include: the relation of peace economics to both defense economics and peace studies; data sources and trends for interstate, intrastate, and extra-state conflict; the costs of conflict; the conflict life cycle; the determinants of interstate armed conflict, with emphasis on the role of territory, economic development, and economic interdependence; arms rivalry, proliferation, and arms control, with particular attention given to the foundational models of Richardson and Intriligator and Brito; the technological and geographic dimensions of conflict, including their connections with Schelling's inherent propensity toward war or peace, various Lanchester war models, and the offense–defense balance; appropriation and exchange theory, wherein appropriation undermines the security of exchange at the same time that exchange shapes the incentives for appropriation; experiments in peace economics, most notably the path-breaking prisoner's dilemma experiments of the 1950s; and future directions in the field.	<gnd:4065004-2> <gnd:4132793-7> <gnd:4134192-2> <gnd:4063255-6> <gnd:4115806-4> <gnd:4134037-1>

Chapter 5. Who Bears the Cost of Recessions? The Role of House Prices and Household Debt ¤ This chapter reviews empirical estimates of differential income and consumption growth across individuals during recessions. Most existing studies examine the variation in income and consumption growth across individuals by sorting on ex ante or contemporaneous income or consumption levels. We build on this literature by showing that differential shocks to household net worth coming from elevated household debt and the collapse in house prices play an underappreciated role. Using zip codes in the United States as the unit of analysis, we show that the decline in numerous measures of consumption during the Great Recession was much larger in zip codes that experienced a sharp decline in housing net worth. In the years prior to the recession, these same zip codes saw high house price growth, a substantial expansion of debt by homeowners, and high consumption growth. We discuss what models seem most consistent with this striking pattern in the data, and we highlight the increasing body of macroeconomic evidence on the link between household debt and business cycles. Our main conclusion is that housing and household debt should play a larger role in models exploring the importance of household heterogeneity on macroeconomic outcomes and policies.	<gnd:4037174-8> <gnd:4121333-6>
Competition Law and Policy in Turkey ¤ This report served as the basis of a peer review of the Turkish Competition Authority (TCA) held in the 2005 OECD Global Forum on Competition. It concluded that the TCA has achieved significant progress since its establishment in 1997. While noting the particular strengths of the TCA, the report makes a wide range of recommendations to address the full array of still persisting competition law and policy issues in Turkey. These recommendations are expected to improve the effectiveness of the implementation of competition law and policy in Turkey.	<gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4065839-9> <gnd:4121924-7>
Chapter 104 Preference Reversals ¤ Study of preference reversals originated with cognitive psychologists and has spread to experimental economics because it is directly relevant to the empirical validity of economic theories of decision-making under uncertainty. A preference reversal experiment involves paired choice and valuation responses, usually over simple two-outcome gambles. Subjects are asked to choose which of a pair of gambles they want to play. They are also asked to place minimum selling prices on the gambles in an experimental context in which telling the truth is a dominant strategy. A preference reversal occurs when a subject places a lower selling price on the gamble that he/she chooses than on the other gamble in a pair. Preference reversals call into question the empirical validity of economic theory because they provide support for the conclusion that the preferences that subjects reveal vary with the response mode (choice or valuation) that is used to elicit the preferences.	<gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4124477-1>
Chapter 7. Payout Policy ¤ This paper surveys the literature on payout policy. We start out by discussing several stylized facts that are important to the development of any comprehensive payout policy framework. We then describe the Miller and Modigliani (1961) payout irrelevance proposition, and consider the effect of relaxing the assumptions on which it is based. We consider the role of taxes, asymmetric information, incomplete contracting possibilities, and transaction costs. The tax-related literature on dividends explores the implications of differential taxes on dividends and capital gains on stocks’ valuation and firms’ propensity to pay out cash in the form of dividends. The issues investigated in this literature are of central importance to corporate finance and asset pricing. It is important to understand the degree to which investor taxes are impounded into security prices, which in turn can affect investment returns, the cost of capital, capital structure, investment spending, and governmental revenue collection. The overall empirical evidence on this issue appears to indicate that from a tax perspective, dividends should be minimized. We review the theoretical as well as empirical literature on Signaling/Adverse Selection models and Agency models. The accumulated evidence indicates that changes in payout policies are not motivated by firms’ desire to signal their true worth to the market. There is no evidence that firms that increase their dividends experience an unexpectedly high earnings or cash flow in subsequent periods. The literature does point out however, that changes in cash payments are negatively associated with firms’ risk profile. This and other evidence seem to be consistent with the notion that both dividends and repurchases are paid when firms have excess cash flows in order to reduce potential overinvestment by management. We also review the issue of the form of payout and the increased tendency to use open market share repurchases. Evidence suggests that the rise in the popularity of repurchases increases overall payout and increases firms’ financial flexibility. It seems that young, risky firms prefer to use repurchases rather then dividends. We also observe that many large, established firms and those with more volatile earnings substitute repurchases for dividends. We believe that the choice of payout method and how payout policy interacts with capital-structure decisions (such as debt and equity issuance) are important questions and a promising field for further research.	<gnd:4508395-2> <gnd:4269795-5>
Chapter 15. New Methods for Macro-Financial Model Comparison and Policy Analysis ¤ The global financial crisis and the ensuing criticism of macroeconomics have inspired researchers to explore new modeling approaches. There are many new models that deliver improved estimates of the transmission of macroeconomic policies and aim to better integrate the financial sector in business cycle analysis. Policy making institutions need to compare available models of policy transmission and evaluate the impact and interaction of policy instruments in order to design effective policy strategies. This chapter reviews the literature on model comparison and presents a new approach for comparative analysis. Its computational implementation enables individual researchers to conduct systematic model comparisons and policy evaluations easily and at low cost. This approach also contributes to improving reproducibility of computational research in macroeconomic modeling. Several applications serve to illustrate the usefulness of model comparison and the new tools in the area of monetary and fiscal policy. They include an analysis of the impact of parameter shifts on the effects of fiscal policy, a comparison of monetary policy transmission across model generations and a cross-country comparison of the impact of changes in central bank rates in the United States and the euro area. Furthermore, the chapter includes a large-scale comparison of the dynamics and policy implications of different macro-financial models. The models considered account for financial accelerator effects in investment financing, credit and house price booms and a role for bank capital. A final exercise illustrates how these models can be used to assess the benefits of leaning against credit growth in monetary policy.	<gnd:4121333-6> <gnd:4037174-8>
Chapter 85 Spiteful Behavior in Voluntary Contribution Mechanism Experiments ¤ One of the basic findings in public good provision experiments via the voluntary contribution mechanism is that subjects contribute a considerable amount of their initial holdings to the provision of a public good even when no contribution is the dominant strategy. On the other hand, there are three fundamental criticisms of voluntary contribution mechanism experiments. First, most experiments to date have used a linear utility function where the marginal return of a public good out of one unit of contribution of a private good is less than one. The second criticism is on the linearity of a utility function. In usual theoretical analyses, economists use a non-linear utility function. The third criticism comes from mechanism design theory. Mechanism designers implicitly assumed that agents in their mechanisms must participate in the mechanisms.	<gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4139716-2>
Chapter 12 Finance and Growth: Theory and Evidence ¤ This paper reviews, appraises, and critiques theoretical and empirical research on the connections between the operation of the financial system and economic growth. While subject to ample qualifications and countervailing views, the preponderance of evidence suggests that both financial intermediaries and markets matter for growth and that reverse causality alone is not driving this relationship. Furthermore, theory and evidence imply that better developed financial systems ease external financing constraints facing firms, which illuminates one mechanism through which financial development influences economic growth. The paper highlights many areas needing additional research.	<gnd:4128160-3> <gnd:4059252-2>
Chapter 20. Transportation Costs and the Spatial Organization of Economic Activity ¤ This chapter surveys the theoretical and empirical literature on the relationship between the spatial distribution of economic activity and transportation costs. We develop a multiregion model of economic geography that we use to understand the general equilibrium implications of transportation infrastructure improvements within and between locations for wages, population, trade, and industry composition. Guided by the predictions of this model, we review the empirical literature on the effects of transportation infrastructure improvements on economic development, paying particular attention to the use of exogenous sources of variation in the construction of transportation infrastructure. We examine evidence from different spatial scales, between and within cities. We outline a variety of areas for further research, including distinguishing reallocation from growth and dynamics.	<gnd:4076601-9> <gnd:4121573-4> <gnd:4239568-9> <gnd:4182752-1>
Introduction to the Series ¤ This chapter provides self-contained surveys of the current state of a branch of economics by leading specialists on various aspects of this branch of economics.

Chapter 96 Growing Organizational Culture in the Laboratory ¤ The states of the world are possible sequences of pictures that both the manager and employee have in front of them. The pictures are of complex office environments, in which there are several people, objects, and activities. The pictures all overlap substantially in content, but also all have several unique elements. More interestingly, perhaps, subjects underestimated the difficulty of integrating these very simple forms of culture. Prior to the merger, they elicited estimates from all subjects about the average performance of the merged firm in the 10 post-merger rounds. One subject would receive a monetary reward for making a more accurate prediction. This produces a situation where it is incentive compatible for subjects to state their true belief of the post-merger firm's performance. The results clearly indicate that subjects overestimate the value of a merged firm.	<gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4015999-1>
Chapter 71. Access to Finance ¤ Expanding access to financial services holds the promise to help reduce poverty and spur economic development. But, as a practical matter, commercial banks have faced challenges expanding access to poor and low-income households in developing economies, and nonprofits have had limited reach. We review recent innovations that are improving the quantity and quality of financial access. They are taking possibilities well beyond early models centered on providing microcredit for small business investment. We focus on new credit mechanisms and devices that help households manage cash flows, save, and cope with risk. Our eye is on contract designs, product innovations, regulatory policy, and ultimately economic and social impacts. We relate the innovations and empirical evidence to theoretical ideas, drawing links in particular to new work in behavioral economics and to randomized evaluation methods.	<gnd:4213090-6> <gnd:4066438-7>
Risk Capital in OECD Countries : Past Experience, Current Situation and Policies for Promoting Entrepreneurial Finance ¤ This article follows up on monitoring and analysing developments and structural issues related to risk capital undertaken by the OECD since the mid-1990s. Risk capital, i.e. finance for fast-growth SMEs, should help to foster entrepreneurship and a high rate of company formation which is seen as essential to achieving full employment.	<gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4068097-6>
Chapter 18. Macro, Money, and Finance : A Continuous-Time Approach ¤ This chapter puts forward a manual for how to setup and solve a continuous time model that allows to analyze endogenous (1) level and risk dynamics. The latter includes (2) tail risk and crisis probability as well as (3) the Volatility Paradox. Concepts such as (4) illiquidity and liquidity mismatch, (5) endogenous leverage, (6) the Paradox of Prudence, (7) undercapitalized sectors (8) time-varying risk premia, and (9) the external funding premium are part of the analysis. Financial frictions also give rise to an endogenous (10) value of money.	<gnd:4121333-6> <gnd:4037174-8>
International Legal Instruments Promoting Synergies in Nuclear Safety, Security and Safeguards : Myth or Reality? ¤ With the discovery of radioactivity and ionizing radiation at the turn of the twentieth century, mankind broke new ground in science and technology. These discoveries, which we now call the “dawn of the nuclear age”,1 paved the way for hundreds of scientists and engineers in their quest to improve our standard of living through progress in science. During the last century, the research they carried out and the tools they designed have provided modern societies with unprecedented progress in a variety of fields, from medicine and agriculture to electricity production and industrial uses.2 Unfortunately, this progress came at a high price to humanity: the making of an atomic bomb.	<gnd:4068925-6>
Chapter Twenty-One. Fair Allocation Rules ¤ We review the theory of fairness as it pertains to concretely specified problems of resource allocations. We present punctual notions designed to evaluate how well individuals, or groups, are treated in relation to one another: no-envy, egalitarian-equivalence, individual and collective lower or upper bounds on welfare, notions of equal or equivalent opportunities, as well as various families extending these notions. We also introduce relational notions specifying how allocation rules should respond to changes in resources (resource monotonicity), technologies (technology monotonicity), preferences (welfare domination under preference replacement), and population (population monotonicity, consistency, converse consistency). We investigate the implications of these properties, in various combinations, in the context of various models: the “classical” problem of dividing an unproduced bundle, economies with production, economies with public goods, economies with single-peaked preferences, economies with indivisible goods, and economies in which the dividend is a non-homogeneous continuum. We consider economies in which resources are owned collectively, economies in which they are owned privately, and economies in which ownership is mixed. We offer a number of characterizations of particular allocation rules.	<gnd:4066735-2> <gnd:4022393-0>
Chapter 18. Cultural Diversity, Conflict, and Economic Development ¤ Are cultural differences good or bad for economic development? Can cultural differences generate conflicts and, therefore, retard economic development? Or can cultural diversity spur creativity and improve economic welfare? These are the type of questions that this chapter addresses. There are many channels through which a diverse society may affect the economic and social outcomes of countries, cities, or villages. The debate usually concentrates on empirical results based on the use of general indices that try to summarize many phenomena at the same time. The use of these indices brings also more debate into the topic, since the construction of indices always implies an hypothesis of how we believe the distribution of culturally diverse groups affects the outcome. To understand why ethnic diversity affects conflict and economic development, we first need to understand which indices best capture the channels through which cultural diversity affects economic outcomes. The chapter also reviews evidence on the effect of specific cultural arrangements on the economic development of regions and countries.	<gnd:4268059-1> <gnd:4315813-4>
Chapter 16. Change and Persistence in the Economic Status of Neighborhoods and Cities ¤ This chapter reviews recent literature that considers and explains the tendency for neighborhood and city-level economic status to rise and fall. A central message is that although many locations exhibit extreme persistence in economic status, change in economic status as measured by various indicators of per capita income is common. At the neighborhood level, we begin with a set of stylized facts and then follow with discussion of static and dynamic drivers of neighborhood economic status. This is mirrored at the metropolitan level. Durable but slowly decaying housing, transportation infrastructure, and self-reinforcing spillovers all influence local income dynamics, as do enduring natural advantages, amenities, and government policy. Three recurring themes run throughout the paper: (i) Long sweeps of time are typically necessary to appreciate that change in economic status is common, (ii) history matters, and (iii) a combination of static and dynamic forces ensures that income dynamics can and do differ dramatically across locations but in ways that can be understood.	<gnd:4121573-4> <gnd:4076601-9> <gnd:4182752-1> <gnd:4239568-9>
Chapter 4. The Structural Estimation of Behavioral Models: Discrete Choice Dynamic Programming Methods and Applications ¤ The purpose of this chapter is twofold: (1) to provide an accessible introduction to the methods of structural estimation of discrete choice dynamic programming (DCDP) models and (2) to survey the contributions of applications of these methods to substantive and policy issues in labor economics. The first part of the chapter describes solution and estimation methods for DCDP models using, for expository purposes, a prototypical female labor force participation model. The next part reviews the contribution of the DCDP approach to three leading areas in labor economics: labor supply, job search and human capital. The final section discusses approaches to validating DCDP models.	<gnd:4122827-3> <gnd:4322126-9>
Chapter 7. Historical Development ¤ This chapter surveys a growing body of evidence showing the impacts that historical events can have on current economic development. Over the past two decades historical persistence has been documented in a wide variety of time periods and locations, and over remarkably long time horizons. Although progress continues to be made identifying and understanding underlying mechanisms, the existing evidence suggests that cultural traits and formal institutions are both key in understanding historical persistence.	<gnd:4128160-3>
Chapter 78 Quasi-experimental Evaluation of Regional Employment Subsidies ¤ Although certain government policies might be tested in controlled experiments during a pilot phase, such tests are rarely undertaken. Ideally, a policy could be tried, when feasible and meaningful, on a random subset of areas, firms or consumers exposed to the policy and be compared with the remaining subset over a significant period of time. The results reported here are from a test where the Swedish government introduced a regional employment policy in a limited part of a fairly homogeneous area with high chronic unemployment, hence creating a non-random division into an experiment region and a control region. Once the decision was made to introduce the policy, a quasi- experimental evaluation of the policy was proposed to the government; and, as a result, the government agreed to leave the two regions intact for a period of three years to allow this evaluation to take place and cover a non-trivial period of time a quite unusual, perhaps unprecedented, step for a government to take.	<gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4124477-1>
Chapter 30 Estimating the effects of trade policy ¤ This chapter examines the way imperfect competition affects the gains and losses from trade policies. It focuses on empirical models that estimate the impact of trade policies, with minimum structure imposed on the data. The welfare effects of trade policy under imperfect competition are decomposed into four possible channels: (1) a deadweight loss from distorting consumption and production decisions; (2) a possible gain from improving the terms of trade; (3) a gain or loss because of changes in the scale of firms; and, (4) a gain or loss from shifting profits among countries. The chapter focuses on the concept of deadweight losses and discusses the terms of trade, along with considering tariffs. It also reviews import quotas and their effect on product quality. In many industries, quotas have led to an increase in the quality of imports purchased, which is an optimal response by consumers and firms. The chapter discusses the effects of trade policy on the markups of firms, and thereby on their output and profits. It also reviews the evidence linking import competition, wages, and the employment for the United States and discusses the impact of changes in product variety.	<gnd:4065365-1> <gnd:4065468-0>
Chapter 20. Solution Software for Computable General Equilibrium Modeling ¤ We describe the progress of computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling software since the 1980s and contrast the main systems used today: GAMS, MPSGE and GEMPACK. The development of these general-purpose modeling systems has underpinned rapid growth in the use of CGE models, and allowed models to be shared and their results replicated. We show how a very simple model may be implemented and solved in all three systems. We note that they produce the same numerical results but have different strengths. We conclude by considering some challenges for the future.	<gnd:4079351-5> <gnd:4065341-9> <gnd:4210294-7> <gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4224214-9>
Competition Law and the Nuclear Sector : An EU Outlook ¤ Competition law essentially aims at preventing harmful distortions of competition in the market which may be caused by agreements between companies, by the abusive behaviour of dominant companies, by structural changes in the market due to mergers or by state aid.1 However, often such practices and measures are actually necessary to render certain services viable, to obtain new or better products, to pursue other policies for the greater benefit of the collective, etc. Occasionally, this raises interesting issues in the nuclear sector.	<gnd:4068925-6>
Chapter 29 Agriculture and economic development ¤ This chapter takes an analytical look at the potential role of agriculture in contributing to economic growth, and develops a framework for understanding and quantifying this contribution. The framework points to the key areas where positive linkages, not necessarily well-mediated by markets, might exist, and it highlights the empirical difficulties in establishing their quantitative magnitude and direction of impact. Evidence on the impact of investments in rural education and of nutrition on economic growth is reviewed. The policy discussion focuses especially on the role of agricultural growth in poverty alleviation and the nature of the market environment that will stimulate that growth.	<gnd:4073993-4> <gnd:4000771-6> <gnd:4034402-2> <gnd:4079351-5>
Chapter 12 The theory of equalizing differences ¤ The chapter presents a discussion on the theory of equalizing differences. The theory of equalizing differences refers to observed wage differentials required to equalize the total monetary and nonmonetary advantages or disadvantages among work activities and among workers themselves. On the conceptual level, it can make legitimate claim to be the fundamental (long-run) market equilibrium construct in labor economics. Its empirical importance lies in contributing useful understanding to the determinants of the structure of wages in the economy and for making inferences about preferences and technology from observed wage data. Measurable job attributes on which compensating wage differentials have been shown to arise empirically include (1) onerous working conditions, such as risks to life and health, exposure to pollution, and so forth; (2) intercity and interregional wage differences associated with differences in climate, crime, pollution, and crowding; (3) special work-time scheduling and related requirements, including shift work, inflexible work schedules, and possible risks of layoff and subsequent unemployment; and (4) the composition of pay packages, including vacations, pensions, and other fringe benefits as substitutes for direct cash wage payments. Another important class of problems identifies work environments with investment rather than with consumption. Market equilibrium is defined by equality between demand and supply for workers on each type of job.	<gnd:4322126-9> <gnd:4122827-3>
Chapter 18 Exchange-rate dynamics ¤ This chapter discusses the dynamic behavior of exchange rates. It focuses on both the exchange rate's response to exogenous disturbances and the relation between exchange-rate movements and movements in such endogenous variables as nominal and relative prices, interest rates, output, and the current account. The chapter discusses an ideal treatment of exchange-rate dynamics by summarizing the relevant characteristics of the empirical record. All key features of the stochastic processes that appear to govern exchange rates and other statistically related economic variables have been reviewed in the chapter. It also presents a set of models that are compatible with at least some of the observed relationships. The chapter introduces market frictions so that the role of endogenous output fluctuations can be studied. The assumption of domestic price stickiness reinforces both the correlation between exchange-rate and terms-of-trade changes and the high short-run variability of the exchange rate compared to that of international price-level ratios. Finally, the chapter examines deterministic and stochastic models in which individual behavior is derived from an explicit intertemporal optimization problem.	<gnd:4065365-1> <gnd:4065468-0>
Chapter 27. Macroeconomics of Persistent Slumps ¤ In modern economies, sharp increases in unemployment from major adverse shocks result in long periods of abnormal unemployment and low output. This chapter investigates the processes that account for these persistent slumps. The data are from the economy of the United States, and the discussion emphasizes the financial crisis of 2008 and the ensuing slump. The framework starts by discerning driving forces set in motion by the initial shock. These are higher discounts applied by decision makers (possibly related to a loss of confidence), withdrawal of potential workers from the labor market, diminished productivity growth, higher markups in product markets, and spending declines resulting from tighter lending standards at financial institutions. The next step is to study how driving forces influence general equilibrium, both at the time of the initial shock and later as its effects, persist. Some of the effects propagate the effects of the shock—they contribute to poor performance even after the driving force itself has subsided. Depletion of the capital stock is the most important of these propagation mechanisms. I use a medium-frequency dynamic equilibrium model to gain some notions of the magnitudes of responses and propagation.	<gnd:4121333-6> <gnd:4037174-8>
Chapter 16 The specification and influence of goods and factor markets in open-economy macroeconomic models ¤ The art of macroeconomic model-building involves making strategic choices among a wide range of alternatives. Theoretical models range from the equation of exchange of the simple quantity theory to vast dynamic models involving many sectors and many agents and which defy analytical solutions. The chapter focuses on theoretical models and considers the implications for open-economy models of alternative assumptions that are made when specifying goods and factor markets. It presents two simple benchmark models: one that focuses completely on monetary factors at the expense of neglecting structural considerations entirely, and the other that focuses on structural factors but that fails to provide a complete model capable of determining the endogenous variables. The two benchmark models are combined under the assumption that real national output and income are constant. The chapter introduces the role of the labor market and discusses the possibility of unemployment. In turn this creates room for output movements as part of the adjustment process, either as a result of changes in unemployment or as a result of endogenous changes in the equilibrium level of output because of changes in equilibrium relative prices. Finally, the chapter discusses the inter-temporal models that focus on the long-run aspects of savings, investment, and international capital movements.	<gnd:4065468-0> <gnd:4065365-1>
Chapter 18 The bargaining set, kernel, and nucleolus ¤ This chapter focuses on the bargaining set, kernel, and nucleolus. The theory of the bargaining set answers a more modest question: How would or should the players share the proceeds, given that a certain coalition structure (c.s.) has formed? From a normative point of view, the reason for asking such a question stems from the need to let the players know what to expect from each coalition structure so that they can then make up their mind about the coalitions they want to join, and in what configuration. The kernel was introduced as an auxiliary solution concept, the main task of which was to illuminate properties of the bargaining set and to compute at least part of this set. Kernel had many interesting mathematical properties that reflected in various ways the structure of the game. Kernel prekernel is covariant with respect to strategic equivalence. Both are finite unions of polytopes. It is almost as difficult to compute the kernel as to compute the bargaining set. Being a point in the kernel, the nucleolus point has all the nice properties of the kernel points. Becauseit is a solution concept that does not depend on the names of the players, it preserves all the symmetries of the game. The nucleolus has an advantage over the Shapley value. Because the nucleolus is not empty even if the core is empty, it can be stated that the nucleolus is the location of the latent position of the core. The chapter also discusses the axiomatic foundation of the prekernel and the prenucleolus, ideas embodied in the bargaining set, kernel, and nucleolus that spawned many other related solution concepts, and dynamic processes that lead the participants in a cooperative game to reach the bargaining set or the kernel, or the nucleolus, or many other bargaining sets via a sequence of steps that make good intuitive sense.	<gnd:4056243-8> <gnd:4066528-8>
The turmoil and the financial industry : Developments and policy responses ¤ The situation in financial markets deteriorated over the past year, but government actions have helped to avert an even bigger crisis. While some signs of recovery are on the horizon, the banking sectors in many countries are not yet on solid footing. Recent government programmes that deal with banks’ ‘toxic assets’ are welcome in this regard. But further reaching financial sector reforms such as those recently endorsed by the G20 leaders and proposed in Europe and the United States are necessary in order to establish a sound financial system.	<gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4068097-6>
Chapter 40 Non-linear dynamical systems: Instability and chaos in economics ¤ This chapter aims to (1) set enough of the mathematics of dynamical systems from the perspective of chaos theory so that the endogenous emergence of chaotic dynamics and other highly complex dynamics are understood, (ii) measures of instability and complexity are explained, (iii) how one tests for the presence of chaos and other complex nonlinear dynamics in time series data is discussed; and (iv) how these concepts have been applied in economics is explained. The chapter focuses on discussing the fabric and unity of this subject from the point of view of economic theory and econometrics. Basic mathematics has been developed so that ideas and the notion of chaotic dynamics are defined precisely. In computer science, there is a great deal of interest in the properties of random number generators. Measures that are designed to detect chaos can also be used to test random number generators. It raises the issue of what criteria should be used in judging whether or not finite length sequences are random. In statistical hypothesis testing, certain measures that are used to detect chaotic dynamics have been used to test for stochastic stationarity and independence.	<gnd:4066472-7> <gnd:4132280-0>
Chapter 4. Economics of Common Property Management Regimes ¤ The purpose of this chapter is to identify the reasons for collective action failures and successes in natural resource management, and to understand, in the light of economic theory, the mode of operation of the factors involved whenever possible. In the first section, we clarify the notion of a common property management regime and provide cautionary remarks about estimation methodologies commonly used. In Section 2, we focus on the general case where common property regulation is feasible yet only if governance costs are kept to a reasonable level. Emphasis is placed on such factors as the size of the user group, income or wealth inequality, and availability of exit opportunities. Special attention is paid to the aspect of inequality since this has remained a rather confused issue in much of the empirical literature. Economic theory can contribute significantly to improving our understanding of the manner in which it bears upon collective action. In Section 3, we discuss cognitive problems as an important impediment to the design and implementation of efficient common property management systems. We also present evidence of the deleterious effects resulting from the absence or inappropriateness of state interventions, particularly where they are motivated by private interests. In Section 4, the importance, under a co-management approach, of appropriate incentive systems at both the village and state levels is underlined and illustrated.	<gnd:4164199-1> <gnd:4078523-3> <gnd:4075236-7> <gnd:4061638-1> <gnd:4061619-8>
Chapter 2 Female labor supply: A survey ¤ This chapter presents a survey on female labor supply. The chapter surveys theoretical and empirical work on the labor supply of women, with special reference to women in Western economies, primarily the United States, in modern times. The behavior of female labor supply has important implications for many other phenomena, including marriage, fertility, divorce, the distribution of family earnings and male-female wage differentials. The labor supply of women is also of interest, because of the technical questions it poses. For example, because many women do not work, corner solutions are at least potentially a very important issue in both the theoretical and empirical analysis of female labor supply, even though in other contexts (for example, studies of consumer demand) corner solutions are often ignored. The chapter presents some stylized facts about female labor supply, and then discusses a number of theoretical models of special interest for understanding female labor supply. After considering empirical studies of the labor supply of women, the chapter concludes with some suggestions for future research. The chapter discusses major trends and cyclical patterns in time-series data, and then examines cross-sectional phenomena.	<gnd:4322126-9> <gnd:4122827-3>
Chapter 18 Cognitive Processes in Stated Preference Methods ¤ Cognitive psychology is best known, to many environmental economists, through the filter of acrimonious debates over the validity of contingent valuation methods (CVM). Psychologists' views on CVM reflect concerns that are deeply rooted in their profession's history and theories. Although psychologists have participated in some CVM studies, their roles have rarely allowed them to present a comprehensive design philosophy, illustrated in actual studies. This chapter sets psychologists' critiques and alternatives within a general cognitive perspective on value elicitation, including stated preferences for environmental goods. It begins with a historical review, organized around two converging streams of psychological research. One stream leads from psychophysics to attitude research. The second leads from decision theory to decision analysis and behavioral decision research. The next section reports some environmental valuation studies arising from each tradition. These studies do not directly monetize environmental goods. However, they can still directly inform policies that do not require monetization and indirectly inform policies that do, by shaping studies with that ambition. The following section considers the role of cognitive studies in helping investigators to know what issues matter to people and present them comprehensibly. The concluding section of the chapter presents a cognitive approach to stated preference methods for environmental values one that could be developed most fully in collaboration with economists. It is built around a cognitive task analysis of the four main elements in any evaluation process: (a) specifying the valuation question, (b) understanding its terms, (c) articulating a value for that specific question (from more general basic values), and (d) expressing that value in a public form.	<gnd:4006340-9> <gnd:4061638-1> <gnd:4061616-2>
Non-Commercial Services Obligations and Liberalisation ¤ Universal service obligations are common in many of the infrastructure sectors. The obligations are often cited as a justification for limiting entry of new providers because the new providers would cherry-pick the highprofit customers who provide the basis for subsidization of another group of customers. When obligations are beneficial, there are a number of policy traps that can be encountered: Obligations are often poorly defined and not well-focused on the customers who are meant to receive help; Obligations are frequently defined narrowly in ways that disfavour new technologies and cause extensive waste; and financing for the noncommercial obligations can often be raised in more efficient ways than through cross-subsidies and can often be spent on multiple service providers rather than one preferred provider. Falling into these traps can create incentives for over-investment in certain infrastructure technology and under-investment in other technology. This paper provides guidance on the competition problems that can arise from universal service obligations and on some ways to limit these problems. This OECD Competition Committee roundtable was held in October 2003.	<gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4121924-7> <gnd:4065839-9>

Chapter 9 New findings on secular trends in nutrition and mortality: Some implications for population theory ¤ This chapter describes the evolution of thought on, and knowledge of, the secular decline in mortality; provides new evidence and new analytical techniques that have made it possible to switch attention from famines to chronic malnutrition as the principal link between the food supply and mortality. The chapter also proposes a new theory of the way that the food supply and population were brought into equilibrium between 1700 and the twentieth century; and suggests some implications of the theory for current population issues. The findings discussed in the chapter indicate that the elimination of chronic malnutrition has played an important role in the secular improvement of health and life expectancy. They also suggest that the elimination of stunting and wasting at early ages is of major importance in the reduction of morbidity and mortality rates at middle and late ages. The relevance of these findings for current policy issues may be more obvious for Third World countries than for currently industrialized countries.	<gnd:4006292-2> <gnd:4123185-5> <gnd:4006294-6>
Chapter 11 Economics of water resources: a survey ¤ This chapter reviews the application of economic concepts to study the consumption, supply, and allocation of water resources. Water management poses a wide array of issues for economists because few commodities are so pervasively involved in human economic activities. To an important degree, the location and intensity of economic activities depend on the availability of water for drinking, for agricultural and industrial production, for sanitation and waste assimilation, for transportation, and for aesthetic and recreational benefits. Water is said to be the only substance that exists in all three physical statessolid, liquid, and gaswithin the normal temperature range found on the earth's surface. Through the process known as the hydrologic cycle, the earth's water inventory is continually being transformed among the three states. No form of life on the earth can exist without water. Water is a universal solvent. The chapter reviews those characteristics of water resource systems that serve to set them apart from other resources, with particular reference to the attributes that serve as the basis for public intervention. It also describes the nature of interventions that have been made and emphasizes the need for evaluating them in terms of their objectives.	<gnd:4014743-5> <gnd:4061638-1> <gnd:4075236-7>
