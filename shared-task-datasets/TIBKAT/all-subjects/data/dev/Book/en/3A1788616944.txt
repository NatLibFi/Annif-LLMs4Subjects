American poetry : a very short introduction
"American Poetry: A Very Short Introduction proposes a new theory of American poetry. Written in engaging language and enlivened with illuminating examples, it shows that two characteristics mark the vast, contentious literature. On the one hand, several of its major poets and critics claim that America needs a poetry equal to the country's own distinctiveness. On the other hand, American poetry welcomes techniques, styles, and traditions that originate from outside the country. Its influences range far beyond America's borders. The force of these two competing characteristics drives both individual accomplishment and the broader field"--
American poetry is a vast and perplexing literature, valuing tradition as much as novelty. Some have claimed that America needs a poetry equal to the country's distinctiveness. Others point out that American poetry welcomes techniques, styles, and traditions that originate from far beyond its borders.In this introduction to American poetry, David Caplan pays close attention to American poets' verse forms, meters, and styles. Examples range from Anne Bradstreet to the poets of the Black Lives Matter movement. He considers how other major figures such as T.S. Eliot, Phillis Wheatley, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, W.H. Auden, and Langston Hughes emphasize convention or idiosyncrasy, and turn to American English as an important artistic resource. This concise examination of American poetry enriches our understanding of both the literature's distinctive achievement and the place of its most important writers within it.
