Stakeholder theory : impact and prospects
Honoring the twenty-fifth anniversary of R. Edward Freeman’s Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach, one of the most influential books in the history of business strategy and ethics, this work assembles a collection of contributions from some of the most renowned and widely-cited scholars working in the area of stakeholder scholarship today. -- The analyses collected here comment on the impact Freeman’s book – and stakeholder theory more generally – has had upon the fields of management and organizational ethics. This study also includes an original response from Freeman himself. As the conversation about stakeholders hits its academic and popular stride, this timely volume provides both a retrospective of stakeholder theory’s history as well as a guide to the questions that are likely to emerge during the next quarter century, providing a new foundation for future theory and practice.
