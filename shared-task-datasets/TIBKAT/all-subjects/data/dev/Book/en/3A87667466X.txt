Coplanar waveguide circuits, components, and systems
Up-to-date coverage of the analysis and applications of coplanar waveguides to microwave circuits and antennas The unique feature of coplanar waveguides, as opposed to more conventional waveguides, is their uniplanar construction, in which all of the conductors are aligned on the same side of the substrate. This feature simplifies manufacturing and allows faster and less expensive characterization using on-wafer techniques. Coplanar Waveguide Circuits, Components, and Systems is an engineer's complete resource, collecting all of the available data on the subject. Rainee Simons thoroughly discusses propagation parameters for conventional coplanar waveguides and includes valuable details such as the derivation of the fundamental equations, physical explanations, and numerical examples. Coverage also includes: . Discontinuities and circuit elements. Transitions to other transmission media. Directional couplers, hybrids, and magic T. Microelectromechanical systems based switches and phase shifters. Tunable devices using ferroelectric materials. Photonic bandgap structures. Printed circuit antennas
