Fluoride and the oral environment
This volume brings together current concepts relating to the use of fluoride in dentistry. In contributions written by expert authors, data from this large and complex field have been assembled into a clear sequence and presented in a lucid fashion. The first section deals with the sources of fluoride intake and its metabolism, in order to fully understand fluoride toxicity and the importance of monitoring intake. The second section focuses in more detail on modes of fluoride application and the mechanisms by which this ion interacts with the oral environment to cause a remarkable reduction in dental caries. The role of fluoride in the prevention of dental erosion is also elucidated. The complex mechanisms by which fluoride exerts its effects are described with clarity and the entire text is accompanied by particularly useful illustrations.As a clear up-to-date summary of current thinking in the field, this book will be essential reading for research workers and postgraduate students. Established researchers and teachers in both clinical and basic sciences will find it to be a valuable addition to their libraries, and clinicians will be able to better evaluate the current scientific evidence on the advantages as well as the hazards of fluoride in dentistry.
