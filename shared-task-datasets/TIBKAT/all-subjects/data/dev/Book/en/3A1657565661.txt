Basics of Laser Physics : For Students of Science and Engineering
Part I - General Description of a Laser and an Example -- Part II - Theoretical Basis of the Laser -- Part III - Operation of a Laser -- Part IV - Types of Lasers (Except Semiconductor Lasers) -- Part V - Semiconductor Lasers -- Part VI - Laser Related Topics
This textbook provides an introductory presentation of all types of lasers. It contains a general description of the laser, a theoretical treatment and a characterization of its operation as it deals with gas, solid state, free-electron and semiconductor lasers. This expanded and updated second edition of the book presents a description of the dynamics of free-electron laser oscillation using a model introduced in the first edition that allows a reader to understand basic properties of a free-electron laser and makes the difference to “conventional” lasers. The discussions and the treatment of equations are presented in a way that a reader can immediately follow. The book addresses graduate and undergraduate students in science and engineering, featuring problems with solutions and over 400 illustrations
