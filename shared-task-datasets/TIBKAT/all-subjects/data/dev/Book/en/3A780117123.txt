Orbital mechanics for engineering students
Written by Howard Curtis, Professor of Aerospace Engineering at Embry-Riddle University, Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students is a crucial text for students of aerospace engineering. Now in its 3e, the book has been brought up-to-date with new topics, key terms, homework exercises, and fully worked examples. Highly illustrated and fully supported with downloadable MATLAB algorithms for project and practical work, this book provides all the tools needed to fully understand the subject. New chapter on orbital perturbationsNew and revised examples and homework problemsIncreased coverage of attitude dynamics, including new MATLAB algorithms and examples
