Encyclopedia of mathematics education : with 9 tables
Stephen Lerman’s Encyclopedia of mathematics education is the attempt to provide “a comprehensive reference text, covering every topic in the field of mathematics education research” on 650 pages. In his foreword, Jeremy Kilpatrick describes the encyclopedia as “delineating theoretical positions, describing research findings, and citing relevant literature”. Central topics in mathematics education -- ranging from `Ability grouping in mathematics classrooms’ to `Zone of proximal development in mathematics education’ are presented by distinguished experts on the field. For example, Manuel Santos Trigo contributed the entry for `Problem solving in mathematics education’ which on six pages introduces the concept of problem solving, discusses current theories for the development of heuristics, outlines directions for future research and lists helpful literature for further reading. This encyclopedia supports researchers and teachers in accessing central fields of research and classroom practice. The entries cover a wide range of topics in mathematics education and comprise high quality information. Nevertheless, readers are invited to give critical feedback on the entries, proposing other aspects of certain topics or new entries to be included.
