"C.S. Lewis rightly instructed, "The task of the modern educator is not to cut down jungles, but to irrigate deserts." This book aims to achieve this task by pushing the frontiers of scholarship for securing a sustainable future through green energy and infrastructure. This encompasses the notion that what we create is in harmony and integration with both the spatial and temporal domains. Through numerous practical examples and illustrations, the book examines a comprehensive review of the latest science on indoor environmental health, energy requirements for buildings, and the "greening" of infrastructure. Also, it provides a discussion on the underlying properties of biomass and its influence on furthering energy conversion technologies. Energy storage is essential for driving the integration of renewable energy, and different storage approaches are discussed in terms of power balancing, grid stability, and reliability. Features : Focuses on the importance of coupling green energy with green infrastructure, provides an unbiased update of the state-of-the-art of sustainability science, discusses utilizing sustainable building materials for simultaneous improvement in energy, economic, and environmental bottom lines for industry, and illuminates practical steps that need to be undertaken to achieve a greener infrastructure. Green energy and infrastructure : Securing a sustainable future is appropriate for researchers, students, and decision-makers seeking the latest, practical information on environmental sustainability"--
