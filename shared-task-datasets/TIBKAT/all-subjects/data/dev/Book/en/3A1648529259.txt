Computational Methods for Sensor Material Selection
"Chemical vapor sensing arrays have grown in popularity over the past two decades, finding applications for tasks such as process control, environmental monitoring, and medical diagnosis. This is the first in-depth analysis of the process of choosing materials and components for these ""electronic noses"", with special emphasis on computational methods. For a view of component selection with an experimental perspective, readers may refer to the complementary volume of Integrated Microanalytical Systems entitled ""Combinatorial Methodologies for Sensor Materials."""
