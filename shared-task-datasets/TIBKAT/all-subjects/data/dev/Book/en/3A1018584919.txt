Aviation and shipping : impacts on Europe's environment
Domestic and international aviation and shipping are key components of Europe's mobility system. They are both economic sectors that directly bring many societal and economic benefits, such as the delivery of a wide range of goods and services and provision of employment and mobility for personal, leisure or business purposes. However, from a broader environmental perspective, both sectors are also seen as challenging, as increasing demand is leading to increased pressures on the environment and climate. The joint consideration of aviation and shipping in the year 2017 report reflects key similarities — opportunities and challenges — between the two economic sectors.
