Infinite-space dyadic Green functions in electromagnetism
In any linear system the input and the output are connected by means of a linear operator. When the input can be notionally represented by a function that is null valued everywhere except at a specific location in spacetime, the corresponding output is called the Green function in field theories. Dyadic Green functions are commonplace in electromagnetics, because both the input and the output are vector functions of space and time. This book provides a survey of the state-of-the-art knowledge of infinite-space dyadic Green functions. Part of Series on Electromagnetics and Metamaterials
