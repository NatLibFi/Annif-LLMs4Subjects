Applications of learning classifier systems
This carefully edited book brings together a fascinating selection of applications of Learning Classifier Systems (LCS). The book demonstrates the utility of this machine learning technique in recent real-world applications in such domains as data mining, modeling and optimization, and control. It shows how the LCS technique combines and exploits many Soft Computing approaches into a single coherent framework to produce an improved performance over other approaches. TOC:Section 1 ? Data Mining.- Section 2 ? Modelling and Optimization.- Section 3 ? Control
