The evolution of modern capitalist society is increasingly being marked by an undeniable and consistent tension between pure economic and ethical ways of valuing and acting. This book is a collaborative and cross-disciplinary contribution that challenges the assumptions of capitalist business and society. It ultimately reflects on how to restore benevolence, collaboration, wisdom and various forms of virtuous deliberation amongst all those who take part in the common good, drawing inspiration from European history and continental philosophical traditions on virtue. Editors Kleio Akrivou and Alejo José G. Sison unite well-known academics who examine new ways of understanding the relations between social classes, organizations, groups and the role of actors-persons. They propose ways to restore virtue in our economy-society-person relations with the purpose of overcoming the current challenges of capitalism which more often than not sacrifice happiness and broader, sustained prosperity for the achievement of short-term efficiency. This book also explores a moral psychology that underpins normative virtue ethics theory, and seeks a deeper understanding on how the concept of prudence and the distinct forms of rational excellence have evolved since Aristotle and the co-evolution of Western-Aristotelian and Eastern virtue ethics traditions. This interdisciplinary book will be of interest to business ethics scholars, organizational behaviour academics, organizational sociologists, qualitative research scholars and economic historians. Policy-makers who are interested in improving collaborative frameworks and cross-institutional collaboration policies will also find value in this book
