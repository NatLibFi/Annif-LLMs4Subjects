Computer graphics : from pixels to programmable graphics hardware
"Offering a complex view on the current state of the art in computer graphics, programmable graphics hardware, shaders, and shader-based effects, this unique text covers nearly all aspects of modern computer graphics. It presents the necessary mathematical background and algorithms and describes rasterization, hidden surface removal, and fixed and programmable pipeline. Suitable for a one-semester course, the book requires only basic knowledge of analytic geometry, linear algebra, and C++. It includes questions and practical examples (mostly using OpenGL3.0) and provides full source code and other materials on a supplementary website"--
