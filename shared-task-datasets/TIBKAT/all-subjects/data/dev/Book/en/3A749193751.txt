Asymptotic Methods in Quantum Mechanics : Application to Atoms, Molecules and Nuclei
Asymptotic Methods in Quantum Mechanics is a detailed discussion of the general properties of the wave functions of many particle systems. Particular emphasis is placed on their asymptotic behaviour, since the outer region of the wave function is most sensitive to external interaction. The analysis of these local properties helps in constructing simple and compact wave functions for complicated systems. It also helps in developing a broad understanding of different aspects of quantum mechanics. As applications, wave functions with correct asymptotic forms are used to systematically generate a large data base for susceptibilities, polarizabilities, interactomic potentials and nuclear densities of many atomic, molecular and nuclear systems
