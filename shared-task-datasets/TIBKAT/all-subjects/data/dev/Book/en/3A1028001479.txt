Computer holography : acceleration algorithms and hardware implementations
"This book describes algorithms and hardware implementations of computer holography, especially, in terms of fast calculation. Chapters 1-3 summarizes the basic of holography and computer holography. In Chapter 4 conventional diffraction calculations are described that play a central role in computer holography. We pick up angular spectrum method, Fresnel diffraction, and Fraunhofer diffraction as the conventional diffraction calculations. Numerical implementations by quasi codes will be discussed. Chapter 5 explains acceleration algorithms for CGH generation and digital holography. This chapter includes CGH acceleration algorithms for 3D object composed of point cloud, using LUT(Look-up table) based algorithms, wavefront recording plane, and so forth. Another CGH acceleration for 3D object composed of polygons using tilted plane diffraction will be explained. For digital holography, new fast diffraction calculations will be explained, that is, scaled scalar diffraction and non-uniform-sampled diffraction, and so forth . Numerical implementations by quasi codes will be shown. Chapter 6 explains hardware implementations for computer holography. Recently several parallel processors have been released, for example, multi-core CPU, GPU, Xeon Phi and FPGA. In this chapter, how to implement algorithms to these processors will be discussed. For FPGA implementation, the basic of HDL(Hardware Description Language), and how to estimate the required bit-width of digital circuit in fixed-point number format will be explained as well as the example of circuit design for CGH generation"--
