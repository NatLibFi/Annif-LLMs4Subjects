Semantics of Parallelism : Non-Interleaving Representation of Behaviour
Semantics of Parallelism is the only book which provides a unified treatment of the non-interleaving approach to process semantics (as opposed to the interleaving approach of the process algebraists). Many results found in this book are collected for the first time outside conference and journal articles on the mathematics of non-interleaving semantics. It gives the reader a unified view of various attempts to model parallelism within one conceptual frame work. It is aimed at postgraduates in theoretical computer science and academics who are teaching and researching in the modelling of discrete, concurrent/distributed systems. Workers in the information technology industry who are interested in available theoretical studies on parallelism will also be interested in this book
