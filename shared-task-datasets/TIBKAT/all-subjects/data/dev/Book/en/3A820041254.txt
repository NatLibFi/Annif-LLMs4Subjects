Stencil type
"As one of the oldest ways of printing type, stencils are a ubiquitous means of mass communication, appearing on everything from construction hoardings to shipping containers, and often employed by populist, rebellious and art movements.  With a broad range of historical examples, Stencil Type presents an intriguing and invaluable collection of this essential typographic art."  From back cover
