Kō : an ethnobotanical guide to Hawaiian sugarcane cultivars
"This work represents nearly a decade of historical research, ethnography, and observations of sugarcane cultivars developed by Hawaiian agriculturalists before European contact and some subsequently important heirloom varieties. The volume presents ethnobotanical information on over 100 varietal names, and detailed information on the identification of 40 varieties still held in collections today. The only significant publication on Hawaiian sugarcane varieties was a brief publication of field notes by W.W.G. Moir in 1932, which contains no images, no ethnography on the canes, and only very brief descriptions for identification. This publication fills this gap of information on the native Hawaiian sugarcane varieties. The publication is primarily be an academic guide to the ethnobotany and identification of kō varieties, intended for those who have a need or desire to learn about Hawaiian agricultural cultivars and includes color photography for identification"--
