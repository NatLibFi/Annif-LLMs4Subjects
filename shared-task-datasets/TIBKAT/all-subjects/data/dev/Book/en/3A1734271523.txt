Modernism and its environments
"Modernism and Its Environments surveys new developments in modernist studies inspired by ecocriticism and the environmental humanities. Taking a fresh view of familiar topics in modernist studies such as the city, this book also introduces new topics and perspectives on modernism, such as: nature and wilderness; conservation and preservation; energy and fuel; waste and pollution; the animal and the human; and weather and climate. Ecocritical and environmentalist approaches have fundamentally altered our understanding of both modernism and the field of modernist studies. This book accounts for the transformation, and offers readers a host of resources with which to continue exploring and rethinking. Covering a wide range of writers and artists including Edvard Munch, Paul Val≈ôy, Robert Musil, A.A. Milne, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, T.S. Eliot, J.R.R. Tolkien, Richard Wright, Elizabeth Bishop, Ralph Ellison, Olafur Eliasson, Zadie Smith, and Kate Tempest,."--
