The authors have collaborated to demonstrate how analytical sociology integrates formal models, computer simulations, laboratory experiments, and complex statistical analysis of large-scale datasets. This integration makes analytical sociology comparable to the methodology adopted by modern biological and physical sciences. The authors discuss computational models as well as laboratory experiments, focusing on how experiments may shed light on the complex relation between norms, networks, and social actions"--
