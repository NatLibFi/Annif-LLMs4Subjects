School Transformation and Social Change
What are the challenges and needs of society that schools face? This publication focuses on the transformation of the school towards a learning organization in the society. The authors present the model of school transformation, supporting it with the theory of transformational leadership and a description of contemporary school functions in the individual and social dimensions. The main reflection is grounded in the assumption that an institution where the interactions between the present and the image of the future are particularly visible is school-essentially focused on the anticipation of emerging civilization trends and new opportunities. Modern schools are particularly expected to promote functions related to the preparation for active life, involved in creating the world in changing conditions and functions related to the universalization of life patterns while maintaining the identity and subjectivity of groups and individuals.
