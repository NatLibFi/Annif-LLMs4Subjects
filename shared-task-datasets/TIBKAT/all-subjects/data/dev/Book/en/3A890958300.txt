Organic trace analysis
"Organic contaminants, even in very low concentrations, can have toxic or ecotoxic effects on exposed organisms. Detection and quantification of trace amounts in diverging matrices (e.g., water, air, soil, food, tissue, organisms) is challenging. Great care and strategic thinking are needed to get reliable results along the way from taking samples up to the final analysis. This book teaches students and researchers about the peculiarities of organic trace analysis and advanced principles of statistical evaluation of analytical results, quality control strategies and good laboratory practices, sampling techniques from various matrices, sample treatment, enrichment and clean-up techniques, chromatographic analyses including hyphenated techniques and spectroscopy, mass spectometry, [and] bioanalytical tools. An extended chapter on selected applications transfers the theoretical understanding into applied scientific problems"--Back cover
