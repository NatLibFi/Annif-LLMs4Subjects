Corporate white-collar crime scandals : detection, investigation, reconstruction
"By examining white-collar crime scandals using the theory of convenience, Petter Gottschalk offers ways to improve the detection of crime signals and investigative skills in fraud examinations, as well as improve change management measures. Chapters take the reader chronologically through different key aspects of corporate white-collar crime, moving from the importance and impact of detection through whistleblowing, into how this evolves into an investigation and the role of fraud investigators. Finally, Gottschalk looks at the resulting restructure of the organization. Detailed case studies also offer critical analysis of why and how misconduct and crime should face consequences in the form of sanctions. Business school students and management consultants will find the combination of important theory and case studies useful in developing an understanding of the topic, and looking into successful resolutions. Criminal justice and law scholars will also find this to be a useful read in analysing the consequences of corporate white-collar crime"--
