"A new, updated edition of a popular book on the history, science, and engineering of bicycles. The bicycle is almost unique among human-powered machines in that it uses human muscles in a near-optimum way. This new edition of the bible of bicycle enthusiasts provides just about everything you could want to know about the history of bicycles, how human beings propel them, what makes them go faster, and what keeps them from going even faster. The scientific and engineering information is of interest not only to designers and builders of bicycles and other human-powered vehicles but also to competitive cyclists, bicycle commuters, and recreational cyclists. The fourth edition begins with a brief history of bicycles and bicycling that demolishes widespread myths. This edition includes information on recent experiments and research in human-powered transportation. It contains completely new material on cycling achievements, special human-powered machines for use on land and in water and air, and power-assisted bicycles.
