Charged particle traps / F. G. Major; V. N. Gheorghe; G. Werth ; [1]: Physics and techniques of charged particle field confinement
This book provides an introduction and a guide to modern advances in charged particle confinement by electromagnetic fields. Confinement in different trap geometries, the influence of trap imperfections, classical and quantum mechanical description of the trapped particle motion, and different methods of ion cooling to low temperatures are the main subjects. The results of optical and microwave spectroscopy using traps are summarized, and potential applications such as quantum computing are discussed.
