Berries and berry bioactive compounds in promoting health
"The area of research on the health benefits of berries, their bioactive compounds and their related metabolites has exploded in the last 20 years resulting in new knowledge in the understanding of their metabolism and molecular mode of action as well as their clinical significance in promoting health and preventing chronic disease. Berries and Berry Bioactive Compounds in Promoting Health reviews state-of-the-art research findings on this exponentially growing area. This comprehensive book brings together international experts in their corresponding fields with cutting-edge reviews. Exploring the effects and mechanisms of action of berry bioactive compounds and their metabolites on different body systems and chronic diseases, including their role on gut microbiota and eventual effect on health, is the focus of this book. Unique topics covered include the chemistry and analytical methods of detection of berry bioactive compounds, their bioavailability, metabolism and factors that affect them, including individual variability, their interaction with the gut microbiome, and their role and mechanism(s) of action on chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome and obesity-induced inflammation, and cancer, as well as neuroprotection and wound healing. It will be of benefit to scientists conducting research in the area of the effects of berries and their bioactive compounds on health and disease, and for health care professionals, nutritionists, dietitians and clinical researchers, nutraceutical and natural food product developers in industry, and food regulators."--Cover page 4
