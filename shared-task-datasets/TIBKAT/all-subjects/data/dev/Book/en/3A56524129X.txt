Transport links between Europe & Asia
Land links between Europe and Asia can offer a viable alternative to sea transport. They substantially improve the accessibility of the countries they pass through and can absorb a substantial portion of the growth in intercontinental traffic, particularly container traffic, that has been forecast. However, the provision of efficient land links between Europe and Asia requires appropriate policy decisions on issues such as the development of adequate infrastructure and the removal of regulatory or institutional barriers that prevent the development of efficient transport services.
