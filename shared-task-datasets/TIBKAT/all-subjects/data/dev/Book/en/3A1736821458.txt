Micro-pattern gaseous detectors : principles of operation and applications
"As a continuation of the author's earlier work (Gaseous Radiation Detectors: Fundamental and Applications, Cambridge University Press 2014), this book describes in detail the recent developments and applications of advanced micro-pattern gaseous devices. Across different chapters, readers will learn of the most basic observations, measurements and applications of this novel technology within particle physics, astrophysics, medicine, cultural heritage studies and more. The content is based richly on a pool of information distilled from a large number of papers and reports on the subject, as well as presentations at topical Conferences and Symposia. The author, Fabio Sauli, is an expert with several hundreds of publications in the field. He is also the inventor of one of the major technologies described - the Gas Electron Multiplier - widely used in particle physics and other applied fields"--
