The mathematical theory of knots and braids : an introduction
This book is an introduction to the theory of knots via the theory of braids, which attempts to be complete in a number of ways. Some knowledge of Topology is assumed. Necessary Group Theory and further necessary Topology are given in the book. The exposition is intended to enable an interested reader to learn the basics of the subject. Emphasis is placed on covering the theory in an algebraic way. The work includes quite a number of worked examples. The latter part of the book is devoted to previously unpublished material
