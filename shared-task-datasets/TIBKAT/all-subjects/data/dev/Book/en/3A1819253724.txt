Environmental geology
"The principal aim of this book is to present the reader with a broad overview of environmental geology. Because geology does not exist in a vacuum, however, the text introduces related considerations from outside geology to clarify other ramifications of the subjects discussed. Likewise, the present does not exist in isolation from the past and future; occasionally, the text looks at both how the earth developed into its present condition and where matters seem to be moving for the future. It is hoped that this knowledge will provide the reader with a useful foundation for discussing and evaluating specific environmental issues, as well as for developing ideas about how the problems should be solved"--
