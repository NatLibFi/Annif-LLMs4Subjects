Development of mathematical cognition : neural substrates and genetic influences
Focusing on the neural substrates and genetic factors associated with both the typical and atypical development of mathematical thinking and learning, this second volume in the "Mathematical Cognition and Learning" series integrates the latest in innovative measures and methodological advances from the top researchers in the field, provides details about new progress made in the study of neural correlates of numerical and arithmetic cognition, and addresses recent work in quantitative and molecular genetics--
