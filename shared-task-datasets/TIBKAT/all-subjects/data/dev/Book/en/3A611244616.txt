A designer's guide to asynchronous VLSI
"Bypass the limitations of synchronous design and create low power, higher performance circuits with shorter design times using this practical guide to asynchronous design. The fundamentals of asynchronous design are covered, as is a large variety of design styles, while the emphasis throughout is on practical techniques and real-world applications"--Provided by publisher
"This book provides an introduction to this diverse area of VLSI from a designer's point of view. Our goal is to enable designers to appreciate the many asynchronous design choices that may be readily available in the near future"--Provided by publisher
