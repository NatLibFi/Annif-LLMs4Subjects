Plasma Physics : An Introduction to Laboratory, Space, and Fusion Plasmas
This book is written by an experimentalist and covers all aspects of plasma physics at an introductory level. The fundamental concepts of plasma description are developed in a bottom-up approach of increasing mathematical complexity. The intuitive understanding of the concepts is emphasized. Different from most introductory texts, low-temperature plasmas, plasma discharges and plasma diagnostics get a much larger share. Controlled nuclear fusion is introduced and magnetic confinement is discussed at a simple level. Novel plasma phenomena as found in complex (dusty) plasmas are described. A large number of illustrations, worked out problems with solutions, and short summaries of the basics of each chapter make this text a companion for undergraduate and graduate students and a useful reference on the bookshelf.
