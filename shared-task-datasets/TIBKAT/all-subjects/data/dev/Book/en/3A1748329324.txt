Printed MIMO antenna engineering
Wireless communications have advanced significantly over the past two decades. The multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology was proposed in the 1990's as a viable solution that can overcome the data rate limit experienced by single-input-single-output (SISO) systems. This resource is focused on printed MIMO antenna system design. Printed antennas are widely used in mobile and handheld terminals due to their conformity with the device, low cost, good integration within the device elements and mechanical parts, as well as ease of fabrication. A perfect design companion for practicing engineers, this book provides full design examples from literature, along with detailed illustrations for the various antenna geometries. This resource overviews the various applications that currently depend on printed MIMO antennas, and provides design guidelines and remarks throughout the book for guidance. Show more
