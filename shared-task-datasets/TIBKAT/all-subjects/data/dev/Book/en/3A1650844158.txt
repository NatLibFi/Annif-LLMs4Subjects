Lebesgue and Sobolev Spaces with Variable Exponents
The field of variable exponent function spaces has witnessed an explosive growth in recent years. The standard reference article for basic properties is already 20 years old. Thus this self-contained monograph collecting all the basic properties of variable exponent Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces is timely and provides a much-needed accessible reference work utilizing consistent notation and terminology. Many results are also provided with new and improved proofs. The book also presents a number of applications to PDE and fluid dynamics
