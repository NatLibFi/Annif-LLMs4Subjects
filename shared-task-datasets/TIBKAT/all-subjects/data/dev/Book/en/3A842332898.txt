Including discussion of global literature and world religions, this Companion looks at: • Key moments in the story of religion and literary studies from Matthew Arnold through to the impact of 9/11 • A variety of theoretical approaches to the study of religion and literature • Different ways that religion and literature are connected from overtly religious writing, to subtle religious readings • Analysis of key sacred texts and the way they have been studied, re-written, and questioned by literature • Political implications of work on religion and literature. Thoroughly introduced and contextualised, this volume is an engaging introduction to this huge and complex field.
