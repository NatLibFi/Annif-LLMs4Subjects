Blender production : creating short animations from start to finish
"Short animation projects are ambitious and time consuming, but with a good plan and toolset, they can be hugely rewarding. Blender expert Roland Hess will get you up to speed on animated short fundamentals, including writing, storyboarding, blocking, and character creation. This follow-up Blender Foundations will introduce the more advanced functionalities of Blender, such as the Library and Linking system, physics simulators, integrated Compositor, and the Sequence Editor. This tutorial-based book will also have you create a short animation from scratch, making you a master of the Blender toolkit in no time." -- Back cover
