`Nursing Care of the Pediatric Neurosurgery Patient` serves as a detailed reference for all nurses caring for children with neurosurgical problems. Staff nurses (and student nurses) working in clinics, PICU, pediatrics, operating rooms, post-anesthesia care units, emergency department and radiology will benefit from the information presented in this book. The explanations of pathophysiology, anatomy, radiodiagnostic testing and treatment options for each neurosurgical diagnosis will help them to understand the rationale behind the nursing care. Presenting symptoms and findings on neurological examination and history will enable nurses to identify normal signs. Each chapter includes information on patient and family education and will give helpful guidelines. Although there has been a need within the pediatric neurosurgery community for this type of information for years, there is no other reference available that provides this type of specific information.
