Luxembourg report on European procedural law / edited by Burkhard Hess, Pietro Ortolani ; volume 1: Impediments of national procedural law to the free movement of judgments
This volume presents a comparative examination and empirical evaluation of national procedural rules and practices, and further assesses the key procedural problems that impact mutual trust and the free movement of judgments in light of national and European Court of Justice case law. It provides an exhaustive overview of the similarities and differences of civil procedure in all EU Member States, and their impact on the recognition and enforcement of judgments. Alongside The Luxembourg Report on European Procedural Law, Volume II: Implementing EU Consumer Rights by National Procedural Law, this volume offers the most comprehensive, empirically driven comparative investigation of national civil procedure thus far undertaken in Europe. Using an extensive dataset comprising hundreds of interviews and responses to a multi-language online survey, it examines the rules of civil procedure in all EU Member States and identifies their impact on mutual trust and the free movement of judgments. This volume will be of interest for all practitioners, academics and policymakers with a focus on judicial cooperation and civil justice and will facilitate a better understanding of the impact of national procedural laws on cross-border dispute resolution in Europe.
