Top Executives' Work Relationship and Work-Family Balance : Taxonomy Development and Performance Implications
Top executives are confronted with extremely high demands. As a result of these challenges, some top executives risk derailing soon after having reached the top. Because of their important position in the organization, a decline in top executives’ performance or their sudden absence is especially harmful to the success of their organizations. Eva-Maria Bauer presents two theoretically grounded taxonomies which describe the different ways how top executives manage their work relationship and work-family balance. Her empirical analysis comprises qualitative interviews with top executives as well as a survey of top executives and their life partners. The results show significant differences between the executives’ types concerning for example their well-being, satisfaction, and performance.
