Handbook on interactive storytelling
"Games are no longer 'just' entertainment or simply a leisure activity; multiple platforms that make games available at any moment of the day and connect the player to other players to become a part of a community play a big role in modern society. Interactive storytelling focuses on creating computer systems, where users experience a dramatically compelling narrative that responds to their actions. The objective of this book is to provide readers with a cohesive picture of the research currently being undertaken in interactive storytelling. In addition to the wealth of material, systematic structure, and extensive bibliography, each chapter provides a set of exercises ranging from implementational tasks to open research questions and starting points for further study. The book is also an inspiring source of information for game designers working in the game industry, focusing on the challenges in creating immersive narrative experiences for the player, irrespective of the technical aspects of game production. The case studies presented have been carefully selected with the aim of proposing specific design approaches where narrative is one of the main features of the gaming experience. Therefore, the book is also aimed at gaming industry- experts who wish to tackle the notion of interactive storytelling to its full potential"--
