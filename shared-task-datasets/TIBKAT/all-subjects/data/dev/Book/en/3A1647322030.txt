Clinical Cardiac MRI : With Interactive CD-ROM
MRI has become the preferred noninvasive imaging modality for the heart and great vessels. The substantial technological progress achieved in recent years has provided the user with state-of-the-art MRI systems, but their optimal use can be limited by restricted awareness of the potential patient benefit and the necessity for teaching. This extensively illustrated volume, together with the accompanying CD-ROM, has been specifically compiled to meet these needs. Essential theoretical background information is provided, and imaging acquisition and potential pitfalls are considered in detail. Most importantly, structured guidelines are provided on the interpretation of clinical data in the wide range of cardiac pathology that can be encountered. Throughout, the emphasis is on the implementation of cardiac MRI in clinical practice.
This extensively illustrated volume has been specifically geared towards optimal use of MRI systems. The text provides essential theoretical background information: Imaging acquisition and potential pitfalls are also examined in detail. Most importantly, structured guidelines are provided on the interpretation of clinical data in the wide range of cardiac pathology that can be encountered.
