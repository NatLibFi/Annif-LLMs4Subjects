Proteinases as drug targets
This book provides vital information on a class of enzymes that have emerged as key drug targets in a number of human diseases, including HIV/AIDS, Hypertension, Cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. There is a gap in information due to the lack of recent international meetings on this subject and, thus, no recent summaries of current research have emerged. The book contains up-to-date information, especially with the genomics revolution of recent years, and includes new proteomics techniques. The story of this enzyme family also includes the most significant efforts in computer-aided drug discovery and structure-based drug design. With contributions from experts in the field, the book is edited by the previous President of the International Proteolysis Society, whose academic career in the field has spanned 35 years
