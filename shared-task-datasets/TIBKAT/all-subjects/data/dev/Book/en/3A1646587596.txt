AJCC Cancer Staging Atlas
"The AJCC Cancer Staging Atlas can be used alone or in conjunction with the AJCC Manual or Handbook by pathologists, surgeons, registrars, and oncologists who wish to visualize the TNM components for 39 disease sites. Over 400 illustrations provide detailed and thorough anatomic depictions that clarify critical structures and allow the reader to instantly visualize the progressive extent of malignant disease. Numerous labels identify important anatomic structures. The ""Summary of Changes"" bulleted points, ""Introduction"" text, and ""Anatomy"" text from each chapter in the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, Sixth Edition, have all been included in the Atlas, providing a refresher for the experienced clinician and a reference for the trainee. 24 line drawings illustrate the new classification of breast cancer, including the complete pathologic nodal staging and the role of sentinel lymph nodes. These illustrations represent the clearest and most comprehensive rendering of the AJCC Sixth Edition breast cancer staging and will be of value to clinicians, registrars and trainees."
