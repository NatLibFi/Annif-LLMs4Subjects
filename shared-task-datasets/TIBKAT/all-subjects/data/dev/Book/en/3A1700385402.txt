Moving images : mediating migration as crisis
In recent years, spectacular images of ruined boats, makeshift border camps, and beaches littered with life vests have done much to consolidate the politics of migration and refugeeism in Europe. The mediation of migration as a crisis, in turn, has done much to shore up certain kinds of humanitarian response, legislative action, and affective investment. Bridging artistic practice and academic inquiry, the essays and artworks gathered in Moving Images interrogate the mediation of migration and refugeeism in the contemporary European conjuncture, asking how images, discourses, and data are involved in shaping visions of migration in increasingly global contexts.
