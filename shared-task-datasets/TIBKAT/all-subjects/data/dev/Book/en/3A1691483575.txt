The Routledge handbook of translation, feminism and gender
"The Routledge Handbook of Translation, Feminism and Gender provides a comprehensive, state of the art overview of feminism and gender-awareness in translation and translation studies today. Bringing together work from more than twenty different countries - from Russia to Chile, Yemen, Turkey, China, India, Egypt and the Maghreb as well as the UK, Canada, the USA and Europe - this Handbook represents a transnational approach to this topic, which is in development in many parts of the world. With forty-one chapters, this book presents, discusses and critically examines many different aspects of gender in translation and its effects, both local and transnational. Providing overviews of key questions and case studies of work currently in progress, this Handbook is the essential reference and resource for students and researchers of translation, feminism, and gender"--
