Locura y trauma en la ficci√≥n centroamericana reciente
"In this book, Marileen La Haije offers a thorough and innovative analysis of the intersections between madness and trauma in recent Central American literature on (post)war. A central argument of her study is that these literary texts challenge the taboo of madness in Latin American contexts of memory, by showing that talking about madness does not necessarily lead to stigmatizing victims of political violence or disqualifying their stories about traumatic experiences. La Haije highlights the importance of including madness on the research agenda in the field of memory studies in Latin America"
