Small and short-range radar systems
"Coupling theory to reality by demonstrating the implementation of actual radar systems to enable those interested in developing small radar technology to move quickly from idea to proof of concept, Small and Short-Range Radar Systems analyzes and provides practical working examples of small and short-range radar systems. It supplies a derivation of the radar range equation, an explanation of applicable algorithms, and a case study for each of the several different types of small radar systems covered, including CW, ultrawideband (UWB) impulse, UWB linear FM, SAR, and phased array"--
