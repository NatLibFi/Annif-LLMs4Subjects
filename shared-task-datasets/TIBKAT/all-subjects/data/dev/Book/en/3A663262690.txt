Introduction to differential calculus : systematic studies with engineering applications for beginners
"Through the use of examples and graphs, this book maintains a high level of precision in clarifying prerequisite materials such as algebra, geometry, coordinate geometry, trigonometry, and the concept of limits. The book explores concepts of limits of a function, limits of algebraic functions, applications and limitations for limits, and the algebra of limits. It also discusses methods for computing limits of algebraic functions, and explains the concept of continuity and related concepts in depth. This introductory submersion into differential calculus is an essential guide for engineering and the physical sciences students"--
"This book explores the differential calculus and its plentiful applications in engineering and the physical sciences. The first six chapters offer a refresher of algebra, geometry, coordinate geometry, trigonometry, the concept of function, etc. since these topics are vital to the complete understanding of calculus. The book then moves on to the concept of limit of a function. Suitable examples of algebraic functions are selected, and their limits are discussed to visualize all possible situations that may occur in evaluating limit of a function, other than algebraic functions"--
