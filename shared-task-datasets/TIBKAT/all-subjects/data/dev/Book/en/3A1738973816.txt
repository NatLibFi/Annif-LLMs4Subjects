P-adic analytic functions
Ultrametric fields -- Analytic elements and analytic functions -- Meromorphic functions and Nevanlinna theory.
"P-adic Analytic Functions describes the definition and properties of p-adic analytic and meromorphic functions in a complete algebraically closed ultrametric field. Various properties of p-adic exponential-polynomials are examined, such as the Hermite Lindemann theorem in a p-adic field, with a new proof. The order and type of growth for analytic functions are studied, in the whole field and inside an open disk. P-adic meromorphic functions are studied, not only on the whole field but also in an open disk and on the complemental of a closed disk, using Motzkin meromorphic products. Finally, the p-adic Nevanlinna theory is widely explained, with various applications. Small functions are introduced with results of uniqueness for meromorphic functions. The question of whether the ring of analytic functions - in the whole field or inside an open disk - is a Bezout ring is also examined"--
