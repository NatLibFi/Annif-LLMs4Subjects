Ornament today : digital material structural
The debates on ornament have reignited. As the digital age dawns, ornament - the very thing that modernity attempted to abolish at the beginning of the machine age - is making a comeback in design, architecture and art. The return of ornament is an indication of a fundamental change. Opinions diverge when it comes to ornament, but less in the sense of taste than that the central formative questions crystallise on it. 'Ornament' is the battleground of theory and practice
