Difficult Decisions in Thoracic Surgery : An Evidence-Based Approach
The book describes the recommended ideal approach, rather than customary care, in selected clinical situations. Brief chapters are devoted to a specific question or decision in general thoracic surgery that is difficult or controversial. Although some of the content may be available in major thoracic texts, rarely are such questions posed specifically and analyzed according to the level of supporting evidence available. The chapters contain both evidence-based recommendations and descriptions of surgeons' personal practices based on their experience and the published literature. Chapters are organized around clearly identified recommendations, making possible the identification of useful material at a glance. Over 50 different topics are presented, including a review of available evidence and a general discussion of recommended practice. This book is a valuable reference source for practicing surgeons, surgeons in training, and educators.
