Discrete oscillator design : linear, nonlinear, transient, and noise domains
"Written by a recognized expert in the field, this authoritative one-stop resource covers the practical design of high-frequency oscillators with lumped, distributed, dielectric, and piezoelectric resonators. Including numerous examples, the book details important linear, nonlinear harmonic balance, transient, and noise analysis techniques. Moreover, the book shows engineers how to apply these techniques to a wide range of oscillators. Professionals gain the knowledge needed to create unique designs that elegantly match their specification needs. Over 350 illustrations and more than 200 equations support key topics throughout the book."--Jacket
