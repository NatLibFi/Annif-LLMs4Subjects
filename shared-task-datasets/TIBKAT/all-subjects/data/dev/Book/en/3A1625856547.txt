Chemical thermodynamics : for process simulation
This is the only book to apply thermodynamics to real-world process engineering problems. It comprises numerous solved examples, as well as estimation methods for thermophysical properties and phase equilibria, thermodynamics of alternative separation processes, and recent developments. Written for teaching students the engineering perspective of thermodynamics, this is also of interest to all companies active in chemistry, pharmacy, oil and gas processing, petrochemistry, refinery, food production, environmental protection and engineering--
