Technological learning in the energy sector : lessons for policy, industry and science
pt. 1. The use of experience curves for energy technologies : an introduction -- pt. 2. Case studies -- pt. 3. Synthesis and recommendations.
Technological learning is a key driver behind the improvement of energy technologies and subsequent reduction of production costs. Understanding how and why production costs for energy technologies decline, and whether they will continue to do so in the future, is of crucial importance for policy makers, industrial stakeholders and scientists alike. This timely and informative book therefore provides a comprehensive review of technological development and cost reductions for renewable energy, clean fossil fuel and energy-efficient demand-side technologies
