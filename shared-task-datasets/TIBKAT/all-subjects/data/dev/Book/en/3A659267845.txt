Design of buildings for wind : a guide for ASCE 7-10 standard users and designers of special structures
"ASCE 7 is the US standard for identifying minimum design loads for buildings and other structures. ASCE 7 covers many load types, of which wind is one. The purpose of this book is to provide structural and architectural engineers with the practical state-of-the-art knowledge and tools needed for designing and retrofitting buildings for wind loads. The book will also cover wind-induced loss estimation. This new edition include a guide to the thoroughly revised, 2010 version of the ASCE 7 Standard provisions for wind loads; incorporate major advances achieved in recent years in the design of tall buildings for wind; present material on retrofitting and loss estimation; and improve the presentation of the material to increase its usefulness to structural engineers.Key features: New focus on tall buildings helps make the analysis and design guidance easier and less complex. Covers the new simplified design methods of ASCE 7-10, guiding designers to clearly understand the spirit and letter of the provisions and use the design methods with confidence and ease. Includes new coverage of retrofitting for wind load resistance and loss estimation from hurricane winds. Thoroughly revised and updated to conform with current practice and research. "--
