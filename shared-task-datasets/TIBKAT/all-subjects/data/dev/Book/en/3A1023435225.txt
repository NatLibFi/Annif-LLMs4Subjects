The economic and political aftermath of the Arab Spring : perspectives from Middle East and North African countries
The economies of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region have always been characterized by economic volatility and social disparities. The recent 'Arab Spring' wave of protests has increased political uncertainty and instability in the region, and this timely book provides an in-depth analysis of the subsequent changes from economic, political and environmental perspectives. The international contributors provide a comprehensive overview of the situation in the Mediterranean Basin, addressing a wide range of contributing factors including: -productivity and innovation -trade and foreign investment -changing geo-political equilibria -labour markets and the role of women -the environment, climate change and energy sourcing. The book concludes that the key problems shared by MENA countries are the uncertain economic prospects coupled with high levels of unemployment - a combination that, through different channels, limits technological and innovative capacities. This book will prove an enlightening read for scholars, researchers and students in various academic fields including development economics, development studies, political economy, international politics and Islamic studies.
