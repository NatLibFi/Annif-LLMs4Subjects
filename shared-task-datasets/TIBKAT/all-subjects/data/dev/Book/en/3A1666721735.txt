The technological and economic future of nuclear power : Reinhard Haas, Lutz Mez, Amela Ajanovic (eds.)
History and Current Status of the World Nuclear Industry -- The Dramatic Decrease of the Economics of Nuclear Power -- Nuclear Policy in the EU The Legacy of Csernobyl and Fukushima -- Nuclear Waste and Decommissioning of Nuclear Power Plants -- Alternatives: Heading Towards Sustainable Electricity Systems
This open access book discusses the eroding economics of nuclear power for electricity generation as well as technical, legal, and political acceptance issues. The use of nuclear power for electricity generation is still a heavily disputed issue. Aside from technical risks, safety issues, and the unsolved problem of nuclear waste disposal, the economic performance is currently a major barrier. In recent years, the costs have skyrocketed especially in the European countries and North America. At the same time, the costs of alternatives such as photovoltaics and wind power have significantly decreased.
