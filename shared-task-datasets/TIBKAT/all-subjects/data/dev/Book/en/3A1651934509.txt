C*-Algebras
Almost four-fifths of this book deals with the study of C*-algebras, and the main results due, among others, to Fell, Glimm, Kadison, Kaplansky, Mackey and Segal are expounded. Because of the amount of material accumulated on unitary representations of groups, the latter pages of the book are devoted to a brief account of some aspects of this subject, particularly since the theory of groups provides some of the most interesting examples of C*-algebras. The theory of C*-algebras is still expanding rapidly, but this work remains a clear and accessible introduction to the fundamentals of the subject
