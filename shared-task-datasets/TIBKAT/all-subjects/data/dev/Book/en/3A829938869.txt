Precision livestock farming applications : making sense of sensors to support farm management
Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) technology is a reality. PLF is a combination of  developing animal sensing (sensors) tools and decision-making process at the farm level. It also has the potential to support animal feed suppliers, human-food retailers and other players along the supply chain to make better choices. The current challenge for PLF is the integration of the technology in the majority of the farms and not only to the pioneering farms.This book consist of full-length peer-reviewed papers combined with 'questions and answers' sections. It is the result of a joint session hosted by the European Association of Animal Production and brings together research focusing on real-time interpretation of the combination of sensor development, industry, animal genetics, animal nutrition, and animal health.Unique of this 'cross-disciplinary' approach is that 'animal-focused' scientists, engineers, companies as well as farmers' organizations have interacted and combined their strengths and views. 'Precision Livestock Farming Applications - Making sense of sensors to support farm management' provides an update on the state of the art of PLF in interaction with the other scientific and applicative expertise. It is of interest for researchers, students, professionals, farmers, and livestock industry concerned with livestock production management
