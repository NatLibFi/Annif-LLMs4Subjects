Renewable energy for sustainable development
Renewable Energy Technologies (RETs) will contribute to the improvement of the well being of present and future generations through the promotion of sustainable development. These technologies are now accepted worldwide as an alternative option for the world's future energy supply. Depending upon the present utilization, RETs have been used either to enhance the capacity of power generation in a sustainable, environment friendly way, or are considered for providing the basic energy needs in remote and isolated regions. This publication is a part of worldwide networking activities. Students from the present and past groups of the Postgraduate Programme Renewable Energy from different countries have contributed their experience with RETs and their application to this volume. Furthermore external experts working in reputed organisations and institutes have also shared their expertise by providing articles for the publication on 'Renewable Energy for a Sustainable Future'. <engl.>
