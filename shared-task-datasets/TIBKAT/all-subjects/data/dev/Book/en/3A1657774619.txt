C++ Standard Library Quick Reference
Introduction -- 1. Numerics and Math -- 2. General Utilities -- 3. Containers -- 4. Algorithms -- 5. Stream I/O -- 6. Characters and Strings -- 7. Concurrency -- 8. Diagnostics -- Appendix A.
This book is a condensed reference guide to the essential data structures, algorithms, and functions provided by the C++ Standard Library. More specifically, you'll learn and have access to the following: • The essentials that the C++ Standard Library has to offer • How to use containers to efficiently store and retrieve your data • How to use algorithms to inspect and manipulate your data • How lambda expressions allow for elegant use of algorithms • What the standard string class provides and how to use it • What functionality the library provides for file and stream-based I/O • What smart pointers are and how to use them to prevent memory leaks • How to write safe and efficient multi-threaded code using the C++11 threading libraries.
