Research design in the social sciences : declaration, diagnosis, and redesign
Assessing the properties of research designs before implementing them can be tricky for even the most seasoned researchers. This book provides a powerful framework - Model, Inquiry, Data Strategy, and Answer Strategy, or MIDA - for describing any empirical research design in the social sciences. MIDA enables you to characterize the key analytic features of observational and experimental designs, qualitative and quantitative designs, and descriptive and causal designs. An accompanying algorithm lets you declare designs in the MIDA framework, diagnose properties such as bias and precision, and redesign features like sampling, assignment, measurement, and estimation procedures. Research Design in the Social Sciences is an essential tool kit for the entire life of a research project, from planning and realization of design to the integration of your results into the scientific literature.
