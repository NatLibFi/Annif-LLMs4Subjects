International Regulation of Underwater Sound : Establishing Rules and Standards to Address Ocean Noise Pollution
Concern over the effects of noise on marine life, particularly marine mammals, has emerged as a topic of considerable interest to both professionals and laypersons alike. The controversy has been fueled by a series of international events that suggest a relationship between man-made sound and marine mammal behavior, resulting in mass strandings and death. International Regulation of Underwater Sound offers a refreshingly objective and responsible look at how ocean noise should be addressed given the lack of regulatory structure and the considerable scientific uncertainty that exists over the effects of noise on marine life. This book will interest policymakers, acousticians, marine mammal biologists, environmental activists, lawyers, oceanographers, and those in the shipping, engineering, and offshore oil and gas industries. It is an essential text for government agencies, regional institutions, universities, and international governmental organizations. Dr. McCarthy offers a comprehensive examination of a timely and controversial subject that has aroused interest in the scientific, legal, and environmental communities.
