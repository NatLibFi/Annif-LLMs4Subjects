Modeling and simulating urban processes
"Urban processes like segregation, migration, or economic transition take place at different temporal and spatial scales. Adequate modeling and simulation techniques are in great demand which consider bottom-up and top-down relationships equally. This volume presents approaches within the field of complexity theory, ranging from spatial-econometric models to geostatistical techniques and multi-agent system simulations, to analyze and visualize patterns of social organization, individual behavior, and spatial fabrics."--Publisher's description
