Google Anthos in action : manage hybrid and multicloud Kubernetes clusters
The operations nightmare: modern applications run on-prem, in the cloud, at the edge, on bare metal, in containers, over VMs, in any combination.  And you're expected to handle the rollouts, dataOps, security, performance, scaling, backup, and whatever else comes your way.  Google Anthos feels your pain.  This Kubernetes-based system simplifies hybrid and multicloud operations, providing a single platform for deploying and managing your applications, wherever they live.  Google Anthos in action introduces Anthos and shows you how it can simplify operations for hybrid cloud systems.  Written by 17 Googlers, it lays out everything you can do with Anthos, from Kubernetes deployments to AI models and edge computing.  Each fully illustrated chapter opens up a different Anthos feature, with exercises and examples so you can see Anthos in action.  You'll appreciate the valuable mix of perspectives and insight this awesome team of authors delivers
