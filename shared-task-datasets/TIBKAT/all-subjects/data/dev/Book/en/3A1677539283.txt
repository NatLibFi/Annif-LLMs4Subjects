Skilled labor mobility and migration : challenges and opportunities for the ASEAN economic community
"Regional integration plays an important role in the advance of economic and social development across many parts of the world. Generating growth and expanding markets, it boosts productivity through the exchange of ideas, technologies, and human resources. This book explores the key vision of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN): fostering the free flow of goods, services, investment, and skilled labor in order to establish a globally competitive region with a single market and production base. Bringing together contributions from renowned scholars in their respective fields, this book takes stock of the trends and patterns of skilled labor migration in the ASEAN, examining the existing literature and adding to it with unique insights drawn from original case studies and policy simulations. Identifying the challenges posed by recent significant changes, this book also looks to the future, to identify potential policy responses. The contributions dispel a common assumption that skill mobility is a zero-sum game, and instead contend that it can be mutually beneficial for both sides. With rigorous quantitative analysis this book will be a useful tool for both policy practitioners and policymakers as well as for researchers and students of international development, economics, and Asian studies"--
