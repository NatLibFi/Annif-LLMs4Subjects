"For more than 40 years politicians, activists, advocates and individuals have been seeking ways to solve the problem of climate change. Governments and the United Nations have taken an economic path. Others seek solutions in the equality of climate justice. Taking the step from green consumer to the streets at climate summits, protest camps and direct action recasts activists as everything from tree huggers, to domestic extremists and ecoterrorists. Political policing and new legislation increasingly criminalized environmental activism, supported by media reporting that recasts environmental activism as actions to be feared. Why this has happened and how activist have learnt to circumvented the media's recasting is the story of this book. From media movements to persuade the moveable middle, high court challenges, and gatekeeping, activists have found ways to challenge media and political discourse. The book identifies four key areas to tie together diverse sets of green governmentality, traditional media discourse and activism. (1) Environmental Governance and green governmentality; (2) historical media discourse; (3) alternative communication infrastructures and (4) local to the global. Using data from 50 interviews, archival research and non-participatory observation from environmental activists from the UK, USA and Australia, this book will show why protest is important in democratic political participation. From activists to slacktivist, Environmental Activism and the Media: the Politics of Protest is for those with an interest in cultural, social and political studies, democratic processes, climate and social justice, governmentality and studying environmental politics, human geography, communication, and sustainability"--
