Narratives of organisational change and learning : making sense of testing times
Narratives of Organisational Change and Learning explores how organisations learn from profound change and create new futures through the narrative process of sense-making. Stefanie Reissner investigates change and learning through the comparative and contextual analysis of organisational stories. This timely and important book focuses on: * how organisational actors make sense of, and learn from, profound change as exemplified by three manufacturing firms from Britain, South Africa and Russia * the interaction between organisational change and wider social, economic and political changes in the organisations' environments; their impact on the organisational actors' identity is also examined * the complex responses to organisational change epitomised by patterns of stories prevalent in each of the three organisations, as well as important insights into often unacknowledged narrative processes of learning which result from profound change. This comprehensive, in-depth account will be warmly welcomed by academics and postgraduates, particularly MBA and doctoral students interested in organisational change, learning, and qualitative research, and will also appeal to management educators and management consultants
