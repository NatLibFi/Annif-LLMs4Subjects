Pharmaceutical salts and co-crystals
From crystal structure prediction to totally empirical screening, the quest for new crystal forms has become one of the most challenging issues in the solid state science and particularly in the pharmaceutical world. In this context, multi-component crystalline materials like co-crystals have received renewed interest as they offer the prospect of optimized physical properties. As illustrated in this first book_ entirely dedicated to this emerging class of pharmaceutical compounds_ the outcome of such endeavours into crystal engineering have demonstrated clear impacts on production, marketing
Multi-component crystalline materials (salts and co-crystals) have received renewed interest due to their importance in the pharmaceutical industry, and pharmaceutical co-crystals and salts represent an emerging class of pharmaceutical materials offering the prospect of optimized physical properties, giving new, stable and patentable solid forms. These multi-component crystalline forms influence relevant physico-chemical parameters such as solubility, dissolution rate, chemical stability, melting point, and hygroscopicity, which can result in solids with properties superior to those of the free drug. This book covers the hot topic of pharmaceutical salts and co-crystals focusing on the following essential aspects an overview of fundamental aspects on salts and co-crystals, racemic resolution via diastereomer separation, optimization of relevant physico-chemical parameters and strengthening of intellectual property. Combining both reports of the latest research and comprehensive overviews of basic principles, with contributions from selected experts in both academia and industry, this unique book is an essential reference, ideal for pharmaceutical development scientists and graduate students in pharmaceutical science
