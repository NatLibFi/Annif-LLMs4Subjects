International labour law under the Rome Conventions
"[This handbook examines] the conflict-of-laws questions in labour law, as far as they are standardised in Europe (Rome I and for industrial action Rome II). It also deals with the unregulated or only partial regulated field of the law referring to the applicable employment law and answers detailed conflict-of-laws questions of the international labour law."--
