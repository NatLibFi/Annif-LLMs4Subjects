A Short Course in Computational Geometry and Topology
With the aim to bring the subject of Computational Geometry and Topology closer to the scientific audience, this book is written in thirteen ready-to-teach sections organized in four parts: TESSELLATIONS, COMPLEXES, HOMOLOGY, PERSISTENCE. To speak to the non-specialist, detailed formalisms are often avoided in favor of lively 2- and 3-dimensional illustrations. The book is warmly recommended to everybody who loves geometry and the fascinating world of shapes
