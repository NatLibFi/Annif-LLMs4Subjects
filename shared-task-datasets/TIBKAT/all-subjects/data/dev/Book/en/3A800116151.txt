MATLAB linear algebra : [practical hands-on MATLAB solutions]
MATLAB is a high-level language and environment for numerical computation, visualization, and programming. Using MATLAB, you can analyze data, develop algorithms, and create models and applications. The language, tools, and built-in math functions enable you to explore multiple approaches and reach a solution faster than with spreadsheets or traditional programming languages, such as C/C++ or Java. MATLAB Linear Algebra introduces you to the MATLAB language with practical hands-on instructions and results, allowing you to quickly achieve your goals. In addition to giving an introduction to the MATLAB environment and MATLAB programming, this book provides all the material needed to work in linear algebra with ease. In addition to exploring MATLAB?s matrix algebra capabilities, it describes the MATLAB commands that are used to create two- and three-dimensional graphics, including explicit, implicit and parametric curve and surface plotting, and various methods of data representation. Methods for manipulating and simplifying algebraic expressions are covered and computational techniques for solving algebraic equations and systems of equations are detailed. --
