Arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery : a practical approach to management
This text takes a comprehensive approach to rotator cuff disorders, including tears and arthroscopic techniques in surgical management. It addresses the latest topics, such as the conversion of mini-open repair to all arthroscopic repair, and answers key questions raised at instructional courses. Experts in the field present not only arthroscopic shoulder anatomy, cuff tear patterns, repair concepts, and other fundamentals, but also provide coverage of state-of-the-art techniques. Acromioplasty, clavicle resection, PASTA repair, large and massive repair techniques, and subscapularis repairs are among the techniques detailed. The book also considers repairable versus irreparable cuff tears, biceps tendon disorders, and tuberosity footprints. Suture anchor repair, suture pass techniques, knot tying, and postoperative treatment are addressed as well. The step-by-step approach is supplemented by a wealth of anatomical drawings and color photos. An accompanying DVD supplements the techniques chapters.
