Human resource management in the public sector
This insightful book presents current thinking and research evidence on the role of human resource management policies and practices in increasing service quality, efficiency and organizational effectiveness in the public sector. -- Internationally, public sector organisations face enormous challenges, including increasingly uncertain political and economic environments, more vigilant and cost-conscious governments, rapidly evolving community needs and an ageing workforce. This collection examines a range of HRM-related topics that will influence the capacity of public sector agencies to negotiate and respond to the challenges ahead. These topics include managing public sector human resources during an economic downturn, enhancing the satisfaction and motivation of public sector employees, attracting and retaining talent, leadership development, and case studies in successful public sector organizational change. -- With each chapter drawing on the latest research, but also emphasizing the practical implications, this collection is suitable for practitioners, researchers and students alike. It will also be valuable for HR specialists and managers of HR units in the public sector.
