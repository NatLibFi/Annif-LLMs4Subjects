Architectural conservation in Europe and the Americas : national experiences and practice ; with a contribution of images from the photo archive of the World Monuments Fund
"The first major survey that looks at the conservation of cultural heritage in both Europe and the Americas, this book will serve as a convenient resource for professionals, students, and anyone interested in the field. Following the acclaimed Time Honored, Architectural Conservation in Europe and the Americas presents contemporary practice on a country-by-country and region-by-region basis, facilitating comparative analysis of similarities and differences. Written to "stand alone" from the predecessor volume, this book will be followed by a third and final volume covering Asia, Africa, Oceana, and the Polar Regions"--Provided by publisher
