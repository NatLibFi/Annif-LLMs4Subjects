Space Manifold Dynamics : Novel Spaceways for Science and Exploration
The term "Space Manifold Dynamics" (SMD) was proposed during the workshop "Novel Spaceways for Scientific and Exploration Missions" for describing new types of spacecraft trajectories that could revolutionize how space missions are designed. Obtained by applying the dynamical system approach to mission design, these trajectories represent a fascinating alternative to elliptic motion and provide a deeper understanding of the classical three and N-body problems in celestial mechanics. This book gives a state-of-the-art overview of this new field of study together with applications of an interdisciplinary nature involving planetary science, astrophysics and the manned exploration of the solar system.
