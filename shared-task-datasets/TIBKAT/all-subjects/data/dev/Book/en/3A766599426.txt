Concrete and sustainability
"In view of the development of world concrete and construction, we see an evolution of the focus in the direction of: Safety Durability Serviceability/Functionality Sustainability It is important in this context to learn at least two things: - All the focuses in the evolution process are closely linked to each other and function upon need instead of occurring and existing independently or replacing one by another. - The latest developed focus - Sustainability is not only evolved from the previous focuses but works as a function of them as well. We therefore believe that sustainability is not only an environmental performance, it is indeed a holistic thinking/approach that can be considered as the function of safety, durability, functionality and economical feasibility, environmental compatibility and social responsibility. The level/magnitude of each focus to sustainability varies depending on the specific requirement of the target and local boundary conditions"--
