Inside Microsoft SQL Server 2008 : T-SQL Querying
Master the mechanics behind advanced querying and tuning - for faster, more scalable code. Tackle the toughest set-based querying and query tuning problems - guided by an author team with in-depth, inside knowledge of T-SQL. Deepen your understanding of architecture and internals - and gain practical approaches and advanced techniques to optimize your code's performance. Discover how to: move from procedural programming to the language of sets and logic, optimize query tuning with a top-down methodology, assess algorithmic complexity to predict performance, compare data-aggregation techniques, including new grouping sets, manage data modification - insert, delete, update, merge - for performance, write more efficient queries against partitioned tables, work with graphs, trees, hierarchies, and recursive queries, and use pure-logic puzzles to sharpen your problem-solving skills
