Language and history : integrationist perspectives
"Language and History develops the integrationist critique of orthodox linguistics, at the same time extending its implications to the field of history. By doing so, it throws light on what is now recognised by many historians to be a 'crisis' in their own discipline. Underlying the post-modernist scepticism about traditional forms of historiography, the integrationist approach reveals a more deep-seated problem concerning the interface between philosophy of history and philosophy of language. With chapters from a range of leading international contributors, Language and History represents a significant contribution to the developing work of the integrationists."--Jacket
