Coherent states and applications in mathematical physics
This second edition of the outstanding monograph on coherent states by Combescure and Robert published in 2012 is enriched with figures, historical information and numerical simulations and enlarged with five new chapters presenting important rigorous results obtained in the recent years. The new chapters include various applications such as to the time dependent Schroedinger equation and the Ehrenfest time, to the growth of norms and energy exchanges, to chaotic systems and classical systems with quantum ergodic behavior, and to open quantum systems, and to adiabatic decoupling for multicomponent systems Overall, this book presents the various types of coherent states introduced and studied in the physics and mathematics literature and describes their properties together with application to quantum physics problems. It is intended to serve as a compendium on coherent states and their applications for physicists and mathematicians, stretching from the basic mathematical structures of generalized coherent states in the sense of Perelomov via the semiclassical evolution of coherent states to various specific examples of coherent states (hydrogen atom, quantum oscillator, etc.). It goes beyond existing books on coherent states in terms of a rigorous mathematical framework.
