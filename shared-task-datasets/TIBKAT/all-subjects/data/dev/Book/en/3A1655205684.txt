Transformation Groups and Algebraic K-Theory
The book focuses on the relation between transformation groups and algebraic K-theory. The general pattern is to assign to a geometric problem an invariant in an algebraic K-group which determines the problem. The algebraic K-theory of modules over a category is studied extensively and appplied to the fundamental category of G-space. Basic details of the theory of transformation groups sometimes hard to find in the literature, are collected here (Chapter I) for the benefit of graduate students. Chapters II and III contain advanced new material of interest to researchers working in transformation groups, algebraic K-theory or related fields
