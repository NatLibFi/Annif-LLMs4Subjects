Proteomic profiling and analytical chemistry : the crossroads
This book is designed to help scientists without a strong background in analytical chemistry to understand basic analytical principles so they can apply them to proteomics profiling. It will also help researchers with an analytical chemistry background to break into the proteomics field. The title focuses on practical applications for proteomic research so readers are guided to design better experiments and to more easily interpret the resulting data.  Bridges the gap between overly specialized courses and books in mass spectrometry, proteomics and analytical chemistryCovers the analytical co
