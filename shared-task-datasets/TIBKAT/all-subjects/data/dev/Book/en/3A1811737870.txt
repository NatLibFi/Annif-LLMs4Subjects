Hydrocarbon biotechnology : challenges and future trends
"Hydrocarbon biotechnology offers environmentally friendly technical solutions that can be implemented to solve problems throughout the value chain of the fossil fuel industry. This book, Hydrocarbon Biotechnology: Challenges and Future Trends, presents an up-to-date view of hydrocarbon microbiology and biotechnology, presented by experts around the world with interest in how our expanding understanding of hydrocarbonoclast ecology and physiology can translate to better tools for bioremediation, oil recovery, bioupgrading of unconventional crudes, the development of biorefining technologies, and the production of hydrogen and electricity from hydrocarbon wastes. The common theme across the chapters in this book is an interest in how developing hydrocarbon biotechnologies may reduce our impact on the global environment. Written by eminent scientists from both the academia and industry, the book starts with a historical perspective on hydrocarbon chemistry and formation, petroleum microbiology, and biotechnology. This is followed by a review of recent research developments in bioremediation and other biotechnologies for hydrocarbons, the principal constituents of petroleum and natural gas. The information found here will be valuable for faculty and students from different disciplines such as microbiology, chemistry, environmental biotechnology, industrial microbiology, biochemical engineering, petroleum science, and technology. In addition, researchers and industry scientists from those disciplines will find the book an invaluable resource"--
