Neonatal Cranial Ultrasonography
An exhaustive treatment of a phenomenon that causes family tragedy worldwide, this book fills a major gap in the current literature. Despite advances in neonatal care, neonatal cerebral injury remains a major cause of morbidity, mortality and disabilities. Cranial ultrasonography provides information on brain maturation in the (preterm) neonate and enables detection of frequently occurring brain anomalies in this patient group. A recent book showing high quality normal ultrasound images is lacking. This work deals with the basics of neonatal cranial ultrasonography and can be used as a reference-book providing essential information about the procedure and normal ultrasound anatomy.
