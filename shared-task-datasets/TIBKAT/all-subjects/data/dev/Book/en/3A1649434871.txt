Banach Spaces and Descriptive Set Theory: Selected Topics
Basic Concepts -- The Standard Borel Space of All Separable Banach Spaces -- The ?2 Baire Sum -- Amalgamated Spaces -- Zippin’s Embedding Theorem -- The Bourgain-Pisier Construction -- Strongly Bounded Classes of Banach Spaces
This volume deals with problems in the structure theory of separable infinite-dimensional Banach spaces, with a central focus on universality problems. This topic goes back to the beginnings of the field and appears in Banach's classical monograph. The novelty of the approach lies in the fact that the answers to a number of basic questions are based on techniques from Descriptive Set Theory. Although the book is oriented on proofs of several structural theorems, in the main text readers will also find a detailed exposition of numerous “intermediate” results which are interesting in their own right and have proven to be useful in other areas of Functional Analysis. Moreover, several well-known results in the geometry of Banach spaces are presented from a modern perspective
