Research handbook on digital sociology
"Exploring the social implications of digital transformation, as well as demonstrating how we might use digital transformation to further sociological knowledge, this incisive Handbook provides an extensive overview of cutting-edge research on the digital turn of modern society. Bringing together contributions from more than 60 experts spanning a wide range of disciplines, Jan Skopek explores how digital technologies inextricably permeate the ways we go about our everyday lives, from how we seek information and carry out economic transactions to how we construct our identities and pursue and maintain social relationships. Chapters investigate timely issues related to social theory and social research in the digital age, including the study of online behaviour, digital social inequalities, and the micro- and macro-level consequences of digital technological change. Covering state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative research methodologies in digital sociology, this Research Handbook serves as a comprehensive resource for teaching and research in a continually developing field. Cross-disciplinary in scope, this dynamic Research Handbook will be essential reading for a diverse audience of academics, researchers, students, and practitioners, particularly in the fields of sociology, demography, computer and information sciences, economics, business, and psychology"--
