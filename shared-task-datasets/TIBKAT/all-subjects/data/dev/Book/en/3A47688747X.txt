Preparative chromatography of fine chemical and pharmaceutical agents
"Our authors, a team of engineers and chemists, who shared their views on preparative chromatography, reflect this situation. It is their aim to present and link experimental and production scale experience, basic knowledge in chemistry and thermodynamics as well as process engineering." "Due to its interdisciplinary nature the book is essential for chemists as well as engineers working in the fine chemicals and pharmaceutical industries as well as for food technologies."--BOOK JACKET
"High performance adsorbents prepared the ground for increasing applications of preparative chromatography in the field of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical agents. But a real break through was stimulated by additional research and development during the last decade, especially in the field of continuous separation processes like Simulated Moving Bed technology (SMB). Especially joint interdisciplinary efforts of chemists and engineers contributed to the increasing acceptance and industrial application of production scale chromatographic processes
