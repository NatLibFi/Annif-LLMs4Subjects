Lectures on logarithmic algebraic geometry
This graduate textbook offers a self-contained introduction to the concepts and techniques of logarithmic geometry, a key tool for analyzing compactification and degeneration in algebraic geometry and number theory. It features a systematic exposition of the foundations of the field, from the basic results on convex geometry and commutative monoids to the theory of logarithmic schemes and their de Rham and Betti cohomology. The book will be of use to graduate students and researchers working in algebraic, analytic, and arithmetic geometry as well as related fields
