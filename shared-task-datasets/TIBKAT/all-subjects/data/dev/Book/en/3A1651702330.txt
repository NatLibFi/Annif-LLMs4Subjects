Computational Fourier optics : a MATLAB tutorial
Computational Fourier Optics is a text that shows the reader in a tutorial form how to implement Fourier optical theory and analytic methods on the computer. A primary objective is to give students of Fourier optics the capability of programming their own basic wave optic beam propagations and imaging simulations. The book will also be of interest to professional engineers and physicists learning Fourier optics simulation techniques-either as a self-study text or a text for a short course. For more advanced study, the latter chapters and appendices provide methods and examples for modeling beams and pupil functions with more complicated structure, aberrations, and partial coherence. For a student in a course on Fourier optics, this book is a concise, accessible, and practical companion to any of several excellent textbooks on Fourier optical theory
