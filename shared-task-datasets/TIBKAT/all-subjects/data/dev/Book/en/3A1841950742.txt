Coordination Chemistry : Basics and Current Trends
1 What are complexes? -- 2 Structure and nomenclature -- 3 What are organometallic compounds? -- 4 Binding models -- 5 Colouring of coordination compounds -- 6 Stability of coordination compounds -- 7 Redox reactions in coordination compounds -- 8 Supramolecular coordination chemistry -- 9 Metal-metal bonding -- 10 Magnetism -- 11 Luminescence in complexes -- 12 Bioinorganic chemistry -- 13 Catalysis.
The chemistry of complex compounds is ideally prepared in this textbook for students on the bachelor's degree course in chemistry and offers an easy as well as comprehensive introduction to the subject, which is relevant for examinations. It is based on proven lecture notes and assumes no basic knowledge. In addition to basic questions such as "what are complexes" and "what are organometallic compounds", the common bonding models are presented and the colour and stability of coordination compounds are explained, among other things. Other chapters cover redox reactions in complexes, the metal-metal bond, molecular magnetism, supramolecular chemistry, and bioinorganic chemistry. As a conclusion, the book gives an outlook into current research areas and trends in coordination chemistry, so that students of higher semesters and PhD students will also benefit from reading it. This includes the luminescence of complexes and selected examples of reactions catalyzed by complexes. Birgit Weber is a professor of inorganic chemistry at the University of Bayreuth. Her research focuses on coordination chemistry and ligand design for multifunctional switchable complexes. This book is a translation of an original German edition. The translation was created with the help of artificial intelligence (machine translation by the service DeepL.com). Subsequent human revision was done mainly in terms of content, so that the book reads stylistically different from a conventional translation.
