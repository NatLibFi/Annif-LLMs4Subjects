Transactions on rough sets I
The LNCS journal Transactions on Rough Sets is devoted to the entire spectrum of rough sets related issues, starting from logical and mathematical foundations, through all aspects of rough set theory and its applications, such as data mining, knowledge discovery, and intelligent information processing, to relations between rough sets and other approaches to uncertainty, vagueness, and incompleteness, such as fuzzy sets and theory of evidence. This first volume of the Transactions on Rough Sets opens with an introductory article by Zdzislaw Pawlak, the originator of rough sets. Nine papers deal with rough set theory and eight are devoted to applications in various domains
