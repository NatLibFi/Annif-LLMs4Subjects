Chinese English : names, norms, and narratives
Revisiting Chinese English -- Developing a framework for Chinese English -- Decoding Chinese English names -- Unpacking Chinese English norms -- Reconstructing Chinese English narratives.
"This book offers a distinct exploration of Chinese English - which has the largest rising population of speakers in the World Englishes (WE) family. The book focuses on the fundamental issues of 'names' and 'norms' that are closely related to Chinese English and the 'narratives' of the speakers of Chinese English. In addition to current approaches to WE research, this book proposes a novel theoretical and analytical framework based on classical Chinese and Western philosophies. This book has an empirical basis, drawing upon interview and questionnaire survey data from proficient speakers of Chinese English. It is also based on an extensive review of the relevant literature on both WE and Chinese English, and it draws upon the author's research experience of over two decades on the subject. This is the third research book on Chinese English that the author has contributed to WE literature and it will be a valuable read for students and scholars alike"--
