Handbook of research on gender and marketing
Susan Dobscha and the contributors in this Handbook provide a primer and resource for scholars and practitioners keen to develop or enhance their understanding of how gender permeates marketing decisions, consumer experiences, public policy initiatives, and market practices. This Handbook's main objective is to provide a roadmap through the complicated terrain of gender as it pertains to marketing and consumer behavior. The book also emphasizes that the study of gender is not restricted to certain theories, methods, or approaches. The unifying conclusion is that the study of gender is an important topic that has not received the attention it deserves within the marketing discipline; and attention to gender is crucial now more than ever. This book will give marketing scholars the guidance they need to incorporate the topic of gender into their research by highlighting the current conversations that are taking place in the field of marketing, and more importantly, by illuminating the gap in which more scholarship is necessary to increase our understanding of gender complexities
