"Due to the big amount of existing nowadays exact solutions in 2+1 Einstein gravity the purpose of the present book is to bring to the audience of experts and young researchers a complete and concise list of exacts solutions with emphasis on their physical and geometrical properties in (2+1) gravity from its beginning in 1963 to present. Emphasis is addressed to solutions to the Einstein equations in the presence of matter and fields, for instance, point particle solutions, perfect fluids, cosmological spacetimes, dilatons, inflatons, stringy solutions. The second part of this book deals with solutions to vacuum topologically massive gravity with a cosmological constant; there exist two big families of spacetimes: the inhomogeneous Bianchi class of solutions, the Kundt spacetimes and the Cotton type N wave fields"--
