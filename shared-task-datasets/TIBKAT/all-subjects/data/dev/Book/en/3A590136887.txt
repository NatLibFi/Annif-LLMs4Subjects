Introduction to mathematical logic
"Retaining all the key features of the previous editions, Introduction to Mathematical Logic, Fifth Edition explores the principal topics of mathematical logic. It covers propositional logic, first-order logic, first-order number theory, axiomatic set theory, and the theory of computability. The text also discusses the major results of Godel, Church, Kleene, Rosser, and Turing."--BOOK JACKET
