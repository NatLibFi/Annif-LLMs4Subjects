Bacterial metabolism
This concise yet comprehensive text surveys the field of bacterial metabolism in terms useful to students and researchers. Emphasis is on those metabolic reactions occurring only in bacteria. Thus, the book describes in detail the energy metabolism of the various groups of bacteria. In addition it examines pathways used by bacteria for the degradation of organic compounds, the synthesis of cellular consituents, the regulation of bacterial metabolism and the fixation of molecular nitrogen. The general arrangement of the first edition has been retained. However, it has been thoroughly revised and updated in recognition of the rapid progress of research in this field. Readers will also appreciate the increased emphasis on membrane-associated processes. From the review of the second edition: "If there is a better textbook in its fields, I'm not aware of it, and I feel the book deserves a place on the shelf of any serious student of microbiology." -ASM News
