Handbook of research on international advertising
The Handbook of Research on International Advertising presents the latest thinking, experiences and results in a wide variety of areas in international advertising. It incorporates those visions and insights into areas that have seldom been touched in prior international advertising research, such as research in digital media, retrospective research, cultural psychology, and innovative methodologies. -- Forming a major reference tool, the Handbook provides comprehensive coverage of the area, including entries on: theoretical advances in international advertising research, culture and its impact on advertising effectiveness, online media strategy in global advertising, methodological issues in international advertising, effectiveness of specific creative techniques, global advertising agencies, international perspectives of corporate reputation, transnational trust, global consumer cultural positioning, and performance of integrated marketing communications, among others. -- ‘An excellent book for international marketing scholars and advertising executives that focuses on the complexity of making advertising decisions in a global world. The contributors identify how international advertising perspectives are being transformed by such changes as the emergence of social media, rise of BRIC countries, and increasing concern for localization of advertising. Confident in predictions and bold in recommendations, this book is written with ambition, scope, and verve that sets it apart from the usual advertising books.’ (Subhash C.
