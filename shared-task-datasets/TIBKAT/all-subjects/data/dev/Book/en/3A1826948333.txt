Elasto-plastic damage behaviour of concrete elements
"Elasto-Plastic Damage Behaviour of Concrete Elements presents the results of practical experiments with numerical analyses and case studies, along with a summary of basic theory, to provide an easy-to-understand explanation for young practising engineers on the performance evaluation of concrete structures. It shows how the mechanical phenomena of familiar concrete structures can be expressed using mathematical models and provides a solid basic understanding of the nonlinear behaviour of concrete structures. It applies elasto-plastic theory to damage mechanics and the modelling of cracks in concrete"--
