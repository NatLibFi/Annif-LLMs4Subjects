InterViews : learning the craft of qualitative research interviewing
"The first edition of InterViews provided students and professionals in a wide variety of disciplines with the "whys" and "hows" of research interviewing, preparing students for learning interviewing by doing interviews and by studying examples of best practice. The thoroughly revised Second Edition retains its original seven stage structure, continuing to focus on the practical, epistemological, and ethical issues involved with interviewing. Authors Steinar Kvale and Svend Brinkmann also include coverage of newer developments in qualitative interviewing, discussion of interviewing as a craft, and a new chapter on linguistic modes of interview analysis. Practical and conceptual assignments, as well as new "tool boxes," provide students with the means to dig deeper into the material presented and achieve a more meaningful level of understanding." "This text is ideal for both novice and experienced interview researchers as well as graduate students taking courses in qualitative and research methods in the social sciences and health sciences, particularly in departments of education, nursing, sociology, psychology, and the media sciences."--Jacket
