Nachhaltige Entwicklung von Hochschulen : Erkenntnisse und Perspektiven zur gesamtinstitutionellen Transformation
What contributions can higher education institutions make to sustainable development in the areas of teaching, research, operation and transfer? How can their sustainable development as a whole institution be achieved? These questions were the focus of the joint project "Sustainability at Higher Education Institutions (HOCH-N)" of eleven German universities. This edited book presents the results from a research-oriented and reflexive perspective.
