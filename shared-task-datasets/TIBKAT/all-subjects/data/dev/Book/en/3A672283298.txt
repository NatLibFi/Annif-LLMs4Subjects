Physical and chemical equilibrium for chemical engineers
"New to this edition is an appendix covering the Bridgman table which includes a basic set of thermodynamic equations Has a new chapter on the thermodynamics of biochemical reactions Updates naming and notation used in the first edition; where the first edition used the traditional names for the Gibbs Free Energy and for Partial Molal Properties, this edition uses the more popular Gibbs Energy and Partial Molar Properties Teaches Physical and chemical equilibrium which deals with calculating the thermodynamic properties for mixtures. Includes many problems in the text to help the reader understand the material covered and includes a solutions manual to these problems"--
