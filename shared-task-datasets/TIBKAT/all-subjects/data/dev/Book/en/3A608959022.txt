A view from the river : the Chicago Architecture Foundation river cruise
This is the literary companion to the Chicago Architecture Foundation's River Cruise. As a memento of the cruise or simply as a guide to some of the finest architecture in the United States, "A View from the River" is a visual and textual treat. Stunning photographs by the Hedrich Blessing agency convey the splendor and diversity of downtown Chicago's buildings - all featured attractions of the Foundation's cruise. The text, by longtime Chicago Tribune contributor Jay Pridmore, tells the story of Chicago's early history and reviews the significance of the Chicago River in the development of one of the world's most beautiful cities. This book, the first to document the architecture seen on Chicago's River Cruise, is a must for anyone who has been awestruck by a ride on the river -- or for anyone who appreciates great architecture and expert architectural criticism.
