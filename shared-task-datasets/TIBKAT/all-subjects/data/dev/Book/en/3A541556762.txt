Understanding the brain : the birth of a learning science
This book provides new insights about learning by synthesizing existing and emerging findings from cognitive and brain science and exploring how this new information might impact teaching, parenting, and educational policy making.  It shows what the latest brain imaging techniques and other advances in the neurosciences actually reveal about how the brain develops and operates at different stages in life from birth to old age and how the brain is involved in acquiring skills such as reading and counting.  It also presents scientific insights into what happens when the brain malfunctions in conditions such as dyslexia or Alzheimer's disease.--Publisher's description
