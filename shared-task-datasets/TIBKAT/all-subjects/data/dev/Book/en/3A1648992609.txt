Biological, chemical, and radiological terrorism : emergency preparedness and response for the primary care physician
This book helps family physicians understand their roles in preparing for and responding to terrorist events. The text considers the physical and psychological impact of terrorism on providers and patients who are directly affected, as well as the spillover effects. Proactive measures are outlined, such as addressing concerns about risk. The text also details how to detect terrorist-caused illness as early as possible, how to provide defensive or preventative therapy, and how to treat ill patients. In-depth coverage of biologic agents (anthrax, plague, smallpox, botulism, tularemia, and hemorrhagic viruses), chemical agents (nerve and blister), and radiologic agents is provided. Readers also learn how to counsel traumatized families. In addition, the text examines the structure, function, and planning efforts of the public health system at the local, state, and federal levels. Emphasis is placed on how physicians can work with health officials on the delivery of preventive and therapeutic measures.
