City-HUBs : sustainable and efficient urban transport interchanges
"This City-HUBs book focuses on the design of 'sustainable and efficient interchanges', aiming to provide guidance and recommendations to enable seamless mobility, travel efficiency, user satisfaction and improved performance of the interchange. The main concern is to ensure that all people are given equal opportunities for reaching their destination, to optimise interconnections between alternative modes in the trip and, at the same time, ameliorate interchange space utilisation and integration in the city context"--Provided by publisher
