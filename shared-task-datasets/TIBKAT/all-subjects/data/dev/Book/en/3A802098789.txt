Surface modification of biopolymers
"This book covers the fundamentals in a most logical and clear manner for science and engineering students to follow as well as researchers from different disciplines. The main objective is to summarize in a fairly comprehensive manner most of the recent technical accomplishments in the area of surface modification of biopolymers for different applications. The book will be organized so that it provides most relevant and realistic information on surface modification of biopolymers for different applications ranging from automotive materials, toxic ion removal, biomedical material development, to defense applications, and more.  Included in this book will be more than 20 chapters.  This book is of interest to materials and biomaterials scientists and engineers, polymer chemists, biochemists, and biotechnologists.  It introduces an overview of the developments made in the area of surface modification of biopolymers.  Critical issues and suggestions for future research avenues are discussed, underscoring the roles of materials scientists and researchers for the future of these new "green" materials"--
