With emphasis on computation, this book is a real breakthrough in the field of LP. In addition to conventional topics, such as the simplex method, duality, and interior-point methods, all deduced in a fresh and clear manner, it introduces the state of the art by highlighting brand-new and advanced results, including efficient pivot rules, Phase-I approaches, reduced simplex methods, deficient-basis methods, face methods, and pivotal interior-point methods. In particular, it covers the determination of the optimal solution set, feasible-point simplex method, decomposition principle for solving large-scale problems, controlled-branch method based on generalized reduced simplex framework for solving integer LP problems
