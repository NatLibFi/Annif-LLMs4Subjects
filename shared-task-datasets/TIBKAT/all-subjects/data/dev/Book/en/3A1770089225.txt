Nanoscale quantum materials : musings on the ultra-small world
Introduction: From giants to dwarfs -- Down to low dimensions -- Quantum dots : in the abyss of no dimensions -- Quantum rings : dynamic unity of polar opposites -- Graphene : carbon and its nets -- Some remarkable episodes in the nanoscale -- Epilog and the road ahead.
"In the past four decades, there has been growing interest in the exciting new topic of physics in low dimensions. Thousands of original ideas have been proposed in the literature, and some are confirmed experimentally, along with several Nobel prizes which have been awarded in this field. While there are several books available, almost all are technical and accessible only to expert researchers. This book provides an accessible introduction to the field, with less emphasis on technical details. Whilst this book does not provide a traditional history of nano-science, instead it uses simple explanations and case studies as vehicles to explain key discoveries and the importance of them, enabling readers without a background in the area to gain an understanding of some aspects of nanoscale physics. It will be of interest to researchers working in condensed matter physics, in addition to engineers and advanced students in those disciplines. It also remains accessible to 'physics enthusiasts' from other academic disciplines, as technical details are contained within boxes and footnotes which can be skipped for a general reading of the book. Features: - Provides an accessible introduction to a technical subject - Contains exciting developments from the cutting-edge science being conducted in the area - Authored by a recognised expert in the field"--
