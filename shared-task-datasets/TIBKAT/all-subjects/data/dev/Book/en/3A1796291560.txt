Some in the crowd, which grew to several thousand people, could be heard chanting "Russia for the Russians" with their animus directed towards dark-skinned labor migrants from the southern border. The slogan "Russia for the Russians" is not a recent invention. It first gained notoriety in the very last years of the tsarist regime, appealing primarily to individuals drawn to the radical right.
