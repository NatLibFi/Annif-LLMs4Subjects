Optical Solitons : Theoretical and Experimental Challenges
Optical solitons represent one of the most exciting and fascinating concepts in modern communications, arousing special interest due to their potential applications in optical fibre communication. This volume focuses on the explicit integration of analytical and experimental methods in nonlinear fibre optics and integrated optics. It covers all important recent technical issues in optical-soliton communication. For example, individual chapters are devoted to topics such as dispersion management and fibre Bragg grating. All authors are leading authorities in their fields
