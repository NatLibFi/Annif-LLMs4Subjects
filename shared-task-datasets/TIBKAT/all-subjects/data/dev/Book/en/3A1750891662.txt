Substrate-integrated millimeter-wave antennas for next-generation communication and radar systems
"The mmW (millimeter wave) is one of the top three technologies to be adopted for future land and satellite wireless networks. The mmW antennas have been proposed for use in mobile terminals, small cells, backhauls, base-stations, satellites, aero-planes and UAVs for high-speed connection and data transmission as well as high-resolution detection and imaging. With the much shorter wavelengths compared to microwave bands, however, the antenna design faces unique challenges, especially in terms of mainly losses caused by structure design and fabrication besides the materials. To deploy mmW systems for wireless communication and radar detection, we must develop the new technologies for the antenna designs with low cost, low loss, and low complexity"--
