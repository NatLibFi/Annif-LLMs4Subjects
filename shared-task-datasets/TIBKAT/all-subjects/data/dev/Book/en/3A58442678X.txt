Hilbert space operators in quantum physics
This course-tested book explains in detail the theory of linear Hilbert-space operators and their use in quantum physics. The central mathematical tool of the book is the spectral theory of self-adjoint operators; in order to make the exposition self-contained, selected topics of functional analysis are included. An introduction to the theory of operator sets and algebras is also presented. This mathematical material is then used for a systematic analysis of the operator structure of quantum theory. Logical building of the theory is discussed as well as its practical aspects, such as spectral
