Foundations for efficient Web service selection
"Foundations for Efficient Web Service Selection provides disciplined and systematic support for efficient access to web services based on their functional and non-functional attributes. The key components of the framework center around a novel service model that provides a formal abstraction of services. A formal service model, a service calculus, and a service algebra that support efficient access web services, are described and demonstrated. Also covered are quality-based selection algorithms that can return the best user-desired web services based on their quality requirements and case studies."--pub. desc
