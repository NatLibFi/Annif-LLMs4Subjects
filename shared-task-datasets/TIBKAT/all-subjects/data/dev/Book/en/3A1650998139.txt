"Symplectic Geometric Algorithms for Hamiltonian Systems" will be useful not only for numerical analysts, but also for those in theoretical physics, computational chemistry, celestial mechanics, etc. The book generalizes and develops the generating function and Hamilton-Jacobi equation theory from the perspective of the symplectic geometry and symplectic algebra. It will be a useful resource for engineers and scientists in the fields of quantum theory, astrophysics, atomic and molecular dynamics, climate prediction, oil exploration, etc. Therefore a systematic research and development of numerical methodology for Hamiltonian systems is well motivated. Were it successful, it would imply wide-ranging applications.
