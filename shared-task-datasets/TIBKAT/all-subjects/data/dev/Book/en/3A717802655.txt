The Islamophobia industry : how the right manufactures fear of Muslims
This is a disturbing account of the rising tide of Islamophobia sweeping through the United States and Europe. Nathan Lean takes us through a world of conservative bloggers, right-wing talk show hosts, evangelical religious leaders and politicians, all united in their quest to exhume the ghosts of 9/11 and convince their compatriots that Islam is the enemy.
