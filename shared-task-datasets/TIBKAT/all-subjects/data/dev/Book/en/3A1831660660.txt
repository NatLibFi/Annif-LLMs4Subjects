Intelligent pervasive computing systems for smarter healthcare
Intelligent sensing and ubiquitous systems (ISUS) for smarter and safer home healthcare / Rui S. Moreira, Jos Torres, Pedro Sobral, and Christophe Soares -- PEMO-EC : a pervasive platform for ECG signal processing / Angelo Brayner, Jos Maria Monteiro, and Joao Paulo Madeiro -- The impact of implantable sensors in biomedical technology on the future of healthcare systems / Ashraf Darwish, Gehad Ismail Sayed, and Aboul Ella Hassanien.
"This book describes the innovations in healthcare made possible by computing through bio-sensors. The reader learns how that goal is being pursued by the editors' examination of topics such as the design and development of pervasive healthcare technologies, data modeling and information management, wearable biosensors and their systems, and more. The pervasive computing paradigm offers tremendous advantages in diversified areas of healthcare research and technology. Pervasive computational support enables the optimization of medical assessment for a healthier, safer, and more productive society"--
