"This book focuses on the human users of search engines and the tool they use to interact with them: the search user interface. The truly worldwide reach of the Web has brought with it a new realization among computer scientists and laypeople of the enormous importance of usability and user interface design. In the last ten years, much has become understood about what works in search interfaces from a usability perspective, and what does not. Researchers and practitioners have developed a wide range of innovative interface ideas, but only the most broadly acceptable make their way into major web search engines. This book summarizes these developments, presenting the state of the art of search interface design, both in academic research and in deployment in commercial systems.  Many books describe the algorithms behind search engines and information retrieval systems, but the unique focus of this book is specifically on the user interface.  It will be welcomed by industry professionals who design systems that use search interfaces as well as graduate students and academic researchers who investigate information systems"--Provided by publisher
