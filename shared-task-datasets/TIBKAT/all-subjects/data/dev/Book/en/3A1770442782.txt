Plant stress biology : strategies and trends
Plants growing in the natural environment battle with a variety of biotic (pathogens infection) and abiotic (salinity, drought, heat and cold stresses etc.) stresses. These physiological stresses drastically affect plant growth and productivity under field conditions. These challenges are likely to grow as a consequences of global climate change and pose a threat to the food security. Therefore, acquaintance with underlying signalling pathways, physiological, biochemical and molecular mechanisms in plants and the role of beneficial soil microorganisms in plant’s stress tolerance are pivotal for sustainable crop production. This volume written by the experts in the stress physiology and covers latest research on plant’s tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses. It elaborates on the potential of plant-microbe interactions to avoid the damage caused by these stresses. With comprehensive information on theoretical, technical and experimental aspects of plant stress biology, this extensive volume is a valuable resource for researchers, academician and students in the broad field of plant stress biology, physiology, microbiology, environmental and agricultural science.
