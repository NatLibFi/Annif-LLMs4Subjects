Urban Renaissance: Glasgow : Lessons for Innovation and Implementation
This urban renaissance review of Glasgow looks back over the 1990s, when a succession of strategic initiatives and major events brought regeneration to several key parts of the city, including along the banks of the Clyde, and helped lift investment and activity.  This book provides a policy tool kit for Glasgow, with the aim of improving the distressed urban areas that are holding the city back.
