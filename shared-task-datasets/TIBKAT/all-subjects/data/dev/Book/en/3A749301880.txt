Quantum Optics : Including Noise Reduction, Trapped Ions, Quantum Trajectories, and Decoherence
Quantum Optics gives a very broad coverage of basic laser-related phenomena that allow scientists and engineers to carry out research in quantum optics and laser physics. It covers the quantization of the electromagnetic field, quantum theory of coherence, atom-field interaction models, resonance fluorescence, quantum theory of damping, laser theory using both the master equation and the Langevin approach, the correlated-emission laser, input-output theory with application in nonlinear optics, quantum trajectories, atom optics, quantum non-demolition measurements and generation of non-classsical vibrational states of ions in a Paul trap. These topics are presented in a unified and didactic manner. The presentation of the book is clear and pedagogical; it balances the theoretical aspects of the optical phenomena with recent relevant experiments
