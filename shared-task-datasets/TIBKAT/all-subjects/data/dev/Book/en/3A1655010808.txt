Mathematics and War
Mathematics has for centuries been stimulated, financed and credited by military purposes. Some mathematical thoughts and mathematical technology have also been vital in war. During World War II mathematical work by the Anti-Hitler coalition was part of an aspiration to serve humanity and not help destroy it.

It discusses the new mathematically enhanced development of military technology which seems to have changed the very character of modern warfare
