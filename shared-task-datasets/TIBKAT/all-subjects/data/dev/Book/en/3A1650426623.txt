Theoretical and Experimental Sonochemistry Involving Inorganic Systems
Despite the fact that chemical applications of ultrasound are now widely acknowledged, a detailed presentation of inorganic systems covering nano-particles, catalysis, aqueous chemistry of metallic solutions and their redox characteristics, both from a theoretical and experimental perspective has eluded researchers of this field. &quot;Theoretical and Experimental Sonochemistry Involving Inorganic Systems&quot; fills this gap and presents a concise and thorough review of this fascinating area of Sonochemistry in a single volume
