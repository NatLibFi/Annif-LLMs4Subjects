Elgar Research Agendas outline the future of research in a given area. Leading scholars are given the space to explore their subject in provocative ways, and map out the potential directions of travel. They are relevant but also visionary. Providing a critical overview of cultural economics, this Research Agenda explores the current state of affairs in the field, suggesting methods of improvement for the coherency and progressiveness of future research. Situating work in this area in its historical context, Samuel Cameron draws together a range of international contributors to explore the development of cultural economics. Undertaking a thorough examination of matters of data quality, statistical methodology and the challenge of new developments in technology, chapters examine the different approaches to cultural economics. The book explores the myriad ways in which the topic has been neglected by mainstream economics, and examines reasons why it needs to be considered, evaluated and explored in more detail in our modern world. Current researchers in cultural economics, as well as cultural policies and leisure studies will find this book an invaluable read in exploring different ways to integrate cultural economics into mainstream studies. This Research Agenda will also be an invaluable aid for advanced students to create discussions suitable for essay topics and dissertations
