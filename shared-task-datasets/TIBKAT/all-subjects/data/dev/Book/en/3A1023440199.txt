Handbook of research on new venture creation
This comprehensive Handbook provides an essential analysis of new venture creation research. The eminent contributors critically discuss and explore the current literature as well as suggest improvements to the field. They reveal a strong sense of both the 'state-of-the-art' (what has and has not been done in new venture creation research) and the 'state-of-the-could-be' (future directions the field should take to improve knowledge). The Handbook comprises nineteen chapters divided into four main sections: setting the agenda; theoretical perspectives; data and measurements; and new venture creation through contextual lenses.
