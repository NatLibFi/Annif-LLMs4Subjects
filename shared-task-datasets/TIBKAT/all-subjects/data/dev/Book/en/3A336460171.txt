Religion im Prozeß der Globalisierung
The volume collects articles that present the current state of the English-language discussion on religion and globalization, especially from sociological and anthroplogical perspectives. A first section consists of theoretical contri-butions which inform the interpretations of the predominantly empirical studies that make up the second section. Overall, the selections show how the develop-ment of global society has contributed greatly to religious transformation; and how in various ways religion has been a significant force in the historical emergence of global society itself. - Content: Introduction, Peter Beyer: English-Language Views of the Role of Religion in Globalization; Section I: Theoretical Statements: Roland Robertson: The Globalization Paradigm: Thinking Globally; John W.
