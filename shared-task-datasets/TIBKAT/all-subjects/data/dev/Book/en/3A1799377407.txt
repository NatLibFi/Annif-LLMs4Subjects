Bio-electrochemical systems : waste valorization and waste biorefinery
"This book addresses electro-fermentation for biofuel production and to generate high-value chemicals and biofuels using organic wastes. It covers the use of microbial biofilm and algae-based bioelectrochemical systems (BES) for bioremediation and co-generation of valuable chemicals, including their practical applications. It explains BES design, integrated approaches to enhance process efficiency and scaling-up technology for waste remediation, bio-electrogenesis and resource recovery from wastewater. Features:  Provides information regarding bioelectrochemical systems mediated value-added chemical synthesis and waste remediation and resource recovery approaches. Covers the use of microbial biofilm and algae-based bioelectrochemical systems for bioremediation and co-generation of valuable chemicals. Explains waste to energy related concepts to treat industrial effluents along with bioenergy generation. Deals with various engineering approaches for chemicals production in eco-friendly manner. Discusses emerging electro-fermentation technology. This book aims at Senior Undergraduate and Researchers in Industrial Biotechnology, Environmental Science, Civil, Chemical Engineering, Bioenergy and Biofuels, Wastewater Treatment"--
