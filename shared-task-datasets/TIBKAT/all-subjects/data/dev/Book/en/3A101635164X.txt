The Oxford handbook of European legal history
This handbook provides a broad overview of the development of European legal history from Ancient Greece to the twenty-first century. It engages with current research questions in international scholarship, and, in addition to Europe's heartland, details the history of its geographical 'fringes', such as Scandinavia and Eastern Europe.
