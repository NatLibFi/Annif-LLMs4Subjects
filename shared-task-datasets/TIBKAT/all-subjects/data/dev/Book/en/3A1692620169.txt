Robust statistical methods with R
The second edition of Robust Statistical Methods with R provides a systematic treatment of robust procedures with an emphasis on new developments and on the computational aspects. There are many numerical examples and notes on the R environment, and the updated chapter on the multivariate model contains additional material on visualization of multivariate data in R. A new chapter on robust procedures in measurement error models concentrates mainly on the rank procedures, less sensitive to errors than other procedures. This book will be an invaluable resource for researchers and postgraduate students in statistics and mathematics.
