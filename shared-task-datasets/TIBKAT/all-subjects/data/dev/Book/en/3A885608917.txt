Geb√§ude, die Zeichen setzen : ein Blick auf drei Jahrzehnte Architektur
The architecture of the last three decades will be illuminated in general as well as in detail. A very personal architectural journey through time with around 30 buildings and their history offers insights and a look behind the scenes of a generation's architecture. What ideas, methods, techniques, as well as social discussions have shaped architecture and the latest trends over the past three decades; which architects have appeared on the scene; which ideas have set standards?
