Recent advances in microbial degradation
Microbes play a major role in the degradation of various pollutants. Therefore, microbes find potential application in the area of energy and environmental technology. The book provides in-depth literature on the topics of environmental and industrial importance. It is compiled to explore the application of microbe used in the degradation of aflatoxin, polymers, biomass into fuel, disinfectants, food products, xenobiotic compounds, lipids, steroids, organic pollutants, proteins, oil waste, and wastewater pollutants. This book will be of interest to teachers, researchers, scientists, and capacity builders. Also, the book serves as additional reading material for undergraduate and graduate students of microbiology and environmental sciences. National and international remediation and restoration scientists, policymakers will also find this to be a useful read.
