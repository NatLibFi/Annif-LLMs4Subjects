Semiconductor modeling : for simulating signal, power, and electromagnetic integrity
This book assists engineers - both recent graduates and working product designers - in designing high-speed circuits. The authors apply circuit theory, circuit simulation tools, and practical experience to help the engineer understand semiconductor modeling as applied to high-speed digital designs. The emphasis is on semiconductor modeling, with PCB transmission line effects, equipment enclosure effects, and other modeling issues discussed as needed. The text addresses many practical considerations, including process variation, model accuracy, validation and verification, signal integrity, and design flow. Readers will benefit from its survey of modeling for semiconductors, packages, and interconnects, along with usable advice on how to get complex, high-speed prototypes to work on the first try. The highlights include: presents a very complete and well-balanced treatment of modeling of semiconductors, packages, and interconnects; facilitates reader comprehension of the whole field of high-speed modeling, including digital and RF circuits; combines practical modeling techniques with the latest EDA tools for simulation and successful high-speed digital design; facilitates resolution of practical, every-day problems. Presents modeling from its historical roots to current state of the art; facilitates keeping abreast of the latest modeling developments as they continue to unfold; and includes a CD-ROM with modeling software and additional model examples.
