Handbook of finance and development
The Handbook of Finance and Development provides a thorough assessment of the existing research on the relationship between the financial system and economic growth. Containing chapters on theory, empirical work and historic accounts, this is the first Handbook to provide a comprehensive overview of the fields of finance and development. As leading researchers in the field the contributors analyse the emergence of, and innovations in, financial instruments, markets and intermediaries, providing commentary on how these components of financial systems shape resource allocation, poverty, income inequality and aggregate economic growth. They also explore the causes and consequences of financial fragility, the historic development of financial systems, and the regulatory and supervisory underpinnings of financial sector development. Further chapters examine financial development at both the aggregate and country levels and assess the degree to which individuals and firms can access financial services. Recent literature on the financial inclusion of households and enterprises is also analysed. The Handbook will be of great value to scholars and researchers who are interested in the fields of finance, development and financial inclusion. Throughout the chapters contributors highlight how insights drawn from research inform policy debates on the topics at hand, making this work a useful resource for policy makers and regulators
