Located in Long Island, New York, the completely unique, LEED-certified home, gets its name from the curved walls which form its cocoon-like shape.

The carefully considered theories that served as inspiration to the house are discussed in depth, making 'Cocoon House' a crucial reference book to anyone studying sustainable architecture as a whole
