X-parameters : characterization, modeling, and design of nonlinear RF and microwave components
"This is the definitive guide to X-parameters, written by the original inventors and developers of this powerful new paradigm for nonlinear RF and microwave components and systems. Learn how to use X-parameters to overcome intricate problems in nonlinear RF and microwave engineering. The general theory behind X-parameters is carefully and intuitively introduced, and then simplified down to specific, practical cases, providing you with useful approximations that will greatly reduce the complexity of measuring, modeling and designing for nonlinear regimes of operation. Containing real-world case studies, definitions of standard symbols and notation, detailed derivations within the appendices, and exercises with solutions, this is the definitive stand-alone reference for researchers, engineers, scientists and students looking to remain on the cutting-edge of RF and microwave engineering"--
