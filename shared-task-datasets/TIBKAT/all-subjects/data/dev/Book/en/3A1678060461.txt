Smart bioremediation technologies : microbial enzymes
Smart Bioremediation Technologies: Microbial Enzymes provides insights into the complex behavior of enzymes and identifies metabolites and their degradation pathways. It will help readers work towards solutions for sustainable medicine and environmental pollution. The book highlights the microbial enzymes that have replaced many plant and animal enzymes, also presenting their applications in varying industries, including pharmaceuticals, genetic engineering, biofuels, diagnostics and therapy. In addition, new methods, including genomics and metagenomics, are being employed for the discovery of new enzymes from microbes. This book brings all of these topics together, representing the first resource on how to solve problems in bioremediation
