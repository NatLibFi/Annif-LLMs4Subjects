Field guide to optics education : a tribute to John Greivenkamp
The past two decades have seen significant innovation in teaching methods for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. This innovation has been driven by development of new educational technologies and methods that were accelerated in 2020 and 2021 by the explosion of remote teaching due to COVID-19. The teaching of optics, being a highly specialized STEM field, has much in common with other areas, but has its own unique challenges. This volume explores individual experiences with the development of methods and their application to the teaching of optics, especially in higher education. The volume is dedicated to the memory of Professor John Greivenkamp, who passed away in early 2022 and was among the best known and most passionate educators of optics in the world.
