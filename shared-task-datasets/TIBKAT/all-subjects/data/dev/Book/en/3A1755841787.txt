Rheology of polymeric systems : principles and applications
Pierre Carreau is Professor Emeritus at the Department of Chemical Engineering at the Ã‰cole Polytechnique in Montreal. He is well known for developing the Carreau Fluid Model, and the Carreau Viscosity Model is now integrated into most flow simulation software packages for plastics processing. Daniel De Kee is Adjunct Professor in the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering at the University of Toronto. He has published over 200 papers in the area of non-Newtonian fluid mechanics and polymer processing, and is the co-author of five textbooks and eight edited books. Raj Chhabra is Professor at the Department of Chemical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. His research focuses on the role of non-Newtonian rheology on flow field in model configurations. He has published over 300 papers and book chapters, as well as seven books.
Rheology is applied extensively in polymer, chemical, food processing, and related industries. This book combines the basic concepts and applications by presenting a balanced overview of the principles. With simplified analysis of complex problems, the textbook format provides easy understanding for both students and practicing professionals. There is no competing book with such a wide scope, including unique topics such as diffusion, flows about particles, and liquid mixing. This second edition is abundantly updated throughout. Highlights include elongational flow measurements, POM-POM modeling, diffusion and rheology of polymer nanocomposites, new results based on CFD simulations, and much more.
