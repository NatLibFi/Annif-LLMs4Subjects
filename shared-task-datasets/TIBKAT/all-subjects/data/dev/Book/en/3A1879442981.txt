Research without tears : from the first ideas to published output
Research Without Tears provides a concise and fascinating guide for those starting their first research project and writing a paper, report or thesis. John Creedy, a widely published writer himself in both journals and books, argues that the process of planning and executing a research project, and producing a research paper which communicates results in a clear and succinct way, is far from self-evident even to those with extensive experience of writing other types of report or essay. This unique and invaluable book therefore sets down explicitly some of those points that even experienced researchers often take for granted. The book covers topics including: planning a first research project; writing a first research paper; writing a thesis and the relationship with a supervisor; the differences between journal and book publishing and what to expect from editors of both publishing formats. It also offers invaluable advice on structure, writing clearly and pitfalls to avoid as well as the processes involved in publishing. This highly interesting and valuable book will be essential reading for students and academics in economics and other related disciplines
