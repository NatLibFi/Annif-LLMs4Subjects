"This is the first attempt to delineate the synthetic field of the theoretical study of information, treating information as the basic phenomenon on the fundamental level of the world encompassing nature, technology, individuals and society. The exploration of information is explored within Info-computational approaches, to natural and social phenomena such as Bioinformatics, Information Physics, Informational Chemistry, Computational Physics, Cognitive and Social sciences, with special emphasis on inter-disciplinary, cross-disciplinary and trans-disciplinary knowledge. The book presents results of collaboration across research fields within info-computational and info-structural frameworks, in attempt to better theoretically and conceptually capture the phenomena of information, and its dynamics (such as computation and communication), as they appear on different levels of organization, on different scales and in different contexts"--
