Classical mechanics illustrated by modern physics : 42 problems with solutions
"This book provides an illustration of classical mechanics in the form of problems (at undergraduate level) inspired - for the most part - by contemporary research in physics, and resulting from the teaching and research experience of the authors. A noticeable feature of this book is that it emphasizes the experimental aspects of a large majority of problems. All problems are accompanied by detailed solutions: the calculations are clarified and their physical significance commented on in-depth. Within the solutions, the basic concepts from undergraduate lectures in classical mechanics, necessary to solve the problems, are recalled when needed. The authors systematically mention recent bibliographical references (most of them freely accessible via the Internet) allowing the reader to deepen their understanding of the subject, and thus contributing to the building of a general culture in physics"--Publisher's description
