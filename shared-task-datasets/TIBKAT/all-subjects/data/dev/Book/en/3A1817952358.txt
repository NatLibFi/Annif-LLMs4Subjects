Corporate Social Responsibility : The Co-Responsibility of Business along Global Supply Chains
Introduction -- Theoretical foundations -- Analysis -- Alternative approaches for more co-responsibility -- Conclusion -- Bibliography -- Declaration of academic integrity.
This book attempts to clarify the social responsibility of business along global supply chains beyond mere profit maximisation as famously argued by Milton Friedman. In this context, corporate social responsibility (CSR) is understood as the responsibility of business to align corporate policies and procedures with commonly accepted ethical standards and to respect stakeholdersâ€™ rights in day-to-day business. As such, CSR is by no means voluntary but constitutes a fundamental prerequisite for companies to keep their license to operate for sustainaable growth and survival in an ever more competitive global market. Inspired by Germany' recent efforts to regulate global supply chains, Germany's Due Diligence Act is analysed in terms of its potential and limitations to promote responsible business practices and complemented by alternative approaches for more co-responsibility of business globally. About the author Lilli Carlotta Sophie Maurice is an international Consultant in the field of sustainable private and financial sector development.
