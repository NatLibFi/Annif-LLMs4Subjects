Chemical elements in the environment : factsheets for the geochemist and environmental scientist
Contents: How large is the natural variation in concentration of the various elements in different media? How do the oft-cited "World average concentrations" in different media compare with actual analytical data? How low a detection limit do I need to attain if I want to analyse for an element in soils, sediments, water or plants? All these questions and many more can be answered by using this reference book. It collates data on the most important properties and uses of all naturally occurring chemical elements. It combines these with data obtained from actual analyses of different sample media (soil, stream sediment, stream water, ground water, plants, human body fluids). This combination of facts and actual data makes this book suitable for learning and teaching applied geochemistry as well (Quelle: www.buchkatalog.de)
