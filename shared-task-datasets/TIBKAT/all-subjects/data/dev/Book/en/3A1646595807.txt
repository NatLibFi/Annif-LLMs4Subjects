Science and Practice of Pressure Ulcer Management
Pressure ulcers, also referred to as pressure sores, bedsores and decubitus ulcers, can range from a very mild pink coloration of the skin, which disappears in a few hours after the pressure is relieved, to a very deep wound extending to and in very serious cases sometimes through a bone and into internal organs. There are many similarities to burn wounds in terms of the course of injury, but the primary cause of pressure ulcers is unrelieved pressure to the skin, while secondary causes include exposure to cold or skin abrasion. Other contributing factors to the development of pressure ulcers include poor nutrition, weight loss and diabetes, all of which are prevalent in the modern developed world. This book will establish the clinical and scientific basis behind effective pressure ulcer management. Aimed squarely at dermatology clinicians and vascular surgeons, this text is designed to be the primary reference for pressure ulcers from diagnosis and prevention to management and treatment options. In addition, dermatology nursing and clinic staff and interns will also gain much from reading this text. The contributing authors are all experts in the management of pressure ulcers and will provide a valuable clinical compendium for this difficult area of medicine.
