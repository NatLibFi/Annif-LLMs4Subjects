The circular economy in the European Union : an interim review
Part I: Representatives of the EU Institutions -- Part II: Consumer Protection Representatives -- Part III: Representatives of Science -- Part IV: Repair as Top Priority within the Circular Economy.
The implementation of the circular economy will entail a major transformation from a resource-destroying, linear economy to a circular one that operates within the planetâ€™s regenerative boundaries. This book presents an interim assessment of the implementation of a circular economy in the EU. It reveals what achievements have been made in various EU institutions, but which are scarcely perceived by the public; which basic scientific principles can be applied in this context; and what NGOs are demanding beyond this progress. It provides convincing arguments for abandoning the "hamster wheel" of material-based satisfaction of our needs, and shows that the primacy of the economy stands in the way of a good life for all. Given its focus, it will appeal to everyone interested in an ecologically sustainable economic system.
