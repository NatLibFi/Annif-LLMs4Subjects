Chapter 1: Heat exchangers and their networks: A state-of-the-art survey -- Chapter 2: Basic thermal design theory for heat exchangers -- Chapter 3: Steady-state characteristics of heat exchangers -- Chapter 4: Thermal design of evaporators and condensers -- Chapter 5: Optimal design of heat exchangers -- Chapter 6: Optimal design of heat exchanger networks -- Chapter 7: Dynamic analysis of heat exchangers and their networks -- Chapter 8: Experimental methods for thermal performance of heat exchangers -- Chapter 9: Optimal control process of heat exchanger networks -- Appendix: Source codes used in the book
Design and Operation of heat Exchangers and Their Networks presents a comprehensive and detailed analysis on the thermal design methods for the most common types of heat exchangers, with a focus on their networks, simulation procedures for their operations, and measurement of their thermal performances. The book addresses the fundamental theories and principles of heat transfer performance of heat exchangers and their applications and then applies them to the use of modern computing technology. Topics discussed include cell methods for condensers and evaporators, dispersion models for heat exchangers, experimental methods for the evaluation of heat exchanger performance, and thermal calculation algorithms for multi-stream heat exchangers and heat exchanger networks. --
