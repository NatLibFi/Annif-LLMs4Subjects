Systems dependability assessment set / coordinated by Jean-Fran√ßois Aubry ; volume 2: Benefits of Bayesian network models
This book explains the principles of knowledge structuration to ensure a valid BN and DBN model and illustrate the flexibility and efficiency of these representations in dependability, risk analysis and control of multi-state systems and dynamic systems. Across five chapters, the authors present several modeling methods and industrial applications are referenced for illustration in real industrial contexts.--
