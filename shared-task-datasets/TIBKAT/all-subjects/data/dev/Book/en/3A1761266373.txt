Geodynamics of the Indian Plate : evolutionary perspectives
This book provides insights on new geological, tectonic, and climatic developments in India through a time progression from the Archean to the Anthropocene that are captured via authoritative entries from experts in earth sciences. This volume aims to bring graduate students and researchers up to date on the geodynamic evolution of the Indian Plate; concepts that have so far resulted in a rather uneven treatment of the subject at different institutions. The book is divided into 4 sections and includes perspectives such as the formation and evolution of the Indian crust in comparison to its neighbors such as Antarctica, Africa and Australia; the evolution of Precambrian cratons and sedimentary basins of India; and a summary account of early life reported in the Indian stratigraphic record. Readers will also discover the key recent research into the neotectonics, tectonic geomorphology, and paleoseismology of the Himalayan Front. Researchers and students in geology, earth sciences, sedimentology, paleobiology and geography will find this book appealing.
