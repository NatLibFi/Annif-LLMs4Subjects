Advanced surfaces enriches the high-throughput engineering of physical and chemical phenomenon in relatin to electrical, magnetic, electronics, thermal and optical controls, as well as large surface areas, protective coatings against water loss and excessive gas exchange. A more sophisticated example could be a highly selective surface permeability allowing passive diffusion and selective transport of molecules in the water or gases. The smart surface technology provides an interlayer model which prevents the entry of substances without affecting the properties of neighboring layers. A number of methods have been developed for coatings, which are essential building blocks for the top-down and/or bottom-up design of numerous functional materials. Advanced Surface Engineering Materials offers a detailed up-to-date review chapters on the functional coatings and adhesives, engineering of nanosurfaces, high-tech surface, characterization and new applications. The 13 chapters in this book are divided into 3 parts (Functional coatings and adhesives; Engineering of nanosurfaces; High-tech surface, characterization and new applications) and are all written by worldwide subject matter specialists. The book is written for readers from diverse backgrounds across chemistry, physics, materials science and engineering, medical science, environmental, bio- and nano- technologies and biomedical engineering. It offers a comprehensive view of cutting-edge research on surface engineering materials and their technological importance
