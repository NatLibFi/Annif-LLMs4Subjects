"HIGH-TEMPERATURE ELECTRONICS provides expert coverage of the applications, characteristics, design, selection, and operation of electronic devices and circuits at temperatures above the conventional limit of 125 degrees Celsius. This edited volume contains approximately 100 key reprinted papers covering a wide range of topics related to high-temperature electronics, eight invited papers, extensive references, and a comprehensive bibliography. Containing more than 200 pages of new material, it brings the reader a well-rounded review of high-temperature electronics from its beginnings decades ago through the present and beyond to possible future technologies. The scope of HIGH TEMPERATURE ELECTRONICS includes active components from standard and advanced semiconductor materials, passive components, as well as technologies for metallizations, interconnections, and the assembly and packaging of electronic components. This book will provide active researchers, technology developers, managers, materials scientists, and advanced students with a sound fundamental grounding in high-temperature electronics technology."
