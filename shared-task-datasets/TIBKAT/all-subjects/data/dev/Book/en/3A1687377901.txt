Python is one of the most popular and widley used progamming languages as it's also available for free and runs on any operating system. All examples in the text involve language data and can be adapted or used directly for language research. The text focuses on key language-related issues: searching, text manipulation, text encoding and internet data, providing an excellent resource for language research. More experienced users of Phython will also benefit from the advanced chapters on graphical user interfaces and functional programming."
