Engineering and technology for healthcare
"Innovation in healthcare is currently a "hot" topic. Innovation allows us to think differently, to take risks and to develop ideas that are far better than existing solutions. Currently, there is no single book that covers all topics related to microelectronics, sensors, data, system integration and healthcare technology assessment in one reference. This book aims to critically evaluate current state-of-the-art technologies and provide readers with insights into developing new solutions. With contributions from a fully international team of experts across electrical engineering and biomedical fields, the book discusses how advances in sensing technology, computer science, communications systems and proteomics/genomics are influencing healthcare technology today"--
