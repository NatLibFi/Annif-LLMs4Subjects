"Phase transitions typically occur in combinatorial computational problems and have important consequences, especially with the current spread of statistical relational learning and as sequence learning methodologies. In Phase Transitions in Machine Learning the authors begin by describing in detail this phenomenon and the extensive experimental investigation that supports its presence. They then turn their attention to the possible implications and explore appropriate methods for tackling them"--
