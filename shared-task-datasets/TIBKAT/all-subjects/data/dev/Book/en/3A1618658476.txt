Optical systems engineering
"A practical guide to optical system design and developmentOptical Systems Engineering emphasizes first-order, system-level estimates of optical performance. Building on the basic principles of optical design and engineering, the book uses numerous practical examples to illustrate the essential, real-world processes such as requirements analysis, feasibility and trade studies, subsystem interfaces, error budgets, requirements flow-down and allocation, component specifications, and vendor selection. Filled with detailed diagrams and photographs, this is an indispensable resource for anyone involved in developing optical, electro-optical, and infrared systems.Optical Systems Engineering covers:  Systems engineering Geometrical optics Aberrations and image quality Radiometry Optical sources Detectors and focal plane arrays Optomechanical design"--
"This unique resource encourages independent thinking to optical system designers/developers creating the knowledge foundation based on kinesthetically enhanced, hands-on learning approach"--
