This book gives you the confidence to abandon your jQuery crutches and walk freely with the power of the web API and JavaScript. Learn about the most important concepts surrounding web development as we demystify jQuery. Beyond jQuery doesn't just throw code at you - everything is explained in detail from the perspective of a jQuery developer. jQuery is often injected into web applications and libraries with no logical reason for pulling it in as a dependency. Many web developers don’t really know when they need to use jQuery, and when they don’t - it's just a standard step when setting up a new library or web application. But relying solely on jQuery as your window to the web leaves large gaps in your knowledge. This in turn results in frustration when the abstraction that jQuery provides “leaks” and exposes you to the native aspects of the browser. Beyond jQuery educates developers, reveals the magic behind jQuery, helps you solve common problems without it, and gives you more confidence to embrace the power of the web API and standardized JavaScript.
