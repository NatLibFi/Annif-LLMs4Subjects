Becoming an architect
"Zara shadows acclaimed architects Sharon Johnston and Mark Lee of the prestigious Los Angeles-based firm Johnston Marklee. Learn from the founders as they near the unveiling of their major new building, the Menil Drawing Institute. Sit in on meetings as they compete for new projects, watch as they conceive, draft, render, plan, construct, and execute buildings. Architects must juggle hundreds of items to ensure their ideas come to life as planned. Zara shows that good architects must have vision as well as organizational acumen."--Amazon
