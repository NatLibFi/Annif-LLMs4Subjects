Radiographic Atlas of Skull and Brain Anatomy
The English Edition contains a few differences from the first ItaHan Edition, which require an explanation. Firstly, some imag­ es, especially some 3D reconstructions, have been modified in order to make them clearer. Secondly, in agreement with the Publisher, we have disowned one of our statements in the preface to the Italian Edition. Namely, we have now added a brief introductory text for each section, by way of explanation to the anatomical and physiological notes. This should make it easier for the reader to understand and refer to this Atlas. These differences derive from our experience with the previous edition and are meant to be an improvement thereof Hopefully, there will be more editions to follow, so that we may further improve our work and keep ourselves busy on lone­ some evenings. Finally, the improvements in this edition are a reminder to the reader that one should never purchase the first edition of a work. UAquila, January 2006 The Authors Preface to the Italian Edition I have been meaning to publish an atlas of neuroradiologic cranio-encephaHc anatomy for at least the last decade. Normal anatomy has always been of great and charming interest to me. Over the years, while preparing lectures for my students, I have always enjoyed lingering on anatomical details that today are rendered with astonishing realism by routine diagnostic ima­ ging.
The book is very innovative, offering a detailed, original representation of normal anatomy of the skull and brain with more than 892 figures in black and white and colours. Plan X Ray, high resolution CT and MRI cuts on conventional planes are collected together with tridimensional reformatted images and with functional studies. Brain, skull, ear, orbit and vascular anatomy are treated in the same book, following systematic designs rather than technique dependent representations. High quality images are supported with extreme care in detail labeling and with colour drawings and schemes.
