The bicycle artisans
Here is an alphabetically presented, richly illustrated guide to 88 of the most creative bicycle makers working today, includes established names such as Achielle, Cielo Cycles and Corima and new kids on the block such as Art & Industry, Bondi Beach Cruisers and Foffa, as well as product designers (Torkel Dohmers, Marc Newson). Today's cyclists are seeking increasingly custom-made bicycles as reflections of their personalities whether a Danish-style cargo bike, a recumbent, a cyclocross trainer or a randonneur. Often working in tiny studios and workshops in hidden parts of our cities, the master craftsmen featured in these pages produce pieces that are highly personal and sought after and rarely seen.
