Biogeography : an ecological and evolutionary approach
"Before starting to outline the structure of biogeography today, it is worthwhile to try to explain how scientists work, and what are their limitations - how far should the student trust what they say and believe? And the best way to learn this is to look at how scientists have behaved in the past, for the research workers of today are no different from them. So history has much to teach us. It is natural to assume that any research worker is free to make any sort of suggestion as to what new idea they might put forward in trying to solve their current problems. The reality is rather different. Just as in the past, the range of what are seen as possible solutions is limited by what contemporary society or science views as permissible or respectable. Attitudes to the idea of evolution (chapter 6) or of continental drift (see below) are good examples of such inhibitions in the 19th and 20th centuries, and the concept of evolution is still controversial today in some societies and communities. The history of scientific debate is rarely, if ever, one of dispassionate, unemotional evaluation of new ideas, particularly if they conflict with one's own. Scientists, like all men and women, are the product of their upbringing and experience, affected by their political and religious beliefs (or disbeliefs), by their position in society, by their own previous judgments and publicly expressed opinions, and by their ambitions-just as "there's no business like show business," there's no interest like self-interest! Very good examples of this, discussed later in this chapter, is the use of the concept of evolution by the rising middle-class scientists of England as a weapon against the 19th-century establishment (see later in this chapter) while, at the individual level, the history of Leon Croizat and his ideas (see later in this chapter) provides an interesting study"--
