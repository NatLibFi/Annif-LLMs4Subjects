Chemistry and technology of alternate fuels
"This compendium covers unconventional fuel sources, i.e., sources other than crude oil and natural gas with the aim of presenting these sources as future alternates to fossil fuels. The contents of this must-have volume are important aspects of the non-fossil fuel sources of availability of alternate sources of fuels. The properties of these fuels are well documented and compared to other fuels from non-petroleum sources (such as tar sand, coal, and oil shale). The environmental effects of non-petroleum fuels will also be compared to other fuels in terms with current environmental regulations"--
