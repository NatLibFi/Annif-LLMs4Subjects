Does economic governance matter? : governance institutions and outcomes
Economic governance institutions (rules, norms and enforcement practices) define the cost and incentive structures that influence the decisions of economic actors. They therefore have a significant impact on micro and macro economic performance across countries and time. -- This book contributes to the growing governance literature in three ways. First, it extends the analysis to new areas such as power asymmetry, regulation, transnational company strategies, and law enforcement. Secondly, it examines the role of formal institutions that shape and enforce the rules/norms codified in law; but also private-ordering institutions that function under the umbrella of the State; and private institutions (such as market rules/norms) that provide reputational and other information that foster compliance. Finally, the book extends and enriches the governance debate, addressing issues such as the determinants of institutional quality and efficiency, and the interaction between actor networks and institutional norms. -- Does Economic Governance Matter? brings together state-of-the-art research and analysis that will appeal to academics and undergraduate and postgraduate students of economics, public policy, network analysis, corporate governance and business law. The book will also appeal to a wide range of practitioners and policymakers in areas such as regulation, competition, international development, corporate law and macroeconomic policy design.
