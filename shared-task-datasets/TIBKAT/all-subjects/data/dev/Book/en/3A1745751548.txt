"This innovative book explores how the design of financial education programmes could benefit from the findings of behavioural economics and finance and cognitive sciences. It covers the social, cultural and technological determinants of financial education, the role of the banking system in promoting financial literacy, and how governments and regulatory authorities are dealing with financial education and risk literacy programmes in schools. Featuring contributions from authors with diverse methodological and ideological backgrounds, Financial Education and Risk Literacy offers a rich and multifaceted debate. Chapters explore theory and empirical evidence, utilising investigations of programmes deployed and the outcomes of experiments. This book also complements the emerging literature by studying how individuals perceive and process information when making financial decisions. Economics students and scholars, in particular those studying behavioural economics, will appreciate the forward-looking agenda of this book. Its insights into how policymakers can benefit from a behavioural approach will also help regulators in the financial education sector"--
