Over the last 70 years, Korea has experienced a rapid and remarkable transformation from a devastatingly poor nation to one of the world's leading advanced economies, achieving both sustained economic growth and a successful democracy. This pioneering work focuses on the key role of sustained investment in human capital behind Korea's phenomenal success. Human Capital and Development analyzes the importance of balancing diverse aspects of the educational system at different stages of development. The need to balance general and vocational education, top-down and bottom-up reform, as well as qualitative and quantitative expansion are highlighted. Adapting Korea's development experience to general principles shows that rather than seeking universal strategies and rules, the key to successful transformation is the provision of educational systems that can evolve over time depending on socio-economic and technological conditions for both developing and advanced countries.

This book also provides a useful reference for policy makers of advanced as well as developing countries in designing their education systems and policies
