Der Bildungsroman im literarischen Feld : neue Perspektiven auf eine Gattung
"The volume uses Bourdieu's theory of social fields to explore the emergence of the Bildungsroman as a genre from the 18th to the 21st century. The nine essays focus on one central novel to outline the literary field and the semantics of genre and describe the formation of concepts of the individual, Bildung, and society as well as positioning strategies in the field,including the choice of narrative techniques and forms for reproducing meaning."--
