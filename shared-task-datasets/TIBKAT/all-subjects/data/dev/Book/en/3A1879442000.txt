The Economics of restructuring and intervention
The Economics of Restructuring and Intervention carries forward the work of Marx, Kalecki, Keynes and Kaldor in analysing questions of growth, distribution and government intervention. It will be essential reading for all those wishing to understand the massive economic and political shifts as we enter the 1990s - the globalization of markets and production, continued growth of the Third World and East European debt, the emerging digital economy. Political debates thrown up by these economic, industrial and technological developments are subject to rigorous scrutiny and critique - from the employment effects of wage cuts to the calls for 'supply side socialism'
