Corporate social responsibility and business performance : theories and evidence about organizational responsibility
Does it pay for businesses to act morally? This book attempts to answer this question. Taking a positive approach, it demonstrates that, under certain conditions, organizations can act responsibly and profitably at the same time. It elaborates on these conditions and provides evidence for the assumed positive relation between responsibility and profitability. -- The author uses analysis of the acceptance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies across Europe, the consequences of CSR on motivation, commitment and absenteeism, and organizational responsibility and the bottom of the pyramid as evidence that organizations can be profitable and responsible at the same time. -- Uniquely taking an organizational perspective on CSR, scholars and students of business ethics will find this impressive book to be an invaluable resource. Business professionals will also find plenty of important information in this admirable compendium.
