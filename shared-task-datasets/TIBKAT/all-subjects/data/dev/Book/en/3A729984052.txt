Trade that Benefits the Environment and Development : Opening Markets for Environmental Goods and Services

In addition to explaining the background to the two earlier lists of environmental goods (stemming from separate efforts by the OECD and by the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum), the different chapters: Explore various practical issues related to the classification of environmental goods, including "dual use" goods. Provide concrete examples of synergies between trade in environmental services and environmental goods. Synthesise the findings of various country studies on environmental goods and services undertaken by the OECD and other inter-governmental organisations.
