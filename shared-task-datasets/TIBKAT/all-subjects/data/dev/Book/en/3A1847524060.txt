Special functions in fractional calculus and engineering
"Special functions play a very important role in solving various families of ordinary and partial differential equations as well as their fractional-order analogs which model real-life situations. Due to the non-local nature and memory effect, fractional calculus is capable of modeling many situations which arise in engineering. This book includes a collection of related topics associated with such equations and their relevance and significance in engineering. Special Functions in Fractional Calculus and Engineering highlights the significance and applicability of special functions in solving fractional-order differential equations with engineering applications. The book focuses on the non-local nature and memory effect of fractional calculus in modeling relevant to engineering science and covers a variety of important and useful methods using special functions for solving various types of fractional-order models relevant to engineering science. The book goes on to illustrate the applicability and usefulness of special functions by justifying their numerous and widespread occurrences in the solution of fractional-order differential, integral, and integrodifferential equations. The book holds a wide variety of interconnected fundamental and advanced topics with interdisciplinary applications that combine applied mathematics and engineering sciences. useful to graduate students, Ph.D. scholars, researchers, and educators interested in special functions, fractional calculus, mathematical modeling, and engineering"--
