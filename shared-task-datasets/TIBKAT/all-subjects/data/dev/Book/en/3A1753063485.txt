Theoretical Foundations of Radar Location and Radio Navigation
Introduction -- Section 1. Overview of Radiolocation And Radionavigation Systems -- Section 2. Radar System -- Section 3. Radio-Navigation System.
The book represents a study guide reciting theoretical basics of radar location and radio navigation systems of air and sea transport. This is the distinctive feature of this study guide. The study guide states the principal physics of radar location and radio navigation, main measuring methods of proper and relative movement parameters of an object, tactical and technical characteristics of radar location and radio navigation systems, including examining issues on radiofrequency signals detection and its parameters estimation against background and interference of different type, filtering, combined detection and rating of signals, signals resolution and classification. The structural and functioning principles of the current and advanced radar location and radio navigation systems of air and sea transport are represented in the study guide with an adequate completeness. The study guide features the result of years long lecturing on radar location and radio navigation theoretical courses at the Moscow State Technical University of Civil Aviation and G.I.Nevelskiy Maritime State Technical Academy. The study guide is designated for students of radio-engineering specialties in area of air and sea transport. The study guide can be useful for radio engineers working in the field of air and maritime transport, and for graduate students and academic researchers as well.
