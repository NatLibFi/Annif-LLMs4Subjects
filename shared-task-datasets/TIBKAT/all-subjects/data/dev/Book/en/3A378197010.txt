Piezoelectric transducers and applications
"Piezoelectric Transducers and Applications" provides a guide for graduate students and researchers to the current state-of-the- art of this complex and multidisciplinary area. The book fills an urgent need for a unified source of information on piezoelectric devices and their astounding variety of existing and emerging applications. Some of the chapters focus more on the basic concepts of the different disciplines involved and are presented in a didactic manner. Others go deeper into the complex aspects of specific fields of research, thus reaching the technical level of a scientific paper. Among other topics resonant sensors, especially bulk acoustic wave thickness shear mode resonators, chemical and bio-sensors , as well as broadband ultrasonic systems are treated in-depth.
