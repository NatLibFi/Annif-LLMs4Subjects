Ultrasonics : fundamentals, technologies and applications
"There have been significant advances in the science, the technology employed in commercial systems, and in both the scope and the range of applications of ultrasound since the second edition of this book was published in January 1988. The present edition includes discussion of many of these advances and improvements; additional figures and numerous new references are provided. In 1988 it became a requirement to write technical papers using SI (Standard International) units rather than British units. The parameters reported are now completely described by SI units: Meters now replace feet. Velocity is now in kilometers/sec. Frequency is in Hertz rather than cycles per second and so on. These up-dates and new material, combined with the core content developed for the 2nd edition make it, in effect, a new book"--
"The book provides a unique and comprehensive treatment of the science, technology, and applications for industrial and medical ultrasonics, including low and high power implementations. The discussion of applications is combined with the fundamental physics, the reporting of the sensors/transducers and systems for the full spectrum of industrial, nondestructive testing and medical/bio-medical uses. It includes citations of numerous references and covers both main stream and the more unusual and obscure applications of ultrasound"--
