Concrete : history and accounts
Concrete is decidedly the world's most important building material today. Approximately twice as much concrete is used each year compared with all other building materials combined. This book addresses the exciting history of concrete, from its humble beginnings, through ancient history and Roman times, up to modern-day concrete made of Portland cement. A number of specialist fields from the more recent history of concrete are treated in separate chapters. In the final chapter the author attempts to predict the future of this building material. The book is peppered with examples, accounts, and anecdotes from a number of countries. -- Product Description
