Probability, statistics and econometrics
Probability, Statistics and Econometrics provides a concise, yet rigorous, treatment of the field that is suitable for graduate students studying econometrics, very advanced undergraduate students, and researchers seeking to extend their knowledge of the trinity of fields that use quantitative data in economic decision-making. The book covers much of the groundwork for probability and inference before proceeding to core topics in econometrics. Authored by one of the leading econometricians in the field, it is a unique and valuable addition to the current repertoire of econometrics textbooks and reference books. --
