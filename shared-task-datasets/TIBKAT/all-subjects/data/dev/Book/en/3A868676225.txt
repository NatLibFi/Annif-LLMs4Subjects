Learn electronics with Raspberry Pi : physical computing with circuits, sensors, outputs, and projects
Getting started with electronic circuits -- All about Raspberry Pi -- Starting with the basics: programming with scratch -- Using Python for input and output: GPIO zero -- More input and output: infrared sensors and LCD displays -- Adding control in Python and Linux -- Creating video with a Pi camera -- Rolling forward: designing and building a robot -- Customize your gameplay: Minecraft hardware programming -- Making your circuits permanent -- Let the innovation begin: designing your own circuits
Learning electronics can be tremendous fun -- your first flashing LED circuit is a reason to celebrate! But where do you go from there, and how can you move into more challenging projects without spending a lot of money on proprietary kits? One excellent answer is Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi is everywhere, it's inexpensive, and it's a wonderful tool for teaching about electronics and programming. Learn Electronics with Raspberry Pi shows you how to make a variety of cool projects using the Pi with programming languages like Scratch and Python, with no experience necessary. You'll learn how the Pi works, how to work with Raspbian Linux on the Pi, and how to design and create electronic circuits. You'll then create projects like an arcade game, disco lights, and infrared transmitter, and an LCD display. You'll also learn how to control Minecraft's Steve with a joystick and how to build a Minecraft house with a Pi, and even how to control a LEGO train with a Pi. You'll even learn how to create your own robot, including how to solder and even design a printed circuit board! Learn how to design and build electronic circuits, and even how to make a PCB Learn how to make fun projects like an arcade game, a robot, and a Minecraft controller while learning about sensors and how devices talk to each other Get started programming the Pi with Scratch and Python
