Antiviral discovery for highly pathogenic emerging viruses
New antiviral drugs are urgently needed. Recent outbreaks caused by viruses with great epidemiological impact such as Zika, or extraordinary virulence such as Ebola, Nipah, Lassa, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever highlight the current lack of clinically proven vaccines and treatments for these potentially catastrophic agents. Antiviral Discovery for Highly Pathogenic Emerging Viruses comprehensively outlines the state of the art in antiviral drug discovery including identification of targets, screening strategies and the current pipeline of antiviral candidates including regulatory issues. The book also addresses the challenges faced in proceeding from pre-clinical studies to animal models and clinical trials with these highly pathogenic agents. Ideal for drug discovery scientists and medicinal chemists with an interest in antiviral drug discovery and development, this book provides a complete overview of the latest progress in the field, recent advances and the challenges that remain in developing these highly pathogenic agents. Illustrated throughout with case studies this book is a valuable resource in this complex and multidisciplinary field
