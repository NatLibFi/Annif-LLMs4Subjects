The Routledge handbook of migration and language
In the context of recent forms of globalization, migration has engendered profound social changes and challenged scholars to rethink their disciplinary constructs. The Routledge Handbook of Migration and Language surveys this controversial topic through: coverage of issues like identity, superdiversity, & citizenship and the role language plays in their definition and practice; analysis of migrant experiences in geographical and historical context; exploration of new research orientations; investigation of the place of language in citizenship, educational policies, employment, economy, and social services. This handbook is essential reading for those with an interest in migration studies
