Gwathmey Siegel : buildings and projects / ed. by Brad Collins. Gwathmey Siegel & Associates Architects ; 3: 2002 - 2012
"A sumptuous treatment of the architecture of modernist masters Charles Gwathmey and Robert Siegel, whose apartments, houses, and commercial buildings are gleaming beacons of clarity and refinement. Quintessential modernists, the principals of Gwathmey Siegel have championed an aesthetic that is at once refined and lyrical, and ultimately richly enticing. Clientele of the legendary firm includes a virtual who's who of the entertainment and business worlds, and with good reason, as vibrantly evidenced here. Rizzoli's third monograph on this distinguished New York firm presents the exquisite residential work for which the firm is so justifiably renowned--from private apartments and three residential skyscrapers in Manhattan to homes in Aspen, Colorado, a ranch in Texas, the new Setai Hotel on Fifth Avenue in New York, and the new W Hotel in downtown Manhattan. Also shown, and representing a large part of the firm's creative output of the last decade, are cultural and institutional works, notably the U.S. mission to the United Nations."--Amazon.com
