Solid mechanics
"This is a textbook for courses in departments of Civil and Mechanical Engineering commonly called strength of materials or mechanics of materials. The intent of this book is to provide a background in the mechanics of solids for students of mechanical engineering, while limiting the information on why materials behave as they do. It is assumed that the students have already had courses covering materials science and basic statics. Much of the material is drawn from another book by the author, Mechanical Behavior of Materials. To make the text suitable for Mechanical Engineers, the chapters on slip, dislocations, twinning, residual stresses and hardening mechanisms have been eliminated and the treatments in other chapters about of ductility viscoelasticity, creep, ceramics and polymers have been simplified"--Provided by publisher
