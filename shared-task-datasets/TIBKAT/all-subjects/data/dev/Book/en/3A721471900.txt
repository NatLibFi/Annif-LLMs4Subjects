Revolutions in twentieth-century physics
"The conceptual changes brought by modern physics are important, radical and fascinating, yet they are only vaguely understood by people working outside the field. Exploring the four pillars of modern physics - relativity, quantum mechanics, elementary particles and cosmology - this clear and lively account will interest anyone who has wondered what Einstein, Bohr, Schr√∂dinger and Heisenberg were really talking about. The book discusses quarks and leptons, antiparticles and Feynman diagrams, curved space-time, the Big Bang and the expanding Universe. Suitable for undergraduate students in non-science as well as science subjects, it uses problems and worked examples to help readers develop an understanding of what recent advances in physics actually mean"--
