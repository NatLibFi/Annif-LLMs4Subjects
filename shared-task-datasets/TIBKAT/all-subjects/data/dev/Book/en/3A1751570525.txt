People flow in buildings
"In this new book, vertical transportation devices will be described more from a software than a hardware perspective. The book will describe how to plan and design transportation systems to make passenger journeys pleasant and smooth in buildings. It illustrates measured passenger traffic profiles in different types of buildings and explains how elevator control systems and modern trends of building usage affect passenger service. Methods of measuring passenger journeys and utilization of this information in traffic planning are described. There are no simple equations to calculate passenger service levels. These are usually investigated and described by traffic simulation. Building traffic simulation includes modelling of building passenger traffic using agents, behavioural models and movement vertically and horizontally, and then modelling the impact of transportation equipment with their control systems. The book also provides a starting point for selection of proper transportation equipment for new buildings and for modernization or refurbishment, as well as utilizing simulated occupant evacuation times in elevator design. Energy consumption of transportation equipment will be briefly discussed"--
