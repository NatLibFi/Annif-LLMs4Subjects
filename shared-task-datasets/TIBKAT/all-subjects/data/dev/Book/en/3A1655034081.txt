Clinical Pre Computer Proforma for the International Computer Database for Radiation Exposure Case Histories
This book is a questionnaire to record case histories of the actue radiationsyndrome in a standardised way. Since the Acute radiation syndrome can be considered a rare disease it is deemed necessary to record all accessible case histories world-wide in a standardised form. This questionnaire provides the possibility to describe the signs, symptoms, and therapeutic approaches concerning the acute radiation syndrome. There are few if any comparably comprehensive publications on the acute effects in man of inadvertent exposure to ionising radiation. Completing and returning thequestionnaire gives access to the WHO database on the acute radiation syndrome currently built up in Moscow and Ulm. The data in the questionnaire and the database are similar in structure. The database will serve in case of future radiation accidents by providing comparable case histories and for scientific work on the acute radiation syndrome. The questionnaire reflects the conceptual database scheme. It is designed according to ergonomical guidelines and its use is explainedby examples
