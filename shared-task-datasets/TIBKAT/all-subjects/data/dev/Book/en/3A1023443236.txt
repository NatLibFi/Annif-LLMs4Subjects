International handbook of globalization and world cities
This Handbook offers an unrivalled overview of current research into how globalization is affecting the external relations and internal structures of major cities in the world. -- By treating cities at a global scale, it focuses on the ‘stretching’ of urban functions beyond specific place locations, without losing sight of the multiple divisions in contemporary world cities. The book firmly bases city networks in their historical context, critically discusses contemporary concepts and key empirical measures, and analyses major issues relating to world city infrastructures, economies, governance and divisions. The variety of urban outcomes in contemporary globalization is explored through detailed case studies.
