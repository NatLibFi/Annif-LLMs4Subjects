Gas-phase pyrolytic reactions : synthesis, mechanisms, and kinetics
"This book covers a chemical processing technique, gas-phase pyrolysis, that has garnered great interest in recent years and falls under the cover of green chemistry and benign synthetic methods. The book looks at all aspects of gas-phase pyrolysis: methodology and reactors, synthesis, reaction mechanisms, structure, kinetics, and applications. The author discusses combinations of pyrolytic reactors with physiochemical techniques, routes for and reactions for the synthesis of organic compounds, and the control of reaction rates. This is information not available elsewhere, and the book provides a physical organic chemistry and mechanistic perspective on the chemistry of thermal processes in the gas phase, which have many advantages over the corresponding reactions in condensed phase"--
