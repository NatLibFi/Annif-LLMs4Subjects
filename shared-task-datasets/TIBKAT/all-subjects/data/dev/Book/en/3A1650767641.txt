Codes and Turbo Codes
This book is devoted to one of the essential functions of modern telecommunications systems: channel coding or error correction coding. Its main topic is iteratively decoded algebraic codes, convolutional codes and concatenated codes. It also presents digital modulation with which channel coding is closely associated to make up the heart of the physical layer of telecommunications systems. The most important theoretical aspects are given, and the building of codes is detailed and justified. Decoding algorithms are developed and, whenever possible, accompanied by simulation results characteristic of their correcting power.The authors are researchers and lecturers recognised for their expertise in the field of encoding and decoding algorithms and associated circuits. Codes and Turbo Codes is intended both as a means for discovering the domain, a valuable source of information about the many techniques imagined since the mid-XXth century, and as a step towards addressing problems not yet entirely solved.
