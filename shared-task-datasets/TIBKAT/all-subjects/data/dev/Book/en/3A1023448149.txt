This comprehensive research review discusses seminal contributions that have increased our understanding of trade in Asia. Early debates centered on the advantages and disadvantages of joining the global economy as exporters to the high-income countries, while trade within Asia was of minor importance. Increasingly, however, trade spilled across Asian borders, and as production chains became more complex attention has shifted towards the organization of international trade within Asia and specifically the operation of global or regional value chains. The review examines the wider literature and will serve as a valuable resource for researchers, students and practitioners
