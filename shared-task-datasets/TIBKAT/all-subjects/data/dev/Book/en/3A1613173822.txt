The first part is dedicated to chapters dealing with conceptual and theoretical approaches to enhancing teaching and learning of International Business (IB) and International Management (IM) by the means of experiential learning, and foundational aspects of pedagogy and experiential learning. The second part contains specific applications of experiential learning in IB and IM. Each chapter in this section describes in detail one experiential learning project (e.g., X-Culture, Global Enterprise Experience, Export Odyssey, any other experiential projects which are used in IB and IM teaching)"--
