Directed quantities in electrodynamics
This monograph explores classical electrodynamics from a geometrical perspective with a clear visual presentation throughout. Featuring over 200 figures, readers will delve into the definitions, properties, and uses of directed quantities in classical field theory. With an emphasis on both mathematical and electrodynamic concepts, the author’s illustrative approach will help readers understand the critical role directed quantities play in physics and mathematics. Chapters are organized so that they gradually scale in complexity, and carefully guide readers through important topics. The first three chapters introduce directed quantities in three dimensions with and without the metric, as well as the development of the algebra and analysis of directed quantities. Chapters four through seven then focus on electrodynamics without the metric, such as the premetric case, waves, and fully covariant four-dimensional electrodynamics. Complementing the book’s careful structure, exercises are included throughout for readers seeking further opportunities to practice the material. Directed Quantities in Electrodynamics will appeal to students, lecturers, and researchers of electromagnetism. It is particularly suitable as a supplement to standard textbooks on electrodynamics.
