Global finance after the crisis : the United States, China and the new world order
Richard Iley and Mervyn Lewis have written an extremely useful book on the global economy since the Western financial crisis. Well-written, well-informed and easily accessible to non-economists, it offers much good sense about many questions, from the future of the renminbi to that of the United States. They wisely urge that, as China's rise continues, the United States should engage with China rather than resist it. This is a book full of good judgement that deserves a wide readership. Martin Jacques, author, When China Rules the World: The End of the Western World and the Birth of a New Global Order The interplay between the macro-economic imbalances, notably in the relationship between the USA and China, and the more micro-economic shortcomings of the Wests financial systems, particularly the lax regulation, forms the centre-piece of this excellently written book.

They tackle difficult-to-answer lines of enquiry such as: can zero interest rates and quantitative easing lift the advanced world back to growth, or will they be dragged down by the overhang of debt? Might costs on savers, retirees and distortions to the pattern of global financing render zero rates counter-productive? What issues face the BRICs? Could China as number one see the renminbi soon challenge the dollar and the euro as a major international currency? Providing a detailed analysis of the post-crisis world and the issues posed by the rise of China and emerging market economies relative to developed countries, this book will prove a stimulating account for academics, students and researchers in the  ...
