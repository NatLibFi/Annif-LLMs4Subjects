1. What is Clojure? -- 2. Data Structures and Syntax -- 3. Functional Programming -- 4. Sequences -- 5. Functions -- 6. Destructuring -- 7. Pattern Matching -- 8. Concurrency -- 9. Namespaces -- 10. Macros -- 11. Object Orientation -- 12. Leiningen -- 13. Command Line Applications -- Appendix A: Conventions -- Appendix B: Writing Clojure with Vim
Get up to speed with Clojure in this quick and practical primer. You'll learn the nuts and bolts of functional programming, data structures, sequences, destructuring, pattern matching, polymorphism, concurrency, conventions, and more. Author Mark McDonnell talks about organization with namespaces; how to change the language via macros; object-oriented programming; and creating command-line apps. Finally, he shows you how to write Clojure from shell languages and interfaces such as Vim.   After reading and using Quick Clojure, you'll come away with first-hand knowledge and advice on how to quickly adopt, use, and apply Clojure without all the theoretical baggage that bigger books can sometimes bring. You will: Work with data structures and their syntax  Discover OOP in Clojure with patterns, polymorphisms, pattern matching, and concurrency  Use conventions, organization, and namespaces in Clojure Create command-line apps  Build various Clojure projects with the Leiningen IDE tool and framework
