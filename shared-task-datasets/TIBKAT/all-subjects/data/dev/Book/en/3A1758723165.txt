Non-thermal processing technologies for the grain industry
"Food can rapidly spoil due to growth of microorganisms, and traditional methods of food preservation such as drying, canning, salting, curing, and chemical preservation can affect the quality of the food. Nowadays, various non-thermal processing techniques can be employed in grain processing industries to combat this. They include pulsed electric field processing, high pressure processing, ultrasonic processing, cold plasma processing, and more. Such techniques will satisfy consumer demand for delivering wholesome food products to the market. Non-Thermal Processing Technologies for the Grain Industry addresses these many new non-thermal food processing techniques that are used during grain processing and minimize microbial contamination and spoilage"--
