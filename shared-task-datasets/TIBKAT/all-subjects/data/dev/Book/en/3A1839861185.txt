Medicinal plants : their response to abiotic stress
This book provides a comprehensive overview of medicinal plants and their interaction with abiotic stress in terms of morphological, physiological, biochemical, and molecular variations, and explains the adaptation and tolerance mechanisms involved. It presents various mechanisms that become operative in medicinal plants to combat stressful situations. The book discusses the secondary metabolites and/or bioactive compounds produced in medicinal plants under abiotic stress conditions, and the use of biostimulants and/or phytoprotectants to alleviate the adverse effects of abiotic stresses on medicinal plants. Additionally, it is likely to address opportunities and challenges in molecular and omics studies of medicinal plants under abiotic stress conditions. Overall, the chapters are developed by eminent subject experts with due care and clarity and cover an up-to-date literature review with relevant illustrations. The book would cater to the need of graduate and post-graduate students, researchers as well as scientists, and may attract the attention of pharmaceutical companies/industrialists and health policymakers.
