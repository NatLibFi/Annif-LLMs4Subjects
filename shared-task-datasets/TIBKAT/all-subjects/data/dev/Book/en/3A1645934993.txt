Quantum Imaging
This book gives an overview of the latest progress in the domain of quantum imaging. It reflects three and a half years of research carried out by leading specialists in the area within the Quantum Imaging network, a research programme of the European Community. Quantum Imaging is a newly born branch of quantum optics that investigates the ultimate performance limits of optical imaging allowed by the laws of quantum mechanics. Using the methods and techniques from quantum optics, quantum imaging addresses the questions of image formation, processing and detection with sensitivity and resolution exceeding the limits of classical imaging.
