In the second edition of the International Handbook on Diversity Management at Work, Alain Klarsfeld and his co-editors have once again brought together an impressive group of authors to provide unique, timely, and valuable information regarding diversity management around the world. This will be my go-to source for learning how different countries are addressing diversity issues. The volume will be a very useful resource for scholars, policy-makers, consultants, and business leaders interested in diversity and equality.'--Bernardo M. Ferdman, Alliant International University, US and Editor, Diversity at Work: The Practice of Inclusion. 'An exemplary work, the second edition of this Handbook is extraordinary in its recognition of the complexities of diversity management under conditions of globalization.

Altogether the book excels in fulfilling its conceptual claims for understanding diversity management at work: contextually, relationally and dynamically.'--Marta B.

'This second edition contains 14 countries as opposed to 16 in the first edition, but is essentially different as it not only includes updates for the countries in common, but also six new ones including Australia, Finland, Japan, New Zealand, Nigeria and Russia. It is, therefore, essentially a complement to the first edition. The editors suggest that one of the most significant effects of globalization has been to widen the scope of diversity management as workforces are becoming more diverse, with migrants posing a particular challenge in some countries. Examination at national level is crucial as anti-discrimination legislation and its implementation vary from country to country, especially with respect to whether or not positive discrimination is a feature. Above all the picture is changing over time. Hence the need for this new edition.'--Peter J. Sloane, Swansea University, UK and Flinders University, Australia. 'By covering the diversity practices in 14 different countries this Handbook makes evident the need to consider diversity management from a global and local standpoint.
