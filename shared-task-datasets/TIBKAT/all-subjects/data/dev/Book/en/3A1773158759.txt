Stability analysis and control of powertrain for new energy vehicles
This book introduces the application of nonlinear dynamics theory for driving system of electric vehicle and hybrid electric vehicle respectively. It establishes the dynamic models for driving system of electric vehicle and hybrid electric vehicle under various working conditions. And the nonlinear dynamics theory is applied to the qualitative analysis and quantitative calculation for the models. The theoretical analysis results are applied to guide the optimization of control strategies. In the end of each chapter, corresponding simulations or experiments are provided to verify the corresponding instances which are carefully selected. This book will give some guidance to readers when they deal with nonlinear dynamics problems of vehicles in the future and provide theoretical bases for the further study of the nonlinear dynamics for driving system of electric vehicle and hybrid electric vehicle. The book is written for engineer of electric vehicle and hybrid vehicle, teachers and students majoring in automobile and automation.
