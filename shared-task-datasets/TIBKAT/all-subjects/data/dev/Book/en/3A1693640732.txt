Wireless automation as an enabler for the next industrial revolution
"To address these issues, the fifth generation of mobile communications (5G) proposes to meet the industrial wireless automation requirements through the ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) services. Integrating the 5G URLLC with the machine learning and artificial intelligence solutions will result in proactive anomaly detection followed up by self-healing enabled by a reliable feedback control loop. The book is presented in a way that it gradually builds on the knowledge introduced in the previous chapters thus providing a seamless integration of various topics"--
