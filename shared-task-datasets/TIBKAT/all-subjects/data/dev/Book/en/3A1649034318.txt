Fecal Incontinence : Diagnosis and Treatment
Fecal incontinence is a frequent, distressing condition that has a devastating impact on patients' lives. However, patients are typically embarrassed and reluctant to acknowledge this disability, so they relinquish the possibility of being cured and remain socially isolated. Since fecal incontinence may result from various pathophysiological situations, an accurate diagnostic work-up of each patient is fundamental. Today, a wide range of therapeutic options is available, but making the correct choice is pivotal to the successful management of this condition. This book is aimed at all physicians involved in the assessment and treatment of fecal incontinence. Its main purpose is to review the latest advances in the epidemiologic, socio-economic, psychologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic aspects of fecal incontinence, in order to establish guidelines for effective treatment.
