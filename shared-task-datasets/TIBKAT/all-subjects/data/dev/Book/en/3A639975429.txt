Multi-gigabit microwave and millimeter-wave wireless communications
Annotation, For decades, microwave radios in the 6 to 50 GHz bands have been providing wireless communications. Recently, newer technologies at the 60 to 100 GHz mm-wave bands have taken advantage of new wireless regulations that are designed to enable ultra-high capacity communications. Exploring this exciting area in depth, this cutting-edge resource offers the latest details on multigigabit wireless communications. The book places emphasis on practical use and applications, but also provides a thorough explanation of important technological underpinnings to give readers a complete understanding of subject. Professionals find clear guidance on system design and link planning, helping them to determine performance levels given the physical limitations of operating in these frequency bands. Supported with over 50 illustrations, the book covers a wide range of critical topics, from the high frequency electromagnetic spectrum and high data rate mm-wave radios, to wireless link margins and path profiling--
