"Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) is an important method that is used across many disciplines for exploring spatial heterogeneity and modeling local spatial processes. This book serves as definitive guide to local regression modeling and the analysis of spatially varying processes, a very cutting-edge, hands-on, and innovative resource. The authors start with the basic ideas and fundamentals of local spatial modeling followed by a detailed discussion of scale issues and statistical inference related to MGWR. A comprehensive guide to free, user-friendly, software for MGWR is also provided, as well as an analysis of the 2020 US Presidential election"--
