European cinema in the twenty-first century : discourses, directions and genres
"This book articulates a way of rethinking the study of European cinema that centres on students and their needs, in an accessible and comprehensive monograph introducing film students to the main discourses, directions and genres of twenty-first century European Cinema. Importantly, this collection is the first of its kind to apply a transversal approach to European cinema, bringing together the East and the West, while providing a broad picture of key trends, aesthetics, genres, national identities, and transnational concerns. Lewis and Cannings collection effectively addresses some of the most pressing questions in contemporary European Cinema, such as ecology, migration, industry, identity, disability, memory, auteurship, genre, small cinemas, and the national and international contexts which underpin them. This book makes a strong contribution to our understanding of recent European Cinema, while providing an invaluable resource for lecturers and students across a variety of film-centred modules."--
