We are the revolutionists : German-speaking immigrants & American abolitionists after 1848
Entanglement is certain : 1848 and the challenge to American slavery -- A firm phalanx of iron souls : free men on Texas soil -- The only freedom-loving people of this city : exiles and emanicpators in Cincinnati -- Why continue to be the humble maid? : a transnational abolitionist sisterhood -- Let us break every yoke : Boston's radical democracies -- A revolution half accomplished : building nations, forgetting emancipation
