Rhetorik und Metarhetorik in Aufkl√§rung und Romantik : Theorie und Praxis der "Beredsamkeit" bei Gottsched, Wieland und in der Romantik
"The work examines transformations of rhetoric in the Enlightenment and Romantic periods. From a problem-historical point of view, first Gottsched and his critique in Wieland's Agathon are investigated, followed by an examination of Romantic rhetoric--especially with A. W. Schlegel and Schelling--their understanding of the autonomy of art and the relationship between orality and writing."--Publisher's website
