Applications of Computer Vision in Automation and Robotics
This book presents recent research results related to various applications of computer vision methods in the widely understood contexts of automation and robotics. As the current progress of image analysis applications may be easily observed in various areas of everyday life, it becomes one of the most essential elements of development of Industry 4.0 solutions. Some of the examples, partially discussed in individual chapters, may be related to the visual navigation of mobile robots and drones, monitoring of industrial production lines, non-destructive evaluation and testing, monitoring of the IoT devices or the 3D printing process and the quality assessment of manufactured objects, video surveillance systems, and decision support in autonomous vehicles
