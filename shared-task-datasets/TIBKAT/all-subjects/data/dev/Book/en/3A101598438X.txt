Culture, discourse, and the workplace
"Culture, Discourse, and the Workplace adds new theoretical and methodological insights into the complex relationship between language, culture, and identity in professional settings. Examining the politics of language use at work and via a critical sociolinguistic approach, this book: - Utilises three case studies from institutional and business contexts to provide a unique illustration of participants' roles and negotiating membership within the business meeting; - Questions essentialist meanings of culture and the ways in which they constitute a powerful resource for employees to perpetuate or challenge the status quo in their professional setting; - Includes a core section on methodology for the Workplace Discourse researcher as well as a section dedicated to FAQs and a worked example on data analysis; - Provides future directions for Workplace Sociolinguistics as a field and makes a case for holistic research and multidisciplinary enquiry. Culture, Discourse, and the Workplace constitutes a key resource for students and teachers of Intercultural Communication and ESP and will also be of significant interest to researchers in the fields of workplace studies and business interaction"--
