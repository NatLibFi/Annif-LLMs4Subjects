Mixed Boundary Problems in Solid Mechanics
The book covers a wide range of subjects and techniques related to mixed boundary problems of elasticity from basic concepts to special techniques that are unlikely to appear in traditional university graduate courses. This book may also be of interest to industrial researchers who encounter defects such as cracks and inclusions of different materials in mechanisms under different localization and type of loading. So the topics present the application of mathematical mechanics of solid bodies notably in elasticity, showing the interconnection of elasticity and temperature that would normally treated independently. Theoretical and experimental results are expected to be useful for researchers investigating a wide range of materials including metals, composites, ceramics, polymers, biomaterials and nanomaterials under different mechanical and temperature loading. The aim of the book is to introduce an interdisciplinary audience to a variety of stress state phenomena occurring in elasticity near defects and edges of the bodies. The book is aimed at researchers, primarily but not exclusively graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, specialists from Aerospace and Civil Engineering, Materials Science, and Engineering Mechanics and should naturally also be of interest to specialists of Physics and Applied Mathematics.
