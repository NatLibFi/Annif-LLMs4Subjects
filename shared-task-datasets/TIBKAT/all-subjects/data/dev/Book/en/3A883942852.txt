Form und Funktion : Festschrift f√ºr Angelika Redder zum 65. Geburtstag
Form and function are basic categories for dealing with language and the various forms of linguistic action in discourse and text. These categories as well as the directions of inquiry and phenomena arising from their application are dealt with in diverse ways in this volume. The relationship between form, function and meaning is just as much an object as literary forms and functions, varieties or the knowledge made available to the listener or reader via the form. In its thematic and disciplinary plurality, the volume is intended to honor the scientific work of Angelika Redderon the occasion of her 65th birthday
