Compact Riemann Surfaces : An Introduction to Contemporary Mathematics
Although Riemann surfaces are a time-honoured field, this book is novel in its broad perspective that systematically explores the connection with other fields of mathematics. It can serve as an introduction to contemporary mathematics as a whole as it develops background material from algebraic topology, differential geometry, the calculus of variations, elliptic PDE, and algebraic geometry. It is unique among textbooks on Riemann surfaces in including an introduction to Teichm√ºller theory. The analytic approach is likewise new as it is based on the theory of harmonic maps
