Practical MMIC design
Monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) are used in a host of electronics from cellular phones and global positioning systems to missile systems and radar. They are prized for their high performance and reliability, but they can be costly and highly difficult to produce. Proper design is the key to minimizing these problems. This practical resource is filled with real-world design techniques and rules of thumb that engineers can use on the job everyday to decrease costs and improve production quality. Emphasizing practice over theory, this handy reference is filled with photos of real
