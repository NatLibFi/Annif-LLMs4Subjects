From Classical Field Theory to Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
Classical field theory -- Deformation quantization of the free theory -- Perturbative quantum field theory -- Symmetries â€“ the Master Ward Identity -- Quantum electrodynamics
This book develops a novel approach to perturbative quantum field theory: starting with a perturbative formulation of classical field theory, quantization is achieved by means of deformation quantization of the underlying free theory and by applying the principle that as much of the classical structure as possible should be maintained. The resulting formulation of perturbative quantum field theory is a version of the Epstein-Glaser renormalization that is conceptually clear, mathematically rigorous and pragmatically useful for physicists. The connection to traditional formulations of perturbative quantum field theory is also elaborated on, and the formalism is illustrated in a wealth of examples and exercises
