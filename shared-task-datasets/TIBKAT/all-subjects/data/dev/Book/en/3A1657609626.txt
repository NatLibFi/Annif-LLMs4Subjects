The SAGE handbook of sociology, work and employment
This is a landmark collection of original contributions by leading specialists from around the world. The coverage is both comprehensive and comparative (in terms of time and space) and each 'state of the art' chapter provides a critical review of the literature combined with some thoughts on the direction of research.
