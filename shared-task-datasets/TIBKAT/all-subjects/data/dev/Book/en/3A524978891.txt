Control Theory and Terminology -- Pneumatic Control Devices -- Electric and Electronic Control Devices -- Fluidic Control Devices -- Flow Control Devices -- Elementary Control Systems -- Complete Control Systems -- Electric Control Systems -- Special Control -- Digital and Supervisory Control Systems -- Psychrometrics -- Central Plant Pumping and Distribution Systems -- Retrofit of Existing Control Systems -- Dynamic Response and Tuning.
Control Systems for Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning, Sixth Edition is complete and covers both hardware control systems and modern control technology. The material is presented without bias and without prejudice toward particular hardware or software. Readers with an engineering degree will be reminded of the psychrometric processes associated with heating and air conditioning as they learn of the various controls schemes used in the variety of heating and air conditioning system types they will encountered in the field. Maintenance technicians will also find the book useful because it describes various control hardware and control strategies that were used in the past and are prevalent in most existing heating and air conditioning systems. Designers of new systems will find the fundamentals described in this book to be a useful starting point, and they will also benefit from descriptions of new digital technologies and energy management systems. This technology is found in modern building HVAC system designs.
