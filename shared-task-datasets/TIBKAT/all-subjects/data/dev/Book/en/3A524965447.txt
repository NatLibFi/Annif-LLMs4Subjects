Monitors of Organic Chemicals in the Environment : semipermeable membrane devices
The information contained in this book will be of interest to all scientists involved in research concerning environmental contaminants. In addition, natural resource managers and regulatory agencies will greatly benefit from an awareness of this technology and its application to monitoring, exposure assessment and mitigation/remediation of environmental pollution. Also, as the passive, integrative sampling approach gains use in the environmental sciences (one of the authors, J.D. Petty, teaches a graduate level course at the University of Missouri which covers this technology as an integral party of the course), we envision that the book has potential for use as a text in graduate level courses.
