Cellulose: molecular and structural biology : selected articles on the synthesis, structure, and applications of cellulose
Cellulose: Molecular and Structural Biology is an up-to-date treatise on the most advanced and provocative research into the biosynthesis, structure, and applications of Nature s most abundant macromolecule and renewable resource, cellulose. Molecular, biochemical, and evolutionary aspects of cellulose biosynthesis are reviewed in a variety of living organisms, including cyanobacteria, eubacteria, (Acetobacter, Salmonella, and E. coli), vascular plants (including Arabidopsis, forest trees, and maize), and tunicates. Phylogenetic analysis, molecular genetics, and the potential for metabolic engineering are also presented. Novel structural approaches include the macromolecular structure of the synthesizing units, the terminal complexes as well as the cellulose product in its many forms are also included. Novel applications using cellulose include smart materials, carbonised cellulose, and biomedical applications. First hand information from the leading researchers distinguishes this work from other books on cellulose.
