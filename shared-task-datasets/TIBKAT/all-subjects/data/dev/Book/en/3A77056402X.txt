Research-based learning in teacher training in South Africa and Germany : a contrastive analysis
Student teachers seem to experience theory and practice of teaching more and more as contradicting and incompatible after they have come in contact with the practical part during internships or their preparatory in-service teacher phase. What are strengths, weaknesses and prospects of team - respectively action research at the University of Oldenburg to promote the interlocking of theory and practice? A comparison with the action research approach used at the partner university in Port Elizabeth is to shed light on this question. The evaluation of sources as e.g. the theoretical concepts of the action research approaches, final papers and interviews with participants was to help with the analysis to find answer to the question. The prefaces look at action research in South Africa and Germany emphasizing the mutual benefits of a discussion concerning the use of action research in teacher training. <engl.>
