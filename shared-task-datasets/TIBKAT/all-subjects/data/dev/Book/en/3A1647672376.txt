Synchronization : From Simple to Complex
Focuses on the fundamental phenomenon in physics - synchronization that occurs in coupled non-linear dissipative oscillators. This work aims to demonstrate that the complexity of synchronous patterns of real oscillating system can be described in the framework of the general approach
