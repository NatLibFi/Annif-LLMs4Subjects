Artificial neural network-based designs of prestressed concrete and composite structures
"This book introduces artificial neural network-based Lagrange optimization techniques for structural design in prestressed concrete based on Eurocode 2 and composite structures based on American Institute of Steel Construction and American Concrete Institute standards. ANN-based design charts show how to use the Lagrange multiplier method to optimize multi-objective functions for the design of a post-tensioned beam, composite columns encasing H-shaped steel sections subjected to biaxial loads, composite beams, and the concrete and reinforcing steel portions of a composite structure. Robust design charts for both prestressed concrete and composite structures are also provided"--
