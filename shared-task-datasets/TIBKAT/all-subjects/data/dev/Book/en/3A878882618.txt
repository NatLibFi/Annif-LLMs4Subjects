Underground gas storage facilities : design and implementation
Weather patterns. Load forecasting. Load curves. Gas laws. The components of a gas storage facility. Characteristics of underground storage. Optimization of underground storage facilities. Monitoring and control of inventory. Pressure measurements of reservoirs. Metering. Dehydration. Compressors. Estimating deliverability of producing wells. Automation. Appendixes. - You get information needed to evaluate a reservoir, determine the particular requirements of the job, and design a storage facility that will operate at its full potential. Underground Gas Storage Facilities combines background information with a systematic approach for examining a specific reservoir to determine the most appropriate day-to-day method of operation. It presents a thorough discussion of topics such as estimating customer requirements, types of storage, sizing of surface facilities, and estimating deliverability. Of particular interest is the section on the economics of storage design, which examines the specific cost factors involved and presents examples to determine an economically optimum design. Information and technical tools to evaluate a reservoir Determine the particular requirements of the job at hand Design a storage facility that will operate at its full potential
