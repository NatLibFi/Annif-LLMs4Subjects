Simulation
"In formulating a stochastic model to describe a real phenomenon, it used to be that one compromised between choosing a model that is a realistic replica of the actual situation and choosing one whose mathematical analysis is tractable. That is, there did not seem to be any payoff in choosing a model that faithfully conformed to the phenomenon under study if it were not possible to mathematically analyze that model. Similar considerations have led to the concentration on asymptotic or steady-state results as opposed to the more useful ones on transient time. However, the relatively recent advent of fast and inexpensive computational power has opened up another approach--namely, to try to model the phenomenon as faithfully as possible and then to rely on a simulation study to analyze it"--
