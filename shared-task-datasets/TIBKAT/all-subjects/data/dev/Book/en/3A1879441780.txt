Market, state, and feminism : the economics of feminist policy
Market, State and Feminism offers an inter-disciplinary critique of the 'free market backlash' - the belief that free market economics can improve the position, status and well-being of women. The authors argue that, far from being restrictive and intrusive, state action can enhance the individual's ability to make responsible choices. This book questions the philosophical basis of free market feminism, challenging its masculine assumptions about rationality and individualism. The authors critically examine the theoretical validity of dichotomising the market versus the state and draw attention to the richness of the interdependence between markets and state institutions. Empirical and case study material is drawn from the UK, the European Union and the United States and illuminates the issues of equal employment opportunities and pay, girls' education performance, business attitudes to women, lobbying by women's groups and equal opportunities legislation
