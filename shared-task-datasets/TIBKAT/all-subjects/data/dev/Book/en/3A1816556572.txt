Charles Prosper Wolff Schoemaker & Vincent Van Romondt : modernism and national characteristics
In this booklet, the architectural theorist and Professor at York University Abidin Kusno discusses two lectures given by two influential professors in the former Dutch colony of Indonesia. The first one, 'The aesthetics of architecture and the art of the moderns', was given by C. Wolff Schoemaker in 1930. The second, entitled 'Towards an Indonesian Architecture', was delivered by Vincent Van Romondt in 1954. Schoemaker and Van Romondt held different views on the challenges of architecture in the world as well as in Indonesia. They nevertheless both sought to bring the notion of modernism and tradition into the context of their time. The lectures are published here for the first time in English
