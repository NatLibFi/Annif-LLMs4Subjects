An architecture of parts : architects, building workers and industrialization in Britain 1940-1970
"Providing a new perspective on post-war reconstruction in Britain, this book examines the social context of the construction industry in the immediate post-war period and culminating in the industrialised building boom of the 1960s and 70s. It explores policy changes in education, training and employment in relation to the experience of work for both architects and building workers, demonstrating the extreme separation of design from production, the factor cited in the Emmerson Report of 1962 as a major contributor to the failure of the British building industry to fully modernise. Christine Wall charts the erosion of the elusive and tenuous link between designers and builders and its residual presence in the discourse of skill through an examination of changes in education and training, and examines competing architectural positions on standardisation and dimensional co-ordination in building. Using analysis of visual, oral and documentary material An Architecture of Parts offers a compelling analysis of architecture, construction and the uneasy relationship between them in post-War Britain"--
