Introduction to wine laboratory practices and procedures
With the rapid growth of the wine industry, it has become increasingly important for not only the enologist and wine maker, but also cellar and laboratory staff to perform the routine wine making duties. Written by a practitioner with hands-on experience in the field, Introduction to Wine Laboratory Practices and Procedures provides a step-by-step guide on performing these essential tasks. Gently easing the reader into the more advanced concepts and analysis, the book covers vineyard sampling to bottling with sections on chemistry, safety, quality control, and general wine education. It's a must have for entry level wine chemists and enologists; students in junior college programs; small and large wineries; professional and home wine makers; winery production staff; or anyone wanting to learn about winemaking in an easy to understand format.
