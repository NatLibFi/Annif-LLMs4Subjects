Berlin transfer - hybrid modernities
"Berlin Transfer - Hybrid Modernities uses a sensorial reading of Brazilian modernism to challenge the generic, if not austere, appeal of Berlin's modernist housing complexes. By applying strategies of extension, insertion and reprogramming to prevalent structures, the book combines generic urban prototypes from the post-war era with the untapped qualities of visionary modernism, using urban interventions to reveal new potentials for existing spaces."--
