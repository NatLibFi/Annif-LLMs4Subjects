Molecular food microbiology
"The elucidation of DNA double helix in 1953 and the publication of DNA cloning protocol in 1973 have put wings under the sail of molecular biology, which has since quietly revolutionized many fields of biological science, including food microbiology. Exploiting the power and versatility of molecular technologies, molecular food microbiology extends and greatly improves on phenotypically based food microbiology, leading to the development of better diagnostics for foodborne infections and intoxications, and contributing to the design of more effective therapeutics and prophylaxes against foodborne diseases. Forming part of the Food Microbiology series, Molecular Food Microbiology provides a state of art coverage on molecular techniques applicable to food microbiology. While the introductory chapter contains an overview on the principles of current DNA, RNA and protein techniques and discusses their utility in helping solve practical problems that food microbiology is facing now and in the future, the remaining chapters present detailed moleuclar analyses of selective foodborne viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites. With contributions from international scientists involved in molecular food microbiology research, this book constitutes an informative textbook for undergraduates and postgraduates majoring in food, medical, and veterinary microbiology; represents an indispensable guide for food, medical, and veterinary scientists engaged in molecular food microbiology research and development; and offers a contemporary update for scholars and educators trying to keep in touch with the latest developments in molecular food microbiology"--
