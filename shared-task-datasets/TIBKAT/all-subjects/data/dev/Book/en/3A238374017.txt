A historical guide to world slavery
Surveys the field of study with more than 100 concise and informative essays supported by detailed biographies and illustrations. Eminent scholars provide an overview of what we now know about slavery as an institution and way of life in cultures around the globe from ancient times to the present day. Drawing on the virtual explosion of empirical research and theoretical discussion of the subject over the past thirty years, many of the articles overturn conventional wisdom and illuminate little-known aspects of the subject, with essays on topics such as concubinage, eunuchs, occupational mobility. Edited by Seymour Drescher, Professor of History, University of Pittsburgh, and Stanley L. Engerman, Munro Professor of Economics, University of Rochester.
