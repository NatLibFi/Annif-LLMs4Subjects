Universality of Nonclassical Nonlinearity : Applications to Non-Destructive Evaluations and Ultrasonic
Divided into three parts, this work defines the concept of Nonclassical Nonlinearity (NCNL) and its universality, and reviews several fields to which it may apply. It also describes the phenomenology, theory, modelling and virtual experiments (simulations); and discusses some of the relevant experimental techniques and applications
