The importance of long-term financing by banks : advantages and future challenges
Long-term financing plays an important part in calming the markets and thus ensuring the stability of economies. The German market for residential real estate financing provides an impressive example of this. However, new financial market regulations such as Basel III and Solvency II will cause the market for long-term financing to contract, as banks will be incentivised to grant more short-term loans. Other financial intermediaries such as insurance companies or funds are unlikely to be able to close this gap. Although alternative financial intermediaries will increase their lending due to advantages in regulation, they will be unable to eliminate the shortage of long-term financing, owing to a lack of experience and incentives. The regulatory framework must therefore be adapted to make the banking sector more robust while simultaneously allowing it to continue to fulfil its original economic functions.
