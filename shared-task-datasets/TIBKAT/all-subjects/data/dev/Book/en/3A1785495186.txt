Modified clay and zeolite nanocomposite materials : environmental and pharmaceutical applications
Modified Clay and Zeolite Nanocomposite Materials: Environmental and Pharmaceutical Applications retraces the most important knowledge gaps that the scientific community is facing, including a drawback of real-world applications. This valuable resource explores the novel applications of this group of nanomaterials that can be suitably surface-modified to obtain properties that can be applied in environmental and pharmaceutical fields. For example, modification with surfactants has given new motivation to the study of these materials by producing an inversion in the ion exchange behavior from cationic to anionic. This strategy has paved the way for new uses highlighted in this timely resource. Explores the combination of both minerals (clay and zeolite) together, with their application in two broad areas of emerging researchExplains better utilization and applications for modified clay and zeolite through detailed comparative studiesConsolidates information on the modification and tuning of clay and zeolite materials for novelty applicationsHelps users in the selection of materials, surface features, and other functionalization for diverse applications
