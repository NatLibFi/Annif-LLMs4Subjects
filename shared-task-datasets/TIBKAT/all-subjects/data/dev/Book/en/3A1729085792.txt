Chloride-induced steel corrosion in concrete under service loads
This book summarizes the latest advances in understanding chloride ingress and steel corrosion in concrete under service loads. Unlike the existing literature, it focuses specifically on the effect of service loads on chloride-induced durability issues in reinforced concrete structures. It discusses how service loads affect the moisture and chloride penetration rate, corrosion kinetics and rust distribution, as well as the structural performance of concrete components (e.g. beams and columns) in a systematic and hierarchical way. Given its scope, the book is chiefly intended for researchers and industry practitioners in structural engineering, particularly those whose work involves the durability design of concrete structures.
