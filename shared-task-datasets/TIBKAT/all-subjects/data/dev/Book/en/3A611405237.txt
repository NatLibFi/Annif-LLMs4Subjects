The art of being a scientist : a guide for graduate students and their mentors
"This is a hands-on guide for graduate students and other young researchers wishing to perfect the practical skills that are needed for a successful career in research. By teaching junior scientists to develop effective research habits, the book helps make the experience of graduate study a more efficient, effective and rewarding one. Many graduate students learn these skills "on the job", often by doing them poorly at first, with the result that much valuable time can be lost; this book will help prevent that. The authors have taught a graduate course on the topics covered in this book for many years, and provide a sample curriculum for instructors in graduate schools who wish to teach a similar course. ... The wealth of advice offered in this book is invaluable to students, junior researchers and their mentors in all fields of science, engineering and the humanities."--Book jacket
