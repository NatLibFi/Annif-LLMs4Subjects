Aromatic C(sp2)-H dehydrogenative coupling reactions : heterocycles synthesis
"This comprehensive text covers the research and development trends in the growing field of aromatic C-H dehydrogenative coupling reactions, leading to different types of heyterocycles. The author provides answers to how this coupling reaction occurs, what kinds of heterocycles are synthesized, and what its advantages are. The palladium, rhodium, iridium, copper, cobalt, ruthenium and ferric catalyzed aromatic C(sp2)-H dehydrogenative cross-coupling reactions are described in detail. A useful reference source for researchers and graduates in the field of heterocyclic chemistry and transition metal catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling reactions"--
