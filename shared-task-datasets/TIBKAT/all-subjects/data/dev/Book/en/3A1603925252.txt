European state aid law : a commentary
Présentation de l'éditeur : "The regulation of State Aid belongs to the core areas of European Union law. Without the general prohibition of state subsidies to undertakings, competitiveness would be distorted and the benefits of the internal market would be put in jeopardy. This book deals systematically article-by-article with the basic principles, the proceedings, and the implementation of State Aid law as laid down in Articles 107 to 109 TFEU, as well as the general block exemptions regulation (Regulation No 800/2008) and the Council Regulation ((EC) No 659/1999) laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 TEC. Further, this commentary deals in detail with the rules regulating State Aid in specific sectors such as telecommunication, postal services, broadcast and television, energy/coal, banking, railroads, road transport, shipping, air traffic/airports, automotive industry, shipbuilding, steel, housing, agriculture, fishery, culture/tourism/sport and health
