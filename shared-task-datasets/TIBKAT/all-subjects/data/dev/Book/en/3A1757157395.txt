Functional materials for next-generation rechargeable batteries
"This book starts with principles and fundamentals of lithium rechargeable batteries, followed by their designs and assembly. The book then focuses on the recent progress in the development of advanced functional materials, as both cathode and anode, for next-generation rechargeable batteries such as lithium-sulfur, sodium-ion, and zinc-ion batteries. One of the special features of this book is that both inorganic electrode materials and organic materials are included to meet the requirement of high energy density and high safety of future rechargeable batteries. In addition to traditional non-aqueous rechargeable batteries, detailed information and discussion on aqueous batteries and solid-state batteries are also provided"--
