Transforming industrial policy for the digital age : production, territories and structural change
Transforming Industrial Policy for the Digital Age argues that digital globalization is inducing deep and productive transformations, making industrial policy necessary in order to reorientate development towards inclusive and more sustainable growth. It demonstrates that industrialization remains an important development process for emerging economies. Featuring contributions by leading scholars, this timely book unpacks the dynamics of 'Industry 4.0', including computer-based algorithms, integration with cloud computing, and the Internet of Things. As existing global value chains take advantage of the new technologies to reorganize production, the contributors explore the implications of new industrial policies, and to what extent they have promoted structural changes that maintain sustainability. This book reflects on the lessons that can be drawn from the history of national industrial policies from across the globe, covering the successes and failures of national policy in promoting industry in response to productive transformations in industrial organization. Insightful and nuanced, this book will benefit scholars of both economics and industrial public policy. International experts and policy-makers will also appreciate this book's critical insight into the transformative shifts in global industrial organization and policies
