Protein phosphatases : with 15 tables
This book provides an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of protein phosphatase research, a rapidly evolving field with increasing importance in our understanding of the molecular basis of cell biology and of pathological processes. The book covers dephosphorylation processes involving serine/threonine, as well as tyrosine and histidine residues, and aims to be a useful resource for both the advanced reader as well as the newcomer to the field. It is also valuable for those working in the pharmaceutical and Biotech industries.
