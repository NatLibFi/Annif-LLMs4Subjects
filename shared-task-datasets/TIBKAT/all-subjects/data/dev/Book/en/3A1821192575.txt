New relativity in the gravitational universe : the theory of cosmic relativity and its experimental evidence
The Paradigm of Cosmic Relativity and Its Evidence -- Space and Time of Our Fundamental Theories -- Electrodynamics, Light and Relativity -- The Special Theory of Relativity and its Empirical Foundations -- Simultaneity and the Synchronization of Time -- The Equivalence Principles -- Einsteinâ€™s General Theory of Relativity.
Our vast Universe is filled with an enormous amount of matter and energy, which are the source of large gravitational potentials affecting all physical phenomena. Because this fact about the size and contents of the Universe was not known when our fundamental theories of dynamics and relativity were completed by the 1920s, the current theories - based as they are in empty space - fail to incorporate cosmic gravity. Though the current theories are consistent with the majority of empirical facts, there are some crucial discrepancies, which demand a drastic shift to a cosmic gravitational paradigm for the theories of relativity and dynamics. The book is a detailed and widely accessible account of this paradigm, called Cosmic Relativity, supported by ample empirical evidence. It is established that all motional relativistic effects are cosmic gravitational effects. The new theory of Cosmic Relativity solves and answers all outstanding questions and puzzles about dynamics and relativity.
