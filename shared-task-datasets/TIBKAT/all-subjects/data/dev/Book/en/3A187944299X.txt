The economics of digital markets
This innovative book provides state-of-the-art analyses of the current condition of the economics of digital markets. The most recent developments in web technology are evolving, creating an increasingly deregulated environment. Much of the impetus for liberalisation is in response to multimedia convergence and the globalisation of markets, leading to uncertainties in the sector. Gary Madden and Russel Cooper examine the microeconomics of platform structure and firm competition within and between digital markets, modern theoretical treatments of regulatory intervention in digital markets and the consideration of forward-looking experimental analysis of demand for yet-to-be provided services. Bringing together a highly focused group of eminent scholars, this book will appeal to academics, postgraduate students, and both international treaty and national government agencies as well as market analysts
