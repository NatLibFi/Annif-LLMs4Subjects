Cold hibernated elastic memory structure : self-deployable technology and its applications
"Cold hibernated elastic memory (CHEM) is a smart material technology that uses shape memory polymers in open cellular (foam) structures. CHEM foams are self-deployable and use the foam's elastic recovery plus their shape memory to erect structures. This book describes CHEM self-deployable structure technology, provides basic property data and characteristics, discusses advantages over other deployable structures, and identifies potential space, commercial, and biomedical applications, including medical devices such as stents for use in endovascular treatment of aneurysms, deployable thermal insulation, and self-repairing bumpers"--
