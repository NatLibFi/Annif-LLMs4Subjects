Presents a series of interventions and inventions of urban space between the years 1880 and 1930 in key literary texts of the period.

"Writing London: Inventions of the City" stages a series of interventions and inventions of urban space between the years 1880 and 1930 in key literary texts of the period. Making sharp distinctions between modernity and modernism, the volume reassesses the city as a series of singular sites irreducible to stable identities, whilst also offering a cogent re-evaluation of motifs of the nocturnal and the suburban in the literary imagination of London, concluding with an extended reading of "The Waste Land" and its manuscript drafts.
