"The proposed book aims to combine the process safety aspects, and the potential dangers to the ecology including source of the contamination, especially unbalanced utilization of the toxic chemicals in the process industries. It covers a broad spectrum of the industrial process safety, environmental pollution factors, dangers to land, water, air and living species, remediation technologies (traditional and futuristic approaches), pollutant degradation through numerical modelling, physico-chemical characteristics of the chemicals and their thermal analysis. It also provides the mandated safety data sheets already available and the suggestions for improvement on industrial specifications. Discusses detailed aspects of process safety and environmental impact from a theoretical and practical perspective. Covers detailed procedure of environmental modeling concepts. Explores forensic investigation sequences during the incident. Proposes futuristic approaches towards risk assessment and management. Includes real-time case studies with complexities and solutions. This book aims at Researchers, Graduate Students and Professionals related to Chemical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, and Process Safety Engineering"--
