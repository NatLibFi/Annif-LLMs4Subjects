The Handbook of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals : From Basic Research to Clinical Practice
This book provides comprehensive coverage of the three most important themes in the field of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDC) research: the basic biology of EDCs, particularly their effects on reproductive systems; EDC effects on humans and wildlife, including biomedical considerations; and potential interventions and practical advice for dealing with the problem of EDCs.
Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals: From Basic Research to Clinical Practice is the first book that provides comprehensive coverage of the three most important themes in the field of EDC research: the basic biology of EDCs, particularly their effects on reproductive systems, EDC effects on humans and wildlife, including biomedical considerations, and potential interventions and practical advice for dealing with the problem of EDCs. This book presents a translational approach to EDC research, spanning both basic biology and clinical applications, and provides a critical link between the laboratory and the physicians office. Scientists and physicians engaged in EDC studies or practice will find that this volume offers insight across all areas of EDC research, including clarifying the mechanisms for EDC effects, understanding the adverse affects of EDCs on humans and wildlife, and offering solutions to the problems created by exposures to EDCs.
