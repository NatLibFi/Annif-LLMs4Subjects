Unsettling colonialism : gender and race in the nineteenth-century global Hispanic world
"Unsettling Colonialism illuminates the interplay of race and gender in a range of fin-de-siècle Spanish narratives of empire and colonialism, including literary fictions, travel narratives, political treatises, medical discourse, and the visual arts, across the global Hispanic world. By focusing on texts by and about women and foregrounding Spain's pivotal role in the colonization of the Americas, Africa, and Asia, this volume breaks new ground in Iberian literary and cultural studies while also significantly broadening the scope of recent debates in postcolonial feminist theory to account for the Spanish empire and its (former) colonies. Bringing together the work of nine scholars, Unsettling Colonialism is organized into three sections: colonialism and women's migrations; race, performance, and colonial ideologies; and gender and colonialism in literary and political debates. Given its interdisciplinary approach and accessible style, the book will appeal not only to specialists in nineteenth-century Iberian and Latin-American studies but also to a broader audience of scholars in gender, cultural, transatlantic, transpacific, postcolonial, and empire studies"--
