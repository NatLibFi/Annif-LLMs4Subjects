Silicon solid state devices and radiation detection
This book addresses the fundamental principles of interaction between radiation and matter, the principles of working and the operation of particle detectors based on silicon solid state devices. It covers a broad scope in the fields of application of radiation detectors based on silicon solid state devices from low to high energy physics experiments, including in outer space and in the medical environment. This book also covers state-of-the-art detection techniques in the use of radiation detectors based on silicon solid state devices and their readout electronics.
