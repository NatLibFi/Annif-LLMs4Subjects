Spatial contact problems in geotechnics : boundary-element method
This book presents a systematic approach to numerical solution for a wide range of spatial contact problems of geotechnics. On the basis of the boundary element method new techniques and effective computing algorithms are considered. Special attention is given to the formulation and analysis of the spatial contact models for elastic bases. Besides the classical schemes of contact deformation, new contact models are discussed for spatially nonhomogeneous and nonlinearly elastic media properly describing soil properties.
