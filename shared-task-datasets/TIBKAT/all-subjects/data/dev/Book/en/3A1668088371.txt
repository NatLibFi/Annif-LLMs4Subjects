The "Greek crisis" in Europe : race, class and politics
This book critically analyses the publicity of the Greek debt crisis, by studying Greek, Danish and German mainstream media during the crisis? early years (2009-2015). Mass media everywhere reproduced a sensualistic ?Greek crisis? spectacle, while iterating neoliberal and occidentalist ideological myths. Overall, the Greek people were deemed guilty of a systemic crisis, supposedly enjoying lavish lifestyles on the EU?s expense. Using concrete examples, the study foregrounds neoorientalist, neoracist and classist stereotypes deployed in the construction and media coverage of the Greek crisis. These media practices are connected to the ?soft politics? of the crisis, which produce public consensus over neoliberal reforms such as austerity and privatizations, and secure debt repayment from democratic interventions
