Spatial modeling in natural sciences and engineering : software development and implementation : with 86 tables
The author introduces the reader to the creation and implementation of space-related models by applying a learning-by- doing and problem-oriented approach. The required procedural skills are rarely taught at universities and many scientists and engineers struggle to transfer a model into a computer program. The purpose of this book is to fill this gap. It moves from simple to more complex applications, covering various important topics in the sequence: dynamic matrix processing, 2D and 3D graphics, databases, Java applets and parallel computing.
