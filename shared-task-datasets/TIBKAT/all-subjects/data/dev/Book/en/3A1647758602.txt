Oncofertility Fertility Preservation for Cancer Survivors
While cancer survival rates have increased steadily over the last several decades, particularly among younger patients, the more aggressive forms of treatment that have made this possible often compromise a cancer patient's ability to later have biological children. In the past, pregnancy after cancer was largely unheard of. Today it is increasingly a possibility due to high survivorship rates in general and emerging reproductive technologies that give patients and their families options at the time of diagnosis to ensure a patient's future fertility (cryopreservation of ovarian tissue). Oncofertility has emerged as an interdisciplinary field bridging biomedical, social sciences and examines issues regarding an individual's fertility options, choice and goals in light of cancer diagnosis, treatment and survivorship. Written by leaders in this evolving field, the volume covers various aspects: medical, ethical and social.
