Critical Management Research in Eastern Europe
The process of transition in Eastern European countries is one in which ideas of the past and present, both local and Western, meet and conflict. Presenting a wealth of new ethnographic and interview-based research, Critical Management Research in Eastern Europe argues that the reform process in Central and Eastern Europe has been dominated by the traditional 'Western' view of management practice. However, this approach overlooks the fact that certain managerial and organizational practices developed in Central and Eastern Europe may still be appropriate and indeed effective within this particular setting. The book brings together authors from both East and West Europe to evaluate how the two systems can best be harmonized, which is particularly important in the context of EU enlargement
