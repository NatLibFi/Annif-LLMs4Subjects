Impact studies of composite materials
This book discusses the impact of different range of velocities (low, high, ballistic and hyper-velocity impact) on composites. Presented through experimental and numerical analysis, the book goes beyond impact event analysis and also covers the after-impact phenomena, including flexural and compression and damage analysis through destructive and non-destructive evaluations. The analyses presented from either experimental or numerical simulations are composed of micro and macrographs images, illustrations, tables and figures with inclusive discussions and supportive evidences from recent studies on composites. This book also highlights the potential applications of composites through the lens of their impact properties, in different industries such as automotive and defence applications. Generally, this book benefits wider range of readers including the industrial practitioners, researchers, lecturer and students, who are working in the fields related to impact and damage analysis, including the structural health monitoring of composites, either experimentally or numerically. .
