Istwa across the water : Haitian history, memory, and the cultural imagination
A note on spelling -- Groundings: tidalectics, Marasa, and Istwa -- The changing same: bok{o}fíó across the sea -- Of Boci{o}, Bo, Cakatú, Zonbi, Nkisi, and Pakèt Kongo -- Boci{o}, Nkisi, Legba, Ogun, and Ghede across the water -- Tidalectical dishonor -- Epilogue: re-suturing or joining the parts to the whole
Drawing on the belief system of Vodou, this project is anchored by three theoretical concepts: tidalectics, a term for the repetitive back-and-forth movement of the ocean, symbolizing ritual, balance, and cyclical unity; Marasa, or twinning, a principle of Vodou in which fragmented parts strive for remembrance and holism; and istwa, a Kreyol term whose meaning encompasses history, story, and memory
