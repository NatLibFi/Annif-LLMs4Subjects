Growing urban habitats : seeking a new housing development model
"Growing Urban Habitats documents and expands on Urban Habitats, an international design competition organized in 2005 by Habitat for Humanity of Greater Charlottesville and the Charlottesville Community Design Center. At stake were the equitable redevelopment of Sunrise, a local trailer park. The goal was to find the most innovative, yet feasible higher-density housing models, all without displacing the current residents."--P. [4] of cover
