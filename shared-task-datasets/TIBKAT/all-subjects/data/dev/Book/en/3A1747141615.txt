All solid state thin-film lithium-ion batteries : materials, technology, and diagnostics
"The monograph is intended for teachers, researchers, advanced students as well as for developers and manufacturers of thin-film lithium-ion batteries (LIB). The monograph contains an overview of developments in the field of materials, technologies and diagnostics of integral LIBs. It describes the basic principles of thin-film LIB functioning and considers their electrochemical systems. The characteristics of electrode materials and solid electrolytes are provided. Methods of deposition of thin-film LIB functional layers, methods for manufacturing test structures and methods for testing LIBs, and their individual elements are considered. The methods of diagnostics of thin-film LIB materials and the features of their investigation by means of electron microscopy, X-ray phase analysis, probe microscopy, mapping, secondary ion mass spectrometry, Auger spectrometry and IR spectroscopy are discussed"--
