Whistleblowing for change : exposing systems of power and injustice
What are the effects of whistleblowing on politics, society and the arts? This book examines this secretive phenomenon of whistleblowing in order to open up a broader public debate. Among others, John Kiriakou, Annie Machon, Frederik Obermaier, Laura Poitras, Gabriella Coleman, and Daryl Davis are key figures in the fields of whistleblowing, investigative journalism, social justice, hacktivism and digital culture. In the context of Disruption Network Lab's research and curatorial practice, they propose an interdisciplinary approach. By linking a diverse selection of perspectives and practices, this book investigates whistleblowing as a developing political practice that has the ability to provoke change from within
