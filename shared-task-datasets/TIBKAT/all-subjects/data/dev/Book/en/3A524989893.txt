Tsunamis and Hurricanes : A Mathematical Approach
Tsunamis and hurricanes had a devastating impact on the population living near the coast during the year 2005. The calculation of the power and intensity of tsunamis and hurricanes is of great importance. This book presents research on the mathematical description of tsunamis and hurricanes. It has formula, tables and results of the calculations
This book presents new research on the mathematical description of tsunamis and hurricanes. The description includes dissipative terms and does not contain singularities or two valued functions. The book uses the equivalence principle of solutions of nonlinear large gas dynamic waves and of solutions of water wave equations. An extension of the continuity equation by a source term due to evaporation rates of salt seawater help to understand hurricanes. Detailed formula, tables, and results of the calculations are given.
