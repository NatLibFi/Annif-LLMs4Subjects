Invariant Manifolds for Physical and Chemical Kinetics
By bringing together various ideas and methods for extracting the slow manifolds, the authors show that it is possible to establish a more macroscopic description in nonequilibrium systems. The book treats slowness as stability. A unifying geometrical viewpoint of the thermodynamics of slow and fast motion enables the development of reduction techniques, both analytical and numerical. Examples considered in the book range from the Boltzmann kinetic equation and hydrodynamics to the Fokker-Planck equations of polymer dynamics and models of chemical kinetics describing oxidation reactions. Special chapters are devoted to model reduction in classical statistical dynamics, natural selection, and exact solutions for slow hydrodynamic manifolds. The book will be a major reference source for both theoretical and applied model reduction. Intended primarily as a postgraduate-level text in nonequilibrium kinetics and model reduction, it will also be valuable to PhD students and researchers in applied mathematics, physics and various fields of engineering. From prepublication comments - "...an overwhelmingly rich display of deep ideas ..." Mikhail Shubin, Matthews Distinguished University Professor Northeastern University, Boston, MA "...a treasure trove filled with a variety of ideas on the reduced description of kinetics." Hans Christian Öttinger, Professor of Polymer Physics, ETH Zürich "... a very remarkable, and much needed, introduction to this fascinating subject, along with a systematic treatment of advanced topics which the authors themselves have largely contributed to develop."
