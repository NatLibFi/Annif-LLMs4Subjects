La escena imaginaria : poética del teatro de Miguel de Cervantes
Rezension: This is a penetrating and erudite study. Maestro looks at Cervantes`s theatre from the perspective of both classical antiquity and early modern Spain, against the Greek and Roman tragedians and against his contemporary rival, Lope de Vega. Rather than casting Lope as the rebellious `modern`, he sets forth Cervantes as the dramatic iconoclast, with Lope as a revisionist `ancient`, as it were. The treatment of Numancia is especially rich, and it is a shame that Maestro cannot devote a similar amount of space to the other plays. The central theses of La escena imaginaria are well delineated and exemplified, and they inspire a reconsideration of Cervantine dramaturgy and its place in literary history. The volume ranks among the major studies of Cervantes`s theatre. --Edward H. Friedman (Vanderbilt University).
Estudio sobre la literatura dramática cervantina, poco estudiada aún, pero que, sin embargo, ha tenido una importancia fundamental para la dramaturgia occidental.
