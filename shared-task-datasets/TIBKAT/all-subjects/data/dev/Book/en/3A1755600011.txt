Governing privacy in knowledge commons
"Privacy, in contrast with secrecy, is a relational concept, achieved when personal information is shared appropriately between actors. Viewed in this way, privacy is necessarily contextual and complex because norms about appropriate flows and use of personal information are socially negotiated and often contested. (Nissenbaum, 2009) Privacy is thus a problem of collective action. Moreover, personal information is often among the knowledge resources pooled and managed by knowledge commons. Even when that is not the case, personal information can be important in shaping knowledge commons participation and governance. The Governing Knowledge Commons (GKC) framework is thus well-suited for studying and analyzing how communities or populations evaluate and shape governance of privacy in particular contexts.
