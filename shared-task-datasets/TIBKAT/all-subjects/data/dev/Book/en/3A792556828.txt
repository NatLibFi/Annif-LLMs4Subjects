A modest proposal on method : essaying the study of religion
Further documents methodological and institutional failings in the academic study of religion. This collection of essays--which includes three previously unpublished chapters--identifies the manner in which old problems (like the presumption that our object of study is a special, deeply meaningful case) yet remain in the field. But amidst the critique there are a variety of practical suggestions for how the science of religion can become methodologically even-handed and self-reflexive--the markings of a historically rigorous exercise.--Provided by publisher
