Learn programming using the Commodore 16/Plus 4 system. Following this book, you and your children will not only learn BASIC programming, but also have fun emulating a retro Commodore system. There are many ways to bring the fun of learning to program in the 1980s back to life. For example, downloading the VICE emulator to a Raspberry Pi allows for the classic “turn on and program” experience and also provides some retro computing project fun. Many parents learned programming in this same way and can have fun helping their children follow the same path. You can also use this book as an opportunity to dust off your computing skills or learn programming concepts for the first time on a system that’s easy, approachable, and fun with a nostalgic twist. Commodore computers were the most sold computing devices before the iPhone. Nowadays, the Commodore system can be run using freely available emulation on modern computers. This book uses VICE, which is available for PC, Mac, Linux, as an online app, and on the Raspberry Pi. Beginning Programming Using Retro Computing offers simple programming concepts to give children and adults alike a sense of wonder in seeing that words they write have the power to do things, like play sounds, draw graphics, or finish math homework
