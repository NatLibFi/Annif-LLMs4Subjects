Research handbook on organizational resilience
"This Research Handbook identifies how resilience has evolved as a critical theoretical concept in the organizational sciences. International resilience scholars conceptualize and explore the various ways resilience can be embedded in theory and practice, offering new and updated perspectives on the importance of resilience in multiple contexts. Sections cover the nature of resilience at employee, team and organizational levels; the processes and dynamics of resilience in different contexts; and the antecedents and outcomes of these forms of resilience. Chapters provide case studies and theoretical frameworks to bring clarity, covering stress and coping, diversity and resilience, crisis management, employee behaviour, continuity and development. Organizational studies scholars interested in advancing theory and practice of resilience will find this Research Handbook includes a range of important considerations for the field. With application of several different levels of analysis, chapters discussing stress and coping will also appeal to those from a social psychology background"--
