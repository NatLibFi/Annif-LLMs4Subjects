A world religions reader
""This new edition expands an already useful textbook - making it an improved resource for introducing world religions. By presenting excerpts from sacred texts and voices from within the traditions, this book provides more than mere facts about various beliefs; it allows insight into the world-views and ethical concerns of adherents, making it the most valuable Reader on world religions to date to any student or teacher that seeks to study or teach the religious traditions of the world." S. Wesley Ariarjah, Drew University "An accessible and sympathetic introduction to the world's religions as understood by their adherents." Ingrid Mattson, Hartford Seminary, USA"--
