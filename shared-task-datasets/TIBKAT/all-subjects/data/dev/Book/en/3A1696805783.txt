Biological synthesis of nanoparticles and their applications
"Biological Synthesis of Nanoparticles and Their Applications gives insight into the synthesis of nanoparticles utilizing the natural routes. It demonstrates various strategies for the synthesis of nanoparticles utilizing plants, microscopic organisms like bacteria, fungi, algae and so forth. It orchestrates interdisciplinary hypothesis, ideas, definitions, models and discoveries associated with complex cell of the prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Highlights: Discusses biological approach towards the nanoparticle synthesis Describes the role of nanotechnology in the field of medicine and its medical devices Covers application and usage of the chemicals at the molecular level to act as catalysts and binding products for both organic and inorganic Chemical Reactions Reviews application in physics such as solar cells, photovoltaics and other usage Microorganisms can aggregate and detoxify substantial metals because of different reductase enzymes, which can diminish metal salts to metal nanoparticles. The readers after going through this book will have detailed account of mechanism of bio-synthesis of nanoparticles"--
