Handbook on the theory and practice of program evaluation
'The economic crisis has simultaneously placed a strong emphasis on the role of R&D as an engine of economic growth and a demand that limited public resources are demonstrated to have had the maximum possible impact. Rigorous evaluation is the key to meeting these needs. This Handbook brings together highly experienced leaders in the field to provide a comprehensive and well-organised state-of-the-art overview of the range of methods available. It will prove invaluable to experienced practitioners, students in the field and more widely to those who want to increase their understanding of the complex and pervasive ways in which technological advance contributes to economic and social progress.' (Luke Georghiou, University of Manchester, UK). -- 'Theoretical and empirical research on program evaluation has advanced rapidly in scope and quality. A concomitant trend is increasing pressure on policymakers to show that programs are 'effective'. Now is the time for a comprehensive status report on state-of-the-art research and methods by leading scholars in a variety of disciplines on program evaluation. This outstanding collection of contributions will serve as a valuable reference tool for academics, policymakers, and practitioners for many years to come.' (Donald S. Siegel, University at Albany, SUNY, US). -- There has been a dramatic increase in expenditures on public goods over the past thirty years, particularly in the area of research and development. As governments explore the many opportunities for growth in this area, they and the general public are becoming increasingly concerned with the transparency, accountability and performance of public programs. This pioneering Handbook offers a collection of critical essays on the theory and practice of program evaluation, written by some of the most well-known experts in the field. -- As this volume demonstrates, a wide variety of methodologies exists to evaluate particularly the objectives and outcomes of research and development programs. These include surveys, statistical and econometric estimations, patent analyses, bibliometrics, scientometrics, network analyses, case studies, and historical tracings. Contributors divide these and other methods and applications into four categories economic, non-economic, hybrid and data-driven in order to discuss the many factors that affect the utility of each technique and how that impacts the technological, economic and societal forecasts of the programs in question.
