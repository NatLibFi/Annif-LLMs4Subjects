Intelligent Information Integration for the Semantic Web
The semantic Web offers new opportunities for information processes. This book is devoted to the core issue of data integration at the semantic level and demonstrates the applicability of the techniques developed to spatio-temporal representation and reasoning and geographic information systems. Preceded by a motivating introduction and an overview of the state of the art in the field of information integration, fundamental problems of terminological representation, terminological reasoning, and semantic translation are treated in detail. The theoretical results and techniques developed are applied to intelligent conceptual and spatio-temporal queries of heterogeneous geographic information systems
