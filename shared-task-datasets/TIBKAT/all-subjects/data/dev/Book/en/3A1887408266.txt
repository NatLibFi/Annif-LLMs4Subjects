Plant-virus interactions
This detailed volume provides practical guidance on techniques in plant-virus interaction research, from targeting specific molecular interactions within the virus-host interactome to the identification of the complete virus-host protein-protein interaction network. After chapters on acquiring the necessary molecular tools, the book continues with biochemical and genetic approaches to confirming protein-protein interactions both in vivo and in vitro, procedures and protocols for assessing replication, translation, viral genome movement, and insect transmission, as well as techniques for detecting multiple molecular interactions between the host and the virus and monitoring immune hubs. Written for the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step and readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Authoritative and comprehensive, Plant-Virus Interactions serves as a valuable resource for understanding the protein-protein interaction network between the virus and the host, crucial for comprehending the life cycle of a virus and for developing strategies for broad-spectrum and long-lasting resistance against viral infections.
