Modern C++ Programming : Classes, Templates, Design Patterns ; with 397 Listings ¤ C++ is an object-oriented programming language, but generic programming using parameterizable classes or templates is increasingly gaining importance, as this method has great advantages over object-oriented programming when it comes to writing reusable code. This book provides a comprehensive presentation of modern C++ programming design according to the ANSI/ISO standard. The author first provides a compact repertoire of basic language elements of C++ and then explains in detail classical object-oriented modeling as well as modern techniques of generic programming using templates and design patterns.

Math Anxiety Trigger? : Investigations into the Relationship between Dyscalculia and School Anxiety ¤ What problems occur in students in the subject of mathematics and what consequences result from them? Besides fears that not only cause performance problems but partly lead to disturbances of the entire personality, arithmetic difficulties can still lead to significant problems up to complete failure in the subject of mathematics and thus have negative effects on the career path of the affected person in the worst case. The book addresses this problem and investigates the relationship between arithmetic weakness and school anxiety in elementary school students. Both theoretically and empirically, a comprehensive overview is provided	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077175-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177169-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037949-8>

Attack on Freedom: Security Madness, Surveillance State, and the Erosion of Civil Rights ¤ Intrusions into privacy and personal freedom are documented and evaluated. A polemical text that aims to awaken citizens, sharpen their awareness of what is being concocted in their own country or in the EU to restrict fundamental rights, extend and exploit surveillance of all, and see how far authorities can go with their zeal without causing offense. The authors were previously booked for literature and travel, so perhaps the feuilleton will now also deal with the topic or at least with the new book. There have already been condescending criticisms in newspapers: a sign of the bad conscience of journalists who did not take care of themselves. Those who did not read "Time" may have thought that only some US lawyers approved of torture, now everyone can see that German constitutional law professors hold similar theses. The press did not show itself to be shocked on the front pages. Juli Zeh does not only write novels, she has a complete and thorough legal education, which benefits the text. - 30 pages of notes, they are online expanded, but unfortunately without references to the text.

Economic Fallacies : 50 Errors in Thought that Cost us Head and Neck ¤ The long-time editor at the "manager magazine" deals with current economic policy issues in his books (cf. most recently "Euro-Vision", ID-G 44/12). This also applies to this same-named sequel to H. Müller: "Economic Fallacies" (ID-A 12/04). As such, the well-known economic journalist explains the theses of growth skeptics, who have been predicting the end of growth since the report to the Club of Rome. He then examines widespread views on the topics of work, markets, society, globalization, and Europe. Readers will agree or disagree with his theses in different ways. In any case, these animate to own engagement with important and much-discussed economic issues of the time, as Müller strikes a serious argumentation "a path through the jungle of judgments and prejudices" - as he formulates it. He captures the changed economic situation since his 1st title, with its causes and possible consequences, in a clear and readable manner. Current, highly recommended.

Handbook of Child and Youth Welfare ¤ This completely revised and supplemented with a series of new current contributions new edition of the Handbook of Child and Youth Welfare brings together the spectrum of pedagogical, institutional, and social policy discussions and perspectives in child and youth welfare at the beginning of the 21st century. Child and youth welfare now includes differentiated offers, programs, and intervention strategies as well as social support policies that do not only refer to children and young people in crisis situations or socially neglected living conditions. It is also an elementary socialization and education institution that shapes childhood and youth in our society socially. The completely revised and supplemented handbook provides not only an overview of the tasks and fields of work of child and youth welfare, but also addresses above all current social and political questions and societal developments that determine and challenge childhood and youth. In the individual contributions, suggestions are given and trends of development are shown that will shape child and youth welfare in the future. It becomes clear that child and youth welfare must be considered and asserted as an independent social and educational policy regulation and design form. The Handbook of Child and Youth Welfare thus brings together the entire spectrum of pedagogical, institutional, and social policy discussions and perspectives in child and youth welfare at the beginning of the 21st century. It is directed at all those who engage in child and youth welfare.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028892-4>
IT in General Education Schools: Subject Matter and Infrastructure; Evaluation of International Empirical Studies and Literature Analysis ¤ The continuously evolving information and communication technologies (IuK) are drivers of an unprecedented structural change: They increasingly penetrate and shape our communication, economic action, and social interactions. In the context of the educational system, one must therefore address the question of what role IuK should play in practical teaching and in the educational content of schools. Against this background, the present working report provides a comprehensive analysis of the various facets of IuK in the context of general education schools. To this end, a structuring framework for school IuK educational content is first developed. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation of previous empirical studies and literature sources is carried out. The analysis focuses on the current role of IuK resources and educational content in German schools and supplements this picture - where possible - with a comparison with other industrial nations. Finally, general recommendations for the orientation of IuK education at schools are derived and research needs are shown.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026926-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136533-1>

Transformationsmanagement for a Sustainable Water Economy : Handbook for the Realization of New-Generation Infrastructure Solutions in the Field of Water and Wastewater ; [Results of the Research Consortium netWORKS] ¤ The transformation - the change - of urban technical systems of water supply and wastewater disposal is the subject of this volume. In the sense of an energy- and resource-efficient urban development, it is necessary to raise existing potential in energy and material resources. If this transformation is successful, the urban water infrastructure will be more decentralized and closely linked to the energy infrastructure (especially heat supply) in the future. It will consist of numerous modules, focus on the closure of material cycles, and be able to react more flexibly to changing environmental conditions. It will mainly affect the level of individual households or buildings, as well as the level of individual blocks, and have consequences for building technology and building equipment. The publication of the research consortium netWORKS is aimed at decision-makers from the fields of urban development, urban planning, and urban water management. Responsible planners are given a concept for a multi-dimensional evaluation of possible transformation strategies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064821-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037278-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4451062-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019956-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000306-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161709-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064811-4>

Introduction to Mechatronics ¤ In recent years, the increasingly stronger penetration of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science has led to the formation of a new discipline, mechatronics. In this interdisciplinary field of engineering sciences, independent fields such as design engineering, technical dynamics, modeling, measurement, control, and regulation engineering, drive engineering, microprocessor engineering, and computer science come together. After an overview of the affected areas of this discipline, the interconnection of the areas in typical mechatronic products is presented using examples	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4238812-0>
Handbook for Technical Product Design: Material and Manufacturing; Decision-Making Foundations for Designers and Engineers ¤ At the interface between product development/design and engineering, communication and cooperation deficits sometimes occur, which can significantly negatively affect the efficiency and quality of development and innovation processes. The causes include, among other things, competence gaps regarding technical relationships on the part of design professions and creative service providers. Corresponding specialized literature, in which basic technical know-how is prepared and conveyed across disciplines based on the semantics and potential of designers, is not yet available on the market. The present book aims to close this gap. In development processes, frequently used technical knowledge about materials and possible processing methods is presented in a clear and scientifically founded manner in the form of a comprehensive reference work, in a way that addresses and supports the way of thinking of designers/engineers and representatives of design professions. Through a corresponding form of presentation, it should be possible to inform oneself quickly and comprehensively about the most important technological framework conditions for a design. In this process, visual and intuitive reading aids have been introduced, and the knowledge components within the book have been linked to each other.

Adoption - a new life perspective for the child? : Adoptive families in focus ¤ Adoption is taking on an increasingly greater importance in our society. As the number of unwanted childless couples in Western countries continues to rise, adoption is more in demand than ever as a means of fulfilling the desire for children. The dream of an intact family life with one's own child is to be realized in this way. But why do adoptions seem to fail again and again? How can the high proportion of adoptive children in therapeutic institutions be explained? Why do adoptive families need so much help and support? Are adoptions as a measure of youth welfare even sensible? Answers to these and other questions are given in this book. In this, the legal provisions of the adoption procedure are dealt with, adoptive applicants are examined in more detail in terms of their suitability, and positive and negative factors on the part of adoptive parents, the adoption agency, and the adoptive child are revealed, which can lead to the success or failure of an adoption.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000522-7>

Myths about Male Careers and Female Performance ¤ The results of the study presented in the book confirm the thesis of the unequal chances of women and men in the profession due to structural barriers. Unlike the widespread notion that individual performance is the central criterion for professional success, career requirements are only to a very limited extent bound to objective performance criteria. Rather, more general, rather unspoken criteria play a decisive role. These relate to the private living situation and the associated normative conceptions of professional commitment. At the same time, the area of private life and the gender arrangements found there is characterized by complex change processes. However, the normative conceptions of the working world hardly take account of these change processes to this day. As a result, not only is the pronounced inequality of chances for women and men in the profession a consequence, but also the loss of enormous potential in competences, incorporated knowledge, and innovation for companies. Conventional structures have petrified relationships, which in turn have a negative impact on economic dynamics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073274-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071781-1>
Feminist Theory from Africa, Asia, and Latin America ¤ This volume presents feminist concepts and debates from Africa and its diaspora, from Asia and Latin America (e.g. Womanism, Islamic feminisms, post- and decolonial feminisms, ecofeminism) through selected theorists as well as their critical engagement with the feminist theory and gender research received from the West.

Feasibility Study: Research Mobility and Innovation ¤ BEGIN The goal of the feasibility study "Research Mobility and Innovation" was to identify data sources and methodological approaches by which the international mobility of researchers with Germany as target and home country can be better recorded and analyzed than hitherto. Such approaches were sought that can provide answers to socially relevant questions regarding knowledge balance, economic balance, effects, and determinants of research mobility and that have the potential to be integrated into a regular reporting system. The feasibility study is divided into five subchapters, whose core results are summarized in this chapter: Definition of content and technical requirements for a reporting system for recording research mobility (Chapter 2), Evaluation of German data sets / sources and empirical research approaches with regard to their possibilities of use as a basis for quantitative studies on research mobility (Chapter 3), Evaluation of international data sets / sources and empirical research approaches with regard to their possibilities of use as a basis for quantitative studies on research mobility (Chapter 4), Comprehensive evaluation of two particularly promising approaches with regard to costs, resource deployment, and risks associated with the respective approach (Chapter 5) and possibilities of linking the reporting system with other information on effects and determinants of research mobility (Chapter 6).

Lost in the Universe: Why Physics Has Gone Astray ¤ A. Unzicker, a PhD physicist and science journalist, also takes a hard look at the modern scientific establishment in this book. Following up on "From the Big Bang to the Big Bounce" (BA 6/10), which was crowned the "most explosive science book of the year" in 2010, he continues his criticism here. Again, it's about the foundations and basic assumptions of physics, space, time, and mass, as well as atoms, atomic structure on the one hand, and galaxies and the cosmos as a whole on the other. As an outsider, he is "appalled by how many speculations with meaningless calculations flood physics". He strongly advocates for more open research, also pointing out the problem of research funding, because as soon as projects are applied for and approved, it is practically excluded that "a fundamentally new idea is involved". Numerous quotes from the literature support his efforts to promote a more critical science.

Introduction to Economics ¤ This book is aimed at students of economics, but also at interested parties from other fields and practitioners. It provides an overview of economics with the goal of presenting the most important questions of this discipline and presenting the methods with which one seeks to answer these questions. Above all, it is about awakening the 'economic intuition' in the reader, making the reader familiar with the economic perspectives, and encouraging further engagement with the subject. After a brief overview of the basics of economics, the treatment of micro- and macroeconomic topics is in the foreground. Subsequently, central topics of the theory of economic policy and financial science are examined.

Postfossil Society ¤ The energy transition is the societal challenge of our time, but a renunciation of energy from fossil energy carriers has massive consequences: Such a society needs not less but more state, values the land as a resource and location, and becomes more dependent on international energy networks. Postfossil societies require a change in the economic and land-use structure, in the understanding of state and consumption, in the use of new materials and design concepts. They are confronted with new distribution questions and develop new governance patterns. The book offers stimulating considerations and ideas.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068598-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4639012-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129504-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130125-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4211713-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014743-5>
Mathematics ¤ Introductory university textbook for first-semester students of non-mathematical disciplines, which stands between the many school mathematics repetition courses and bridge courses (e.g. Peter Dörsam: "Mathematics at the beginning of studies", BA 2/06; W. Poguntke: "No fear of math", BA 1/05) and subject-specific textbooks like that of Manfred Precht: "Mathematics ... for non-mathematicians" (ID 43/06; related problem collection: ID 38/06). The book takes into account all areas of mathematics that are relevant at this level, is held in an engaging style and is very clearly formulated. The individual chapters are also selectively readable when the language of mathematics is sufficiently mastered, so the work can also be used as a compendium. Also suitable for secondary school level II students. The very good equipment with colorful graphics, photos, color-coded mnemonics, examples and practical applications reminds more of schoolbooks than of university textbooks.

FEM : Fundamentals and Applications of the Finite-Element Method in Mechanical and Vehicle Engineering ¤ Textbook on the finite element method with case studies and understanding tasks. Addressed are students of technical disciplines and engineers in practice. (LK/LEV: Junker) The finite element method (the author mixes the English and German spelling) is used in mechanical and vehicle engineering in computer-aided development. The textbook is intended to build a bridge between theory and practice, with an emphasis on making it more understandable. So, numerous formulas and equations are brought into a practical context, and solved case studies and understanding tasks (with results) are intended to facilitate entry into the not exactly simple subject matter. In addition, a glossary and a list of formula symbols as well as an extensive bibliography are included. Compared to the 6th edition last discussed (ID-G 16/06), it has been slightly tightened and carefully updated in the theoretical part. Therefore, it is mainly intended for first-time acquisition or as a replacement for older than the 8th edition. In addition to F. Rieg: "Finite Element Analysis for Engineers" (not discussed here).

Statistics for Dummies Problem Collection ¤ 999 problems from descriptive and inductive statistics, later with detailed solution descriptions, are intended to lead to the ability to apply independently and to understand conceptually, without requiring deeper theoretical knowledge. Review (ekz) The tasks lead from calculations of the standard measures of descriptive statistics to special estimation and test procedures of closing statistics. In the more comprehensive 2nd part, the solutions are described in detail; it serves not only for success control, but explains the relationships and terms again thoroughly. Deeper knowledge from probability theory is not required of the reader, even the standard formulas from combinatorics are explained. Some prior knowledge is certainly helpful and necessary, which can be found in earlier titles of this publishing series, for example D. Rumsey: "Statistics II for Dummies". Relevant software for handling larger data sets - which is rarely required here - is handled by F. Brosius: "SPSS 22 for Dummies"; also in this series). (2-3 pages)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056995-0>
Outline of Literary Studies ¤ Already the 2009 edition of the title (not discussed here) shows, apart from a revised layout, various content innovations compared to the 2003 edition discussed here (ID-G 46/03), including references to media and cultural studies; the literature recommendations for 'new Germanists' and the bibliography have also been updated five years ago. Furthermore, R. Schneider's assessment of "... generally understandable and vividly written ... fluid and stimulating to read ... sympathetic, helpful, primarily recommended for beginners ... introduction" still applies. The current reprint has now been changed in the cover and the literature lists have been revised again. In addition, there are supplements in the concluding tip section for students regarding the research of newspaper and internet sources as well as study behavior rules. The 2nd edition should be replaced in any case.

Due to the many functions, diploma theses and dissertations can be efficiently worked out and designed accordingly. The revised edition of the book contained in BA 4/03 shows how Word can be used in scientific everyday life in versions 2000, 2002, and 2003. A sample diploma thesis serves as an example, which is designed and created step by step, from the correct structure to submission as a PDF file. Also included are data backup and recovery, setting up documents and taking over departmental guidelines, as well as inserting content, image, and other indexes. Clear structure with numerous step-by-step instructions and screenshots, making it possible for cross-entry. Should be acquired by all libraries with the corresponding target group. (2) (LK/SFB: Green) The daily guide for working with Word for students: It guides students through typical tasks that occur in diploma theses and dissertations. Systematics help with looking up.

The Passionate Programmer : How Programmers Can Succeed in Their Careers ¤ Readers who enjoy writing programs may be inclined to turn their hobby into a career. What should one consider in this case? The author clearly shows that a profession should not only create the foundations for a secure life. A profession should also bring fulfillment and happiness, the feeling of being a valuable and respected person. Fulfillment and happiness rarely occur by chance. The author describes - occasionally from a typically American perspective - strategies for planning and realizing a truly successful career (and thus also a successful life) in software development. It is clearly repeated again and again: only intense, not goal-oriented, personal effort helps further. Emphasis is placed, among other things, on clever self-marketing and the desire to stay up to date. Good hints for implementing the developed strategies. Many short, but memorable guiding principles as milestones for the successful path. A book that can be very helpful in planning a professional career in general.(2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005964-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175854-7>
Political Extremism in the Federal Republic of Germany: An Introduction ¤ Fundamentally and objectively, S. Kailitz deals with the various manifestations of political extremism in his study. The focus of his investigation is (of course) Germany. After a general definition, he provides a comprehensive overview of the development of left- and right-wing extremist parties, followed by a depiction of violent manifestations and a brief comparison with the countries of France, Italy, and England. A separate chapter is devoted to religious extremism - Islamic fundamentalism - as a particularly dangerous variant. The conclusion of the book forms a kind of cause research, how it can come to political extremism and extremist attitudes in the population, and a brief summary of the tools available to the state to protect itself from it. Very good introduction to the extreme parties of Germany, in the form without special comparison titles.

Virtue and Terror: A History of the French Revolution ¤ Great historical narrative of the French Revolution from 1789 to 1799, which promoted modernity in Europe and at the same time anticipated all aspects of later revolutions between liberation and breakthrough on the one hand and degeneration, terror, and dictatorship on the other. (Harald Pilzer) The relevant titles discussed here in recent years were rather compendia or didactic purposes (e.g. S. Lachenicht: ID-A 24/12; A. Kuhn: ID-A 4/13 and 18/13; J. Heinßen: ID-A 6/11; H.-U. Thamer: BA 11/04) and specialized questionings (W. Kruse: ID-G 35/05) dedicated presentations. J. Willms has added another, in the truest sense of the word, both content and outwardly strong band to his numerous and recognized books on the history, present, and literature of France. This 5-book/episode-structured history of the revolution and the advent of modernity is a great historical narrative of the years 1789-1799 and unfolds a broad panorama, whose title borrows the core theme of political virtue as a commitment to the common good and at the same time targets the period of the \	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018183-2>

Location-Adapted Cultivation Systems for Energy Plants: Results of the Joint Project "Development and Comparison of Optimized Cultivation Systems for the Agricultural Production of Energy Plants under the Different Site Conditions in Germany, EVA I" ¤ Considering the locations, crop rotations that combine C3- and C4-plants yielded the highest yields. Crop rotation 3 (Maize - Green rye - Sorghum (b. x s.) - Winter triticale (GPS) - Annual ryegrass) was, on average, the most productive crop rotation with the smallest fluctuations between the two time-shifted experimental plots. Based on this crop rotation, the productivity of the different locations could also be highlighted.[...] In addition to these economic aspects, however, the agronomic and ecological benefits of various energy plant production systems should not be neglected. Considering aspects of erosion, water, and biodiversity protection, as well as the need to maintain soil fertility through a long-term balanced humus budget, additional location-specific recommendations can be derived.[...] (Source: Publisher)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4602952-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4473009-3>
Microeconomics, Competition, and Strategic Behavior ¤ The microeconomics professor presents a university textbook that allows business administration bachelor students a well-understandable entry. Here, the material is not abstracted strictly according to the curricula, but rather it is about the microeconomic methods and concepts that actually play a role in business practice. According to the generally recognized study plans, the material is divided into ten chapters (Foundations, Customers and Market, Risk and Behavioral Economics, Companies and Competition, Production Function and Technology, Costs, Entrepreneurial Competition Policy, Price Strategies, Game Theory, Competition Strategies in the Oligopol). Behavioral Economics and Digitalization are not excluded. There is a summary, control questions, and literature references for each chapter, the keyword index is cleverly arranged.

The Liberal Illusion: Why We Need a Left Realism ¤ Left parties must change their priorities: In contrast to a secure income or affordable housing, issues like cultural diversity, gender equality, sexual identity, open borders or European integration are secondary in the reality of life for many people. - Review: The principal representative of the SPD state parliamentary group in Rhineland-Palatinate is also a busy writer, currently in demand as an interview partner and guest author in the daily press. In his articles, as in this polemic, he deals with the decline of the German and European left and, in particular, of social democracy.

Library Science in National Socialism: A Research Status Analysis ¤ This investigation deals with German library science in National Socialism. The central questions are: How did the book burnings in May 1933 come about, who was responsible and how did the actions unfold in detail? With which state regulations did the libraries have to struggle and how did the library staff react? How did the Association of German People's Librarians (VDV) and the Association of German Librarians (VDB) behave regarding the political guidelines? What importance did other library forms have, such as lending libraries, confessional libraries, or libraries in National Socialist concentration camps? Numerous authors have dealt with the various aspects of NS library policy in recent years or decades and have gained new insights. Now, an attempt will be made to depict and analyze the research status on the history of people's libraries and scientific libraries in the Third Reich based on specialist literature. The treatise not only provides a comprehensive overview of the most important publications on this topic. The reader also learns something about the historical framework conditions and can form a comprehensive picture of the effects of cultural policy, in particular library policy, from 1933 to 1945 due to the detailed and vivid depiction of the most important events.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006439-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167870-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013021-6>

Literature and Multilingualism: A Handbook ¤ The research field of 'Literature and Multilingualism' is currently experiencing a notable surge in international literary and cultural studies, as the analysis of literary multilingualism promises a novel approach to the relationship between literature and phenomena of cultural and social difference. The handbook assumes that the research of literary multilingualism is primarily characterized by its research direction and methodology. It therefore presents the methods available for the analysis of literary multilingualism and provides cultural-historical background information for their interpretation. Thus, it also opens up new perspectives on the specific language of literary texts. With this, the handbook provides urgently needed tools for the exploration of linguistic diversity in literature for both aspiring and established literary and cultural scholars.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038403-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035964-5>
Not to Crack : From Unsolved Enigma Codes to the Letters of the Zodiac Killer ¤ There are many books about the extensive field of cryptography, about encryptions and their counterpart, the art of deciphering, cracking codes and secret writings. Klaus Schmeh himself has already dealt with this topic... In his new book, it's less about the hardware of coding, but about its results, e.g. the radio messages of the Enigma machines. Some are still not deciphered. More interesting, however, are the preserved manuscripts that could not be deciphered, which may also remain so. These include the Voynich Manuscript and the Codex Rohonci, but also the writings of the Zodiac serial killer - A thrilling read not only for logical puzzle solvers, to whom the author also offers his own difficult-to-solve cryptograms.

Atlas of the Strange Houses and Their Inhabitants ¤ Suddenly there's a house: A gigantic castle made of white wood, built by a New York art speculator. A half-sphere of concrete, set up by a film director for himself and his lover on a cliff in Sardinia. A hut in Mexico, where an American ex-banker has retreated. Eccentric builders sometimes indulge in rather peculiar houses, which Niklas Maak has been tracking down all over the world. He has spoken with architects and inhabitants and learned a lot about the dreams, fears, and obsessions of the 20th and 21st centuries. Houses tell the most wonderful stories. Niklas Maak has written them down – not just for architecture enthusiasts. "A building atlas, as the title claims, this subjectively compiled house show is not. Also, not all stories are equally interesting. That one still wants to read the book is due to Maak's storytelling art and his infectious fascination with unusual biographies" (deutschlandradiokultur.de)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066772-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>
Foundations for Climate Change-Adaptive Urban and Open Space Planning : Wolfgang Wende, Stefanie Rößler, Tobias Krüger (Eds.) ¤ The consequences of climate change are particularly noticeable in the settlement areas. Volume 6 of the REGKLAM publication series summarizes the project's work on the foundations of climate-resilient settlement development. In addition to methods, concrete research results are presented that are directly related to the bioclimatic effects of urban building and vegetation structures. Approaches for climate-resilient urban and open space planning are formulated. The thematic spectrum includes the identification of heat-sensitive settlement areas, the evaluation of thermal loads in various urban planning situations, as well as methods for capturing the green infrastructure of settlement areas as a basis for evaluating the climatic performance and the effects of planning decisions. Furthermore, open space planning options for vacant land are presented under the aspect of their suitability for climate adaptation, as well as suitability recommendations for the use of urban trees.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034354-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056754-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1>
The Political Islam: Between Muslim Brothers, Hamas and Hezbollah ¤ In the latest political upheavals in the Arab world, parties and movements whose ideological basis is Islam are playing an increasingly important role. Here at home, their ideas are often lumped together under the term 'Islamism'. The author presents the most important of them in their social and political context, by translating and critically evaluating numerous writings. In doing so, not only their political and religious, but also their economic and social policy positions are presented. Through the current reference to the political situation, for example, in Egypt, Palestine or Lebanon, and the embedded prominent quotes from writings and speeches of political Islamic actors, a very vivid and readable image of the situation and long-term perspectives emerges. It becomes clear that these groups are dynamic social movements that differ significantly in their ideological positions. A successful contribution to political opinion-forming.

For the Animals, Every Day is Treblinka ¤ From the domestication and enslavement of animals, a direct path leads to industrial mass slaughter. Patterson shows how early mechanisms of animal husbandry and treatment were transferred to humans. As the end of the 19th century in the slaughterhouses of Chicago begins the mass production of animal slaughter and processing, it is only a step to the automated destruction of humans. The nationalist ideology relies on contemporary theories of animal selection and breeding, which lead to racial mania, forced sterilizations, and eugenically justified human killings. Although the mass murders Patterson deals with in his book differ in terms of the identity of the victims and the purpose of the killings, they have several terrifying similarities: The isolation of the victims. The transport in cattle wagons. The accommodation in stables and slaughterhouses. The architecture of the gas chambers. The mass killing. Already Bernhard Grzimek spoke in connection with the keeping of laying hens of „chicken concentration camps“.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060087-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038639-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073091-8>

Statistics : an Introduction for Social Scientists ¤ A conceptually careful introduction to the methods and procedures of statistics, as far as they are required in the social sciences, mostly oriented to concrete examples, with references to suitable software, without pursuing mathematical foundations. (Wolfgang Grölz) The text claims to be a textbook and a reference work. Almost without requiring relevant prerequisites and without pursuing mathematical backgrounds, but with great conceptual care, the reader should be conveyed the statistical knowledge and skills required for the social sciences. Some experience with software should be possessed or derived from the recommended literature. The calculations here use the systems SPSS and Stata. The clearly structured explanations are mostly oriented to concrete examples and lead from data structures to the descriptive statistics to the estimation and test procedures of inductive statistics based on samples. Results from probability theory are used without pursuing the theoretical backgrounds. The ability to apply critically in practice is the prevailing learning goal that the authors pursue.

CO2 Pricing, Energy Carrier Prices Reform: Paths to a Cross-Sectoral Market Design ¤ How should the market design be shaped to enable efficient climate protection in Germany and promote sector coupling? A comprehensive CO2 pricing and reform of taxes, levies, and charges are essential components. This statement incorporates the decisions from the Climate Package 2030 and shows options for how the revenue from CO2 pricing can be used to achieve a double dividend for climate protection. The following points are crucial: A uniform and comprehensive CO2 price in Europe forms the core of an efficient and effective market design. It is obvious that the European Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) should be extended to all sectors by 2030. For the national CO2 pricing in the transport and heat sector, which the federal government has decided on in the Climate Package 2030, Germany should win further member states as partners. Together, they can form a strategic CO2 alliance that, in the best case, leads to an extension of the EU-ETS. The revenue from CO2 pricing can be used to reform the system of taxes, levies, and charges – with the goal of relieving disproportionately heavily burdened energy carriers. This can achieve a double dividend and promote sector coupling. Particularly effective is replacing the EEG levy and reducing the electricity tax. In the transport sector, emissions are currently at the same level as in 1990. A better market design could significantly contribute to solving these climate policy challenges in the transport sector in a targeted and efficient manner. The federal government should initiate a process to develop suitable solutions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1215284845> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547705-1>
PCs for Dummies : [learn to start and use the PC ; connect camera, printer & Co. ; learn Windows Vista ; the computer, your friend and helper] ¤ For the computer novice, there has been this PC introduction from the Dummies series for many years, now in the 9th edition (last shown 7th edition BA 7/06). With this edition, the Vista era begins. The 31 chapters of the book were updated throughout, taking into account the new operating system and latest technical developments. The structure and organization follow the predecessor. Due to the update, numerous new text sections are available. Also, individual chapters were rearranged or completely removed. Since computers have developed into multimedia all-round talents in the meantime, the author devotes a complete book section to this aspect. Under the heading "Digital Life", chapters on using the PC as a TV and stereo system replacement or as a film and photo studio reside. The numerous readable images were adapted to Vista.

Electrical Installation in Residential Buildings : Handbook for Installation Practice ¤ It is a very demanding handbook (guideline for electrical installation) and reference work (for standards, regulations, guidelines, each commented) for professionals (craftsmen, masters etc.), less for apprentices or laymen who want to perform small installations. Since 1984 it has been continuously expanded and above all updated, lastly in 2005 (BA 9/05). There are again some innovations (e.g. in the field of building system technology or through electronic household meters etc.) and fundamental changes in the standards, regulations and guidelines, The title is probably not a big borrower (in Wuppertal the aforementioned 6th edition was borrowed 11 times) compared to the guides for laymen by H.O. Häberle (BA 2/10), H. Schultke (BA 4/10), the even simpler one by B. Hanus (BA 3/07) or the overview for builders by A. Burgwitz (BA 5/09), to mention only the newer titles.

Software Development for Embedded Systems: Fundamentals, Modeling, Quality Assurance ¤ Embedded systems take on complex control and regulation tasks for technical systems. Their functionality is realized through the interaction of special hardware, standard processors, peripherals, and software. Often the focus is on hardware aspects. In fact, software design plays at least an equally important role in designing these systems. This book starts here and provides a good overview of the topic. Classifications and topics such as concurrency, real-time, and real-time operating systems form the fundamentals. Programming embedded systems is explained using C++, Java, and examples from Esterel and Giotto. Selected software design techniques such as statecharts, hybrid systems, UML, and hardware-software co-design are presented in detail. Embedded systems are often used in safety-critical areas. Ensuring software quality is therefore of central importance and forms another important part of the book.

Control of Wind Energy through Regional Planning - Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow ¤ This contribution deals with the development of regional planning designations between 2009 and 2014. The evaluation of current draft plans provides further information on the scope of future zoning designations for wind energy. The investigation is based on the data of the BBSR-managed Regional Planning Monitor (ROPLAMO), whose vector data from zoning areas in binding regional plans have been supplemented with vector data of draft plans on the topic of wind energy. This allows for the first time a time series consideration of regional planning designations. Quoted are, inter alia, the judgments of the Federal Administrative Court of 13.12.2012 (Case No. 4 CN 1.11 and 4 CN 2.11), in which the methodological requirements for the planning control of wind energy use in the countryside were further developed, as well as OVG Schleswig-Holstein, 20.01.2015, 1 KN 18/13	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049040-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128839-7>
Global culture : media, arts, policy, and globalization ¤ For McDonalds, MTV & Co. there is no terra incognita anymore, as these signs of cultural globalization have already penetrated into the last corners of the world. The contributions of the volume investigate how and with what success states, cities, as well as public and private cultural organizations try to intervene in processes of cultural globalization. In the first part, differences and similarities between cultural policies in Europe, the United States, and Asia are asked. Thus, the cultural policy of France, Sweden, and the United States is compared under the aspect of the relationship between private and public cultural funding, and the development of Japanese cultural policy and the orientation towards Western models is presented. The second part is dedicated to the regeneration of depleted cultural resources in cities that had suffered economic losses. Thus, the effect of a cultural and economic upswing through the establishment of new museums in cities such as Liverpool, Marseille, and Barcelona is investigated. Another contribution analyzes the positive effect of globalization on local music traditions, as can be seen in Brazil, for example. The third part shows, using the examples of Singapore and Ferrara, how cultural policy can contribute to a change in the image of cities. The fourth part finally asks, using examples of American and Japanese television productions, for criteria by which local television series are exported to foreign cultures.

ecoControl : Design and Implementation of a Software for Optimizing Heterogeneous Energy Systems in Multi-Family Houses ¤ A decentralized energy supply is the first step towards an energy transition. In this context, various power and heat generators are increasingly being used in multi-family houses. In particular, in Germany, block heat and power plants are increasingly being used in this context, as they can convert gas very efficiently into heat and power. In addition, they enable a continuous and decentralized energy supply in combination with other energy systems such as photovoltaic systems. When operating different energy systems, it is desirable that the systems work in sync with each other. However, it is currently difficult to operate heterogeneous energy systems efficiently together. As a result, potential savings are left unused. A central control can therefore improve the efficiency of the overall system. With ecoControl, we present an expandable prototype that optimizes the cooperation of energy systems and takes environmental factors into account. The software provides a uniform interface for configuring all systems. In addition, it offers the possibility of developing, testing, and executing optimization algorithms using a programming interface. Within such algorithms, predictions provided by ecoControl can be used. These predictions are based on the individual behavior of each energy system, weather forecasts, and energy consumption forecasts. Using a simulation, technicians can immediately test different configurations and optimizations without having to test them over a long period on real devices. ecoControl also helps housing associations and landlords with the management and analysis of energy costs. We have shown through case studies that optimization algorithms that improve the use of heat storage can significantly improve the efficiency of the overall system. Finally, we conclude that ecoControl must be tested under real conditions as soon as a suitable hardware component is available. Through this interface, measurement values are sent to ecoControl and control signals are forwarded to the devices.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012002-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7708028-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4024257-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038373-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7660153-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140245-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055382-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064204-5>

STEP 5-Crash Course: SPS Programming and Simulation for Users ¤ Publisher's text: STEP(c)5 is the most widely used SPS programming language in Europe. Knowledge of this language is of great benefit to anyone involved in electrical, control, and automation technology. Even small control tasks are now solved with SPSs, as the price difference between control systems implemented with conventional switching technology and those with small SPSs is small or no longer exists. In terms of flexibility and comfort of the systems, these are often equipped with SPSs. The book conveys STEP(c)5 in addition to the practical handling of a SIEMENS automation device. With the attached WinSPS software, the examples in the book can be programmed and simulated. The simulator is operated like an automation device of the S5 series from SIEMENS. The AGs up to the 135U series are simulative. The book is set up so that a topic is first conveyed and explained by examples. Then follows a practical programming exercise with the simulation software.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057282-1>

We Make Music : A Suggestion ¤ The father, a pioneer of early shellac culture, brings the Berlin dance and variety orchestras to the ODEON recording studio in the 1920s and 1930s. Later, in the post-war period, he brings a new black disc from the city every evening, from which loud music sounds to the daughter's horror. The father appears to her as a magician who can compress opera singers, pianists, and entire orchestras into the small format of a record. Nothing interests the daughter more than finding out what it's all about with the mysterious, paternal world of music. That's why she takes piano lessons, studies with her father's couplets and small dances, and tries to become a child star, but fails in a quirky way with each of these attempts. She must therefore come up with something else. \	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135113-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062386-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040841-3>
Design Dictionary : Conceptual Perspectives of Design ¤ This standard reference work is aimed at professionals in the fields of design, advertising, and marketing, as well as "design fans": 100 international authors explain 260 terms. (Bettina Scheurer) This book fills a gap. The often meager glossaries at the end of more extensive design picture books help the reader with orientation, but they always remain on the surface - which is not something that can be blamed. This book goes deeper, it extracts, explains, and establishes connections. 100 international authors have worked on 260 terms around design and marketing relevant to design. The result is a standard work that deserves this title. So even some technical jargon loses its frightening aspect. From "Added Value" to "Target Group" - no question remains unanswered. This scientific reference work is suitable for both a professional audience and as an interesting book for design fans. It is certainly already possible for smaller collections as a solid basic equipment. (1 A) (Bettina Scheurer)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011510-0>

Understanding Learning Processes : Ways of a New (Special-)Pedagogical Diagnosis ; a Handbook ¤ From a scientific and school-practical perspective, the handbook documents the departure from special pedagogical-deficit-oriented diagnostics. Ways to individual help within the framework of learning process analysis are presented. Most federal states have reacted to the change in pedagogical diagnostics, among other things, with school law innovations. The traditional special school examination is increasingly being replaced by support committee procedures. This change is based on a fundamental shift from a attributive and thus stigmatizing to a ability- and support-oriented pedagogical diagnostics. The child environment, self-organization, and the process character of learning are taken into account both at the entrance and through learning process analysis. Traditional test procedures are pushed into the background. A holistic view is made fairer for students.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124210-5>

Life on the Castle: Everyday Life, Feuds, and Tournaments ¤ Richly illustrated representation of life on and around the medieval castle: castle construction, spread, and tasks, knights and castellans in everyday life and at tournaments or in war, economic environment and culture. (Olaf Kaptein) The theme of 'Castle and Knights' is extensively covered in the children's book sector, but on the non-fiction market, only A. Schlunk (BA 12/03) and 'German Knights - German Castles' (BA 11/98) can be referred to, Maurice Keen (BA 12/99) is already significantly more challenging. Following Theiss (Schlunk), Thorbecke now presents a very simple and understandable representation of life on and around the medieval castle: castle construction, spread, and tasks, knights and castellans in everyday life and at tournaments or in war, economic environment and culture. Dramatic descriptions, scandal stories, and anecdotes - often repeated from original sources - enliven the well-structured text (short chapters with indented paragraph beginnings) illustrated by miniatures from illuminated manuscripts. Unfortunately, no index, but well-structured, literature recommendations would have been desired for the expected readership. In comparison to the above-mentioned Schlunk, still more versatile, also suitable as an introduction to the Middle Ages.

Globalization and its Critics : The Current State of the Globalization Debate ¤ Globalization' has become one of the most frequently used political buzzwords in recent years, although - or perhaps precisely because - the term is still underdetermined, theoretically vague, and often overloaded with (ideological) value judgments. Regardless of this, numerous controversies have arisen - in the wake of the inflationary use of the globalization term. The spectrum of these conflicts is marked on the one hand by 'globalization supporters' and on the other hand by 'globalization critics.' The volume brings together contributions that outline the framework conditions and divergences of the globalization controversy from different perspectives and provide a sociological interpretation of the transnational, international, and national phenomena that accompany it.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4557997-0>
Sacred Scriptures: An Introduction ¤ The research of the Sacred Scriptures has brought about significant progress in the last four decades, raised new questions, put previously secured things into question again, and also eliminated uncertainties. The research of the Sacred Scriptures has brought about significant progress in the last four decades, raised new questions, put previously secured things into question again, and also eliminated uncertainties. The present volume presents the state of knowledge achieved in the relevant scientific disciplines under the questions of religious science, in such a way that even the non-expert is able to form an impression of the fullness of the new insights into the Sacred Scriptures. Renowned researchers explain the origin, author, structure, literary characteristics, hermeneutic questions, and addressees as well as the handling of the sacred texts. This is followed by the question of what authority and significance the relevant Sacred Scripture has for the believers of the respective religion. The volume provides a reliable orientation on the Old and New Testament, the Talmud, the Quran, the scriptures of Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Baha'i, and the New Religions, from the Mormons over Christian Science and the Unification Church to the Community of the Universal Life. An introduction to the canonical and apocryphal texts of the religions of the world, from the great world religions to the newer religious movements.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4159382-0>
Physics for Engineers for Dummies : [for the kick with physics ; at a glance: finally understand the mathematical basics ; Mechanics and Thermodynamics quickly grasp ; Optics, Electricity, Atomic, Nuclear, and Solid-State Physics master] ¤ With Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Electromagnetism, Optics, Atomic, Nuclear, and Solid-State Physics, C. Thomsen covers the usual areas in 2-semester introductory courses on the physical foundations of natural and engineering sciences. In addition to engineers, students of natural sciences, teacher candidates, advanced students, and interested laymen can also benefit from the book. Only at a few places do the mathematical requirements exceed the level of the upper secondary school (mostly as part of optional supplementary sections). Physics students will not get by with this volume alone without further specialized literature (e.g. "Modern Physics", ID-G 3/10). The individual sections can be used independently of each other. In contrast to ("Physics for Dummies", ID-G 50/07), the content focuses are more evenly distributed. The literature list and tasks are missing. Instead, the numerous examples in the text are designed as tasks and provided with step-by-step solutions. The colloquial tone may disturb the purists, but it whets the appetite for the subject.

The Old Order Amish : a Community of Faith between Perseverance and Development ¤ Publisher's information: The life of the Old Order Amish has hardly changed over the past two centuries. With horse-drawn carriages, old costumes and their antiquated German dialect, they stubbornly deny all developments of the Industrial and Post-Industrial Revolution. Approximately 85,000 people still live in the USA and Canada today according to the strict rules of the most conservative part of the Mennonites. Silke Langwasser provides an overview of the fascinating history of the Old Order Amish. Their origin from the Anabaptist movement and the secession of 1693, their way of life, their reaction to the American Civil War and the world wars of the 20th century are explained by her just as vividly as the social structures that have shown an unusual continuity over the centuries. Religious aspects such as worship, baptism and burial and their importance for the survival of the community are further topics. With a sociological approach to religion, the Germanist and historian succeeds in presenting this extraordinary minority in a largely unbiased manner.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001720-5>
Love : an Exercise ¤ Individuals can be recognized by the fact that they have a bend in their optics. They gain a second meaning from all publicly accessible things and events, which is initially only accessible to themselves. In this highly personal optics, what may be experienced as the slowness of a fellow human being may be attributed to the impatience of the experiencer themselves. This individualized form of experiencing is not particularly consensual. Nevertheless, it can happen that another person, instead of simply shaking their head, inserts themselves into my worldview and even starts to confirm it through their own actions: Instead of accusing me of impatience, they act a bit faster themselves. For the others, my experience is still insignificant, but for the other, it apparently has the power of a strong motivator. So it becomes easier for me to be who I am.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035646-2>

Homer's Wild West: The Historical-Geographical Rebirth of the Odyssey ¤ Heinz Warnecke brings Homer's Odyssey back from 'literary abstraction' into historical reality and thereby initiates a paradigm shift in Homer philology. He resolves, taking into account all the statements of the Homeric epics, the question of Odysseus' homeland island and, on a solid philological basis, shows that Odysseus' fictional journey leads through geographical spaces that lose nothing of their reality in the form of mythologizing narration. Furthermore, the historical findings on the subject matter are groundbreaking for the solution of the Homeric question. Moreover, the historical personality of the Odyssey poet and his homeland can now be reliably fixed. In addition to a wealth of new arguments, Warnecke supplements the second edition with a chapter on the history of the Ithaka question.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195351-4>

Nietzsche : Biography of his Thinking ¤ Like few others, Friedrich Nietzsche has shaped modern thought. He called himself dynamite. One can imagine his thinking as a laboratory where provocative, sometimes risky arguments are experimented with. His philosophy does not result in a system, but rather lives from its inner dynamics. Rüdiger Safranski called his significant and highly successful Nietzsche book, which appeared on the 100th anniversary of his death and was translated into many languages, a 'biography of his thinking'. On the 175th birthday on October 15, 2019, a new edition of this standard work appears, expanded with an afterword that highlights the unbroken topicality of Nietzsche's thinking.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045791-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3>
Holz erkennen und benutzen : das Nachschlagewerk für die Praxis ; [over 200 wood species and their use] ¤ The title is about 30 pages more comprehensive and includes 17 new wood species compared to the previous edition "Holz bestimmen und benutzen". Nevertheless, the edition from 2006 can certainly remain in stock. After a brief introduction to the material wood with drying, cutting, grain and wood defects, 219 wood species, each presented on an A4 page, are listed alphabetically by botanical name. The always similarly structured pages contain a photo of the grain, the text includes the sections Description, Properties, Drying and Stability, Durability (including pests), Use, Origin and Health Risks. Partly supplemented by photos of workpieces. More processing-oriented and comprehensive than the otherwise comparable "Atlas of Wood Species" (ID 17/10). As a more affordable and sufficient material expert for DIYers, "Material Wood" (BA 2/03) is still recommended.

Revolution or Evolution: The End of Capitalism? : Conversation with Roman Chlupatý ¤ Social injustice, environmental destruction, and the debt and financial crisis make us question whether the market economy is the right solution to the problems of our time. Bestselling author Tomás Sedlácek ("The Economics of Good and Evil") nonetheless takes up the lance for capitalism: it is the best economic system we know. But it must be fundamentally reformed. David Graeber ("Debt: The First 5,000 Years") argues against this: capitalism is no longer reformable, it must be abolished. Our economy needs a different, fairer system.

Ubuntu 18.04 : Practical Knowledge for New and Experienced Users ¤ The Linux operating system exists in various distributions and derivatives. A very popular derivative is Ubuntu, closely related to the Debian distribution. M. Fischer is the author of a comprehensive handbook on this topic. Troche has written a very concise introduction, which is limited to essential basic knowledge. He has now updated his last title for the Ubuntu version 16.04. The LTS version 18.04 is dealt with, which again receives five years of support with updates. With this new version, the groundbreaking developments of the past few years are abandoned (Desktop system Unity and display manager Mir) and the Gnome/X-Window-Server pair returns for display and management of the work surface.

Helfen durch Rhythmik : recognizing, understanding, and treating behaviorally disturbed children ¤ The predecessor of this book (ID 7/93), which reached a total of 6 editions, was unfortunately not available for comparison. As the book provides an extensive theoretical discussion of behavioral disturbances and the possibilities of influencing them through rhythmic-musical education, as well as being very practice-oriented and containing more than 150 exercises and songs, it is recommended for broad use - deviating from the previous review.

Supply Chain Management : Fundamentals, Strategies, Instruments, and Controlling ¤ Supply Chain Management has developed into a business field with particularly significant change. Especially, large improvement potentials are suspected in a supply chain. Hartmut Werner shows concrete ways to exploit these optimization possibilities. For this, the fundamentals of supply chain management as well as modern supply-chain strategies are characterized. On this basis, instruments are presented that serve the implementation of the previously discussed strategies. These considerations culminate in a supply chain controlling. The book is very application-oriented designed and relies on a wide range of examples from practice.(Publisher's text)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4684051-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4346401-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036210-3>
Taliban : Afghanistan's God Warriors and the Jihad ¤ A depiction of the origin, history, fundamentalism, power, and financial resources of the Taliban. (Elisabeth Mair-Gummermann) Review: Ahmed Rashid, a critical Pakistani journalist, has been reporting on and from Afghanistan for 21 years. Accordingly, his book on the Taliban, these ultra-fundamentalist fighters, is by no means a quick shot, but a thoroughly well-researched, solid, serious, competent, and comprehensive presentation. He reports on the history of the Taliban government and the reasons for their success, on the relationship of the Taliban to Islam and vice versa of Muslims to the Taliban, and (very important, as new perspectives are offered here) the ruthless policy of the great powers around oil and pipelines through Afghanistan (a book on this topic has just appeared in France, causing great commotion).

Sociology from the Beginning : An Introduction to Themes, Results, and Literature ¤ This introduction aims to present 'Sociology from the Beginning'. Sociology deals with society as a product of social action. It begins with the concept of social action and aims at society. It attempts to systematically present the themes or basic concepts of sociology on the way from social action to society: social order, social differentiation, social integration, social structure, social inequality, social mobility, and social change. In addition to these themes, selected results of sociology are presented. Finally, the report on theories and results is supplemented by instructions for personal reading and further literature.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077624-4>
E-World : Technologies for the World of Tomorrow ¤ The development of new information technologies is advancing very quickly. The working world and society will change like never before. The author introduces the most important IT trends of the coming years. He does not remain on the surface, but tries to explain the backgrounds and thus to awaken a better understanding of the consequences that can arise from these developments. Problematic effects are clearly named. The author's core statement is that control over the future E-World is indispensable. Only in this way can it be guaranteed that this E-World remains a human world. Interesting, lively, and easily understandable presentation. Extensive historical references. Partly, the leading employee Frank K., a typical product of the modern, post-capitalist, global economic order, is accompanied in his work and considerations. Helpful general understandable glossary in the scope of 13 pages. Good compilation of further information (also magazine articles and addresses in the World Wide Web).

Mathematical Modeling with MATLAB® : a practical introduction ¤ Dass vorausschauende Prognosen durch mathematische Modelle gestützt werden, erfolgt in sehr unterschiedlichen Bereichen, sei es in der Wirtschaft, bei Wettervorhersagen, in der Kosmologie oder auch nur, um die optimale Flugbahn eines Balles zu bestimmen. Dazu muss eine mathematische Struktur gefunden werden, in der die Ausgangsgrößen und die bestimmenden Naturgesetze interpretiert werden können. Die Resultate mathematischer Prozesse müssen dann wieder in die Realität übersetzt werden. The text introduces the problem with a detailed case study and then deals with the topic generally and fundamentally. The numerical calculations use the routines and possibilities of the MATLAB program system, which is explained again in the appendix. The book is aimed at students in the bachelor's program, who, however, must have some mathematical knowledge, as deeper lying proofs are mostly only hinted at.

The House of the Dead : Siberian Exile under the Tsars ¤ Based on extensive studies in Russian archives, this work examines the system of exile under the tsarist regime from 1800-1917 and gives a vivid description and with many eyewitness accounts also a voice to the exiles themselves. Review: The exile 'to Siberia' presented in the German language has finally found a well-founded, scientifically based representation in this multi-award-winning book by the British historian, covering the 19th century until the fall of the tsar in 1917. Alive, with colorful access to the fate of people, Beer describes the system, function, and increasingly dysfunction of the exile system, the endless transports and archaic punishment methods, and gives with many eyewitness accounts a voice to the hordes of people exiled for political or criminal reasons to places like Chita or the island of Sakhalin: the Decembrists, the Polish insurgents of the 1st and the Russian revolutionaries of the 2nd half of the century, and finally the persecuted of the pre-war and war years from 1905 who gradually undermined the system.

Empörung : Novel ¤ He is young, decent, and diligent, he rebels once, and he pays for it with his life. Marcus Messner begins his studies at the conservative College of Winesburg in Ohio in 1951. As the Korean War enters its second year, Marcus experiences a story that deals with inexperience, resistance, sex, courage, and error. Barely is he in college when he encounters a first, completely disturbing experience with a fragile young girl, and he encounters a form of discrimination that enrages him. Against his will, Marcus becomes a rebel, against his fellow students, but also against his father - and he remains stubborn until the bitter end.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4503339-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058167-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148217-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031110-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123212-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032467-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4522377-4>
Office 2010 for Dummies : [also for Home and Student Edition ; at a glance: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Access expertly use ; stylish layout for documents and presentations ; edit tables, create formulas and analyze data ; configure e-mail accounts and create databases] ¤ In the popular "Dummies" series, two titles appear in parallel to the current Microsoft Office package: a comprehensive "all-in-one" volume by Peter Weverka (in this number) and the present introduction by Wang Wallace (last BA 1/05). Three target groups are addressed: switchers from Office 2007 get a quick overview of the new features, users of older versions such as Office 2003 or XP learn the transition to the menu bar-controlled user interface, and Office newcomers receive an introduction to the most commonly used and useful menus, functions, buttons, commands from Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, and Access. The individual programs cover both the "Home and Business Edition" and the "Home and Student Edition". Formulated in a relaxed and understandable way, with good examples for private or professional use, numerous step-by-step instructions, and informative screenshots. Recommended alongside the two almost identical introductory titles by G. Born (both BA 9/10) and the more affordable practical handbook by G. Philipp (BA 8/10).

Family Policy Concepts in a Cross-National Comparison: Stepping Stone or Obstacle for Working Mothers? ¤ The civic role distribution between the working man and the housekeeping wife no longer corresponds to the self-understanding of progressive industrial societies for decades. There is a broad consensus that the welfare state with its blessings should promote equal burden in profession and family. However, although both political science, economic, and demographic aspects speak against the breadwinner model, it is still being solidified in many places through political regulations. Nadine Stern examines the gender-political effect of German, French, and Swedish family policy. To this end, she presents central family policy regulations against each other. The result is not only country-specific findings. The author rather goes on to ask how financial regulations, childcare and care leave regulations can specifically promote the compatibility of profession and family for men and women.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040949-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069349-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016418-4>

Algorithmic Mathematics ¤ Based on a basic lecture, this work provides students of mathematics, preferably in the first semester, a compact introduction to algorithmic mathematics. Review (ekz): With the increasingly presence of high-performance computers, the importance of algorithmic mathematics is constantly increasing. It deals with the design and analysis as well as the implementation of algorithms and the development and investigation of the underlying mathematical structures. The present work, based on an introductory basic lecture, now provides students of mathematics, preferably in the first semester, a compact introduction to algorithmic mathematics. The presentation, equipped with numerous examples and illustrations, conveys the contents in a mathematically sound manner and provides a small introduction to the programming language C++, in which the implementation of numerous algorithms also takes place. Knowledge beyond school knowledge is not necessary. Nevertheless, basic competences in dealing with algorithms and first solid experiences with university mathematics significantly facilitate reading. Very useful for the target group to acquire basic knowledge in the field of algorithmic mathematics. No tasks. (3)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193909-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042805-9>

Peace in Chinese : why war threatens in Asia ¤ After Holslag, China is "a normal country with normal ambitions", whose interests, however, "are not in line with the idea of a peaceful rise". The main theses of the book are not original, yet it is a readable analysis of international relations in Asia. Review: Holslag, an expert in international politics at the Free University of Brussels, sees in China a rising country that "pursues normal ambitions and faces the normal dilemmas of war and peace". He foresees tensions and even warns of a war, because China's interests in the region, in his view, "are not in line with the idea of a peaceful rise in a complex Asian environment". This concerns China's strategic goals and those of its powerful neighbors as well as the United States, which still play a key role in Asia. Media-effectively, Holslag claims to offer a completely new look at this complex situation, in reality, his theses are not particularly original (cf. on the subject: Dirk Schmidt: "Foreign Policy and Foreign Trade of the People's Republic of China", 2012; K. Mahbubani: "The Return of Asia", 2009; W. Hirn: "The Next Cold War", 2013; A. Lorenz: "The Asian Revolution", 2011).

Paths to Technological Fascination: Socialization Trajectories and Intervention Time Points ¤ The empirically designed study is part of the interdisciplinary acatech consortium project „Monitoring of Motivation Concepts for Technological Youngsters (MoMoTech)”. It investigates conditions and prerequisites for developing and promoting technological interest in children and adolescents. The study assumes that there are phases and time points in the socialization process of children and adolescents that are significant for their (technological) socialization. Whether young people begin to be interested in technology depends on various factors that can be described as condition constellations. The study aims to collect and describe such constellations. The study collects three content complexes: skills and abilities required for understanding and dealing with technology, attitudes that influence the view of technology and dealing with it, and socialization factors that promote or hinder interest in technology (with a focus on school and family). With a view to potential intervention time points, it is investigated how relevant technical skills and attitudes change in the socialization process; special interest is given to gender specificity.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144815-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028859-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059205-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013943-8>
Understanding International Politics : An Introduction ¤ Even the 2nd, expanded edition of this university textbook on International Politics can be recommended without restriction. The unusual arrangement, explaining political theories based on current conflicts, greatly facilitates entry into the complex subject matter. Thus, when dealing with the war over Syria, the theory of the 'New Wars' (Mary Kaldor, 2007) is introduced and its analytical and prognostic statement power is checked. With glossaries, exercise questions, extensive literature references, even with relevant film tips! A model work that should be offered in libraries with a student readership.

Numerous examples and sample solutions, as well as extracts from data sheets of selected components on CD-ROM, serve as support. This is new compared to the otherwise more comprehensive previous edition "Electronic Components" by Reisch (ID 6/98), from which the present title is an excerpt. Due to the more favorable price, already for medium-sized libraries. There was otherwise nothing new on the subject in recent times. (2) (LK/W: Weinheimer-Hartmann)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113826-0>

... confronted with death suddenly : a guide for kindergartens with emergency plans, checklists, and aids for bereavement support ¤ Loss, death, and grief are recurring themes in kindergartens and pose a challenge to the pedagogical sensitivity of educators. A practical guide to supporting younger children in their grief. (Birgitta Negel-Täuber) Even small children are already confronted with death, loss, and grief. The way to deal with this in kindergarten daily life varies in intensity, depending on how close the deceased person was to the institution (e.g. the school bus driver, a caregiver dies after a long illness, stillbirth in a child's family). In accordance with the temporal course of grief work, checklists for initial reactions (who is informed?, participation in the funeral?) make a start. Short- and long-term pedagogical support, parent work, and processing of the grief case in the group with many suggestions (songs, rituals, conversations) take up the vast majority of space. A table on possible reactions of children, depending on age, a glossary around the topic of death and burial, and an excursion on burial rituals in other religions round off the practical guide. The only known comparable title is hardly still available anywhere (G. Ennulat: "Supporting children in their grief", BA 1/99), which is why it is recommended more broadly.

The Dictionary of PC Technical Terms with Correct Pronunciation : [all important computer technical terms and abbreviations especially for PC beginners and seniors ; new: terms for Windows 7 and blog language] ¤ In a reader-friendly font, this PC dictionary lists 6,000 current technical terms from the computer environment. (LK/HB: Isigkeit) Updated edition of a PC dictionary that focuses primarily on desktop PCs and laptops. The 6-year-old prequel (BA 12/04) is outdated and should be deleted. For the 6,000-entry work, a larger font was provided to improve readability, and in addition, the English terms received a phonetic supplement. Certainly a concession to the newly named target group of seniors. In addition to these formal improvements, numerous new technical terms have been introduced, including those from the environment of Windows 7 and the blog language. The inconsistency in the selection noted in the prequel is also noticeable in this edition. The appendix provides, in addition to a list of file extensions, a table of top-level domains and a reference called Netlingo with commonly used abbreviations, which appear again and again in the blog, chat, news, and forensic scenes.

Basic Course in Function Theory: An Introduction to Complex Analysis and its Applications; [for Bachelor and Diploma] ¤ Hardly any of the standard lectures at German-speaking universities has remained unchanged in its core for many years like the one on complex analysis, which was clearly shown by the recently published new edition of a nearly 100-year-old lecture notes (H. Weyl: "Introduction to Function Theory", ID 50/08). Of course, the beginnings are now more thoroughly founded, and new application areas have been added. This volume is also characterized by its subtle treatment of algebraic and topological foundations, as well as by the many cross-references shown at the end of each section. However, the central theme remains the study of holomorphic and meromorphic functions with the instrumentarium built on the Cauchy's integral theorem. A substantial final chapter deals with the geometric environment of the Riemann's mapping theorem. Various problems without solutions are inserted. Highly recommended from 2nd year of study.

Mathematics for Life Scientists: Foundations with a Focus on Statistics for the Bachelor ¤ Introduction to mathematics and statistics for the bachelor's and teacher training studies with a focus on biology. Review (ekz): To describe observations and processes in biology quantitatively, the statistical and analytical methods of mathematics are used. Adolf Riede has updated his introductory textbook from 1993 (not shown here) after years of university experience and presents the 2nd edition. More than half of the book is dedicated to statistics. Elements of differential and integral calculus are embedded, which include a repetition of the secondary school material from level II. Despite the step-by-step and example-guided presentation form, the mathematical tone remains. This makes the book particularly relevant, even if elementary, theoretical concepts are of interest, such as in teacher training studies with natural science subject combinations. It can also be used for the biological bachelor. Titles with a stronger practical focus (e.g. "Biostatistics", ID-G 49/12) or with a focus on evaluation software ("Parametric Statistics", can not be replaced in this way. Supplementing at university locations. (3)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035811-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072798-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121729-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013396-5>

Introduction to Mathematical Work ¤ Revised edition of a methodical and content-related introduction to abstract mathematical thinking and working. Review University mathematics differs massively methodically and in terms of content from school mathematics. This induces significant problems at the beginning of the mathematics study. The proven and in a 3rd, revised edition (1st edition: 2009) available introduction to mathematical work originates from the teaching practice of an introductory phase of study. It provides, taking into account the problematic initial situation, preferably first-year mathematics students with a competent methodical and content-related introduction to abstract mathematical thinking and working and conveys, in addition to central basic techniques, conventions, and knowledge for the representation of mathematical facts, also some contents of the 1st study section. With numerous examples and tasks. Very helpful for a successful university entry. References to explanatory videos round off the 3rd edition.

How the Locomotive Depot Works ¤ In BA 8/99 the book "The Steam Locomotive in the Locomotive Depot" and in BA 12/01 the title "Diesel- and Electric Locomotives in the Locomotive Depot" (both written by M. U. Kratzsch-Leichsenring) were recommended for purchase. If these two books are available and not yet worn out, they can be used further. Transpress has incorporated the new volume into its "How it works..." series (so far: D. Endisch: "How the Steam Locomotive Works", BA 4/04; S. Alkofer: "How the Diesel Locomotive Works", BA 8/05 and E. Preuß: "How Railway Signaling Systems Work", BA 1/06), but offers little new compared to the two comparison volumes. Some sections are even based on the older books, with steam locomotives dominating the content. Not even the facilities for electric multiple units, which differ significantly from those for locomotives, for example in S-Bahn or ICE trains, are addressed. Therefore, the book is only recommended if the books mentioned at the beginning are not in stock or replacement purchases are necessary. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014027-1>
Themes and Theses of Critical Social Theory: A Compendium ¤ The book informs about the themes and theses of the older critical theory. From this, the numerous changes and rejections of this project can be assessed. Adorno's theory is in the foreground and it is shown that it is centrally designed as a dialectical social theory, although there are surprising interpretations that operate the dialectic out of Adorno's theory. The central thesis is: Despite all contrary interpretations, criticism can still refer to Adorno with good reasons today. From the older 'Frankfurt School' so many branches have developed in the meantime that it is no longer possible to equate a uniform critical theory with it. This book briefly summarizes the essential themes and theses of the original project. The position of Theodor W. Adorno is emphasized because he has anchored social criticism throughout in a dialectical theory of society, although there are surprising Adorno interpretations today that operate the references to dialectics out of him. A central thesis of this book is: Despite all further developments and fractionalization of the original program, the underlying connection lines to the original project of a dialectical social theory are still preserved in the understanding of 'criticism'.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073840-1>

Stalking : [obsessive Harassment and Pursuit, Celebrities and Ordinary Citizens as Stalking Victims, Offender Typologies, Psychological Backgrounds] ; with 8 Illustrations and 12 Tables ¤ Following H. Dreßing's scientific monograph "Stalking!" (ID 37/05), this is another specialist documentation. The forensic psychologist Jens Hoffmann, according to the publisher "the" German stalking expert, presents here the results of his dissertation in an extended form. The content framework is similar to Dreßing's collection (in which Hoffmann was involved), but in differentiation and focus setting further developed. For, in addition to the forms and psychological causes and backgrounds as well as offender and victim typologies and intervention measures, this volume is characterized by special accents: by the presentation of the state of knowledge in intercultural comparison, by the focus on "celebrity stalking", the discussion of the erotomania ("love madness"-)-concept in stalking, the handling of stalking victims and perpetrators as well as special cases: the alleged stalking victim or cyber- (i.e. internet-) stalking.

Strategies of State and Regional Planning for Coping with Demographic Change: A Project of the Research Programme "General Departmental Research" of the Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development (BMVBS) and the Federal Office for Building and Regional Planning (BBR) ¤ In the end, the effects of demographic change play a special role in most federal states in the preparation, revision or reorientation of the spatial development plans. The intensity of dealing with demographic change and the orientation of the strategies and instruments of state planning on the consequences reflect the pressure to act in the countries. The states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, Saxony and Saarland, as well as in partial regions of Rhineland-Palatinate and Lower Saxony, have newly established their state development plans/programs or are in the process of doing so, all with the explicit goal of reacting to the consequences of demographic change in the form of population decline and aging.[...] (Source: BBR)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034268-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049040-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006292-2>

Rational choice : theoretical analyses and empirical results ; Festschrift for Karl-Dieter Opp on his 70th birthday ¤ In sociology, rational-choice (RC) explanations are increasingly widespread. They are intended to contribute to a solution to general theoretical core problems (explanation of social order, cooperation, and social norms) on the one hand. On the other hand, RC theory now dominates numerous fields of empirical research. In this volume, renowned authors describe the extensive theoretical and empirical application possibilities. A focus of the theoretical works are analyses of social norms. The empirical contributions and applications deal with a broad spectrum of topics, including deviant behavior sociology, political sociology, and terrorism analysis. The essays are rounded off by methodological considerations. The volume provides students and researchers with a comprehensive orientation on the important lines of development of this research program.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055916-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274923-2>

Radically Just: How the Unconditional Basic Income Revolutionizes the Welfare State ¤ Our social system is at an end. It cannot be reformed, says Hamburg economist Professor Thomas Straubhaar. But it can be revolutionized: through the unconditional basic income. If all people, from infants to the elderly, receive a basic income, this does not enslave them, but frees them to self-sufficiency and their own decisions. And the state invests no longer in the administration of scarcity, but in a just equal treatment of all. Sounds too good to be financially feasible? -On the contrary, it is possible, as Straubhaar calculates. The unconditional basic income is a liberal, effective, and social way to bring justice and efficiency to a social system that has gotten out of balance - and thus contribute significantly to inner peace. Germany should dare to try this experiment as one of the largest and most stable economies in the world!	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055722-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055896-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123252-5>

Generationen-Management : Concepts, Instruments, Best-Practice Approaches ¤ Publisher's information: Studies show that companies experience the change in age structure, but also the change in wishes within the workforce as the first consequences of demographic change. Despite this, the priority in demographic management is often still on health promotion and talent acquisition. However, this is not enough to build a competitive workforce sustainably. Leadership and work organization not only determine the working ability, but also the commitment of employees. Systematic generation management creates the framework conditions to position the company as an attractive employer for all relevant employee groups and thus derive competitive advantages from a diversity of generations. In this context, three fields of action appear to be essential: shaping organizational and labor policy framework conditions, promoting lifelong performance capability, and strengthening intergenerational appreciation and cooperation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4215762-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061963-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006292-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045269-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4240300-5>
In Focus: Natural Resources: In Search of Raw Materials ¤ The collection, created in collaboration with the newly established 'German Raw Materials Agency' and the 'Federal Institute for Geosciences', contains 17 essays and interviews that deal with the impending scarcity of energy raw materials, minerals, and ores. The authors also analyze how Germany, as a country with limited raw materials, can ensure its supply. Although it is not a systematic representation, a wide range of topics are covered. They range from increasingly important rare earths (with 'We're consuming ourselves to death', ID-A 50/11) to the search for unconventional gas fields (on gas 'Energy in 60 minutes', ID-B 46/11) to manganese nodules, diamonds, copper, salt, and coal. In comparison to the conference proceedings 'Energy and Raw Materials' (ID-G 40/11), the essays are easier to read and take into account environmental policy aspects.

Introduction to Mathematical Work ¤ The way mathematics is taught at higher schools differs radically from the way mathematics is taught at universities. While in school mathematics, mostly schemes for solving standard problems are in the foreground, mathematics as a science is mainly concerned with abstract structures. These are defined by as few basic attributes as possible, and further valid properties as well as cross-references to other structures are derived in proofs by logical conclusions. There is probably hardly a subject where a broader and deeper chasm between school and university has to be overcome, and many students are already at risk of failing in the first weeks at this transition. The "Introduction to Mathematical Work" bridges this chasm by placing the "How" on an equal footing with the "What" in the transmission of the typical contents of the first study phase.

State Failures at the Highest Level: What Must Change After the Mollath Case ¤ Even in the rule of law, there are wrongful judgments and/or isolation of uncomfortable people in forensic psychiatry: This has made the Mollath case clear to a broad public. Especially the internet is full of outrage, revelations, and solidarity. That Mollath was released in August 2013 after 7 years is due to the long efforts of a support group, alone Mollath was defenseless. He wanted to uncover money laundering transactions, was brought to court by defamation, and was classified as a public danger through a fatal collaboration of justice, questionable psychiatric reports, as well as the concealment of economic crime and the failure of politics. In enlightening reports and statements from lawyers, doctors, and engaged journalists, connections, shortcomings, and diagnosis problems are explained, reforms are demanded, and the long way to the re-trial is described (March 2014). Chronology; Notes. - Usable everywhere alongside U. Ritzer (ID-A 27/13) due to even more precise research and expert assessments.

Digitalization in Care: Supporting Better Work Organization ¤ This book systematically focuses on the approaches of digitalization that improve work organization in care and thus have the potential to contribute to higher job satisfaction of care workers. Digitalization in care is currently being very controversially discussed. "Will care workers in the future be replaced by care robots?" Such and similar headlines raise far-reaching ethical questions and do not contribute to making the potential that digitalization offers for the care industry visible. This book deals with approaches to digitalization that support care workers in their daily work or also increase the quality of life of care recipients. The presented approaches were scientifically founded and have proven themselves in practice. The book also shows how the process of digital transformation in care can be successfully implemented - namely in a way that the employees in care are designers of their own change process from the beginning. The editors Dr. Vanessa Kubek is a Diplom-Politologin, graduated in economics at the TU Kaiserslautern and is a systemic consultant (DGSF), systemic coach and organizational developer (SG/DGSF). Dr. Sebastian Velten studied economics and mathematics at the TU Kaiserslautern and graduated in economics at the University of Saarland in Saarbrücken.

Roof Stages ¤ Publisher's text: The roof is the primal form of human dwellings, where wood as a building material for roof constructions still holds an enormous significance in residential construction. Due to its low weight, fast assembly, elementarity, and modern connection technology, wooden roof stages will also be used in the future. The book provides an overview of the common construction systems used in old and new buildings, up to special forms, roof dormers, and modern constructions. Similarly, constructive approaches are shown and explained, as well as hints given to analyze the inventory and set constructive measures to enable later roof space use. Furthermore, the principles of roof stiffening are explained and construction proposals are given.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148724-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148729-1>

Don't be Afraid - Write! : The Hero Method for Home and Thesis Work ¤ Katja Reinicke, independent writing coach and lecturer for scientific writing, presents the 'Hero Method' she developed, which supports students in writing their thesis work. In particular, it is about providing assistance in overcoming writing blocks and fears, in order to find one's way into the writing process and come to a first rough outline of the work. Methods for idea finding and structuring as well as concrete formulation aids are presented. The individual exercise units are set up according to a 'dramaturgy' with concrete scenarios, which each contain a brief introduction, tasks, case examples, and (very detailed) scientific background information. The program is certainly most effective in a writing workshop or in personal writing coaching. - Additionally available in larger quantities alongside classical titles on scientific writing such as Daniela Weber: The Successful Thesis for Dummies (2017). Writing blocks are also discussed by Helga Esselborn-Krumbiegel: Tips and Tricks for Writing Blocks (2015)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133161-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184945-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058216-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4199679-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116418-0>
Information Behavior in the Choice of Studies and Vocational Training: Eligible Students 2012 Half a Year Before and Half a Year After Graduation ¤ To prepare for studies or training, prospective students eligible for studies mainly consider online offers and personal conversations helpful. Especially popular are easily accessible information sources such as online portals for the choice of studies and vocational training, university or company homepages, as well as print media. In their personal environment, in addition to friends and siblings, parents are important contact partners in matters of education and study planning. In comparison to previous cohorts, students eligible for studies in 2012 inform themselves earlier about the possibilities of studies and vocational training and also rate their information status as more comprehensive half a year before graduation.

The Beginner's Seminar - CorelDRAW X4 ¤ CorelDRAW Graphics Suite is a graphics software primarily distributed on Windows systems, which has experienced strong competition from Adobe programs, primarily distributed in the prepress stage, Illustrator and FreeHand, and no longer has the importance of earlier years. This is also evident in the reaction of the book market, as the series title for the previous version X3 by the same authors (BA 10/06) was the only title on the topic that could be discussed here. The new version X4 does not contain fundamental changes compared to X3, yet the predecessor title was carefully revised within the proven series in the learn-practice-apply concept with unchanged structure and above all updated by exchanging screenshots. The scope has increased by around 50 pages, which is partly due to a somewhat more generous layout. The book trade currently offers no alternatives for the new version, so the new purchase is mandatory there where each program version is to be documented, otherwise the predecessor still provides good services.

Philosophical Foundations of the Natural Sciences: A Critique of Scientism ¤ The book is an attempt to overcome the dichotomy between the humanities and the natural sciences with a general theory of the mind. On this background, it is shown, inter alia, that Adorno and Habermas have theoretical intersections with Einstein and Heisenberg, which have been overlooked in previous debates. In other words: Not being able to talk to electrons does not rule out methodological unity.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019838-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117665-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128283-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041421-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4323577-3>
Violence in Schools: Pedagogical Answers to a Social Crisis ¤ An up-to-date analysis of the manifestations and causes of violence among students, combined with proposals for pedagogical measures and programs. Hurrelmann (most recently BA 4/04, see also "Youth 2006", BA 12/06) and Bründel (most recently BA 11/05) analyze the manifestations and causes of aggression and violence among students and show that the school itself can also be involved in the emergence of violence, for example through excessive performance pressure. They also clearly show that the school is at the same time a particularly suitable institution for the prevention of violence and present numerous measures and programs for this purpose, such as sensitization and violence prevention programs. A well-founded, perfectly suitable overview for updating the existing state. Primarily for teachers and other pedagogically active professionals in the school, and also for interested parents.

Iran. Interrupted : . [Trans.: Susanne Baghestani ; Benjamin Carter] ¤ Beatrice Minda (*1968 in Munich) is repeatedly concerned with the relationship between private space, memory, and history. Following the expressive exploration of Romanian interiors in her photo book Innenwelt, the artist travels to the Islamic Republic of Iran for her new work. There, she immerses herself in the largely unknown world of private Persian living spaces and inner courtyards, including their enclosures by grilles, walls, or impenetrable curtains. In a country with a history spanning thousands of years, Beatrice Minda follows the trail of a partially heavily buried tradition and identifies – despite all historical breaks – hidden signs of continuity. In the sensitive color photographs, it becomes visible and tangible how the current mindset of the inhabitants, as well as historical, cultural, and social connections, are reflected in the private space. Subtly, this brings the socio-political dimension of Iran. Interrupted to the fore.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066768-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045895-7>
Islam in the Media: Journalistic Quality in the Struggle over the Mohammed Cartoons ¤ Islam has become a top theme in the media in Germany. Almost daily, the German press reports on the integration of Muslims or developments in Muslim-dominated countries. The reporting thus determines the social discourse and decisively influences political debates. Reports without tendentious representations and evaluations are therefore urgently needed. Is there a need for action here? Based on journalistic quality criteria, Fabian Wahl examines the reporting in three German daily newspapers on the example of the dispute over the Mohammed cartoons. With the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the BILD-Zeitung, and the Bonner General-Anzeiger, he covers the entire spectrum from the nationwide quality newspaper to the opinion-forming tabloid to the independent regional newspaper. Empirically, the author checks the aspects of diversity, impartiality, accuracy, transparency, and understandability.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4351632-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126889-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029670-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067510-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005709-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047966-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028779-8>
The Heidelberg Karl-Theodor Globe from 1751 to 2000: Preserving the Past with Present Methods for the Future ¤ A successful example of a lively collaboration with different disciplines is illustrated by the restoration of this important cultural asset: The Heidelberg example of a Vaugondy globe from 1751 has a varied history and was recently restored with modern methods. Historical sources on the production of globes were consulted just as much as modern mathematical procedures from image processing, with which the digitized world map was filtered. In addition, an insight into the importance of globes and the emergence of a new world view in the 18th century, which was accompanied by the scientific academies, was gained in the confrontation with historical aspects.

Collected Poems ¤ Ulla Hahn has since the surprise success of her first poetry collection "Heart Over Head" in 1981 published 9 further lyric collections at irregular intervals (most recently "Re-words", ID-A 37/11). She is now considered one of the most successful German lyricists. The "Collected Poems" contain a reprint of all 10 poetry collections published by Ulla Hahn over the past three decades, supplemented by unpublished poems, an informative afterword, notes and index. The nearly 880-page volume provides a good overview of the development of the lyricist and the change of her themes. It also shows that Ulla Hahn has remained true to her unique lyrical language, the ironically broken game with conventional forms, as well as to her major life theme: the question of the possibility of love in a rationally ordered world. In view of the popularity of Ulla Hahn as a lyricist and as a storyteller (most recently "Breakthrough", BA 11/09), the complete edition should already be offered in medium-sized libraries. (Ronald Schneider) The comprehensive collection of the entire lyrical work of the successful German writer (born 1946), published in individual volumes between 1981 and 2011, is supplemented by unpublished poems, an informative afterword, notes and index.

Raspberry Pi : the comprehensive handbook ¤ In addition to the numerous titles on the Raspberry Pi minicomputer (most recently Simon Monk), this book stands out from the three known authors in terms of scope and breadth of topics. It covers almost the entire range of topics and addresses both experienced RaspPi enthusiasts and beginners equally. In addition to special RaspPi knowledge, the book also conveys basics on the topics of electrical engineering, hardware, and programming. The now available 4th edition shows only minor differences from the predecessor. A comprehensive update led to adjustments in some subchapters and subheadings. Now the Raspberry Pi Zero W is taken into account (update of the stripped-down Raspberry Pi Zero), there are changes in SSH configuration, and new hardware components (fingerprint and fine-tipped sensors, Pimoroni Zero LiPo expansion board, etc.) have been added.

12 x 12 Key Concepts in Mathematics ¤ The present book deals with and explains in 12 chapters important mathematical concept formations, methods, ideas, and results for mathematics students who are currently in their first semesters with numerous basic definitions, concepts, and statements. As a study-accompanying reading, it aims to provide orientation and help understand exemplary mathematical results and their characteristics, but also to enable a repetition of central concepts of basic lectures as well as first insights into still unknown areas. This is achieved by the authors through a very accessible semi-formal representation of important key concepts, including number theory, algebra, analysis, numerics, stochastic, set theory, and logic, which every student will encounter at some point during their studies. The work is bound to the study and not suitable for preparation for this or as an introduction, such as that by O. Deiser (BA 7/10) or H. Schichl (ID 49/09).

Linguistics : Grammar - Interaction - Cognition ¤ Comprehensive foundational work of linguistics for students. Contains many exercises, graphics, and tables. (Katharina Perlbach) A foundational work of linguistics, conceived as a community work by several authors, each specialists in the field they describe. The book covers almost the entire field of linguistics, from topics such as "Sounds" or "Words" to "Multilingualism" or "Language and Culture". In general, it is about what human language is exactly, and how it can be analyzed. As the publisher states, the target group are students of the subject linguistics, for whom it will certainly be practical that exercises for deepening the various thematic areas are offered in the individual chapters. The clearly written book should be acquired by all public libraries that count students among their regular customers. Also recently published on the topic of linguistics is Anke Lüdeling: "Foundations of Linguistics" (Klett Verlag; ID-G 52/13).

Socialization through Reading in the Media Society: A Research Overview ¤ Publisher's text: This volume provides a comprehensive overview of the research on socialization through reading. Initially, the positive evaluation of socialization through reading is normatively justified by referring to the functions associated with reading. In addition to the immediate functions of entertainment and information, the book focuses particularly on the subsequent functions of the development of primary imagination and linguistic differentiation, through argumentative communication, empathy and moral development, etc., up to the maintenance of cultural memory. - The currently still open research questions are finally approached in relation to the relationship between socialization through reading and media society. In total, the question is answered on the basis of the presented systematization of the state of research, whether reading can still be considered a central key qualification in media society.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4463850-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130705-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028859-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055783-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120719-1>
Market Research : Methods, Applications, Practical Examples ¤ Trends and risks to be recognized early, this is an important goal of market research. The book presents the essential methods and application areas for this purpose, starting with planning (i.e. the selection of the research approach, the determination of the sampling plan and the selection of the data collection procedure) to the implementation of the survey (i.e. data collection, evaluation and interpretation of the results). It also considers qualitative research methods in addition to quantitative ones - explicitly and comprehensively. Furthermore, newer procedures, especially from neuroscience, are part of the 3rd edition. In addition, this book deals with product, advertising, and price research. It also deals with digital media, Big Data, and ethical questions. The book is equally directed at students, researchers, and practitioners. The clarity and comprehensibility of the content are therefore in the foreground. (Publisher's text)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037630-8>

Juristischer Gutachtenstil : a textbook and workbook ¤ A textbook and workbook that introduces law students not only to the style of writing expert opinions, but also informs them about the structure and composition of expert opinions. Review: The book by the lecturer at the University of Bielefeld is, in the best sense, a textbook and workbook. It introduces students not only to the style of writing expert opinions, but also illuminates the content of expert opinions. It deals with questions such as: "Why do I draw a syllogistic conclusion?", "Why do I form a major premise?", "How do I develop a definition?". In the end, the author draws attention to the special features of expert opinions in criminal law, civil law, and public law. Students are directly encouraged to work on the short exercises in the book. Therefore, entries are to be expected. The solutions to the tasks can be found in the appendix. The title should be offered everywhere where law students belong to the clientele. A comparable title is not known.

Gender Relations in School ¤ Abstract: Learning in school takes place within structural framework conditions and is always dependent on the actors involved. Students and teachers make different experiences in this environment with their interaction partners and with the structural conditions of school life. In this book, Monika Stürzer, Henrike Roisch, Annette Hunze, and Waltraud Cornelissen analyze these connections on the basis of the current state of research, related to academic achievements, interests, interaction forms and processes. They also address the debate on coeducation and provide an overview of the structural gender distribution within school organization. The results of research on gender role stereotypes in schoolbooks are discussed and the gender-differentiating research on the use of new media in school is sketched. In addition, the authors critically reflect on the presented research results and check their current validity.

Information systems are the basis of Building Information Modelling, BIM. Connected information and continuously connected model data are the basis of collaborative building. They allow transparent control and reliable risk management. Multimodels are connected information. The basics and methods of BIM and multimodels are explained, and it is shown how a process-oriented management with multimodels brings new quality to the planning and control of construction processes. The continuous BIM working method with connected information allows construction process simulations to be performed in the shortest time. In addition to the virtual building, a virtual construction site in virtual reality also provides important new impressions for construction management. Construction management information becomes transparent, comprehensible, and graspable at once. Volume 1 focuses on the basics of the models and their extension through link models, on the methods for BIM and multimodel data such as filtering, visualizing, and on the processes, their fast configuration, and process-based planning and management, as well as information logistics, which is just gaining new approaches and qualities through multimodels, while Volume 2 shows illustrative applications in construction site planning, construction process simulation, construction project, and risk management.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072806-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4353072-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004704-0>

Culture and Pedagogical Reform: On the Relevance of Humanistic Education ¤ This book starts from an analysis of the spiritual situation of the time as the time of transition into a globalized civilization, whose characteristics are the overwhelming economization of all life relationships, the dominance of the natural sciences that are available to humans, the overwhelming technologization of societies, the lack of a European consciousness based on Christian antiquity, and the reduction of human existence to the religious dimension. From there, it is shown that the reforms initiated under the names of PISA and Bologna Process are inadequate to meet the time-conditioned challenges. From there again, it is argued why only a pedagogical reform with the contents of a modern humanism that actualizes traditions is able to equip people to face the immense threats. The connection between culture and education is made clear at the concepts of 'beauty', 'leisure' and 'community sense', at the polarity of pre-Socratic and postmodern, and at the example of Goethe for a lifelong educational effort. The necessary contents of a humanism that shapes all schools at all age levels are described and justified from the spiritual situation of the time.

Spatial implications of the European Monetary Union ¤ With the beginning of the year 1999, a further important step towards deeper integration of Europe took place: The European Monetary Union (EMU) was put into force. Undoubtedly, this has, beside other effects, also considerable effects on the economic geography of the integrating area. Possible and probable spatial effects of EMU was the motive to establish an international working group within the ARL-DATAR (Délégation à l'Aménagement du Territoire et à l'Action Régionale) cooperation agreement in order to shed some light on these effects. The present volume consists of papers having been elaborated by members of the working group. Considerations are made with regard to - consequences for the regions of a changed relationship in which countries being members of the euro-zone stand to each other, - macroeconomic consequences for regions of their being a member of EMU, - effects of the possible concentration of industrial activities in regions and of trends towards specialisation of regions in certain industries, - effects of EMU using a multiregional general equilibrium model, - distinguishing between static and dynamic effects of the Euro. Based on these deliberations recommendations are formulated and spatial orientated policy conclusions are given even though one fear seems to be unfounded: the aim of territorial cohesion in the EU seems not to be touched systematically by the common currency in a negative way.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188829-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049043-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076605-6>

Squimera : a live, Smalltalk-based IDE for dynamic programming languages ¤ BEGIN Software development tools that work and behave consistently across different programming languages are helpful for developers, because they do not have to familiarize themselves with new tooling whenever they decide to use a new language. Also, being able to combine multiple programming languages in a program increases reusability, as developers do not have to recreate software frameworks and libraries in the language they develop in and can reuse existing software instead. However, developers often have a broad choice with regard to tools, some of which are designed for only one specific programming language. Various Integrated Development Environments have support for multiple languages, but are usually unable to provide a consistent programming experience due to different features of language runtimes. Furthermore, common mechanisms that allow reuse of software written in other languages usually use the operating system or a network connection as the abstract layer. Tools, however, often cannot support such indirections well and are therefore less useful in debugging scenarios for example. In this report, we present a novel approach that aims to improve the programming experience with regard to working with multiple high-level programming languages. As part of this approach, we reuse the tools of a Smalltalk programming environment for other languages and build a multi-language virtual execution environment which is able to provide the same runtime capabilities for all languages. The prototype system Squimera is an implementation of our approach and demonstrates that it is possible to reuse development tools, so that they behave in the same way across all supported programming languages. In addition, it provides convenient means to reuse and even mix software libraries and frameworks written in different languages without breaking the debugging experience.

Market Competition in the Nuclear Industry ¤ Nuclear power plants require a wide variety of specialised equipment, materials and services for their construction, operation and fuelling. There has been much consolidation and retrenchment in the nuclear industry since the 1980s, with the emergence of some large global nuclear companies. Electricity market liberalisation in many OECD countries has meanwhile placed nuclear plant operators under increased competitive pressure. These structural changes in both the producer and consumer sides of the nuclear industry have had implications for the level of competition in the nuclear engineering and fuel cycle markets. With renewed expansion of nuclear power now anticipated, this study examines competition in the major nuclear industry sectors at present, and how this may change with a significant upturn in demand.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027415-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123502-2>

Investigating safety impact of center line rumble strips, lane conversion, roundabout, and J-turn features on Louisiana highways ¤ Over the past several years, Louisiana has installed quite a few relatively new crash countermeasures, such as center line rumble strips (CLRS) on rural two-lane highways, restriping four-lane undivided roadways to three-lane or five-lane roadways with center lane for left turns, restricting median openings on high speed corridors (RCUT), and roundabouts. Evaluating the effectiveness of these crash countermeasures is crucial for the state highway safety improvement programs. According to the results of this study, these four countermeasures are generally cost-effective and successful in reducing crashes, particularly severe crashes. Estimated crash modification factors (CMFs) for total crashes are 0.83 for CLRS by the Empirical Bayes (EB) method. The CMF for the lane conversion to three and five-lane highways are 0.61 and 0.70 by EB method for segment, and 0.69 and 0.76 by Improved Prediction Method for segment plus intersection. The CMF for RCUT is 0.86 and 0.69 by Improved Prediction Method for RCUT section and intersection only. The CMF for RCUT intersection only is 0.80 by EB method. The CMF for roundabout with stop-sign on minor street (without layout change) is 0.32 and 0.28 by Improved Prediction and EB method. Except roundabout, the ratio of benefit to cost (B/C) is bigger or much bigger than one. Being the most expensive countermeasure, the B/C ratio of roundabout is less than one, but that estimation did not count the benefit from the improved traffic flow performance (reduced delay or saving in travel time) and long-time safety benefits (only three after years).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062962-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7727649-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4331587-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197414-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4222416-0>

The Motel in America ¤ In The Motel in America, John Jakle, Keith Sculle, and Jefferson Rogers take an informative and entertaining look at the history, architecture, and business of motels in the United States. Like Jakle and Sculle's acclaimed The Gas Station in America, this book explores the effect on American culture as citizens became motorists. The new breed of automobile traveler rejected the hotels of the railroad era, which were located in congested downtown areas and lacked adequate parking. Instead, they came to favor the roadside lodgings outside city limits which came to be known as motels, a term first used in Arthur Heineman's Milestone Mo-tel, opened in San Luis Obispo, California, in 1926. The popularity of motels grew steadily throughout the century, booming after the Second World War and reaching a peak in 1961, when there were some 61,000 motels operating throughout the country, the vast majority of them independently owned. These motels were an integral part of the American landscape, shaping their guests' ideas about modern living, introducing Americans to the consumer novelties of the age: color televisions, automatic coffee makers, shag rugs, even residential swimming pools. By the 1980s, most of the country's 40,000 motel establishments were affiliated with referral and franchise chains, reflecting the traveler's need for uniform quality and the entrepreneur's desire for regional or national recognition. The history of the motel, from autocamp to franchise, has long been overlooked. Although motels have come to be taken for granted, they illustrate much that is central to the American experience. In The Motel in America, motels at last receive the careful interpretation they deserve.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4691631-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076001-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160693-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025922-5>

Topology of digital images : visual pattern discovery in proximity spaces ¤ This book carries forward recent work on visual patterns and structures in digital images and introduces a near set-based a topology of digital images. Visual patterns arise naturally in digital images viewed as sets of non-abstract points endowed with some form of proximity (nearness) relation. Proximity relations make it possible to construct uniform topologies on the sets of points that constitute a digital image. In keeping with an interest in gaining an understanding of digital images themselves as a rich source of patterns, this book introduces the basics of digital images from a computer vision perspective. In parallel with a computer vision perspective on digital images, this book also introduces the basics of proximity spaces. Not only the traditional view of spatial proximity relations but also the more recent descriptive proximity relations are considered. The beauty of the descriptive proximity approach is that it is possible to discover visual set patterns among sets that are non-overlapping and non-adjacent spatially. By combining the spatial proximity and descriptive proximity approaches, the search for salient visual patterns in digital images is enriched, deepened and broadened. A generous provision of Matlab and Mathematica scripts are used in this book to lay bare the fabric and essential features of digital images for those who are interested in finding visual patterns in images. The combination of computer vision techniques and topological methods lead to a deep understanding of images.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4768168-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4470226-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188417-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006684-8>

Interval probabilistic timed graph transformation systems ¤ The formal modeling and analysis is of crucial importance for software development processes following the model based approach. We present the formalism of Interval Probabilistic Timed Graph Transformation Systems (IPTGTSs) as a high-level modeling language. This language supports structure dynamics (based on graph transformation), timed behavior (based on clocks, guards, resets, and invariants as in Timed Automata (TA)), and interval probabilistic behavior (based on Discrete Interval Probability Distributions). That is, for the probabilistic behavior, the modeler using IPTGTSs does not need to provide precise probabilities, which are often impossible to obtain, but rather provides a probability range instead from which a precise probability is chosen nondeterministically. In fact, this feature on capturing probabilistic behavior distinguishes IPTGTSs from Probabilistic Timed Graph Transformation Systems (PTGTSs) presented earlier. Following earlier work on Interval Probabilistic Timed Automata (IPTA) and PTGTSs, we also provide an analysis tool chain for IPTGTSs based on inter-formalism transformations. In particular, we provide in our tool AutoGraph a translation of IPTGTSs to IPTA and rely on a mapping of IPTA to Probabilistic Timed Automata (PTA) to allow for the usage of the Prism model checker. The tool Prism can then be used to analyze the resulting PTA w.r.t. probabilistic real-time queries asking for worst-case and best-case probabilities to reach a certain set of target states in a given amount of time.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4713349-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4396978-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121894-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4238872-7>

Regional disparities in small countries ¤ This book challenges the common perception that significant regional disparities do not exist in small countries. As small developed countries become increasingly competitive and their economic structures resemble those of the large, a re-assessment of the regional consequences of these changes is of timely importance. Regional Disparities in Small Countries presents a systematic discussion of the unique theoretical, methodological and measurement challenges in analyzing regional inequalities in small countries and a series of empirical analyses addressing the issue of regional convergence and divergence in these countries. With contributions from leading regional scientists and economists, this book also examines the policy experience of small countries in closing regional gaps and the effectiveness of public interventions in this field.

The logic of violence in civil war ¤ By analytically decoupling war and violence, this book explores the causes and dynamics of violence in civil war. Against prevailing views that such violence is either the product of impenetrable madness or a simple way to achieve strategic objectives, the book demonstrates that the logic of violence in civil war has much less to do with collective emotions, ideologies, cultures, or 'greed and grievance' than currently believed. Stathis Kalyvas distinguishes between indiscriminate and selective violence and specifies a novel theory of selective violence: it is jointly produced by political actors seeking information and individual noncombatants trying to avoid the worst but also grabbing what opportunities their predicament affords them.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008784-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020832-1>

Basics of aerothermodynamics ¤ The basics of aerothermodynamics are treated in this book with special regard to the fact that outer surfaces of hypersonic vehicles primarily are radiation cooled. The implications of this fact are different for different vehicle classes. In any case the properties of both attached viscous and separated flows are of importance in this regard. After a discussion of flight environment and transport phenomena in general, the most important aerothermodynamic phenomena are treated. Thermal surface effects are particularly considered, taking into account both radiation cooling and/or active cooling, for example of inner surfaces. Finally the simulation means of aerothermodynamics are discussed. Computational methods and their modelling problems as well as the problems of ground facility and flight simulation, including the hot experimental technique, are treated.

Vehicle Propulsion Systems : Introduction to Modeling and Optimization ¤ In this book the longitudinal behavior of road vehicles is analyzed. The main emphasis is on the analysis and minimization of the fuel and energy consumption. Most approaches to this problem enhance the complexity of the vehicle system by adding components such as electrical motors or storage devices. Such a complex system can only be designed by means of mathematical models. This text gives an introduction to the modeling and optimization problems typically encountered when designing new propulsion systems for passenger cars. It is intended for persons interested in the analysis and optimization of classical and novel vehicle propulsion systems. Its focus lies on the control-oriented mathematical description of the physical processes and on the model-based optimization of the system structure and of the supervisory control algorithms. This text has evolved from a lecture series at ETH Zurich. Prerequisites are general engineering topics and a first course in optimal control theory.

Set-valued mappings and enlargements of monotone operators ¤ Set-valued analysis is an essential tool for the mathematical formulation of many real-life situations, e.g., equilibrium theory in mathematical economics. This work offers the first comprehensive treatment in book form of the fairly new subdiscipline of enlargements of maximal monotone operators, including several important new results in the field. In the last decades, with the development of nonsmooth optimization, effective algorithms have been developed to solve these kinds of problems, such as nonsmooth variational inequalities. Several of these methods, such as bundle methods for variational problems, are fully developed and analyzed in this book. The first chapters provide a self-contained review of the basic notions and fundamental results in set-valued analysis, including set convergence and continuity of set-valued mappings together with many important results in infinite-dimensional convex analysis, leading to the classical fixed point results due to Ekeland, Caristi and Kakutani. Next, an in-depth introduction to monotone operators is developed, emphasizing results related to maximality of subdifferentials and of sums of monotone operators. Building on this foundational material, the second part of the monograph contains new results (all of them established during the last decade) on the concept of enlargements of monotone operators, with applications to variational inequalities, bundle-type methods, augmented Lagrangian methods, and proximal point algorithms	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137027-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4401290-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138566-4>

Fighting unemployment : the limits of free market orthodoxy ¤ With much of Europe plagued by high levels of unemployment, it has become widely accepted that the culprit is labor market rigidity and that the prescription can only be labor market deregulation: lower wages, higher earnings inequality, greater decentralization in bargaining, less generous unemployment benefits, more hiring flexibility, and less job security. Fighting Unemployment critically assesses this free market orthodoxy. With cross-country statistical analyses and country case studies, leading economists from seven North American and European countries contend that this conventional wisdom has greatly exaggerated the extent to which the unemployment problem can be blamed on protective labor market institutions and that the case for dismantling the welfare state to fight unemployment rests more on free market ideology than on the empirical evidence. The larger message of this book is that fundamentally different labor market models - ranging from the 'American Model' to the much more regulated and coordinated Scandinavian systems - are compatible with low unemployment.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005982-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002737-5>

Maize cobs and cultures : history of Zea mays L. ¤ Our perceptions and conceptions regarding the roles and importance of maize to ancient economies is largely a product of scientific research on the plant itself, developed for the most part out of botanical research, and its recent role as one of the most important economic staples in the world. Anthropological research in the early part of the last century based largely upon the historical particularistic approach of the Boasian tradition provided the first evidence that challenged the assumptions about the economic importance of maize to sociocultural developments for scholars of prehistory. Subsequent ethnobotanic and archaeological studies showed that the role of maize among Native American cultures was much more complex than just as a food staple. In Maize cobs and cultures, John Staller provides a survey of the ethnohistory and the scientific, botanical and biological research of maize, complemented by reviews on the ethnobotanic, interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary methodologies	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037135-9>

Embedded systems design : the ARTIST roadmap for research and development ¤ This extensive and increasing use of embedded systems and their integration in everyday products mark a significant evolution in information science and technology. Nowadays embedded systems design is subject to seamless integration with the physical and electronic environment while meeting requirements like reliability, availability, robustness, power consumption, cost, and deadlines. Thus, embedded systems design raises challenging problems for research, such as security, reliable and mobile services, large-scale heterogeneous distributed systems, adaptation, component-based development, and validation and tool-based certification. This book results from the ARTIST FP5 project funded by the European Commision. By integration 28 leading European research institutions with many top researchers in the area, this book assesses and strategically advances the state of the art in embedded systems.

A perturbation result for dynamical contact problems ¤ This paper is intended to be a first step towards the continuous dependence of dynamical contact problems on the initial data as well as the uniqueness of a solution. Moreover, it provides the basis for a proof of the convergence of popular time integration schemes as the Newmark method. We study a frictionless dynamical contact problem between both linearly elastic and viscoelastic bodies which is formulated via the Signorini contact conditions. For viscoelastic materials fulfilling the Kelvin-Voigt constitutive law, we find a characterization of the class of problems which satisfy a perturbation result in a non-trivial mix of norms in function space. This characterization is given in the form of a stability condition on the contact stresses at the contact boundaries. Furthermore, we present perturbation results for two well-established approximations of the classical Signorini condition: The Signorini condition formulated in velocities and the model of normal compliance, both satisfying even a sharper version of our stability condition.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063621-5>

Quantum entropy and its use ¤ This book provides a complete overview of quantum entropy theory, from the early days of quantum mechanics up to the most recent developments. It employs mathematical formalism based on operator theory and functional analysis with a goal of creating a comprehensive account of the different entropy concepts, their interrelations and use. Among the ideas discussed are entropy of a quantum state, relative entropy, mutual entropy, entropy of a coarse graining and dynamical entropy. Numerous fundamental properties of quantum information measurement are developed, including the von Neumann entropy of a statistical operator and its limiting normalized version, the entropy rate. Use of quantum- entropy quantities is made in perturbation theory, central limit theorems, thermodynamics of spin systems, entropic uncertainty relations, and optical communication.

New York, New York! : urban spaces, dreamscapes, contested territories ¤ Once a center of transatlantic cultural exchange and the avant-garde arts, New York City has transformed into a global metropolis. This book traces a shift that took shape as cultural practices and media underwent dramatic changes: it takes us from modernist visions of urban sublimity to postmodernist cityscapes; from Hart Crane's Brooklyn Bridge to the Flushing Meadows fairgrounds; from Mina Loy's poetics to Klaus Nomi's transgressive musical performances and Jem Cohen's multimedia experiments; from Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and the Magnum Photos portfolio to post-9/11 cinema and the photo blogs of the internet age. As we visit these urban spaces and dreamscapes, we enter territories that remain contested, dynamic locales in a city that keeps unfolding its transformative force	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033422-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115380-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125698-0>

Matching Economic Migration with Labour Market Needs ¤ This publication gathers the papers presented at the “OECD-EU dialogue on mobility and international migration: matching economic migration with labour market needs” (Brussels, 24-25 February 2014), a conference jointly organised by the European Commission and the OECD. It provides new evidence on the role that international migration has played in Europe and in selected other OECD countries over the past decade in terms of labour force; educational attainment; and occupational changes. It analyses the availability and use of migrants’ skills based on an in-depth literature review as well as new data analyses for Europe and the United States, Canada and the OECD as a whole, taking advantage of the International Survey of Adult Skills – PIAAC. Finally, several chapters discuss the potential role of international migration in meeting current and future labour market needs in Europe, in the United States and in the European Union. This work shows that although migration can make an important contribution to labour force growth, its role in counterbalancing the effects of population ageing will depend on the capacity of countries to match labour needs to migrants’ characteristics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003743-5>

Flash thematic country review on apprenticeships : Sweden ¤ This publication is the final report of the flash thematic country review of apprenticeships (TCR) in Sweden. Cedefop initiated the review which took place between June 2017 and April 2018 and looked at apprenticeship at upper secondary level. This report presents the key findings and suggestions for action to develop apprenticeship training in the medium and long term. The underlying analysis largely relies on information collected from different categories of stakeholders at different levels, and in-depth discussions with a national panel of experts. The report presents suggestions for action organised in two areas for intervention: rethinking the overall scheme design, clarifying its identity and selling point by making it more responsive to the labour market; and at the implementation level, revising the responsibility allocation and ownership balance to engage employers more.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005871-2>

Plant phenology as a biomonitor for climate change in Germany : a modelling and mapping approach ¤ The investigations refer to the development of plant phenology since the 1960s in Germany. Spatiotemporal trends were assessed by means of regression kriging. It could be shown that there already is a distinct shift of phenological onset towards the beginning of the year of up to two weeks. In future, a shift of up to one month was calculated till 2080. Moreover, a prolongation of the vegetation period of up to three weeks was found. The findings are relevant for the development of mitigation measures to prevent from environmental, agricultural and economic issues due to climate change.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127856-2>

Entrepreneurship and economic growth ¤ By serving as a conduit for knowledge spillovers, entrepreneurship is the missing link between investments in new knowledge and economic growth. The knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship provides not just an explanation of why entrepreneurship has become more prevalent as the factor of knowledge has emerged as a crucial source for comparative advantage, but also why entrepreneurship plays a vital role in generating economic growth. Entrepreneurship is an important mechanism permeating the knowledge filter to facilitate the spill over of knowledge and ultimately generate economic growth.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066527-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7588126-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027089-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061949-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078599-3>

Translating humour in audiovisual texts ¤ Humour found in audiovisual products is, of course, performative in nature. If we consider instances of humour - any droll moment occurring in today's fare of mixed-genre products as a composite of cognition, emotion, interaction and expression - we see that the verbal code becomes just one component of four equally significant elements. And, as 'expression' is not limited to verbal output alone, humour may of course be created in absence of a verbal code. Translating humour for audiovisuals is not too different from translating verbal humour tout court. What makes humour occurring within audiovisual texts more problematic is the fact that it may be visually anchored; in other words a gag or a joke may pivot on verbal content directed at a specific element that is present within the graphic system of the same text. As the term itself suggests, audiovisuals contain two overlying structures: a visual and an auditory channel each of which contain a series of both verbal and non-verbal elements which inextricably cross-cut one another. The contributors in this collection of essays present a series of case studies from films and video-games exemplifying problems and solutions to audiovisual humour in the dubs and subs in a variety of language combinations	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026170-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4373404-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061418-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017102-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130847-5>

Nanostructures : theory and modeling ¤ Progress in nanoscience is becoming increasingly dependent on simulation and modeling.This is due to a combination of three factors: the reduced size of nano-objects, the increasing power of computers, and the development of new theoretical methods. This book represents the first attempt to provide the theoretical background needed by physicists, engineers and students to simulate nano-devices, semiconductor quantum dots and molecular devices. It presents in a unified way the theoretical concepts, the more recent semi-empirical and ab initio methods, and their application to experiments. The topics include quantum confinement, dielectric and optical properties, non-radiative processes, defects and impurities, and quantum transport. This guidebook not only provides newcomers with an accessible overview (requiring only basic knowledge of quantum mechanics and solid-state physics) but also provides active researchers with practical simulation tools.

Clustering surgical procedures for master surgical scheduling ¤ The sound management of operating rooms is a very important task in each hospital. To use this crucial resource efficiently, cyclic master surgery schedules are often developed. To derive sensible schedules, high-quality input data are necessary. In this paper, we focus on the (elective) surgical procedures' stochastic durations to determine reasonable, cyclically scheduled surgical clusters. Therefore, we adapt the approach of van Oostrum et al (2008), which was specifically designed for clustering surgical procedures for master surgical scheduling, and present a two-stage solution approach that consists of a new construction heuristic and an improvement heuristic. We conducted a numerical study based on real-world data from a German hospital. The results reveal clusters with considerably reduced variability compared to those of van Oostrum et al(2008).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122751-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032786-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075664-6>

Solitary waves in dispersive complex media : theory, simulation, applications ¤ This book is devoted to one of the most interesting and rapidly developing areas of modern nonlinear physics and mathematics - the theoretical, analytical and advanced numerical study of the structure and dynamics of one-dimensional as well as two- and three-dimensional solitons and nonlinear waves described by Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP), nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) and derivative NLS (DNLS) classes of equations. Special attention is paid to generalizations (relevant to various complex physical media) of these equations, accounting for higher-order dispersion corrections, influence of dissipation, instabilities, and stochastic fluctuations of the wave fields. The book addresses researchers working in the theory and numerical simulations of dispersive complex media in such fields as hydrodynamics, plasma physics, and aerodynamics. It will also be useful as a reference work for graduate students in physics and mathematics.

A topological aperitif ¤ This is a book of elementary geometric topology, in which geometry, frequently illustrated, guides calculation. The book starts with a wealth of examples, often subtle, of how to be mathematically certain whether two objects are the same from the point of view of topology. After introducing surfaces, such as the Klein bottle, the book explores the properties of polyhedra drawn on these surfaces. Even in the simplest case, of spherical polyhedra, there are good questions to be asked. More refined tools are developed in a chapter on winding number, and an appendix gives a glimpse of knot theory. There are many examples and exercises making this a useful textbook for a first undergraduate course in topology. For much of the book the prerequisites are slight, though, so anyone with curiosity and tenacity will be able to enjoy the book. As well as arousing curiosity, the book gives a firm geometrical foundation for further study.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156724-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060425-1>

Tree rings and natural hazards : a state-of-the-art ¤ The initial employment of tree rings in natural hazard studies was simply as a dating tool and rarely exploited other environmental information and records of damage contained within the tree. However, these unique, annually resolved, tree-ring records preserve valuable archives of past earth-surface processes on timescales of decades to centuries. As many of these processes are significant natural hazards, understanding their distribution, timing and controls provides valuable information that can assist in the prediction, mitigation and defence against these hazards and their effects on society. Tree Rings and Natural Hazards provides many illustrations of these themes, demonstrating the application of tree rings to studies of snow avalanches, rockfalls, landslides, floods, earthquakes, wildfires and several other processes. Several of the chapters are 'classic studies', others represent recent applications using previously unpublished material. They illustrate the breadth and diverse applications of contemporary dendrogeomorphology and underline the growing potential to expand such studies, possibly leading to the establishment of a range of techniques and approaches that may become standard practice in the analysis of natural hazards in the future.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041387-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4149072-1>

Probability matching priors : higher order asymptotics ¤ Probability matching priors, ensuring frequentist validity of posterior credible sets up to the desired order of asymptotics, are of substantial current interest. They can form the basis of an objective Bayesian analysis. In addition, they provide a route for obtaining accurate frequentist confidence sets, which are meaningful also to a Bayesian. This monograph presents, for the first time in book form, an up-to-date and comprehensive account of probability matching priors addressing the problems of both estimation and prediction. Apart from being useful to researchers, it can be the core of a one-semester graduate course in Bayesian asymptotics. Gauri Sankar Datta is a professor of statistics at the University of Georgia. He has published extensively in the fields of Bayesian analysis, likelihood inference, survey sampling, and multivariate analysis. Rahul Mukerjee is a professor of statistics at the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta. He co-authored three other research monographs, including A Calculus for Factorial Arrangements in this series. A fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, Dr. Mukerjee is on the editorial boards of several international journals.

Do smart adaptive systems exist? : best practice for selection and combination of intelligent methods ¤ ‚Do Smart Adaptive Systems exist?’ is intended as a reference and a guide summarising and focusing on best practices when using intelligent techniques and building systems requiring a degree of adaptation and intelligence. It is therefore not intended as a collection of the most recent research results but a practical guide for experts from other areas and industrial users who are interested in building solutions to their problems using intelligent techniques. One of the main issues covered is an attempt to answer the question of how to select and/or combine suitable intelligent techniques from a large pool of potential solutions. Another attractive feature of the book is that it brings together experts from neural network, fuzzy, machine learning, evolutionary and hybrid systems communities who will provide their views on how these different intelligent technologies have contributed and will contribute to creation of smart adaptive systems of the future.

Economics and biology ¤ Economics and Biology is a collection of key essays on the relationship between economics and biology. As the limitations of the mechanistic metaphor in economics are increasingly recognized, this volume explores the potential for the use of evolutionary and other ideas from the science of biology. Topics covered include evaluations of mechanistic and biological analogies in economics in the Darwinian revolution, the use of biology in Alfred Marshall's economics, the concepts of optimisation and rationality in an evolutionary context and the inspirations that biology may offer for modern economics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006851-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1>

Integrated Assessment of Instruments and Fiscal and Market-Based Incentives of International Climate Policy and Their Impacts (IACCP) : Study funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research : within the framework of FONA - Economy of Climate Change - BMBF ¤ In the existing literature the estimation of the effect of unilateral climate change policy measures and their effectiveness is done primarily in ”Computable General Equilibrium“ (CGE) models or based on “Integrated Assessment Models” (IAM). The selection of parameter values for the required calibration of the models is often ad hoc and based on various studies that are neither consistent to each other nor with the theoretical modeling. The objective of this project is to develop consistent and integrated approaches to enhance climate change policy advice. For this purpose, the structure of the estimated equations is derived from research results and based on theoretically modeling and thus links the estimated and micro-founded results with consistently constructed CGE-models which are then employed for the analysis of climate policy scenarios. This represents a significant methodological development to existing Integrated Assessment Models and in particular combines the research in the international trade area with that of climate debate. The results of the project include: • Construction of well suited databases to be used for the analysis of international climate policy • Evaluating the instruments of international climate change policy • Development of indices for international climate change policies • Prognosis of the welfare effects of climate change policy objectives with a special focus on the long term consequences • Conveying the findings to a wide audience	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547705-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224214-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125152-0>

Econometric Theory and Methods ¤ Econometric Theory and Methods provides a unified treatment of modern econometric theory and practical econometric methods. The geometrical approach to least squares is emphasized, as is the method of moments, which is used to motivate a wide variety of estimators and tests. Simulation methods, including the bootstrap, are introduced early and used extensively. The book deals with a large number of modern topics. In addition to bootstrap and Monte Carlo tests, these include sandwich covariance matrix estimators, artificial regressions, estimating functions and the generalized method of moments, indirect inference, and kernel estimation. Every chapter incorporates numerous exercises, some theoretical, some empirical, and many involving simulation. Econometric Theory and Methods is designed for beginning graduate courses. The book is suitable for both one- and two-term courses at the Masters or Ph.D. level. It can also be used in a final-year undergraduate course for students with sufficient backgrounds in mathematics and statistics. FEATURES BLUnified Approach: New concepts are linked to old ones whenever possible, and the notation is consistent both within and across chapters wherever possible. BLGeometry of Ordinary Least Squares: Introduced in Chapter 2, this method provides students with valuable intuition and allows them to avoid a substantial amount of tedious algebra later in the text. BLModern Concepts Introduced Early: These include the bootstrap (Chapter 4), sandwich covariance matrices (Chapter 5), and artificial regressions (Chapter 6). BLInclusive Treatment of Mathematics: Mathematical and statistical concepts are introduced as they are needed, rather than isolated in appendices or introductory chapters not linked to the main body of the text. BLAdvanced Topics: Among these are models for duration and count data, estimating equations, the method of simulated moments, methods for unbalanced panel data, a variety of unit root and cointegration tests, conditional moment tests, nonnested hypothesis tests, kernel density regression, and kernel regression. BLChapter Exercises: Every chapter offers numerous exercises, all of which have been answered by the authors in the Instructor's Manual. Particularly challenging exercises are starred and their solutions are available at the authors' website, providing a way for instructors and interested students to cover advanced material.

Graph theory : a problem oriented approach ¤ Graph Theory presents a natural, reader-friendly way to learn some of the essential ideas of graph theory starting from first principles. The format is similar to the companion text, Combinatorics: A Problem Oriented Approach also by Daniel A. Marcus, in that it combines the features of a textbook with those of a problem workbook. The material is presented through a series of approximately 360 strategically placed problems with connecting text. This is supplemented by 280 additional problems that are intended to be used as homework assignments. Concepts of graph theory are introduced, developed, and reinforced by working through leading questions posed in the problems. This problem-oriented format is intended to promote active involvement by the reader while always providing clear direction. This approach figures prominently on the presentation of proofs, which become more frequent and elaborate as the book progresses. Arguments are arranged in digestible chunks and always appear along with concrete examples to keep the readers firmly grounded in their motivation. Spanning tree algorithms, Euler paths, Hamilton paths and cycles, planar graphs, independence and covering, connections and obstructions, and vertex and edge colorings make up the core of the book. Hall's Theorem, the Konig-Egervary Theorem, Dilworth's Theorem and the Hungarian algorithm to the optional assignment problem, matrices, and Latin squares are also explored.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113782-6>
Practical opto-electronics : an illustrated guide for the laboratory ¤ This book explains how to create opto-electronic systems in a most efficient way, avoiding typical mistakes. It covers light detection techniques, imaging, interferometry, spectroscopy, modulation-demodulation, heterodyning, beam steering, and many other topics common to laboratory applications. The focus is made on self-explanatory figures rather than on words. The book guides the reader through the entire process of creating problem-specific opto-electronic systems, starting from optical source, through beam transportation optical arrangement, to photodetector and data acquisition system. The relevant basics of beam propagation and computer-based raytracing routines are also explained, and sample codes are listed. The book teaches important know-how and practical tricks that are never disclosed in scientific publications. The book can become the reader's personal adviser in the world of opto-electronics and navigator in the ocean of the market of optical components and systems. Succinct, well-illustrated, and clearly written, this book is helpful for students, postgraduates, engineers and researches working not only in the field of applied optics but also in high-tech industry, information technology, medicine, biology and other domains.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043687-1>

Decreasing costs of renewables : analysis of energy sector planning and climate policy in Indonesia ¤ This study analyses the processes and assumptions underlying the development of Indonesia's NDC and its revision in 2020. The assumptions underlying the related energy sector documents (KEN, RUEN, RUKN, RUPTL) and their relationships are also assessed. The study is completed by giving a snapshot of the current state of discussion around constraints related to renewable energy. The unconditional target of Indonesia's NDC foresees a reduction of GHG emissions of 29% relative to a Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario (41% conditional to international support). It specifies that electricity generation shall reduce emissions by 18.8% relative to BAU. The overall target of a 29% and 41% have been set by a non-public process. The sectoral shares of GHG reductions are determined by the responsible ministries (ESDM in case of the energy sector), with modelling performed by academic institutions (e.g. BTI for energy). This modelling is partly based on existing plans of the energy sector. Data underlying this modelling is not public, but underlying socio-economic assumptions suggest that the BAU scenario overestimates emissions. The NDC has no influence on planning in the energy sector but should be considered a by-product of existing planning documents. The process underlying the current revision is repeated for the current revision of the NDC and likely also for creation of the LTS. The ambition under the revised NDC will not be increased. The share of renewable energy in the NDC follows from a cascade of energy planning documents (KEN, RUEN, RUKN, RUPTL), which pass the target from the most overarching energy plans to the NDC. Arguably the most important target related to renewable energy planning in Indonesia set down by the countries' energy strategy KEN, to reach 23% renewable energy in each sector in total primary energy supply in 2025. The assumptions underlying this target are not known and can therefore not be contested. The national energy plan RUEN makes this target more specific in terms of technology. The power sector plan by the ministry of energy RUKN and the power sector plan by the utility RUPTL all consider 23% renewable energy target. Besides that, these plans remain largely disconnected from each other...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032594-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068598-6>
