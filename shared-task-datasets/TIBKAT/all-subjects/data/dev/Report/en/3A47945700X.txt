Embedded systems design : the ARTIST roadmap for research and development
This extensive and increasing use of embedded systems and their integration in everyday products mark a significant evolution in information science and technology. Nowadays embedded systems design is subject to seamless integration with the physical and electronic environment while meeting requirements like reliability, availability, robustness, power consumption, cost, and deadlines. Thus, embedded systems design raises challenging problems for research, such as security, reliable and mobile services, large-scale heterogeneous distributed systems, adaptation, component-based development, and validation and tool-based certification. This book results from the ARTIST FP5 project funded by the European Commision. By integration 28 leading European research institutions with many top researchers in the area, this book assesses and strategically advances the state of the art in embedded systems. The coherently written monograph-like book is a valuable source of reference for researchers active in the field and serves well as an introduction to scientists and professionals interested in learning about embedded systems design
