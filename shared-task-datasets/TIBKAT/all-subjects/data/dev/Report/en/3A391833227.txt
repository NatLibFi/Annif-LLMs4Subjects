Design of intelligent multi-agent systems : human-centredness, architectures, learning and adaptation
The ongoing transition of Intelligent Systems Research and in particular the agent based research into the real world has resulted in the emergence of new phenomena distinct from the traditional logic-centered approach. This books focuses on those new trends in design and evolution of the agent technology such as humanization, architectures and learning of agents. "Design of Intelligent Multi-Agent Systems" presents the application of soft computing agents to complex real world problems in distributed environments, humanization of the agents and the optimization of their performance. TOC:Humanization of soft computing agents.- Software agents for ubiquitous computing.- Agents-based knowledge logistics.- Architectural styles and patterns for multi-agent systems.- Design and behavior of a massive organization of agents.- Developing agent-based applications with JADE.- A collective can do better.- Coordinating multi-agent assistants with an application by means of computational reflection.- Learning by exchanging advice.- Adaptation and mutation in multi-agent systems and beyond.- Intelligent action acquisition for animated learning agents.- Using stationary and mobile agents for information retrieval and e-commerce
