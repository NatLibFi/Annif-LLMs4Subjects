Practical opto-electronics : an illustrated guide for the laboratory
This book explains how to create opto-electronic systems in a most efficient way, avoiding typical mistakes. It covers light detection techniques, imaging, interferometry, spectroscopy, modulation-demodulation, heterodyning, beam steering, and many other topics common to laboratory applications. The focus is made on self-explanatory figures rather than on words. The book guides the reader through the entire process of creating problem-specific opto-electronic systems, starting from optical source, through beam transportation optical arrangement, to photodetector and data acquisition system. The relevant basics of beam propagation and computer-based raytracing routines are also explained, and sample codes are listed. The book teaches important know-how and practical tricks that are never disclosed in scientific publications. The book can become the reader's personal adviser in the world of opto-electronics and navigator in the ocean of the market of optical components and systems. Succinct, well-illustrated, and clearly written, this book is helpful for students, postgraduates, engineers and researches working not only in the field of applied optics but also in high-tech industry, information technology, medicine, biology and other domains.--
