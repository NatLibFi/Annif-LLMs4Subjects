Mixed automorphic forms, torus bundles, and Jacobi forms
This volumedeals with various topicsaround equivariant holomorphic maps of Hermitian symmetric domains and is intended for specialists in number theory and algebraic geometry. In particular, it contains a comprehensive exposition of mixed automorphic forms that has never yetappeared in book form. The main goalis to explore connections among complex torus bundles, mixed automorphic forms, and Jacobi forms associated to an equivariant holomorphic map. Both number-theoretic and algebro-geometric aspects of such connections and related topics are discussed. TOC:Introduction.- 1. Mixed Automorphic Forms.- 2. Line Bundles and Elliptic Varieties.- 3.
