Optical near field recording : science and technology
This textbook is written for all those wishing to understand the concepts behind modern optical recording. It also paves the way towards the future science and technology beyond the optical diffraction limit. The important keyword here is "near-field optics," a regime whose promising characteristics will open the door to a new information optics. This unique book will be useful for all graduate students, scientists and engineers seeking to advance our understanding of optical near-field recording. TOC:Introduction.- Summary of Optical Data Storage and the Future Trend.- Basic Theory of Optical Near-Field and Surface Plasmon Polarities.- Near-Field Recording and Its Actual Methods.- The Role of Surface Plasmons in Optical Disc
