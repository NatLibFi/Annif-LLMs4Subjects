Mathematica : a problem-centered approach
"The Springer Undergraduate Mathematics Series (SUMS) is designed for undergraduates in the mathematical sciences. From core foundational material to final year topics, SUMS books take a fresh and modern approach and are ideal for self-study or for a one-or two-semester course. Each book includes numerous examples, problems and fully-worked solutions." "Mathematica: A Problem-Centered Approach introduces the vast array of features and powerful mathematical functions of Mathematica using a multitude of clearly presented examples and worked-out problems. Each section starts with a description of a new topic and some basic examples." "The intention is to enable the reader to learn from the codes, thus avoiding long and exhausting explanations." "While based on a computer algebra course taught to undergraduate students of mathematics, science, engineering and finance, the book also includes chapters on calculus and solving equations, and graphics, thus covering all the basic topics in Mathematica. With its strong focus upon programming and problem solving, and an emphasis on using numerical problems that do not need any particular background in mathematics, this book is also ideal for self-study and as an introduction to researchers who wish to use Mathematica as a computational tool." "Mathematica: A Problem-Centered Approach comes with a free 30 day trial of the Wolfram Mathematica software"--Jacket
