Introducing Judaism
Attention is paid to various models of piety, mysticism, scholasticism and folk religion, including the impact of Judaism on the daily life of believers and the experiences of Jewish women. Illustrated throughout, "Introducing Judaism" includes text boxes, a glossary, and a list of further reading to aid students' understanding and revision, providing a thorough overview of one of the first recorded monotheistic faiths and one of the oldest religions still practiced today. Eliezer Segal is Professor of Western Religions at the University of Calgary, USA.
