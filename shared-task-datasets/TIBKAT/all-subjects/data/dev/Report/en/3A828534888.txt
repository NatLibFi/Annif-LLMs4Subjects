New York, New York! : urban spaces, dreamscapes, contested territories
"Once a center of transatlantic cultural exchange and the avant-garde arts, New York City has transformed into a global metropolis. This book traces a shift that took shape as cultural practices and media underwent dramatic changes: it takes us from modernist visions of urban sublimity to postmodernist cityscapes; from Hart Crane's Brooklyn Bridge to the Flushing Meadows fairgrounds; from Mina Loy's poetics to Klaus Nomi's transgressive musical performances and Jem Cohen's multimedia experiments; from Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and the Magnum Photos portfolio to post-9/11 cinema and the photo blogs of the internet age.
