Interactions involving lipid-based surfaces : from protein adsorption to membrane adhesion
Interactions involving biological interfaces such as lipid-based membranes are of paramount importance for all life processes. The same also applies to artificial interfaces to which biological matter is exposed, for example the surfaces of drug delivery systems or implants. This thesis deals with the two main types of interface interactions, namely (i) interactions between a single interface and the molecular components of the surrounding aqueous medium and (ii) interactions between two interfaces. Each type is investigated with regard to an important scientific problem in the fields of biotechnology and biology: 1.) The adsorption of proteins to surfaces functionalized with hydrophilic polymer brushes; a process of great biomedical relevance in context with harmful foreign-body-response to implants and drug delivery systems. 2.) The influence of glycolipids on the interaction between lipid membranes; a hitherto largely unexplored phenomenon with potentially great biological relevance. Both problems are addressed with the help of ...
