Biosynthesis of polyphenols in Norway spruce as a defense strategy against attack by the bark beetle associated fungus Ceratocystis polonica
The family Pinaceae (order Coniferales) includes many environmentally and economically important softwood tree genera. The most important Pinaceae species endemic to Europe is the Norway spruce tree (Picea abies). This tree species is frequently subject to severe attacks by the scolytid bark beetle Ips typographus and its microbial associate, the blue stain fungus, Ceratocystis polonica. Spruce trees have structural and chemical defense strategies against invasion by the beetle-fungus complex, including cells with autofluorescent inclusion bodies containing aromatic compounds such as stilbene glucosides and flavan-3-ols. The goal of our research was the elucidation of the pathways leading to the formation of stilbene glucosides and flavan-3ols in spruce and to determine their role in the defense of this tree against infection by the bark beetle associate C. polonica. ...
