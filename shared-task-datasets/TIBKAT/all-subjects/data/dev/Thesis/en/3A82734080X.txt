Tailorable system software
...Over the last four years, my research has focused on methods and techniques to improve the design, implementation, and maintenance of static variability in highly tailorable system software. My central contributions in this respect are: (a) The CiAO approach, which employs language techniques to achieve excellent up-tailorability of embedded system software (towards the requirements of a specific application). (b) The Sloth approach, which employs generative techniques to achieve down-tailorability of embedded system software (towards better exploitation of modern commodity hardware). (c) The VAMOS approach, which employs cross-language analysis techniques and holistic variability modeling to improve on the long-term maintainability of multi-paradigmatic variability implementations in existing large-scale system software, such as Linux...
