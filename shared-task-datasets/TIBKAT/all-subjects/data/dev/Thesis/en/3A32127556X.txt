Mikropolare Zweiphasenmodelle : Formulierung auf der Basis der Theorie por√∂ser Medien
In the presented work, a theoretical description of multi-phase materials is presented. Basis is the Theory of Porous Media, which is extended by elements of the micropolar theory in order to take into account the influence of the microstructur. The kinematics according to finite deformations and the governing balance relations are discussed. The attention is focused on the extensions according to the independent rotations which arise in the framework of the micropolar theory. Furthermore, from the master balance equation the structure of the individual balances for the constituents is derived and related to the balance equations of the mixture as a whole. For a two-phase material consisting of elastic porous skeleton and a viscous pore-fluid thermodynamical consistent constitutive relations are derived from the evaluation of the entropy prinicple. Specially, an evolution equation for the volume fraction is introduced. This is of interest because this equation does not follow from kinematical considerations in the case of compressible constituents. Finally, to become more concrete, the solid skeleton is assumed to be elastic and a strain energy functions is given. Furthermore, according to a dimensional analysis, the extra stresses of the fluid are neglected with respect to the drag force. Some numerical examples show the evidence of the proposed model and of the included effects.
