Ma(r)king the Difference : Multiculturalism and the Politics of Translation
This research delivers a conceptual reconstruction of the trajectory of concepts used to mark qualitative differences among identities from the 16th to the 21st century in central Europe and the Americas. The surplus lies in the inclusion of colonial history in the genealogy of Western political thought and ideas, as well as in the postcolonial discussion of multiculturalism. The manuscript deals with the power and authority of translation providing the reader with an insight into the history of colonial racism through a deep conceptual analysis of three historical debates that have not been previously discussed together. By linking the so-called "Indian Question", the "Jewish Question" and the multicultural question, this thesis includes a valuable critical revision of the origins of Humanism in colonial times and contexts and an original critique to the power and violence of language in ma(r)king differences, which is described in terms of translation. This thesis was selected among the three best dissertations in critical social thinking of the year 2019 by the Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung. About the author: Tania Mancheno is a political scientist, an independent critical researcher and a lecturer at the Department of Geography, at the University of Hamburg.
