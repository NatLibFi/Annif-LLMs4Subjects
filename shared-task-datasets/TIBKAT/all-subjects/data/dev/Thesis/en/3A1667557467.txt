Geochemical characterization of tea leaves (Camellia sinensis) and soils for provenance studies based on compositional data analysis
Provenance studies on tea (Camellia sinensis) are an important tool to reconstruct the origin of tea products. This thesis explores the potential of using solely the ionome (main and trace element concentrations) of tea shoot tips for provenance studies. The emphasize of the thesis is to find element subcompositions which are robust in respect to the various parameters of tea cultivation and production, such as the area, their soils, soil fertilizer and applications of foliar sprays, tea cultivars, plucking/harvesting techniques, manufacturing or leaf grade of the processed tea. For specifi...
