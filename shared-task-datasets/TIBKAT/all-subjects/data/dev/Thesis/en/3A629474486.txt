Late Mesozoic to Cenozoic erosion and sediment dispersal in the Dinaride orogen : a sedimentary provenance approach
This work presents the results of a sedimentary provenance study undertaken in Cretaceous to Tertiary basins of the Dinarides. The major objective has been to put new constraints on the orogenic evolution of this integral, yet one of the least known segment of the European Alpine chain. We have taken on the approach of in-depth characterizing the detritus derived from major tectonostratigraphic units, focusing on information extracted via the geochemistry, geochronology and fission-track thermochronology of single detrital grains. We used these results to describe the paleogeology and understand sediment dispersal patterns which are all dependent on the large-scale crustal and surface processes involved in the Alpine orogeny. The Bosnian Flysch forms a c. 3000 m thick, intensely folded stack of Upper Jurassic to Cretaceous mixed carbonate and siliciclastic sediments in the Central Dinarides, sandwiched between the Adriatic Carbonate Platform and the Dinaride Ophiolite Zone ...
