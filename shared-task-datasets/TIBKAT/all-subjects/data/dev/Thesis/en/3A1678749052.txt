Assessing, testing, and implementing socio-cultural valuation methods to operationalise ecosystem services in land use management
Ecosystem services (ESs) are defined as the contributions that ecosystems make to human wellbeing and are increasingly being used as an approach to explore the importance of ecosystems for humans through their valuation. Although value plurality has been recognised long before the mainstreaming of ESs research, socio-cultural valuation is still underrepresented in ESs assessments. It is the central goal of this PhD dissertation to explore the ability of socio-cultural valuation methods for the operationalisation of ESs research in land management. To address this, I formulated three research objectives that are briefly outlined below and relate to the three studies conducted during this dissertation. The first objective relates to the assessment of the current role of socio-cultural valuation in ESs research. Human values are central to ESs research yet non-monetary socio-cultural valuation methods have been found underrepresented in the field of ESs science. In regard to the unbalanced consideration of value domains and conceptual uncertainties, I perform a systematic literature review aiming to answer the research question: To what extent have socio-cultural values been addressed in ESs assessments. ...
