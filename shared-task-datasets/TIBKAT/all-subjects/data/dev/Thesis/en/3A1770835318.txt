Increasing culturability of plant microbiome towards core microbiome manipulation and engineering
This study aimed to optimize the use of plant-based culture media for exploration of the plant-associated microbiota and extend the culturability borders to isolate novel bacterial taxa and meticulously characterize the culture-dependent and culture-independent microbiomes in view of the developed plant-based culture media. Throughout the study, we could prove that plant-based culture media are able to support the recovery of previously uncultured plant-associated bacteria, and also support the enrichment of bacterial lineages that belong to the candidate phyla radiation (CPR).<eng>
