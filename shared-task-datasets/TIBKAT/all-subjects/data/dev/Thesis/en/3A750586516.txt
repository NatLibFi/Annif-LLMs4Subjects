Dimensional sandstones : weathering phenomena, technical properties and numerical modeling of water migration
This here presented thesis is focused on the systematically evaluation of the durability of natural sandstones by the detailed characterization of their petrographical, petrophysical, deterioration and weathering properties. The thesis presents a new combined approach for the detailed analyses at sandstones by onsite studies (deterioration phenomena and weathering behavior), in laboratory (measurement and determination of petrophysical and petrographical properties), by statistical considerations (i.e. establish correlations between petrography, petrophysical and weathering properties) and ...
