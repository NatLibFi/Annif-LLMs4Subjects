The United States and the transatlantic slave trade to the Americas, 1776-1867
"While much of modern scholarship has focused on the American slave trade's impact within the United States, considerably less has addressed its effects in other parts of the Americas. A rich analysis of a complex subject, this study draws on Portuguese, Brazilian, and Spanish primary documents--as well as English-language material--to shed new light on the changing behavior of slave traders and their networks, particularly to Brazil and Cuba. Slavery in these nations, Marques describes, contributed to the mounting tensions that would ultimately lead to the US Civil War. Taking a truly Atlantic perspective, Marques outlines the multiple forms of US involvement in this traffic amid various legislation and shifting international relations, exploring the global processes that shaped the history of this participation." --
