Scaling laws for internally heated mantle convection
This work presents a new method to simulate mantle convection in a 3D spherical shell with fully spatially varying viscosities. The formulation of the governing equations is based on the finite-volume (FV) method for fully irregular grids using Voronoi-cells. The simulation code is efficiently parallelized for more than 1000 CPUs. A new irregular grid with varying lateral resolution, the spiral grid, was investigated. The discretization method is second-order accurate in space and time. The Krylov-subspace solver BiCGS with a Jacobi preconditioner is employed to solve the resulting system of equations. The discretization of the stress tensor can handle viscosity variations of up to 8 orders of magnitude from cell-to-cell and up to 45 orders of magnitude system wide. As an application to purely internally heated mantle convection in a spherical shell, a parameter study of 88 cases is carried out to derive scaling laws for heat transport, stagnant-lid thickness and structural complexity...
