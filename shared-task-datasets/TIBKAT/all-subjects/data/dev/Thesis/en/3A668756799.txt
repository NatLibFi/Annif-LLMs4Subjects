Identifizierung von an chromosomalen Translokationen beteiligten Genen
Malignant diseases show frequently characteristic genetic alterations. The detections of such alterations were facilitating by improved molecular approaches in recent years. The focus of this work is the precise characterisation of breakpoint regions of chromosomal alterations of T-cell acute lymphatic leukaemia. For this purpose the fine-tiling comparative genomic hybridization (FT-CGH) were combined with the ligation mediated-PCR (LM-PCR). These both approaches were established in cell lines and subsequently used in different leukaemia samples. Chromosomal aberrations are frequently accompanied by genetic losses or gains. Such unbalanced alterations can be detected by the comparative genomic hybridization, which allows the detection of DNA copy number differences between a test sample and a reference sample. The fine-tiling-CGH detects with high resolution the DNA amount differences in specific genomic areas. The detected breakpoint regions can be further analysed by the LM-PCR. A comparison with the internal control cell line HEK 293-T revealed atypical PCR fragments in the analysed leukaemia sample. Using the BLASTn search database resulted in the identification of different genomic alterations in cell lines and T-cell acute lymphatic leukaemia samples. The combination of the FT-CGH and the LM-PCR allowed the clarification of simple deletions as well as complex chromosomal translocations ...
