Valorization of biobased furfurals by catalytic oxidative esterification
The two benchmark biobased chemicals, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and furfuraldehyde were successfully oxidized by newly developed bimetallic catalysts in batch and in flow conditions. The processes were made under the mildest conditions so far, in good to excellent yields. Also, carbene catalyzed valorization of furfurals was explored. All these processes were conceived under the guidelines of sustainability, and the principles of green chemistry and engineering.<eng>
