Mineralogical characterization of Fe-driven alteration in smectites
The main objective of this research was to enhance the understanding of the interactions of bentonite with iron in the near field of a HLW-repository. One target was to investigate natural Fe-rich bentonites as a possible analogue. Another topic was to recognize the mineralogical interaction of bentonite with iron powder simulating the contact of bentonite with steel containers (thermodynamic approach). An additional objective was to explore the idea that bentonites have a specific dissolution potential (kinetic approach). In order to take the thermodynamic approach, compacted MX80 bentonite and Friedland clay were used as starting materials for clay/iron interaction experiments in percolation systems (Clay/Iron-ratio = 0.1). The natural processes were studied by examining a tropical weathering profile of serpentinized diabase from the Thanh Hoa province of Vietnam. The kinetic approach was taken by investigating a series of well characterized bentonites, 9 from API-standard series, 12 from the BGR-collection and 4 others, all of them saturated with deionized water (liquid/solid-ratio = 10/1) and NaCl 1N solution (liquid/solid-ratio = 4/1) for 30 days, followed by exposing the soft gels to mechanical agitation by overhead shaking corresponding to two energy levels (20 rpm and 60 rpm). XRD and TEM - EDX measurement were the major analytical techniques applied in this research, with FT-IR and XRF analyses as additional tools to characterizing the structure and
