Estimation of coefficients for modelling ships from sea trials using stepwise optimization methods and considering trim and draught conditions
This thesis proposes a method for estimation of the hydrodynamic coefficients using full-scale sea trials and the system identification. Also, based on this, a proposal for a new estimation method that can consider various trim and draught conditions is given here. The new estimation method is in the form of suggesting an additional correction formula that can complement the existing empirical estimation formulas for the hydrodynamic coefficients involving different trim and draught parameters.<eng>
