Growth and quality of indigenous bamboo species in the mountainous regions of Northern Vietnam
The aim of the study is to enhance the knowledge on sustainable management of six indigenous bamboo species in Vietnam, including Oligostachyum sp., Phyllostachys edulis Lehaie, Indosasa angustata McClure, Dendrocalamus latiflorus Munro, Dendrocalamopsis sp. 2, and Dendrocalamus barbatus Hsueh et D.Z.Li. To improve the efficiency of bamboo management we developed the schematic plans for both natural and planted bamboo forests based on the major issues as follows: (1) the plant osmotic potential was measured to diagnose the adaptation of each bamboo species to its site condition; (2) the bamboo stands were investigated to determine the appropriate densities and (3) the physical and mechanical properties of bamboo culms of different age classes were assessed to determine the variation of quality of bamboo culms and find out a proper age for the bamboo culm cuttings
