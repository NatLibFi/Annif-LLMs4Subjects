Sequential change point analysis based on weighted moving averages
The aim of sequential change-point analysis is to provide adequate methods for detecting structural breaks in stochastic processes. This work is concerned with non-parametric procedures, which are based on weighted moving averages. We discuss known control-charts and also introduce new procedures. The main results of this work, namely the PWMA-Test (polynomially weighted moving average) and the FWMA-Test (fractionally weighted moving average), are generalizations of the CUSUM-Test. Furthermore, we derive the limiting distributions of the conditional stopping-times for the MOSUM-Test. The latter result is utilized to provide asymptotic confidence intervals for the location of a change-point.
