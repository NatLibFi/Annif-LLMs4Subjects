Amino cellulose sulfate : synthesis, characterization and physicochemical behavior
Amino cellulose sulfates, a new class of polyampholytic polysaccharide derivatives, are accessible by a three step synthesis; tosylation, sulfation and nucleophilic displacement for introduction of amino moieties. Thus, tosylate moieties can be introduced in position 6 of the repeating unit of the cellulose backbone. Subsequently, anionic sulfate groups can be linked to the tosyl cellulose by the treatment with sulfur trioxide pyridine complex. ...
