Influence of the pore structure on the catalytic performance of Rh-supported Zr-MOFs in the hydroformylation of olefins
Zirconium-based metal-organic frameworks (Zr-MOFs) of different pore sizes  and structure were synthesized and used for the preparation of the Rh-supported catalysts. The catalytic performance was studied in the hydroformylation of olefins to the corresponding aldehydes. A series of n-alk-1-enes of different chain length and bulky olefins with different size was used to study the influence of the pore size and structure. The results show that the Zr-MOF-based catalysts are very active and show high aldehyde selectivity.<eng>
