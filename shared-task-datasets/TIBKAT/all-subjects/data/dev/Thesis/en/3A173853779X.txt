Synthesis of highly fluorinated precursors and their deposition conditions for self-assembled monolayers with defined small-scale surface structures as templates for the manipulation of wetting behavior
"How Wenzel and Cassie were wrong" â€“ this was the eye-catching title of an article published by Lichao Gao and Thomas McCarthy in 2007, in which fundamental interpretations of wetting behavior were put into question. The authors initiated a discussion on a subject, which had been generally accepted a long time ago and they showed that wetting phenomena were not as fully understood as imagined. Similarly, this thesis tries to put a focus on certain aspects of liquid wetting, which so far have been widely neglected in terms of interpretation and experimental proof. While the effect of surface roughness on the macroscopically observed wetting behavior is commonly and reliably interpreted according to the well-known models of Wenzel and Cassie/Baxter, the size-scale of the structures responsible for the surface's rough texture has not been of further interest. Analogously, the limits of these models have not been described and exploited. Thus, the question arises, what will happen when the size of surface structures is reduced to the size ...
