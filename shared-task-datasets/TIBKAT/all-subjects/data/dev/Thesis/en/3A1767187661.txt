Distributive justice and its realization in Nigeria : philosophy and education as a roadmap to change for a multi-cultural society
This dissertation began with the debate on what exactly constitutes the correct currency of justice in a political society. Justice means giving each individual an equal path in order to live a meaningful human life. Unfortunately, the principles of justice enumerated do not function well in Nigeria. The research revealed the major obstacles which militate against the realisation of justice in the country. The state of justice in Nigeria demands a radical approach and the conclusion is that sound education and philosophy can serve as a road-map towards  realizing an equal and just society.<eng>
