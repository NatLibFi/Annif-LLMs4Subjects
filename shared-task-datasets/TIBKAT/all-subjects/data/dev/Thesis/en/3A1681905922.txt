Enabling Big Data security analytics for advanced network attack detection
The last years have shown an increasing sophistication of attacks against enterprises. Traditional security solutions like firewalls, anti-virus systems and generally Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are no longer sufficient to protect an enterprise against these advanced attacks. One popular approach to tackle this issue is to collect and analyze events generated across the IT landscape of an enterprise. This task is achieved by the utilization of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. However, the majority of the currently existing SIEM solutions is not capable of handling the massive volume of data and the diversity of event representations. Even if these solutions can collect the data at a central place, they are neither able to extract all relevant information from the events nor correlate events across various sources. Hence, only rather simple attacks are detected, whereas complex attacks, consisting of multiple stages, remain undetected. Undoubtedly, security operators of large enterprises are faced with a ...
