Exclusive event generation for the COMPASS-II experiment at CERN and improvements for the Monte-Carlo chain
Zusammenfassung: Measuring exclusive production processes to a high precision allows an access to the generalized parton distributions (GPDs). These GPDs can be used according to Ji's sum rule, which gives an access to the total angular momentum of the quarks and gluons. The COMPASS-II experiment at CERN is designed to carry out these measurements.This thesis comprises the development of an event generator for exclusive photon and meson production in the COMPASS-II kinematic. In this process, the Goloskokov and Kroll model for exclusive neutral pion production has been implemented. Furthermore, several improvements for the Monte-Carlo software were introduced to the COMPASS-II reconstruction software. The main objective of this work was an increase of the overall accuracy and performance of the Monte-Carlo chain for experimental acceptance studies and model comparisons
