Disentangling the chemodynamical history of the Milky Way disc with asteroseismology and spectroscopy
Galaxies are among the most complex systems that can currently be modelled with a computer. A realistic simulation must take into account cosmology and gravitation as well as effects of plasma, nuclear, and particle physics that occur on very different time, length, and energy scales. The Milky Way is the ideal test bench for such simulations, because we can observe millions of its individual stars whose kinematics and chemical composition are records of the evolution of our Galaxy. Thanks to the advent of multi-object spectroscopic surveys, we can systematically study stellar populations in a much larger volume of the Milky Way. While the wealth of new data will certainly revolutionise our picture of the formation and evolution of our Galaxy and galaxies in general, the big-data era of Galactic astronomy also confronts us with new observational, theoretical, and computational challenges. This thesis aims at finding new observational constraints to test Milky-Way models, primarily based on infra-red spectroscopy from the Apacheâ€¦
