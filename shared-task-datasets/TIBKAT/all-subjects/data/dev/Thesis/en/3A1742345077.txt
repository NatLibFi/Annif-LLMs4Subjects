Minimizers of generalized Willmore energies and applications in general relativity
The Willmore functional is a function that maps an immersed Riemannian manifold to its total mean curvature. Finding closed surfaces that minimizes the Willmore energy, or more generally finding critical surfaces, is a classic problem of differential geometry. In this thesis we will develop the concept of generalized Willmore functionals for surfaces in Riemannian manifolds. We are guided by models in mathematical physics, such as the Hawking energy of general relativity and the bending energies for thin membranes. We prove the existence of minimizers under area constraint for these generalized Willmore functionals in a  suitable class of generalized surfaces. In particular, we construct minimizers of the bending energy mentioned above for prescribed area and enclosed volume. Furthermore, we prove that critical surfaces of generalized Willmore functionals with prescribed area are smooth, away from finitely many points. These results and the following are based on the existing theory for the Willmore functional. This ...
