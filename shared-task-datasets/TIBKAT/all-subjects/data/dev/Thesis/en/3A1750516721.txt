Novel nanostructured materials from cellulose esters
Cellulose, the most abundant natural polymer on earth, constitutes virtually an inexhaustible source for the fabrication of nanostructured materials. Combining its biocompatibility and biodegradability, cellulose-based nanostructured materials possess significant benefits when compared to conventional nanostructured materials. Nanostructured materials, such as cellulose nanocrystals and cellulose nanofibers, have been isolated from cellulose, via top-down approaches. The present thesis focuses on the bottom-up approach for constructing nanostructured materials with cellulose derivatives, wh...
