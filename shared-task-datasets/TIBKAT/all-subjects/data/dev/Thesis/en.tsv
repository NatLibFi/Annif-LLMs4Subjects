(Ir)rational choices? : the impact of learning on party policy moves ¤ The work examines the impact of learning on the ideological change of 137 parties in 22 OECD-countries from 1950 to 2013. Parties learn about the effectiveness of policy moves with regard to vote gains or losses of themselves, their competitors, and other parties abroad and then make a (limited) rational decision for the direction of a change. The internal power balance between party elites and activists determines which information sources influence the final decision. The thesis is about ideological change of political parties and the way parties gather information, learn by updating their beliefs and ultimately make "rational choices". Analyzing 1451 policy moves of 137 parties in 22 OECD-countries from 1950 to 2013 it is a story about rational learning, about emulating other parties abroad and chasing public opinion. Yet, the "internal life" of a party conditions the effects when activists have some influence over the formation of party policy. As volunteers facing a scarcity of time and resources, members of the party on the ground have a different information horizon, and may arrive at the opposite decision where to move than party elites which (can) rest their decision on a broader set of information resources. In some parties the party on the ground thus constitutes an "internal wall of resistance" to the strategy party elites would choose, if they were free from constraints.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035408-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4245375-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026486-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128256-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012277-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044737-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187586-2>
Multilayer Zone Plates for Microscopy with Hard X-Ray Radiation ¤ Especially for biological samples, X-ray microscopy is a successful examination method, as it allows the analysis of unaltered specimens. However, in order to also benefit from the advantages of hard X-ray radiation – smaller wavelengths and greater penetration depths – in this field, special optics are required. Multilayer zone plates (MZPs), consisting of thin layers, are promising optical elements in this case, provided they exhibit smooth and well-defined multilayers. By combining pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and focused ion beam (FIB), it has been possible to establish a production method that can achieve this. Together with pre-focusing optics, a MZP with less than 5 nm was generated, which is the smallest X-ray focus in the world with hard X-ray radiation. In order to use this extremely small beam profitably for microscopic applications, improvements in MZP geometry were essential, which in turn required a deep understanding of the underlying processes (such as target changes and sputtering and backscattering effects during production). Accordingly, analyses were carried out with complementary methods such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray reflectometry (XRR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and SDTrimSP simulation. As a result, MZPs were realized that can undoubtedly enable microscopic examinations in the range of 50 nm and possess the potential for resolutions in the sub-10 nm range.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252384-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178315-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4244347-7>

Mothers Without Borders : Paradoxes of Professionalized Caregiving at SOS Children's Villages ¤ In SOS Children's Villages worldwide, women live and work as mothers for (social) orphans. This provides a unique opportunity to empirically examine the professionalization of motherhood. In the framework of a field research in Austria and Bolivia, Sarah Speck analyzes the practice of these institutions. The core of her qualitative study is the reconstructive evaluation of interviews with SOS Children's Village mothers. Furthermore, the author asks what happens when specific conceptions of good motherhood are exported to other sociocultural contexts. Her book moves at the intersection of gender-theoretical, sociological, and cultural-anthropological approaches and connects to debates about the structural change of work, current gender relations, and cultural globalization processes.

International Jurisdiction in Societal Disputes within the Legal Framework of the European Internal Market ¤ The work deals with the question of the international jurisdiction of courts in societal disputes within the European internal market. The topic is highly relevant in practice. Due to the extensive mobility of companies within the internal market, there is an increased need to be able to conduct societal internal disputes in a legally secure manner. The work comes to the result that Art. 24 No. 2 EuGVVO aims for a correlation between jurisdiction and applicable law. The author concretizes the correlation indicated by union law on the basis of material court points. For this purpose, the author uses the principle of equal treatment in company law, which the author locates on the European level as a general legal principle. Finally, the author qualifies the alternative anchoring of the general place of jurisdiction in Art. 4 para. 1 in conjunction with Art. 63 para. 1 EuGVVO as an unjustified restriction of the freedom of establishment.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020646-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145576-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027387-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139832-4>
Investigations on selected breast cancer cell lines using Raman microspectroscopy and chemometric methods ¤ Breast cancer accounts for approximately 460,000 deaths annually, making it one of the leading causes of death in the female global population. Detailed tumor characterization is necessary for the development of an appropriate cancer therapy. Raman microspectroscopy is used to provide molecular biological information to pathologists during tumor diagnosis. In this research work, chemometric methods were used to evaluate the Raman data of individual cells, making classification and identification experiments possible. In this context, cell nucleus spectra were correctly assigned to breast cell lines MCF-10A and MCF-7 with an accuracy of 99%. The differentiation of Raman data from six malignant breast cancer cell lines showed that individual Raman spectra could be correctly assigned with an accuracy of almost 100%. Classifications according to the cell line origin (pleural effusion and solid tumor) achieved accuracies of over 94%. The separation of Raman data from individual cancer cells according to the respective breast cancer subtypes achieved accuracies of 97%. The results demonstrate the great potential of Raman spectroscopy for application in clinical diagnosis. In addition, the effect of the chemotherapeutic agent Docetaxel (DCT) was investigated using Raman cell nucleus spectra. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008528-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176916-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4231928-6>
Calculation of the Dynamic Structural Factor in Warm Dense Matter with ab-initio Simulations ¤ Characterization of warm dense matter is a major research field and a significant challenge for experiments and theory. A possibility of representation are X-ray Thomson scattering experiments, from whose results the dynamic structural factor can be obtained. This work aims to obtain this quantity from FT-DFT-MD simulations, with a treatment beyond the perturbation theory of quantum and correlation effects. The obtained structural factors are compared with other theoretical models and experiments for beryllium and boron.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183800-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141062-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4163615-6>
Legislators in Conflict between the Rule of Law and Counter-Terrorism: An Examination of § 89a Abs. 2a StGB ¤ The author analyses the concept of criminal liability according to para. 89a sec. 2a of the German Criminal Code. By this provision, the criminal liability of the preparation of a serious act of violent subversion is linked already to the departure from the Federal Republic of Germany. Hereby, the criminal liability is shifted further to preparatory status. Considering the constitutional concerns, the author examines the limits of pre-shifted criminal liability by preparatory and abstract strict liability torts. He fathoms the limits of pre-shifted criminal liability considering dogmatic and constitutional limits. The work offers a comprehensive, practice-oriented comment on para. 89a sec. 2a of the German Criminal Code. Furthermore, the author addresses general dogmatic investigative approaches, not only for practitioners, but for penal jurists and law students as well.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4432390-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059534-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4199432-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131795-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187680-5>
Shareholders and Corporate Form in Company Tax Law: Considerations on Neutrality of Legal Form and Corporate Taxation ¤ Theoretically, it is indeed possible to consider companies, regardless of their legal form, as completely transparent in (income-)tax terms and, in the sense of a complete integration model (Partnership Tax)140, to record and tax all company income exclusively at the shareholders' income tax. However, a tax model of this kind is hindered by two significant disadvantages: On the one hand, the income determination and income allocation to the respective shareholders can become extremely difficult, especially in the case of affiliated companies and conglomerates, due to the numerous forms of participation in companies. In addition, with an increasing number of shareholders, the question of income determination and income allocation becomes almost insoluble. This makes this integration model completely impractical. Therefore, no country has introduced such a complete integration model in the framework of corporate taxation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020646-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7502161-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070938-3>
Optimization of External Pressure Conditions on Li-Ion Cells to Increase Lifespan ¤ Li-ion cells expand during charging due to volume changes of active materials during lithium intercalation. In addition, aging mechanisms of the anode lead to significant and irreversible growth of the cells. Since the cells are pre-stressed in modules for their use in electric vehicles, this expansion leads to an increase in pressure in the module. Both performance and aging of the cells are dependent on the external pressure. The interactions between module pre-stress, pressure development, and aging are still largely unknown, as no systematic investigation of realistic mechanical pressure conditions has been carried out in the literature so far. Within the framework of this experimental work, the effects of module stiffness and initial pre-stress of cells on cyclic and calendar aging, cell thickness growth, and pressure development in the module were investigated using three different cell types developed for use in electric vehicles. Based on the statistical experimental design, the effects were modeled and evaluated in terms of their statistical significance. Subsequently, the dominant aging mechanisms and limiting aging effects were identified within the framework of electrochemical characterization and post-mortem analysis. The greatest effect on pressure development in the module is module stiffness, a factor that has been largely neglected in the literature so far. The influence of initial pre-stress depends strongly on the mechanical properties of the cell. All three cell types show pressure-dependent aging effects and mechanisms, such as cathode active material losses due to particle breakage, increasingly inhomogeneous aging, or Li-plating at the edges of the anode. In the last step, the mechanical module design was optimized in terms of volumetric energy density over the lifespan. Within the framework of an experimental optimization, the influence of the design of buffer elements on the volumetric energy density during cyclic aging was investigated and an optimal design was derived.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7681721-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128096-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4345882-8>

The InflateSAR campaign : detecting refugee rubber boats with SAR ¤ Ziel der Dissertation war es, mit MigrantInnen und Geflüchteten besetzte Schlauchboote mittels Fernerkundungsdaten zu detektieren. Die Forschung folgt der Vision, zivilen Rettungskräfte vor Ort Lagebilder zu liefern um deren Suche nach Booten in Seenot zu unterstützen. Um eine tageszeit- und witterungsunabhängige Suchinfrastruktur für die maritime Seenotrettung zu ermöglichen, nutzten wir „Synthetic Aperture Radar“ (SAR). Wir führten zwei ca. sechsmonatige Messkampagnen mit einem 12m langen Fluchtschlauchboot durch, um SAR-Bilder verschiedener Satelliten zu sammeln und werteten die Ergebnisse aus. Damit schufen wir ein umfassendes Verständnis der Radarmustern von Schlauchbooten in SAR-Daten und konnten zeigen, dass eine Detektion möglich ist. Im Rahmen der Arbeit wurden systematisch existierende Schiffsdetektoren untersucht und daraus neue, speziell auf das Testobjekt abgestimmte Detektoren entwickelt. The aim of the dissertation was to detect rubber inflatables carrying migrants and refugees using remote sensing data. The research follows the vision of providing civilian rescue teams on the ground with situational images to support their search for boats in distress. We utilised synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to provide a search infrastructure for maritime rescue operations that is independent of the time of day and weather conditions. We carried out two measurement campaigns lasting around six months with a 12m-long inflatable boat to collect SAR images from various satellites and analysed the results. In this way, we gained a comprehensive understanding of the radar patterns of inflatable boats in SAR data and were able to show that automated detection is possible. As part of the work, existing ship detectors were systematically analysed and new detectors specially adapted to the test object were developed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029932-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176765-2>
Citizen Patrols in Germany : Between Neighborhood Help and Right-Extremist Space Seizure ¤ From seemingly apolitical neighborhood watches to organized right-extremist patrols - citizens are increasingly staging themselves as an alternative force of order. Nina Marie Bust-Bartels has accompanied citizen patrols on their rounds and provides insights into the political motivations of the members. With her study at the interface of sociology, ethnology, and political science, she shows why men in particular question the state's monopoly on violence. Furthermore, she investigates citizen patrols for the first time as a strategy of right-extremist actors who want to gain political power through control of public space.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4196366-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170995-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048829-9>
The Resident Foreigners in Classical Athens ¤ Classical Athens attracted numerous foreign guests and visitors, and for many of them, the polis was more than just a stopover: As resident foreigners, they belonged quite naturally to the cityscape. In an extensive study, Franziska Luppa systematically identifies the characteristics that members of this population group carried both through individual circumstances and through Athenian attribution, and analyzes their impact on the lives and experiences of resident foreigners in Athens. The investigations show on the one hand, what remarkable heterogeneity the group of resident foreigners in classical Athens made up, on the other hand, they outline the complex web of integration offers and exclusion offers with which the Athenians did not simply fix the place of foreigners in the polis rigidly, but negotiated it continuously.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155370-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169736-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151434-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077575-6>
Nobility and Colonialism in the 20th Century: The Imperial Biography of the "Africa Duke" Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg ¤ What power dynamics emerge when two historically grown principles of rule, nobility and colonialism, intersect? The study, based on the biography of Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg, illuminates a connection that has not yet been treated by either nobility or colonial research. Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg (1873-1969) was able to maintain his elite social position throughout all the political upheavals of the 20th century, from the Empire to the Federal Republic of Germany. Through his privileged position, the Mecklenburg Duke was able to claim an influential status as an "Africa expert." As a researcher, governor of Togo, or later as a representative of emerging development cooperation, he adapted his "expertise" to the changing circumstances. The study provides insights into the transformation processes of elites in the 20th century and opens up a view of historical continuities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073624-6>
Procedure and Prototype for the Production of Thin-Walled Hollow Cylinders from Silicone Elastomer with Integrated Fluid Chambers and Channels ¤ Minimally invasive surgery continues to gain importance within invasive therapeutic procedures, promising a faster recovery of the patient, combined with a reduction of financial burdens for the healthcare system. For this purpose, locomotion systems are required that can actively move within the natural body cavities of the patient to transport working channels and surgical tools of the surgeon from the outside to the desired operating field. Completely flexible, miniaturized systems with worm-like movement are in the focus of international developments. A significant limitation in the development and further miniaturization of such locomotion systems exists due to the available manufacturing processes. The present work presents a new procedure and a prototype for the production of thin-walled hollow cylinders from elastomer, in whose wall fluid chambers and channels are integrated within the process. By filling the miniaturized fluid systems with fluid and controlling the inflow and outflow of fluid volume, a targeted deformation of the chambers can be created. By equipping the hollow cylinder with a complete series of chambers and channels, a peristaltic sonde is to be created in the framework of further developments, which can move worm-like in the spinal canal. The presented procedure consists of the following steps: 1. A metal rod is coated with a removable separation layer of photoresist by dipping (Dip-Coating). 2. Subsequently, a first inner layer of silicone elastomer is created on the separation layer and also by dipping. 3. This silicone layer is coated with photoresist by spraying (Spray-Coating) using special process parameters, which is then illuminated with a laser lithography. 4. After development, washing and drying, resist structures remain on the surface of the silicone layer, representing the later fluid chambers and inlets. 5. These resist structures serve as placeholders for the inner, later fluid-filled volume, when in a further step the outer silicone elastomer layer is applied again by dipping. In analogy to classical foundry and microsystem technology, the resist structures can also be referred to as sacrificial structures. 6. The resulting silicone body is then connected with corresponding tubing connections and a solvent is fed through these, which dissolves the resist structures. 7. After washing the chambers and inlets, they can be filled with working fluid (e.g. sterile, isotonic sodium chloride solution).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144863-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014162-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160452-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7610839-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4211206-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046699-1>
Threshold Investigation of Physiological Blinding for Fixed Road Lighting: Development of the TI Formula for Wet and Dry Roads ¤ This work includes a fundamental threshold investigation of physiological blinding for fixed road lighting and contributes to the improvement of visibility in nighttime road traffic. The associated promotion of road safety can help reduce nighttime traffic accidents. From the literature research, it is evident that the neglect of a simultaneously perceived contrast reduction by a veil due to blinding (also known as the physical effect of the blinding veil) in the road lighting standard represents a significant gap. So far, the TI formula assumes a threshold value increase without this effect, which therefore less accurately reflects the actual perception conditions and leads to incorrect judgments in blinding assessment. An experimental apparatus was developed, which made it possible to investigate the influence of this contrast reduction on threshold measurement. The adaptation/ blinding level, presentation duration and type were used as influencing factors. For the first time, it is proven that the original experiment by Narisada from 1977 for threshold measurement with equivalent blinding veil is replicable and reliable. His experimental result can therefore be confirmed. The results show that in the case of blinding, the component of contrast reduction affects the luminance difference threshold more strongly than the component of simultaneous retinal brightening. A dependence of the difference threshold with blinding veil is also proven by the presentation type. A comparison with threshold values from Blackwell/Adrian shows no agreement due to the missing physical effect of the blinding veil. From the comprehensive threshold model by Narisada and the own measurement data, new, extended TI formulas for foveal and peripheral vision can be derived for the first time. This makes it possible to quantify blinding more correctly, because on the one hand, the contrast reduction due to the blinding veil is taken into account, and on the other hand, the new blinding formulas depend on the background luminance of an obstacle in the evaluation field, which allows the inhomogeneous luminance distribution, which is particularly present on wet roads, to be calculated more accurately.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171198-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4520711-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4192070-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057931-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038852-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4265933-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135101-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129991-7>
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder after Intensive Medical Treatment: Epidemiology, Diagnosis, and Therapy Considering Dyadic Aspects ¤ The dissertation addresses epidemiological, diagnostic, and therapeutic aspects in relation to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after experiencing intensive medical treatment and focuses not only on patients but also considers, in light of evidence on dyadic connections in mental well-being within a partnership, the partners of those undergoing intensive medical treatment. The focus of the dissertation is the development and efficacy testing of a new internet-based cognitive-behavioral treatment offer for patients and their partners who suffer from clinically relevant PTSD symptoms after ITS treatment. This was implemented within the framework of a RCT and scientifically examined. The study found no evidence for the effectiveness of the intervention in terms of the pre-post change in the severity of PTSD symptomatology compared to the control group (CG). In the intervention group (IG), a significant increase in relationship satisfaction was found compared to the CG. The remission rate was 64% in the IG (marginally significantly higher than in the CG, 27%). No adverse events occurred. The study participants confirmed the applicability of the intervention. Due to the small sample size, the study is to be considered a pilot study, with the findings on efficacy remaining preliminary. Although the effectiveness of the newly developed treatment offer is not proven in terms of PTSD symptomatology, the findings on the effect on symptom remission and relationship satisfaction are promising. The results of the dissertation are relevant to clinical practice in two ways. Implications for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of PTSD are derived. Furthermore, the findings are guiding for further research, which should, among other things, investigate whether modified approaches to treating PTSD after ITS treatment may be more effective.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032844-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026924-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161965-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4361388-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059798-2>
Communication in Project Management : Fields of Task and Functions of Project Communication ¤ Starting from a systemic project model and a constructivist multi-level model of communication, Matthias Freitag reconstructs a total of 34 functions of project communication. The author concretizes the broad, but also ambivalent, influence of communication on project work, both on the level of the individual and the project team as well as in the relationship to stakeholder groups. In doing so, he shows that, in addition to project management, reporting, and documentation, performance delivery and learning, team development and leadership, as well as relationship management with stakeholders are primarily communication tasks through project marketing and politics. New developments such as agile project management and virtual collaboration further emphasize this influence.

Bilingual Education in Focus of Biology Didactics: Effects of Instructional Language and Context on Motivation and Knowledge Acquisition ¤ Petra Duske shows that bilingual subject teaching is suitable for maintaining student motivation in the subject and acquiring comparable knowledge like in German-language biology teaching. The instructional context in the sense of thematic embedding seems to play a subordinate role for motivation and knowledge acquisition. These are the results of a comparative study with approximately 800 students using a bilingual or German-language module in the subject of biology. The study can serve as a decision-making aid for teachers, school administrations, education administrations, students, and their parents when introducing or participating in bilingual education programs.

Globalization Processes in the Textile Industry, Especially in the Ecologically Oriented Branch ¤ Due to the second structural change, which is also referred to as the precursor or first phase of globalization in economic geography, the German textile and clothing industry (TBI) has been in a process of restructuring since the early 1970s, resulting in a location dynamics. To the extent that the structural change alters the economic and social framework conditions, sustainability plays an increasingly important role in production for a future-oriented competition. The ecological TBI is a niche specialist within the entire TBI, which generates ecological competitive advantages with its added value. The mentioned economically strategic reasons are accompanied by ecological and social aspects. The present work pursues the research field with the goal of examining the locations of the material flows and value creation chains of ecological textile and clothing companies in the global network.

Investigations on the distribution and transmission of Schmallenberg virus in sheep and goat flocks ¤ Schmallenberg-Virus, midges, small ruminants. - The Schmallenberg virus (SBV) first appeared in 2011 as a new viral disease of ruminants in Germany and wide parts of Europe. The clinical as well as the pathological picture is characterized by deformed and mostly stillborn lambs and calves, which is caused by an intrauterine virus transmission from the mother animal to the embryo or fetus. The SBV belongs to the Bunyaviridae, genus Orthobunyavirus and is mainly transmitted by midges. Small ruminants were clinically much more affected by SBV infections than cattle, which partly resulted in very high economic losses of the affected sheep and goat herds. Deformed and mostly stillborn lambs, but also mother animals that died or were euthanized due to insurmountable birth problems, were the main reasons for these partly massive losses. The aim of this work was to obtain data on the epidemiology and transmission routes of this newly emerged viral disease. Through a SBV-specific ....	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039561-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157775-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140081-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189837-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1041849648> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015016-1>

Modeling and analysis of cognitive radio ad hoc networks ¤ A world without wireless Ad-Hoc networks is hardly imaginable today. Due to the low costs and minimal installation effort, an increasing number of devices are being used in an increasing number of application fields. Since most of these networks operate in the license-free ISM band, this is currently heavily loaded and has hardly any free capacities left. However, current studies by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) show that large parts (up to 70%) of the licensed frequencies are unused. This circumstance shows that the problem is not the general scarcity of free frequencies, but rather the inefficient distribution and use of available resources. The main focus of the present dissertation is on improving spectrum utilization to enable further development of wireless Ad-Hoc networks. In this work, a new spectrum management concept called Opportunistic Spectrum Access with Backup channel (OSAB) is developed and presented. The underlying concept allows Secondary Users (SUs) to dynamically and flexibly access frequencies of unlicensed and licensed frequency bands when they are not used by the Primary User (PU) - i.e., there are no interference. Since access to the frequency spectrum of existing systems is still very inflexible, this should be made more flexible and dynamic in the future by Cognitive Radios (CR). When developing OSAB, the different properties of various frequency bands were taken into account. The main advantage of licensed bands is that they are available in large numbers. In contrast, the main advantage of unlicensed frequencies is the equalization of all users. As soon as a SU has occupied a channel, it can no longer be displaced from it. If OSAB communicates in licensed bands, a backup channel (BC) is always maintained to react to the sudden appearance of the PU. The proposed concept was also subjected to an intensive analysis using Markov chains in this work. The results obtained show that OSAB can reduce packet loss and the expected number of spectrum hand-offs by 60% and 17%, respectively. To practically demonstrate the benefits and advantages of OSAB, the MAC protocol SWITCH (opportunisticSpectrum access WITh backup CHannel) was developed in the present work. SWITCH is a decentralized, asynchronous, connection-based MAC protocol that can effectively respond to the sudden arrival of PUs due to the backup channel concept. Each SU is equipped with two transceivers, one of which is always responsible for communication on the commonly used control channel (Common Control Channel). The second transceiver is designed to periodically search for unused channels and dynamically access them. To correctly recognize the state of a channel (occupied/unused), a simple but effective form of cooperative sensing is used in this work. The performance of the protocol was evaluated using simulations. The results show that SWITCH can achieve a remarkable improvement in throughput of 91.7% compared to other CR-MAC protocols. In summary, it can be said that the proposed contributions represent a step towards more efficient use of available radio resources and increased capacity of wireless Ad-Hoc networks.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155397-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4216130-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4674811-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4314339-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4225227-1>

Femininity, Female Authorship, and National Character: Early Perception of Mme de Staël in Germany (1788-1818) ¤ This study examines the early perception of the French writer Anne Louise Germaine de Stael-Holstein in Germany. It provides a comprehensive documentation and evaluation of testimonies that existed during her lifetime and are now available in printed form. It also shows how contemporary discussions about gender and national character entered into the confrontation with Mme de Stael's person and work. The focus is on the judgments of women. In the comments on Mme de Stael, they revealed their attitude towards the disputed female part in public and literary life. Thinking about the French author was thus a thinking about oneself. The own social role as a woman and writer was increasingly reflected in dealing with Mme de Stael, with the aspect of national character becoming increasingly important. The goal is to draw a development line from the judgments about Mme de Stael herself, about her early work and her two novels Delphine (1802) and Corinne or Italy (1807) to the judgments about her book On Germany (1810/1813). It is shown that the female statements reveal a growing self-confidence as a woman and writer.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071776-8>
International Human Resource Management in Multinational Companies: An Empirical Analysis of Work-Family Interaction in the Context of Expatriation ¤ Work-Family Balance of Expatriates and its Impact on Expatriation Success -- Analysis of an Integrative Model of Work-Family Balance using a Mixed-Methods Approach -- Influencing Factors of Work-Family Conflict and Work-Family Enrichment in the Context of Expatriation. Heike Schütter investigates in the framework of a qualitative and a quantitative study, which factors have an impact on an expatriation, especially how the work-family interaction influences the expatriation success. The author shows the necessity for companies to consider the family stronger than before both in the candidate selection and during the time abroad to consider and to promote the influencing factors of the interaction between work and family specifically to maximize the probability of a successful expatriation. The expatriates are enabled by the findings of this work to assess whether they and their families are suitable candidates for an expatriation.

Interprofessional Qualifications for Judgment Formation and Decision-Making Behavior of Professionals and Consequences for Their Development in Vocational Training ¤ Cliff Notes: The aim of the investigation is to develop theoretical foundations for a methodology of developing judgment and decision-making skills in vocational training and further education. Judgment and decision-making processes in the regulation of actions are analyzed and the elements that constitute them are presented in their interaction. From this, necessary and beneficial qualifications for judgment formation and decision-making behavior are determined. Diagnostic judgment formation in the process of error search is explicitly examined as an important special case. Based on a learning-theoretical understanding of didactics, didactic consequences for the development of the determined qualifications in vocational training and further education are worked out.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113499-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121202-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4199421-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062174-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4199967-8>
Civil Liability in Cashless Payment Transactions: An Examination of the Implementation of the Payment Services Directive (2007/64/EC) into German Law ¤ With this work, the claims of the parties involved in the payment process for reimbursement, execution, and damages are examined: It begins with the background of the harmonized regulation of cashless payment transactions across the EU. This includes the political goals, scope, and basic structure of the directive, which has different temporal phases of a payment process. In the framework of the 'notification phase', the payment-triggering communication with payment service providers is examined to discuss the effectiveness requirements and withdrawal possibilities. The subsequent 'authorization phase' focuses on the claims of payment service providers after completed transactions. Here, especially evidentiary questions about authorization and the specifics of direct debits are discussed. In the 'execution phase', the individual content obligations of payment service providers and the claims in the event of performance disruptions are explained, before the 'reversal phase' deals with the practically relevant § 675x BGB, which enables a refund of the payment amount especially for direct debits. Explanations of general liability restrictions conclude the treatment.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022898-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124608-1>
Pedagogy of Appreciation - A Chance for the School of the Present? : Foundations and Possibilities ¤ The term »Appreciation«, frequently used in current school programs, remains unclear in educational science. Based on a theoretical anchoring, »Appreciation« is characterized as a pedagogical attitude and behavior, grounded in the dignity of the child. In the framework of a historical search for clues, anthropological and child rights aspects of a contemporary »Pedagogy of Appreciation« are unfolded. Against the backdrop of an analysis of current educational policy developments as well as evident signs of »Non-Appreciation« at today's schools, the vision of school as an appreciative organization is designed.

Design and Analysis of High Numerical Aperture Beam Shaping Systems ¤ The generation of tailored light is today at the center of many innovative applications. One possibility of flexible manipulation of light is laser beam shaping. The goal is to transform the intensity profile of a laser beam into a desired profile. The focus of this work is the modeling and propagation of laser light in paraxial and non-paraxial beam shaping systems as well as the optimization of these systems using a generalized projection algorithm. This algorithm is used to optimize pointwise, using the asphere formula or polynomials parameterized beam shaping surfaces. It is shown that during optimization, consideration of diffraction, interference, and aberrations is possible. The latter can not only be considered, but also targeted for beam shaping. Ultimately, it is shown that the aberrations of spherical catalog lenses are sufficient for some beam shaping applications. The effectiveness of the developed optimization algorithm is demonstrated in both paraxial and non-paraxial beam shaping examples with a numerical aperture of up to 0.62.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4568913-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224496-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4423037-0>

Pharmacokinetics of Betamethasone and Triamcinolone Acetonide after intraarticular Application regarding doping relevance in horses ¤ Betamethasone, Triamcinolone Acetonide, Pharmacokinetics. - The objectives of the present study were the optimization and validation of an HPLC/MS/MS method for the quantitative analysis of betamethasone and triamcinolone acetonide from horse urine and plasma, as well as the determination of pharmacokinetic parameters by conducting studies on the pharmacokinetics after intraarticular administration of various corticosteroids in horses. On the current state of doping analysis, it should be checked whether detection times for the intraarticular application of glucocorticoids can be predicted. The presented analytical method consists of a wet-chemical sample preparation and subsequent analysis by HPLC/MS/MS. The validation was carried out in accordance with the parameters selectivity, linearity, detection limit, quantification limit, precision, accuracy, stability, and recovery. It was shown that the method meets all the set criteria and is therefore suitable. The detection limits are 0.004 ng/ml for betamethasone in urine and plasma. Triamcinolone acetonide can be detected with certainty up to a concentration of 0.008 ng/ml in plasma and 0.010 ng/ml in urine. In test series, betamethasone and triamcinolone acetonide were applied to horses and blood and urine samples were then taken, which were examined for the applied substance. In the first test series, the excretion behavior of betamethasone after intravenous application was investigated.

Architecture and Art in the Lyric Work of Johannes Bobrowski ¤ Bobrowski had expressed the intention after graduating to study art history, but war and captivity thwarted his plan: the Wehrmacht member was released from military service only for a semester at the University of Berlin in the winter of 1941/1942. Bobrowski was particularly impressed by the lecture 'German Art of the Goethe Era' by Professor Wilhelm Pinder. Despite a fundamental influence, Pinder's ideological background never manifested in Bobrowski's poems. After returning from Soviet captivity on Christmas 1949, it was no longer possible for the now 32-year-old to think of studying. The lifelong intermedial engagement with works of visual art in his oeuvre can, however, be interpreted as an expression of his diverse cultural-historical interests and inclinations. The poet's life phases correlate with a motivational development of his picture poems: especially the unassailable aesthetics of significant works of art helped him to overcome the horrors of the last war years and the hardships of Soviet captivity. Initially, didactic-moral objectives shaped the poems that emerged in the years after his return, before Bobrowski was able to break free from this type of poem and began to write more poems that took on cultural-historical dimensions and placed historical, mythological, biblical, and philosophical themes in epoch-spanning connections.

The Representation of Consumer Interests: Organisation, Aggregation, Legitimation ¤ How can consumer interests be defined and determined? How do public interest groups fulfil their fundamental function of interest aggregation? This study analyses how consumer interests are defined, aggregated and legitimised within the field of consumer policy. In Germany, these interests, which are diffuse and hard to organise, are represented as well-understood consumer interests by advocacy organisations, which have no particular membership and are financially dependent on the state. This case study analyses interest aggregation in consumer organisations based on the example of the ‘Verbraucherzentrale’ (consumer association) of North Rhine-Westphalia. Therefore, it contributes to a theory of interest aggregation within the study of public interest groups. Referring to the field of political consumer research, this study focuses on a core problem of consumer policy: organising, determining and legitimising consumer interests.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134944-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187572-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062638-6>
Symbolic on-the-fly analysis of stochastic Petri nets ¤ This dissertation considers the efficient analysis, in particular model checking, of bounded stochastic Petri nets (SPN) that can be enriched with reward structures. An SPN induces a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). A reward structure associates a reward with each state and defines a Markov reward model (MRM). The continuous stochastic reward logic (CSRL) allows very specific properties for CTMCs and MRMs to be defined, which can be automatically checked by a model checker. - CSRL model checking can be realized based on established numerical analysis techniques for CTMCs, which are based on the multiplication of a matrix by a vector. Since these techniques consider a matrix and a vector of the size of the set of reachable states, it is however difficult to cope with the phenomenon of state space explosion. Various approaches, such as the use of multi-terminal decision diagrams (MTDD) or Kronecker products for representing the matrix, have already been investigated. Often, these allow the implementation of more efficient CTMC analysis and are available in a number of tools. - As an alternative to these established techniques, I further develop the idea of an "on-the-fly" computation of the matrix entries, using a symbolic representation of the state space. The set of state transitions that define the matrix is counted by firing the transitions of the Petri net in all reachable states. The set of reachable states is encoded using interval decision diagrams (IDD). - Further, I discuss essential aspects of the implementation of the first parallelized symbolic CSRL model checker, which is based on the developed technique and part of the MARCIE tool. An experimental comparison with the probabilistic model checker PRISM for a large number of experiments shows empirically the efficiency of this approach and its implementation, in particular when considering biological models.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135576-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4337061-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037612-6>
Influence of Equilibration Time and a Bull-Specific Diluent Medium on Cryoconservation of Semen Quality, Fertility, and Economic Efficiency in Holstein-Friesian Bulls in Germany ¤ The aim of this study was to compare the economic efficiency of a four-hour equilibration time with the diluent medium BioXcell (control) to a 24-hour equilibration time with a bull-specific diluent medium (BioXcell, Triladyl, and OptiXcell) in terms of spermological effects, non-return rates, and overall economic efficiency. For this purpose, eight bulls of the Holstein-Friesian breed were selected and in a pre-test, the most suitable diluent medium for the 24-hour equilibration was determined for each bull using three ejaculates in the split-sample procedure. Four bulls received Triladyl, and four bulls were assigned OptiXcell for the 24-hour equilibration. In the subsequent main test, a total of 60 ejaculates were collected and processed in three different batches using the split-sample procedure. A spermological examination and the recording of the total sperm concentration in the insemination portions were performed. The insemination portions were inseminated by animal breeding technicians. Subsequently, the non-return rates after first inseminations and total inseminations after 60 and 90 days per batch were recorded. In total, 11,058 inseminations were performed and evaluated. The present study has shown that extending the equilibration time from four hours to 24 hours generally leads to significantly better spermological results after cryoconservation. It was also found that extending the equilibration time has the potential to increase the economic benefits for a breeding company in terms of working time arrangement for the stable and laboratory personnel. Furthermore, extending the equilibration time has a positive...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113937-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012494-0>
Condition Assessment of Ageing High-Voltage Transformer Bushings with Oil-Paper Dielectric using Dielectric Diagnostics ¤ The goal of this work is to show suitable procedures for the state diagnosis of bushings with oil-paper dielectric. For this purpose, capacity and loss factor measurements as well as polarization and depolarization current measurements (PDC) and frequency range spectroscopy measurements (FDS) were performed on three 400 kV transformer bushings that were in operation for 28 years. The possibilities for qualitative analysis of the measurement results are given. Through simulations, the results of the PDC and FDS measurements can also be quantitatively evaluated, making it possible, inter alia, to estimate the water content of the insulation. The suitability of the used measurement, analysis, and simulation procedures was verified by the disassembly and examination of the paper of one of the test subjects. In addition to many practical hints on dielectric measurements and their interference influences, new procedures for temperature compensation of dielectric curves in the time domain as well as for the derivation of simple equivalent circuit diagrams for simulation are presented.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172437-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130713-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4009840-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160229-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140227-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4369492-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160231-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4149458-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142063-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4149716-8>

Plasma-Assisted Nanostructuring of ETFE Film ¤ This work deals with the investigation of the structure formation on ethylene tetrafluorethylene film (ETFE) in a plasma etching process. A double magnetron system with pulsed DC power is used as plasma source. In a pure oxygen atmosphere, negative oxygen ions are formed, which are accelerated towards the substrate in the cathode fall and interact with it. Through the interaction with the ETFE film, its surface is nanostructured. Initially, the influence of the process parameters on the structure formation is investigated by varying the energy dose. The nanostructures are analyzed in terms of their reflection-reducing and thus transmission-increasing effect as well as their structure sizes, shapes, and depths. With increasing energy dose, an increase in structure depth is observed. This is associated with an increase in transmission up to a maximum and a decrease in further increase of the energy dose. The connection between the energy dose, the transmission change, and the structure dimensions is presented and discussed. The characterization methods used for the analysis of the nanostructures are compared with each other and investigated and evaluated for their applicability to the description of nanostructured ETFE film. Furthermore, the influence of the crystalline areas on the structure formation is investigated. For this purpose, the semi-crystalline ETFE film is monoaxially stretched. The crystal lamellae align in the ETFE. In the plasma etching process, nanostructures form on the stretched ETFE films, which differ from those on unstretched ETFE. The dimensions of the nanostructures are considered in relation to the dimensions of the crystalline areas and the connection between structure formation and crystalline areas of ETFE is investigated and discussed. Finally, possibilities for further increasing the transmission are presented. The knowledge gained in the course of the work on the dependence of structure formation on plasma parameters is transferred to the polymer polyethylene terephthalate (PET). In addition, the stability of the nanostructured ETFE against weathering influences is shown and the potential of nanostructured ETFE film for outdoor applications such as encapsulation of solar cells is presented.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7617943-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174821-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137837-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4208514-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4342626-8>
Affective Dysregulation in Patients with Borderline Personality Disorder: Psychophysiological Changes during the Imagination of Emotional Episodes ¤ Borderline-Persönlichkeitsstörung, Physiological Psychology, Imagination, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Trauma, affective Dysregulation, Psychophysiology, Startle responses Aims: The aim of the present thesis was to investigate affective dysregulation in patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) using a psychophysiological paradigm. A general emotional vulnerability with intense, easily triggered affective reactions combined with an inability to regulate such emotions is considered to be a core symptom in BPD. However, evidence from psychophysiological studies for this model is not very consistent. Given the high comorbidity of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in BPD patients, current comorbid PTSD might also modulate emotional reactivity. Thus, the current study investigated whether BPD patients compared to healthy control subjects show stronger reactions to emotional evocative cues in general or specifically to disorder-related emotional stimuli. Comorbid PTSD as well as the disposition to dissociation as a common feature in BPD were considered as factors modulating emotional reactivity. Methods: Using a script-driven imagery paradigm, the emotional reactivity in 40 non-medicated BPD patients (37 women) and 32 healthy control subjects (27 women) was investigated. Besides standard unpleasant, neutral and pleasant scripts, idiographic aversive scripts based on personal transcription of an aversive life event were presented. Due to the high degree of traumatization, idiographic aversive scripts of BPD patients mostly contained trauma-related scenes. Furthermore, the unpleasant category of scripts comprised disorder-specific scenes ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4361388-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060749-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076126-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4007720-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072730-0>
Church Image and Church Unity: The Dominican "Tractatus contra Graecos" (1252) in its Theological and Historical Context ¤ With the "Tractatus contra Graecos" (1252) of an anonymous Dominican from the still young convent of Constantinople, a controversial theological work is in the focus of this book, whose peculiarity arises from its diverse interaction with contemporary discourses and whose character can be considered paradigmatic for the east-west conflict constellation of the High and Late Middle Ages along with their effects on current mutual perceptions of Church(es) and theological traditions. Controversial theology is to a certain degree always also „making of“: In the case of the "Tractatus contra Graecos" and works of its theological context, images of the other or the real or literary conversation partner are transported, who – if he did not meet the expectations of the course and solution of the question of church unity – became an enemy image from the partner. The analysis of these images shows: Under an often polemical surface, a much more original theology is sometimes hidden, than one would attribute to this text genre.

Synthesis and Characterization of Novel Donor-Acceptor Substituted Oligosilanes ¤ Of general interest for potential application possibilities are materials with special electrical or nonlinear optical properties. Within this work, new dipolar compounds were synthesized and characterized, which contain a central organosilane spacer unit (-SiMex-,-(SiMe2)6-), a terminal metal complex fragment (potential donor, FcN-) as well as a terminal organic acceptor unit (-PhF, -PhBr, -PhCHO) and at the same time exhibit a large range of desired properties. From photo-EMK measurements, UV/VIS-, NMR spectroscopy, Mössbauer, and cyclovoltammetric investigations, it can be concluded that there is a temperature-dependent varying intermolecular coupling between the donor and the organic acceptor in the solid state. Photo-EMK and single-crystal X-ray structure analyses of the salts (hydrochlorides, picrates) reveal strong intermolecular interactions (C-H···p, D-C-H···A) with a decisive influence on solid-state properties (supramolecular MO's).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147587-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154116-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4181296-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4264968-7>

Caught in the Middle or Just Along for the Ride?: Experiencing Domestic Violence in Childhood and Its Consequences for Identity Development ¤ Domestic violence affects not only the family member who is being abused, usually the mother, but also the children who see, hear, or are confronted with the consequences of the violence and grow up in an atmosphere shaped by violence. The perspective of the children, reported retrospectively by young adults, is at the center of this book. It summarizes the theoretical background and reports on the current state of research on the effects of domestic violence on children. However, the main focus is on interviews with those affected, who speak about their experiences years later. The sensitively evaluated interview material provides insight into coping strategies and resources, but also provides deep insights into the effects that these childhood experiences had on the identity development of young adults.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4723056-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030550-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138616-4>
360° Assessment and Personality Test in Leadership Evaluation: Predicting Leadership Success and Potential ¤ Stefanie Puckett investigates whether the prediction of leadership success can be improved through a 360° assessment by incorporating personality traits of the leader. The 360° assessment allows for the inclusion of various perspectives from the leader's environment in their evaluation, but is limited to behavior-based variables. The central question is: Can leadership evaluation be optimized through a combined application of behavior-based and trait-based variables?

Barrier-Free Internet for People with Intellectual Disabilities: An Experimental Pilot Study on Technical Requirements and Participatory Effects ¤ The topic of 'Barrier-Free Internet for People with Intellectual Disabilities' has not been empirically investigated in the German-speaking region so far. The present study closes this gap by examining the effectiveness of the BITV guidelines for creating barrier-free websites in Germany for people with intellectual disabilities. This is done using specially created research instruments that ensure the inclusion of the target group and their acceptance as experts, while also making the results usable. The research design is characterized by a methodological triangulation, which meaningfully links the various research objectives and different disciplines. The core is an experimental test page examination that is combined with observation and questioning and provides results that are suitable for everyday and practical use. The results are discussed in detail with reference to the scientific discipline and the corresponding regulations (BITV, WCAG 1.0 and WCAG 2.0). Based on this, pedagogical considerations are developed in institutional, organizational, and methodically-didactic terms, as well as concrete points for processing future technical guidelines.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308416-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019852-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191103-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4806684-9>
Structure-reactivity relationships in metal sulfide/C3N4 based semiconductor catalysts used for photocatalytic H2 evolution ¤ The present work elucidates the synthesis of metal sulfide/carbon nitride composites and their application in photocatalytic hydrogen generation with Pt as co-catalyst in the presence of triethanolamine or lactic acid as sacrificial reductants. However, the formation mechanism of photogenerated charge carriers as well as their separation and transfer during the photocatalytic reaction is still not clear, though its complete understanding is inevitable in order to tune the photocatalytic properties for achieving high photocatalytic H2 production efficiency.

Systemic Service Management : An Approach for Hybrid Value Creation at the Example of the Capital Goods Industry ¤ While in the exchange of goods, classical market transactions are in the foreground, bundles of services, consisting of integrated and customer-oriented goods and service components (hybrid products), lead to the formation of complex service relationships. Markus Nini derives the need for a paradigm shift in service management and shows with a design model at the example of the automotive industry an alternative approach. It is a systemic-constructivist service management that provides important orientation points for the design of hybrid value creation processes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4416850-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065685-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037278-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027561-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4418986-2>

Structure and Properties of Transition Metal-Containing Oxo-Arsenates(III) of the Rare Earth Elements ¤ This work deals with the synthesis and characterization of new compounds of the rare earth elements. In the foreground stands the development of new synthesis strategies for the construction of compounds in which rare earth elements and transition metals are linked to complex networks with Oxo-Arsenate(III) anions. These ligands are particularly suitable for the construction of such aggregates because they are characterized by a large number of different coordination and linking modes and thus enable a variety of variations in the construction of the solid and thus in the arrangement of rare earth and transition metal ions with respect to each other. By solid-state reaction of the oxides of the rare earth elements with transition metal oxides or chlorides and arsenic(III) oxide, the compounds SE5(AsO3)4Cl3 (SE = La, Pr, Nd), SE3(AsO3)(As2O5)Cl2 (SE = Sm, Eu, Gd), SE2Zn(AsO3)(As2O5)Cl (SE = Dy, Ho, Er, Yb) and SE2Fe(AsO3)(As2O3)Cl (SE = Sm, Gd) were obtained. First investigations on the thermal and spectroscopic properties of these compounds as well as the powder diffraction investigations are presented. <dt.>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132099-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183788-5>

Nonverbal Attitude Measurement : Benefits for Behavioral Brand Controlling ¤ Within the scope of brand strength measurement, the inclusion of images is often demanded, as brand image and attitude towards the brand – the most important drivers of brand strength – are largely stored in memory in pictorial form. Verbalizing these memory images is difficult for consumers. Sandra Schlegl therefore presents nonverbal image and attitude measurement as an alternative method for measuring the emotional attitude component. The empirical results show that the additional use of nonverbal attitude measurement leads to a significant improvement in the explanatory power of the important marketing variables brand preference, willingness to recommend, and purchase probability.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070102-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151420-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075376-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136439-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252999-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144679-3>
The role of storytelling for communication in risk management : a conceptual and experimental study ¤ Risk management is confronted with a changing risk environment as both more complex and new risk factors, so-called unknown-unknowns, are arising. To address these developments effectively and to have an impact on critical decision-making processes in companies, this discipline needs to advance. Soft factors—such as communication—are seen as effective levers in this context. This book deals with the potential offered by the communication form storytelling for risk management. In a conceptual study, the author outlines different ways of applying storytelling in risk management. In an experimental study, she analyses and elaborates the advantages of storytelling over purely numerical forms of communication in the same field.

The Scientific Author : Aspects of His Typologization at the Example of Einstein, Sauerbruch, Freud and Mommsen ¤ Although writing texts is an essential part of his profession, the scientist has not yet been explicitly recorded as an author type. Elke Flatau defines the scientific author based on the functioning of the modern scientific system and develops a characteristic catalog, with the help of which she analyzes four prominent case studies. Even celebrities are bound by the rules of scientific publishing, at the same time, individual studies uncover the neuralgic moments of the author type. Many of the described laws still determine the scientific business today, but are questioned by the current media upheavals on the book market.

Emperor and Tyrant : The Encoding and Decoding of the Ruler Representation of Nero and Domitian ¤ In the literary discussion after their death, Nero and Domitian appear as megalomaniac tyrants, while in the panegyric during their lifetime they are lavishly praised. In view of this discrepancy, one has suspected hidden criticism of the emperor in the overstatements of the ruler's praise. The volume considers the disparate image with a new, communication-theoretical approach as a result of processes of encoding and decoding of ruler representation. While the motif of transgression plays a central role in the panegyric for Nero and Domitian, it is dispensed with in the self-presentation of their successors. With the change of power, therefore, a change of codes occurs, by means of which this power is described. Thus, aspects that were interpreted as positively connoted boundary extension in the panegyric encoding of representation are decoded as negatively connoted boundary violation according to the codes of the respective new dynasty. The work analyzes the linguistic mechanisms underlying these processes. This opens up new perspectives on the literary representation of the two malus principes and on modes of political communication in the early Principate	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020531-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137492-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132339-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129073-2>
Microsystem-Integrated, Optically Pumped Magnetometer ¤ This work involves various aspects of design, fabrication, and research of microfabricated alkali vapor cells. Alkali vapor cells, hermetically sealed volumes filled with atoms of an alkali metal, have special importance as a central element within optically pumped magnetometers (OPM) and small-format frequency standards (or atomic clocks). Modern developments in this field are particularly aimed at reducing the volume and size of the used components, as this ensures better integration of the sensors and also avoids or limits problems with measurements in inhomogeneous magnetic fields (e.g., when used in the Earth's magnetic field). However, reducing the cell volume contradicts the demand for high sensitivity of the measurement. This emerging contradiction, as well as the microsystem-technological fabrication process of the cells, is the focus of this work. Regarding the fabrication process, developments for handling the highly reactive cesium used here, as well as the possibility of passivating the cell body with thin layers of Al2O3, deposited by atomic layer deposition, against the influence of the used cesium, are presented. Notably, a method developed for the hermetic cell closure allows anodic bonding at room temperature and voltages in the range of 100 V. This unique parameter combination is made possible by the use of thin layers of a lithium-containing glass with high ionic conductivity. The result of this work is an array of several alkali vapor cells connected via channels with a central structure, the reservoir. The reservoir serves to take up the cesium. The array design ensures identical properties or characteristics of the individual cells. In particular, by adjusting the used buffer gas and the buffer gas pressure in the cells, the achievable shot-noise-limited sensitivity of the fabricated cells could be increased to values of approximately 150 fT/ [sqrt] Hz. When relating this value to the cell volume of 50 mm^3, a value of 33.6 fTcm^3/2 / [sqrt] Hz is obtained for the cells. This represents an international top value for measurements in the used operating regime.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4168596-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147131-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4221617-5>
Laser Spectroscopy on Highly Charged Bismuth Ions for Testing Quantum Electrodynamics ¤ The work deals with a test of quantum electrodynamics in strong fields using laser spectroscopy of the ground state hyperfine structure of highly charged bismuth ions. The experiment was performed and evaluated at the ESR storage ring of the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt. Space charge effects were systematically investigated and the laser wavelength measurement was verified by absorption spectroscopy of iodine. By in-situ measurement of the electron cooler voltage, the ion velocity was determined, which reduced the largest systematic uncertainty of the previous experiment by more than an order of magnitude. This showed the need for the establishment of a permanently installed high-voltage measurement at the electron cooler, which was driven forward within the scope of the work. The specific difference determined from the measured wavelengths deviates so significantly from the theoretical prediction that none of the investigated systematic errors can be considered as the cause of the deviation. In addition to doubts about the values from the theory, the literature value of the magnetic moment of bismuth-209 is mentioned as a possible cause and presented in the outlook, how in subsequent experiments this riddle could be solved.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162347-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4293230-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160168-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4572240-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4285389-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189262-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161052-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047982-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4364318-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034620-1>
Concept and Investigation of a Bistable Safety Valve and Simulation-Based Development of a Method for Its Dimensioning ¤ Safety valves for gas pipelines - so-called gas flow monitors - are indispensable mechanical protective devices that prevent the uncontrolled release of large gas quantities in the event of an accident or intentional manipulation. This can prevent gas explosions and the resulting existential consequences. The known solutions for safety valves have a significant disadvantage due to their monostable switching behavior, as they automatically reopen after triggering and thus release the gas flow. Potential sources of danger remain undetected. The essential advantage of a new safety valve lies in the realization of a bistable switching characteristic through the use of pre-tensioned flexible suspension elements. The reliable dimensioning of such a new valve proves to be an extremely challenging task in practice and requires a lot of experience, especially in dealing with numerical simulation tools. The present work is intensively concerned with the investigation of flexible suspension elements and the resulting valve switching behavior for different geometric dimensions. The goal and motivation of the work is to reduce the existing hurdles in dimensioning and provide a simple-to-apply dimensioning model. The results of the work are based to a large extent on FEM simulations of the deformation behavior of the flexible suspension elements. Based on the determined force-displacement curves, it has been possible to describe the switching behavior mathematically using derived dimensioning equations and to provide a method for dimensioning new safety valves based on this. In addition, the dimensioning model was carefully validated using experimental investigations on real suspension elements. At the end of the work, the behavior of various valve prototypes was also considered in practical use at test facilities. The gained knowledge flows into the results and ensures a high quality of the dimensioning model. Furthermore, the results can also be used for dimensioning bistable systems in other application fields.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7619504-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126496-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156052-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131142-5>
Interfigurality in Phaedrus: A Fable of Self-Representation ¤ That Phaedrus, in particular, develops a complex poetics in the framing poems of his fabulae Aesopiae, is a fact that can be considered established in research. Scant attention has been paid so far to the central role that the characters of the fables play in Phaedrus' literary program and self-representation. The fable poet uses characters such as the genre founder Aesop, the donkey, the dog, a peasant, but also gods as a vehicle for his self-presentation and highlights their ambivalence as a poetological strategy: By inscribing himself through these characters as an inconsistent fable poet, Phaedrus presents inconsistency and multifacetedness as central elements of his poetics. Such a poetological and self-representational dimension of the fable actors can be explained by the concept of interfigurality, with which complex relationships between characters and the authorial I can be described. In the text-adjacent interpretations, various references to Horace's work also appear, and they illustrate how Phaedrus seeks to establish the fable as an independent genre in the post-Augustan literary landscape.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122349-4>
Congestion Management in the German and European Electricity Supply ¤ The work examines in detail for the first time the various legal questions that arise in connection with the management of bottlenecks in the national electricity supply networks and at the border coupling points. Based on a thorough analysis of the legal framework for congestion management (inter alia Regulation 714/2009, Sections 13, 14 EnWG, Sections 11, 12 EEG) the prerequisites and legal consequences of the short-term (e.g. Countertrading, Redispatch) and long-term (e.g. explicit and implicit auctions, Market Coupling) instruments of congestion management are worked out and systematized. In doing so, the numerous individual questions that arise in connection with congestion management are dealt with in detail, such as capacity calculation and capacity allocation, secondary trading, revenue use, market delimitation, selection of measures of short-term congestion management, remuneration, liability and compensation, cooperation of network operators, supervision and efficiency control	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121178-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4208377-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4792975-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130688-0>
Supported Employment according to § 55 SGB IX: A Social and Labour Law Examination of the Future-Oriented Participation Instrument and Simultaneous Critical Norm Analysis ¤ The dissertation discusses legal questions related to seeking benefits based on the supported employment act in Germany. Problems of both social security and labour law during the stages of the procurement of appropriate services, granting benefits and realising them practically are considered. This concerns legal premises, the characteristics of the legal relationship between the parties involved, the statutory sources from the German severely disabled act, membership in several branches of the German social security insurance as well as questions of applicability of competition laws. The legislator’s regulations are reflected critically. Furthermore, changes are proposed in order to eliminate statutory shortcomings.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134681-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005979-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4203086-9>
Protection against Private Law-Shaping Administrative Acts in Regulatory Law ¤ The protection against private law-shaping administrative acts, such as remuneration approvals, illustrates the legal challenges that arise in the context of multipolar relationships in administrative law in a tangible way. Originally uninvolved parties at the citizen-state relationship can rise to the position of a co-recipient. The related protection questions must be answered within the existing subjective protection system with its nucleus of subjective public law. The work deals with these questions and places them in a larger dogmatic context by incorporating the topos of the 'functional change of administrative jurisdiction'.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063321-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7698651-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137448-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048835-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201190-5>
State-of-charge optimization of 110-kV distribution networks for maximum transport of feed-in from renewable energy sources ¤ The electrical energy supply systems of the Federal Republic of Germany have been shaped by changes in the generation structure due to energy policy requirements for years. As a result of the targeted promotion of regenerative power plants, there has been a massive increase in regenerative power generation in the distribution network sector, which continues to this day. In some regions, the installed regenerative power generation capacity already exceeds the peak load of the underlying medium-voltage networks significantly, so that overloads can occur in the high-voltage network in unfavorable feed-in situations. To ensure network security, the distribution network operators are forced to reduce the feed-in from regenerative power plants in these situations. These operational interventions will continue to increase, as the implementation of network reinforcement and expansion projects cannot keep pace with the continuously increasing integration of new power plants. In the predominantly meshed operated high- and extra-high voltage networks, the adaptation of the network topology to the expected feed-in and load situation can be an appropriate means of eliminating bottlenecks and increasing transport capacity. This work therefore addresses the question of how much energy can be fed in from regenerative power plants through state-of-charge optimization of existing 110-kV distribution networks. For the answer to the question, an extended congestion management procedure is proposed, which takes into account not only the topological degrees of freedom but also further operational adaptation measures, such as feed-in management. For the evaluation of the network operation state, the integration of the known procedures of load flow and (n-1)-failure simulation from network security calculation is carried out. In this work, a new, for discrete problem statements designed particle swarm optimization algorithm is adapted to the present problem of state-of-charge optimization for the elimination of bottlenecks. This algorithm has proven itself to be particularly robust for the present optimization problem and allows the formulation of further, arbitrary optimization goals also with regard to the changing requirements of network operation management. To reduce the number of discrete decision variables, a new modeling method for cross- and full connections is proposed. This method implicitly takes into account local side conditions with regard to the connection and allows the realistic representation of all practically realizable connection possibilities. The validation of the proposed method is carried out using numerical case studies with the stationary network calculation at two real, medium-sized 110-kV network groups. The investigations are based on real feed-in and load time series with a quarter-hourly resolution. The results show that the transport capacity of the existing network can be increased and the amount of energy fed in from regenerative power plants can be maximized through state-of-charge optimization of the network. The exploitable maximization potential is largely dependent on the network structures and the degree of meshing of the network. Furthermore, it is proven that the definition of multiple network normal switching states for the maximization of feed-in from regenerative power plants on the one hand and the minimization of network losses on the other hand is possible over a period of one year.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4279392-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068598-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4259675-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014224-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4450204-7>
What You Hear: Works, What They Will Have Been Through Us ¤ Musical works in the European-American tradition are meant to be heard. Where do we see music listening from history and the present? What images and what language do listeners use in the process? And to what extent do they even speak through the works? A strong musical script concept has brought it about that these questions do not stand at the center of musicological research on art music. Important exceptions are reception aesthetics and history, which deal with reactions to artworks. However, the experience of hearing does not only determine their reception, but also musical interpretation and even the process of composition. Composers create sheet music in processes of auditory experience. In the process of listening through ideas, they continuously work on a piece. In the comparison between auditory imagination and real sound experience, compositional listening takes on the function of an important corrective. Thus, the musical artwork as a whole is readable as a communicative event in which different groups of listeners interact with each other. In the re-reading of exemplary stations of European-American art music, the book embarks on an aesthetic and music-philosophical search for the traces and imprints that listening subjects leave in works.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040802-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133320-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025405-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072905-9>
The Dark Triad in the Service Context: Influence on Emotional Labor and Consequences for Employees ¤ Text 4. Back cover This study examines the influence of the psychological personality construct of the Dark Triad, consisting of narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism, on the strategies of emotional labor and the resulting positive and negative consequences for employees in the service sector. The data from an online survey designed for this purpose, conducted with 255 service employees, show that psychopaths and narcissists use surface acting to regulate their emotions in interactions with customers. The latter also use the strategy of deep acting. Furthermore, the findings confirm that surface acting mediates the influence of the Dark Triad on burnout, with deep acting acting as a partial mediator in the relationship between narcissism and engagement. Engagement subsequently increases employee satisfaction and performance. The content Emotional labor as intrapsychic processes Strategies of emotional labor The influence of the Dark Triad on emotional labor Target groups Lecturers and students from the fields of marketing, business administration, psychology Practitioners from service companies and sales with a focus on customer orientation and customer loyalty The author Sandra Kruse studied business administration with a focus on Strategy, Management and Marketing at the Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena and completed her Master of Science degree.

Open Access: Academic Publishing and Copyright Obligations of University Professors ¤ The author examines whether the right to Open Access publication can develop into an obligation. The focus is on the rights and obligations of the university professor to his research results and copyright-protected works that arise during his activity in research and teaching. The author comes to the result that the freedom of science according to Art. 5 Section 3 GG, which comprehensively protects the publication freedom of the scientist, sets clear limits to the publication obligation of the university professor for research results. If the research results are content of copyright-protected works, the university professor is not de lege lata obliged to offer these works to his employer or the university. Such an obligation de lege ferenda is opposed by the property and scientific freedom as well as the copyright personality right.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7525775-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025243-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072560-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134205-7>
Anger on Difference : Critical Theory and the Critique of Racism ¤ Racism is an unresolved problem of modern societies. The interplay of rationality and irrationality predestines racism to be the subject of critical theory: This connects the perspective on function and objective genesis of ideologies with a psychological view of subjective processing forms, especially in the variants of its first generation (Adorno, Horkheimer et al.). In order to embed racism in a theory of society, Ulrike Marz devotes herself to the three categories of society, economy, and subject. This expands the theoretical point of view on racism and conveys through critical theory pairs of opposites that are often only one-sidedly treated: Objectivism - Subjectivism, Nature - Culture, Particularism - Universalism	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073840-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076527-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137147-1>
Liability in the Limited Professional Liability Partnership : under special consideration of recourse questions ¤ The work „Liability in the Limited Professional Liability Partnership – under special consideration of recourse questions“ deals with the limited professional liability partnership (PartGmbB), a company form only for freelancers, in which the liability limitation is based on the conclusion of a professional liability insurance. The focus of the work lies on a PartGmbB consisting of lawyers and the peculiarities of the legal professional law. While the external law of this company is relatively clearly regulated, there are numerous unclear questions about the internal relationship between the company, shareholders, and insurance. The work deals in-depth with the statutory recourse possibilities and evaluates the effectiveness of the liability limitation. Furthermore, it provides guidelines for contract design.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049068-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063180-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1221024817> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4415913-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124552-0>
Environmental Protection through Ecotaxes under German and European Law as a Perspective for the Introduction of an Ecological Tax Reform in the People's Republic of China ¤ The change of the global environment requires a sustainable development of state and society worldwide. Ecotaxes are a possible state instrument of shaping. They have a significant advantage due to their market economic incentives compared to regulatory measures and have been successfully used in Germany and other EU countries for years. The Chinese tax system is currently undergoing an economic structural change, at the same time China is striving for a resource-saving and environmentally friendly society. Against this background, Yifan Zhu puts the ecological sustainability of the Chinese tax system to the test. He examines to what extent China can benefit from the experiences of European countries with ecotaxes and makes proposals for the short-term, medium-term, and long-term development of the Chinese tax law and system.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4368640-0>
Globalität sehen : on the visual construction of 'World' ¤ Space photographs, CO2 infographics, and world maps - they do not simply illustrate data, facts, and connections, but create specific conceptions of a world shared by all humans. How they do this, what conceptions of the world this involves in detail, and what can be learned from these visual representation media about concepts of globality and the structure of world society, is researched by Sebastian W. Hoggenmüller using a newly developed method of interpretive image analysis. His book opens up ways to see things that remain hidden from everyday sight. And it sheds light on a theme that has not yet been systematically treated: the visual construction of globality. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/deed.en	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006568-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4557997-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145419-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026475-0>
The Effects of the Tariff Unity Act on Labor Dispute Law ¤ „No labor dispute will be prevented due to the Tariff Unity Act – neither legally nor factually.“ This core thesis of the present investigation is the exact counterpart to the legislator's expectation that decisions will be made on the proportionality of labor disputes in the sense of tariff unity (BT-Drs. 18/4062, p. 12). It is based on a comprehensive, closely oriented analysis of the practical problems of tariff unity, which examines the interplay between the Tariff Unity Act and labor dispute law in the areas of the proportionality of labor disputes, contractual peace obligations, and labor dispute law unit of employees. After some work on the constitutionality of tariff unity, the investigation thus presents the practical effects of tariff unity in the required depth for the first time.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120921-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140007-0>
Wandelbarkeiten of Antisemitism : on the position of Antisemitism in Racism-, Ethnicity- and Nationalism Research ¤ Antisemitism is a phenomenon of exclusion that is both long-lasting and changeable. Its inhomogeneous spread across different milieus, communities, communication spaces, and time periods highlights this finding. In order to make the (dis-)continuities and changeabilities of antisemitism tangible, Oliver Marusczyk develops a process-oriented theory of antisemitic boundary-making. For this purpose, he combines the cultural sociological boundary-making paradigm with intersectionality research in an innovative way and thus makes a contribution to the re-approach of antisemitism research and sociological inequality research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041300-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4234987-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002333-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7729679-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012472-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012475-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076527-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114087-4>
Process as Form : Parametrics as Fundamental Functional Principle of Design ¤ The conditions of the digital present no longer allow for designing in rigid schemas and isolated individual considerations. The permanently changing contexts demand a fundamental adaptability of design, which can only be ensured through a holistic consideration of things in their contexts and a design thinking in changes - through parametrics. Fabian Kragenings indicates a paradigm shift, through which designers no longer design the concrete design, but the conditions of design itself: No longer closed products, but connectable processes are now given a form.

City and Control : the Discourse on Safety and Cleanliness in Inner Cities ¤ A thematization of social control requires urbanistic reflection – just as a thematization of the city must systematically think about aspects of social control. In the framework of a sociological discourse analysis, Guido Lauen shows how the symbolic and material order of an urban society produces, transports, legitimates, and changes city-related knowledge through the discourse on safety and cleanliness in inner cities. To this end, he describes the processes of social construction and dissemination of interpretation and action structures in urban and control-related institutions, organizations, or facilities such as the police, law, or architecture, and addresses the social effects of these processes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012475-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112846-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055719-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113326-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056723-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062110-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4300539-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128511-6>
Usability-evaluation in intelligent environments ¤ In the dissertation, a procedure model for the usability evaluation of intelligent environments, so-called Smart Environments, is developed. As a tool-supported approach, the concept of a virtual Smart Environment is developed. It enables development-accompanying evaluation with increasing real part and decreasing virtual part. Four application scenarios are supported: (1) interactive traversal of models, (2) Wizard of Oz experiments, (3) generation of artificial sensor data, and (4) anonymous playback of recorded data from user studies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7707222-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4820282-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126901-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005541-3>
Hybrid Union Law : the Treaty-Based Supplement to European Integration by Example of the Euro Rescue Measures ¤ Mit dem Europäischen Stabilitätsmechanismus und dem Vertrag über Stabilität, Koordinierung und Steuerung in der Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion wurden zwei völkerrechtliche Verträge abgeschlossen, die zwar formal neben dem Recht der Europäischen Union stehen, institutionell und materiell jedoch eng hiermit verbunden sind und auf eine Fortentwicklung der Europäischen Integration abzielen. Die hieraus resultierende „rechtliche Grauzone“, in der sich beide Verträge befinden, ruft bislang kaum gestellte Fragen nach den Voraussetzungen dieser „hybriden Rechtsakte“ hervor. In diesem Zusammenhang analysiert die Arbeit einerseits die Freiräume und Vorgaben des Unionsrechts und andererseits verfassungsrechtliche Legitimationsanforderungen und Grenzen für völkerrechtliche Verträge, die in einem besonderen Näheverhältnis zum Recht der Europäischen Union stehen. The contract of the European Stability Mechanism and the European Fiscal Compact are international treaties and – from a formal point of view – not part of European Union law. With regard to the institutional level and to the main contents of the contracts, there is a specific relationship to the law of the European Union: Both treaties aim at developing European integration. This situation leads to legal questions about the conditions of this specific type of contract, which have rarely been asked yet. Therefore, this work analyses the conditions which European Union law and German constitutional law require for the legal validity of this kind of international treaty.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4408931-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188829-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071013-0>

Risk Management and Value-Oriented Corporate Governance: Efficiency and Monopoly Effects ¤ Carolin Stier examines the value relevance of risk management. The starting point of her analysis is the neoclassical capital market theory, which forms the basis for deriving capital cost rates as a value standard in value-oriented corporate governance. From the perspective of the new institutional economics and industrial economics, the author considers the influence of risk management on the company's relationships with its stakeholders and competitors. On this basis, the concepts of efficiency and monopoly effects are defined for categorizing the value effects of risk management. It is shown that these effects of risk management primarily affect the company's success to be evaluated and are therefore relevant for the company value.

Consumption Volume Recording of Antibiotics in Livestock Providing Food in Agricultural Enterprises in the District of Kleve ¤ Antibiotics, consumption volume monitoring, livestock. - The Zoonosis Directive 2003/99/EG of 2003 requires resistance monitoring of resistant pathogens in member states. Since the emergence of resistance is likely linked to the use of antibiotics (TEUBER 2001, DE WITH 2004), the directive implies, among other things, the regular recording and evaluation of antibiotic consumption. In some member states such as Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden, comprehensive monitoring programs already exist. Since a direct transfer of existing systems to Germany is not possible due to structural and legal differences, the aim of this study was to investigate the possibilities of data collection on antibiotic consumption in livestock providing food in Germany. In the study conducted in the district of Kleve, the consumption of antibiotic substances was recorded in 65 voluntarily participating cattle and pig farms, and thus representative results on drug consumption in this part of Germany were created and evaluated. As data sources, veterinary application and dispensing documents (§13 TÄHAV) and information from herd books (ANTHV) were used in the participating farms. Consumption data from a period of one year (01 September 2006 to 31 August 2007) were entered into a central database.

The human rights situation of Sunni Kurds in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Problems of the realization of human rights in a strongly religiously shaped legal order in the field of tension between international law, Iranian constitutional law and Shia religious law ¤ The realization of human rights of the Kurdish and Sunni minority in the Islamic Republic of Iran is a challenging task. It is shaped by the tension between the internationally guaranteed human rights on the one hand and the provisions of Islamic law and the Iranian legal order on the other hand. The author deals with the concrete human rights problems of the members of the Kurdish and Sunni minority of the country. Foci are the restrictions on access to public offices for Sunnis, restrictions on the exercise of their freedom of religion and the only strongly restricted language rights of the members of the Kurdish minority. The realization of human rights of the Kurdish and Sunni minorities in Iran is shaped by the tension between the internationally guaranteed human rights on the one hand and the provisions of Islamic law and the Iranian legal order on the other hand. The author deals with the human rights problems of these minorities and focuses on the restricted access to public offices as well as on restrictions in the field of freedom of religion and language rights.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184103-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033792-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074725-6>
Investigations on Oxygen Supply with Perovskite Ceramic Fillings in a Fixed-Bed Reactor ¤ This work demonstrates that the loads on reversibly operating ceramic materials are very low. Regenerative oxygen supply thus generally imposes lower requirements on perovskite ceramic materials for oxygen production than membrane technology. The decrease in diffusion coefficients at low temperatures is significantly less detrimental than in membranes using comparable materials. This could be shown by using the O 2 discharge technology and loading technology in comparison to O 2 separation by ceramic membranes at relatively low temperatures, already large amounts of O 2 can be produced. Due to the low temperatures, there are no problems with reactions between the oxygen-supplying material and the reactor materials. This makes the integration and use of fixed bed fillings conceivable. In comparison, the bonding and operation of thin ceramic membranes in a reactor are significantly more complex. Less periphery and process-related effort is required for oxygen separation by reversibly operating materials than for cryogenic air separation, pressure swing adsorption or membrane technologies. Regenerative oxygen supply can be implemented in both new and existing plants that require oxygen. This makes it possible to dispense with the transport of oxygen. A partial phase transformation of BSCF8020 at elevated temperature and high oxygen supply plays a subordinate role in regenerative oxygen supply, as the required target temperatures (450 ggf. to 650 °C) for O 2 loading and unloading are lower than the temperature range in which decomposition can occur (750 to 800 °C). Furthermore, the time span (O 2 loading cycle) in which BSCF8020 is exposed to sufficient high oxygen levels (p O2 > 10 -3 bar) is too short to complete these transformations. The O 2 discharge cycle always ensures that any initial decomposition is reversed, as the cubic phase is stabilized towards lower p O2. It has been demonstrated that the electronic control of the cyclic oxygen discharge and uptake is controllable. The high separation efficiency of ceramic materials leads to oxygen being supplied electrolytically in a pure state. In general, further research is always to be pursued to increase the oxygen amounts that can be obtained per unit mass of ceramic used, as this may lead to a further reduction in material use or energy expenditure. For the BSCF8020(SVT) selected for the multicyclic investigations of this work, the cobalt component with approximately 80% accounts for the predominant cost share of the oxygen-supplying material. BSCF ceramics with a higher iron content should be subjected to a more detailed characterization for multicyclic applications in fixed bed reactors in order to open up further suitable perovskites with low material costs.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180072-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4159653-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030270-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113549-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173836-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4051803-6>
Qualification Processes of Suburban Open Spaces in Growing Urban Regions: Experiences, Challenges, and Potentials - A Case Study of the Region Cologne/Bonn ¤ Qualification - yes! But how? Dynamic urbanization and transformation processes have led to new phenomena of urban realities. While the qualification of the emerged suburban open spaces is a frequently proclaimed goal in planning, politics, and science, the translation of these qualification goals into planning practice has been little explored so far. The research work assumes that the transformation processes can be controlled by an offensive, development- and implementation-oriented strategy. Based on the planned open space networks in the region of Cologne/Bonn, "RegioGrün'" and "Grünes C", the question is investigated under which conditions qualification processes of suburban open spaces can be successful in the long term. For this purpose, for the two projects implemented within the framework of the Regional 2010, both promoting and hindering process effects are identified, as well as the quality of the process and project goals is examined. The latter are placed in the context of current development trends - the established "Perspective Change on Landscape" - and measured against them. The action- and effect-oriented research approach is based on a comprehensive qualification concept: In addition to the material- and design-related "In-Value-Setting" of the spatial object, it also includes the process itself - along with its results and effects as well as the actors involved in it, their perceptions, thought- and behavior patterns -.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017396-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124268-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056763-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022309-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018319-1>

Novel methods and tools for lactonases, acylases and proteases ¤ Biotechnology, Biocatalysis, Enzyme, Proteins, Quorum sensing, Quorum quenching, N-Acyl-L-Homoserinlactone, Protease, Protein purification, Screening This thesis is about the establishment and the application of novel methods and tools that are re-lated to the most widely used enzyme class: hydrolases. It covers all fields from the identification to the application of these valuable enzymes with particular focus on lactonases, acylases and proteases. The activity assay introduced in Article I substantially extends the method toolbox for studies on lactonases and acylases that interfere with the bacterial cell-cell communication system. Article II describes a fully automatized robotic platform that represents the next-level tool for the high-throughput enzyme screening in the microtiter plate format. It was used, for instance, for the screening for improved porcine aminoacylase I variants. Diverse aspects of the protease-mediated hydrolysis of non-resistant proteins for the purification of resistant target proteins are highlighted in Article III.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069491-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076388-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014988-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054045-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4393622-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047521-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166378-0>

Biofuel Policy in Germany: On the Discursive Construction of a Multiple Problem Solution ¤ Biofuels in Germany -- Interpretative Policy Analysis -- Discourse Coalitions -- Environmental, Agricultural, and Energy Policy -- Ecological Modernization -- Neoliberalization Biofuels have been promoted as a potential solution for a wide range of problems since the 1980s: from oil dependence to agricultural structural change and climate change. Against the backdrop of the German biofuel policy's sudden and sometimes contradictory course, Thomas Vogelpohl draws the societal construction of biofuels over the past thirty years and their reflection in political decisions discursively. He examines how biofuels have gained and maintained their status as a political solution option in Germany and how this complex social construction process can be understood against the backdrop of historically specific political-institutional and paradigmatic framework conditions.

From the 'Peripheral Phenomenon' to the 'Densification Space' : History of 'Right-Wing Extremism' Research since 1945 ¤ The book starts from the observation that a complete confusion about terms and their contents prevails in the research on the ›extreme right‹. By writing the knowledge and concept history of 'right-wing extremism' in the Federal Republic of Germany in the context of the Cold War (Walter Lippmann), it becomes clear in which politically highly contested field different approaches emerge, assert themselves, or are marginalized. Since 1945 until the early 1990s, a continuity of certain interpretation patterns is evident in the Federal Republic. As a publicly particularly effective one has proven itself in the wake of the totalitarianism theory the 'extremism theory', which has been the official line of interpretation for 'right-wing extremism' since about the mid-1970s. This has resulted in significant omissions and abbreviations to this day. These are partly already inherent in the term 'extremism' itself, partly they are also intensified by a science policy influence from the side of politics and state authorities. Finally, newer approaches in research are presented and discussed, in which they are suitable for a re-conceptualization of the research on the extreme right. Studies on the education system and value socialization related to performance and work are thus in greater need of attention, in order to be able to arrive at a new integrating approach.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017894-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048829-9>

Pop and Death : Writing after Theory ¤ Introduction -- Preconditions: Pop, Literature, Theory -- From Ontology to Hantology -- Pop and Death -- Pop as a Way of Life -- Abbreviation Index -- Bibliography -- Register. How has theory changed the novel? And what does Pop have to do with it? The theses of Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, and Jacques Derrida pose problems for writing that become visible in the experimental arrangement of literature and Pop. Pop texts strive for immediacy, presence, life, and at the same time know about the fundamental belatedness of writing. It is this tension that becomes productive in the discussed novels by Christian Kracht, Rainald Goetz, and Thomas Meinecke. In their writing, the encounter of literature and theory culminates in an emphatic understanding of Pop as a way of life, whose theory they formulate again in their novels.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117229-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4448404-5>
Württembergers in North America: Migration from the Swabian Alb in the 19th Century ¤ As part of a global trend, nearly half a million Württembergers embarked on the transatlantic mass migration to North America. What options were available to them? What strategies did they pursue? How did their further life path in the immigration country and society look like? Where and with whom did they settle, how and from what did they live? Under a micro-historical view on personal sources like Württemberg emigration registers, ship passenger lists and American census lists, Jochen Krebber succeeds in drawing a comprehensive, diverse and dynamic picture of the North American migration of 6,000 Swabian migrants from the Southwest Alb, who settled in more than 1,000 locations in the USA and Canada in the course of the 19th century.

Persönlichkeit und Person-Umwelt-Austauschprozesse bei der leichten kognitiven Beeinträchtigung : eine Analyse im Rahmen der Interdisziplinären Längsschnittstudie des Erwachsenenalters (ILSE) ¤ Persönlichkeit, persönlichkeitsnahe Eigenschaften (allgemeine und domänenspezifische Kontrollüberzeugungen) und andere handlungs- und erlebensbezogene Person-Umwelt-Austauschprozesse fanden in Studien zur leichten kognitiven Beeinträchtigung (LKB), die ein mögliches prodromales Stadium der Alzheimer Demenz darstellt, bisher wenig Beachtung. Grundsätzlich hängen wesentliche Persönlichkeitseigenschaften mit der Kognition zusammen. Ferner werden Zusammenhänge zwischen Kontrollüberzeugungen und kognitiver Leistung berichtet, es gibt aber kaum Untersuchungen bei Personen mit LKB. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird überprüft, ob sich Personen mit LKB von kognitiv gesunden Gleichaltrigen in Bezug auf die Entwicklung der Persönlichkeitseigenschaften im Sinne der Big Five sowie der allgemeinen und wohnbezogenen Kontrollüberzeugungen im höheren Lebensalter unterscheiden. Zudem wird der Frage nach dem Erleben der räumlichen Umwelt (Wohnbedeutungen, erlebte Nützlichkeit) und der Person-Umwelt-Passung bei der LKB nachgegangen. Diese Untersuchung basiert auf Daten aus drei Messzeitpunkten (T1: 1993/94, T2: 1997/98, T3: 2005/07) der Interdisziplinären Längsschnittstudie des Erwachsenenalters (ILSE), in deren Rahmen eine umfassende Erhebung körperlicher, psychiatrischer und psychologischer Größen erfolgte. Insgesamt konnten 232 zwischen 1930 und 1932 geborene Studienteilnehmer einbezogen werden. Davon wurde bei 67 zu T3 eine LKB diagnostiziert, 165 waren kognitiv gesund. Den Ergebnissen zufolge zeigt sich in beiden Gruppen eine signifikante Abnahme in Neurotizismus und Extraversion über einen Zeitraum von durchschnittlich 12 Jahren. Offenheit, Verträglichkeit und Gewissenhaftigkeit bleiben hingegen stabil. Personen mit LKB zeichnen sich im Vergleich zu kognitiv gesunden Gleichaltrigen durch signifikant höhere Neurotizismuswerte zum ersten Messzeitpunkt und niedrigere Offenheitswerte zu allen drei Messzeitpunkten aus. Darüber hinaus führen höhere Ausprägungen in Neurotizismus zu einem erhöhten Risiko einer LKB-Entstehung. Im Hinblick auf die persönlichkeitsnahen Eigenschaften nehmen allgemeine internale Kontrollüberzeugungen für negative Ereignisse in beiden Gruppen ab, in Bezug auf die externalen Kontrollüberzeugungen „wichtige Andere“ wird eine Zunahme festgestellt. Auch wohnbezogene externale Kontrollüberzeugungen nehmen im höheren Lebensalter zu. Bei Personen mit LKB zeichnet sich zudem eine Veränderung der räumlich-dinglichen Aspekte von Wohnbedeutungen ab, wobei sich die beiden Gruppen hinsichtlich der erlebten Nützlichkeit und der Person-Umwelt-Passung nicht unterscheiden. Die Befunde der vorliegenden Arbeit unterstreichen die Bedeutung der Persönlichkeitseigenschaften bei der LKB. Höhere Neurotizismuswerte können als ein Risikofaktor für die Entstehung einer LKB angesehen werden. Person-Umwelt-Austauschprozesse im Sinne der Kontrollüberzeugungen scheinen sich hingegen altersabhängig zu verändern. Dies kann auch bei der LKB im Hinblick auf die Selbstständigkeitserhaltung eine wichtige Rolle spielen. Darüber hinaus ergeben sich erste Hinweise auf ein verändertes Umwelterleben in Folge einer kognitiven Beeinträchtigung. Ein besseres Verständnis von Persönlichkeits- und persönlichkeitsnahen Eigenschaften bei einer LKB kann somit nicht nur zur Identifikation von Risikogruppen, sondern auch zur Entwicklung neuer Präventionsmaßnahmen beitragen.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032844-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164473-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045242-6>
The Enforcement of Consumer Rights : A Comparative Legal Analysis of Consumer Rights Enforcement in France, the Netherlands and Germany ¤ The enforcement of consumer rights is regarded as deficient. Germany, France and the Netherlands have traditionally taken different approaches to ensuring that consumer law is enforced effectively. European provisions have also increasingly impacted national enforcement structures. The thesis presents the different forms of consumer law enforcement in Germany, France and the Netherlands. Individual, collective and administrative legal protection instruments and their significance in the legal system will be examined in detail. On the basis of a comparative legal analysis, an alternative approach to improving the enforcement of consumer rights will be presented.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177275-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115712-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117338-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4246789-5>
Truthfulness and Action from Freedom: On the Theory-Practice Problem of Immanuel Kant's Ethics ¤ The starting point of this study is Kant's philosophical anthropology and the insight conveyed in it that man is neither determinable as passive nor as active. The concept of conscience, as well as Kant's thesis of the 'radical evil', stand in a larger context of a critical interpretation of Kant's ethics, which leads to the areas of politics and faith. This provides an important contribution to the clarification of the disputed problem of theory and practice. This is made clear, in an excursus, through an engagement with a more recent work from the current discussion of analytical ethics: Kant's 'determination through freedom' is neither a formal procedure, nor can the categorical imperative be simply understood as 'principle of conflict resolution'.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015602-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047068-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8>
Influence of Cell and Bacterial Culture Supernatants on the In-Vitro Differentiation of Bovine Macrophages/ submitted by Christine Gesterding ¤ Supernatants, Transit period, Macrophages. - Macrophage plasticity is a crucial component of a functioning pathogen defense, where mature macrophages take on various tasks from pathogen elimination to resolution of inflammation and tissue regeneration. The control of macrophage function, polarization, is influenced by mediators produced both by endogenous tissue cells and by pathogens themselves. Within the framework of the present work, this situation was simulated in vitro using cell and bacterial culture supernatants and their influence on monocytes and their differentiation to macrophages was investigated. Since E. coli infections are frequently observed in dairy cows during the transit period, various E. coli isolates were used for bacterial stimulation. Furthermore, it is predominantly factor diseases. Therefore, additional parameters such as the blood sampling time point relative to birth, body condition, lactation number of animals and their health status were taken into account when evaluating the data. Both uterine stromal cell culture supernatants and culture supernatants of uterine epithelial cells were able to activate monocytes. They induced an immediate, concentration-dependent calcium influx. In this context, supernatants of E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - stimulated stromal cells had a ....	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4250701-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050061-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070959-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177897-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067547-6>

Brand Evaluation with Unique Product Attributes ¤ Against the backdrop of the flood of information in advertising, the question arises whether consumers even notice if product information is unique or, conversely, is missing an alternative. At the same time, the lack of 'beacon brands' and product experiences leads consumers to conduct more intensive product comparisons; they become suspicious about the reason why information is missing. Rainer Elste analyzes the phenomenon of missing product information. Strong brands seem to be invulnerable. Do they still suffer if unique attributes are missing? Can weak brands, on the other hand, profile themselves through unique product properties? What influence does advertising have in the interplay of missing information with differently strong brands? The author provides not only surprising answers, which are based on the results of three empirical studies, but also gives various useful overviews, including insights into the classification of attributes and their processing by the consumer.

The European Arrest Warrant and the Proportionality of its Application in Practice ¤ The European Arrest Warrant (EAW) is so far the most successful instrument of European Criminal Law. However, it has a weakness that has been preoccupying politics, science, and practice for years: its disproportionate application to petty crimes, such as the theft of a false beer, or in other cases of excessive harshness, such as the extradition of juveniles or pregnant women. This work drives the solution forward by asking the question of why and in which cases the EAW is applied disproportionately, and investigates whether and how the solution pursued by the EU bodies can be improved in the field of mutual recognition and human rights binding. The work follows a practical approach and places special emphasis on alternative measures to the EAW, and the question of whether these are actually attractive alternatives in practice	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4742193-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191765-0>
Antibiotic Use in Companion Animals ¤ So far, animals that provide food, especially through the food chain, have been considered as multipliers and distributors of antibiotic resistances from animal to human. However, studies have underlined the relevance of companion animals such as horses, dogs, and cats not only as distributors but also as reservoirs. This is particularly promoted by the increasing number of kept animals and their close contact with humans. Therefore, it seems essential from the perspective of treating these individual animals as well as from a One-Health perspective to gain data on the amount and type of antibiotics used and to evaluate them. In general, various data sources are available for this purpose, which can be applied to monitor antibiotic use in companion animals to a greater or lesser extent. Most of the time, it is secondary data sources, as they are not primarily collected for the purpose of monitoring antibiotic use. The analysis of secondary data offers the great advantage that this initially means no additional work for those involved in the veterinary practice routine. Nevertheless, there are differences and limitations regarding the suitability of these data sources for use. Application and dispensing records are already used as a monitoring system under the Medicinal Products Act, but only for animals that provide food. For animals that do not serve food production, these do not need to be filled in. In human medicine, data from insurers provide an overview of the antibiotics used and have been evaluated for years. Data from pet insurance are currently not suitable as a basis for a monitoring system due to the low proportion of insured dogs and cats and the unknown number of insured horses. Furthermore, the various insurance models and the varying scope of services offered by the insurers further limit the benefit. Handwritten documentation had greater importance in the past, which is further decreasing with increasing digitalization and is now used at most as an addition to an electronic documentation. An electronic practice management software is therefore considered a particularly suitable data source for a monitoring system. This combines essential medical information. Within the framework of the evaluations carried out here, the first systematic investigations regarding antibiotic use in dogs, cats, and horses in Germany were successfully carried out from data of an electronic practice management software. Here, it was generally proven that this use is technically possible. Furthermore, specific professional statements could be made. The evaluations include not only the type of active substances used, but also the frequency and quantity as well as the reference to the ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113937-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012494-0>

The Education of the Good Mother: Medical-Pedagogical Instructions for Motherhood in the 18th Century ¤ In the process of shaping and spreading the specifically modern norm of motherhood, medicine plays a decisive role: In the second half of the 18th century, academic medicine and licensed physicians developed a program for the education of the mother, in order to legitimize and control her behavior towards her children. It was only in this process that the idea of motherhood as the central female life principle took hold and the mother became universally responsible and accountable for her infant child. In the medical advisory literature for the >>mothers of the refined and educated classes<< and in the obligatory state writings of the >>Medical Police<< with their unique interweaving of medicine, pedagogy, philosophy, and state science, physicians formulated and propagated the social image of the >>good mother<<. Although physicians initially only addressed the numerically small group of women from the upper bourgeoisie, with the implementation of the bourgeois family ideal, this good mother became an ideology and a model for women of all strata - to this day.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140725-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038243-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170901-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015482-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170889-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048476-2>

Peripheral Resistance : the new Nationalism in the Mirror of Jewish Contemporary Literature ¤ The 2006 FIFA World Cup was perceived by broad sections of the public as a positive turning point in the self-perception of a new German national consciousness after 1945. However, a differentiated positioning of the new nationalism in Germany since the World Cup shows that its ardent supporters still tend to marginalize critical impulses from the Jewish diaspora. Felix Kampel shows, using relevant writings and political statements by Robert Menasse, Maxim Biller, Lena Gorelik, and Olga Grjasnowa, the openly articulated resistance provoked by the new nationalism in these four 'Jewish' contemporary intellectuals. Against the background of classical and more recent texts of nationalism research, it becomes clear that the four authors are involved in a transnational enlightenment work through their protests, which was already hinted at by Friedrich Nietzsche and is currently experiencing an unbroken topicality due to the virulent renationalization trends across all of Europe.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123469-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4419039-6>
Psychotherapy for Obesity: An Examination of the Application of Logotherapy and Behavior Therapy ¤ Morbid obesity (obesity) is one of the most serious health problems of the 21st century. Obesity is associated with a reduced quality of life and an increased risk of physical and mental illnesses. Elke Carina Humer addresses the causes and general treatment and psychotherapy methods with a focus on behavior therapy. Furthermore, she conducts an existential analysis of obesity and explains the possibilities of applying logotherapy and existential analysis in psychotherapy for obesity. Behavior therapy is currently considered the method of choice for psychotherapy. Logotherapy and existential analysis could, however, complement classical, established therapy programs – especially in critical phases of motivation and relapse prevention.

Metatheory of General Didactics: A System-Theoretically Grounded Proposal ¤ General Didactics has fallen into a crisis! For instead of developing new or further developing existing general didactic theories, criticism of the entire discipline has emerged. Although General Didactics has significantly contributed to this crisis due to its history of theory development – in the Federal Republic of Germany, approximately 100 general didactic, relatively isolated theories have been designed since 1945 –, a particularity of the discussion is becoming increasingly evident: individual, often very specific criticism points are not significant for all theories due to the hardly graspable multitude of general didactic theories. In order to make general statements about General Didactics, it would be necessary to formulate this criticism in the systematic framework of an explicit metatheory, which offers the basic possibility of considering all general didactic theories.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4289909-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070463-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135148-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190121-6>
Organ Remuneration in Non-Profit Organizations ¤ Hardly any topic from the field of the third sector gains as much public attention as excessive remuneration by persons with management responsibility in NPO. While the well-known cases from the media are often legally clear, there are countless pitfalls in practice that can make the compatibility of remuneration with the applicable law unpredictable. The lack of supreme court case law and the inconsistent administrative practice exacerbate the problem. The present work therefore attempts to scientifically structure the network of civil law requirements (organizational responsibility, statutory requirement, design limits) and tax law selflessness, and to develop a guide for practice, in particular for the assessment of appropriate remuneration for organ holders. - The dissertation was awarded the "W.

Indebted Kings : Money, Politics, and the Chamber of the Realm in the 15th Century ¤ New mechanisms of politics allowed the financial demand to grow far beyond the available amount of money in the 15th century, making this century the era of the indebted kings. The crowns of Europe were acquired with credits and pledged to secure credits. The cities with their merchants became the stage and transmitter of a realm policy, whose functionality now essentially rested on credit relationships. While in older research the history of the chamber and the royal conduct with debts and credits was considered success-oriented from an economic and administrative historical perspective, Mathias Kluge's study offers a functional and effect-oriented analysis. Kluge illuminates a dark side of financially hungry realm policy by examining the royal handling of money not according to economic and economic principles, but in the context of political and representative purpose. In this context, the history of those who needed money or lost it under political pressure comes to the fore. The growing pressure to finance led to the emergence of new forms of realm policy that made credit possible in the first place. They shaped the following centuries.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4208851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032950-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127795-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127425-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151359-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031516-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053461-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4263479-9>

Drei-Eltern-Kinder : the evaluation of Mitochondrial Replacement Techniques under German Law ¤ Mitochondrial replacement techniques are relatively new medical procedures in which the components of egg cells from two women are combined. This is intended to prevent genetically caused mitochondrial diseases of the embryo, which later develops from this egg cell. The embryo thus carries genetic components from three people. The first known 'three-parent child' was born in 2016. The author concludes through interpretation that the Embryo Protection Act stands in the way of application in Germany. Subsequently, she examines the question of whether the techniques would have to be allowed in Germany from a constitutional point of view. She addresses the constitutionality of the ban on egg cell donation and the ban on germ line interventions. In addition, the legal situation in the United Kingdom and the United States is analyzed, where the techniques are already permitted or will possibly be permitted soon. The work concludes with legal policy implications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194102-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124939-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197011-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187680-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139469-0>

Trust in Bank Investment Advice from an Economic Ethics Perspective ¤ Investment advice is a form of cooperation between banks and customers, whose functioning is based on the trust of customers. If trust is lost, the realizability of mutually beneficial and socially desirable cooperation is endangered. In fact, banks have reduced trust in themselves and their own investment advice in many cases through their behavior towards private customers. The present dissertation models the process of bank trustworthiness and its determinants through the mediation of trustworthiness and perception among bank customers up to the formation of trust and its impact on customer cooperation willingness. Based on this model, frictions are identified and analyzed as empirical conditions that deter banks from investing in the asset value of trustworthiness or from trustworthy behavior. From the insights gained from the analysis, criteria for appropriate solution mechanisms are derived. Approaches from the Investor Protection and Function Improvement Act 2011 are evaluated based on this and improvement proposals are derived.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5>
Multicultural Teams in Elderly Care: A Qualitative Study ¤ Text 4. Back cover[1] (max. 1400 incl. spaces) Maya Stagge deals with the influence of cultural plurality in elderly care teams on team dynamics, cooperation, and care quality within the framework of a qualitative cross-sectional study. The author examines the effects of demographic development, national and international migration movements, and the field of elderly care from various perspectives. Using a database search on multicultural teams in care, she explores the micro-level.

Investigation of virus spread and persistence in murine Theiler-Encephalomyelitis in experimentally infected mice using polyclonal antibodies and RNA probes ¤ murine Theiler-Encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), viral spread, Multiple Sclerosis. - Experimental infection with the murine Theiler-Encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Cardiovirus and the family Picornaviridae, induces a demyelinating leukomyelitis in susceptible mouse strains. After an acute infection phase in the brain, the virus is eliminated in resistant C57BL/6 mice, whereas an insufficient antiviral immune response in susceptible SJL/J mice leads to viral persistence. Furthermore, the virus antigen triggers a delayed hypersensitivity reaction and myelin-specific autoimmunity, which cause an inflammatory demyelination predominantly in the spinal cord of susceptible mouse strains. These changes correspond to those of the chronically progressive course of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in humans. Based on the results of previous studies, the question arises regarding the spread of the virus and the formation of lesions in the central nervous system (CNS) at the beginning and during the chronic course of the experimental ....	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188401-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040693-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4254833-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4294568-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169148-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152136-5>
Enthusiasmus : Investigation of a Multidimensional Construct in the Context of Musical Education ¤ Kristin Wömmel investigates 'Enthusiasm' as an etymological term and phenomenon. In doing so, she draws on knowledge and related theories of enthusiasm from philosophy, psychology, and the social sciences for the first time in music pedagogy. Using a specially developed typology, the author provides first, empirically supported answers to questions about the triggering, possible forms of expression, and long-term effects of enthusiasm in music pedagogical situations. Finally, the phenomenon of enthusiasm is systematically examined, detached from the pedagogical context, in the experience of the individual, alone or together in a group, in various everyday situations. The content What is Enthusiasm? Musical Enthusiasm Psychological Theories in the Context of Enthusiasm Development of Theories on Enthusiasm The Target Groups Lecturers and students of pedagogy, particularly music pedagogy, psychology, philosophy, and the social sciences (Music-)Pedagogues, teachers of all disciplines, psychologists The Author Kristin Wömmel works at the Berlin Philharmonic Foundation in Berlin.

Behavioral Norm and Time: A Criminal Law Doctrine Investigation ¤ Pursuant to an entrenched paradigm of German criminal law theory, criminal offences require the breach of an individual legal duty. Unveiling its ontological and doctrinal inconsistencies, the author challenges this view and drafts an alternative approach that forgoes the breach of duty as a constitutive element of crime.Survey of contentsA.

Conclusion in Theses To the supporting pillars of current crime theory, the assumption that crimes require the violation of legal behavioral duties belongs. This is contradicted by Lars Berster in his present work. Starting from an analysis of the temporal existence of behavioral norms, he shows that punishable behavioral duties at the time of the offence can regularly not have come into existence. Furthermore, he reveals that the breach of duty as a crime element represents a dogmatic foreign body that cannot be smoothly integrated into the doctrines of the last hundred years or into the dogmatics of result crimes. Finally, he drafts a crime theory beyond the established behavioral duty dogma that avoids the mentioned ontological and dogmatic inconsistencies, but is able to integrate the knowledge treasures of the prevailing criminal law doctrine to a large extent.Inhalts&uuml;bersichtA.

Social Work in Multiprofessional Cooperation: A Gender-Critical Investigation of Action-Guiding Orientations in Professional Positioning at the Example of Early Help ¤ The book presents an empirical investigation of the gender- and profession-related positioning of social work professionals in cooperation with healthcare professionals. In this context, power configurations are identified in which a limitation of the fundamental (feminized) competence of social work professionals for early help takes place. Based on the empirical reconstructions, a professionalism model is proposed that encourages a systematic handling of gender dynamics in practice and in disciplinary spaces of social work.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020775-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055676-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028892-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071776-8>

Cloud Computing in International Tax Law: A Dogmatic and Normative Analysis ¤ How is and should the digitalized economy be taxed? This question receives great attention in both public and political discussion as well as in science. Cloud Computing forms a strongly growing part of the 'digital economy'. This is characterized by a high degree of cross-border transaction provision due to the lack of presence binding. Till Krummel examines the treatment of Cloud Computing from a tax perspective with regard to national foreign tax law and international treaty law. He subjects his results to a normative evaluation and asks whether the taxation of Cloud Computing as a digital business model is currently carried out in a suitable manner. In addition, he discusses current reforms on OECD and UN levels.Inhalts&uuml;bersichtEinleitung Kapitel: 1 Grundzüge des Geschäftsmodells Cloud Computing A. Der Begriff Cloud ComputingB.

Hospital Cooperations: A Case Study Analysis of Cooperation Projects ¤ In the business administration work, the possibilities of use of cooperations in the hospital area are shown and the organizational implementation is presented. The author proves that $aCooperations are an instrument for the extension of the scope of action in the health care$z are. They lead to a gain in flexibility, which is especially necessary for hospital management, since the changing environment requires measures of management. Above all, for the solution of the conflict of goals of "cost reduction without loss of quality" cooperations offer a promising potential. In a meta-analysis of practice examples, a taxonomy of hospital cooperations was developed. It was possible to $an identify nine different types of cooperation organizations$z and to describe them in detail, which differ in terms of tasks and organizational structure and enable a choice of alternatives depending on the cooperation task. For effective and efficient cooperation management, it is to be demanded that the organizational structure has a fit with the cooperation task. The investigation is also of interest for companies that stand in performance relationships with hospitals. For example, the trend of cooperation between hospitals and suppliers is considered, on the other hand, important influencing factors also result from partnerships between hospitals among themselves or with doctors, social services, etc. for example, for providers of pharmaceutical and medical services	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078604-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032786-3>
Citizen Participation in Administration: The Hamburg Deputationen as an Outdated Form of Involvement or a Proven Instrument of Cooperation ¤ This book illuminates the traditional administrative body of the Hamburg Deputationen in the context of administrative science, history, law, and political science. As a central question, it is investigated whether the Deputationen in their form existing until the end of the 21st legislative period had a justification for existence, what historical origins they were, what reform needs there were, and whether they corresponded to the constitutional requirement in Article 56 of the Hamburg Constitution (a. F.), to let the people participate in administration. To this end, a comprehensive quantitative survey is conducted with the help of a standardized questionnaire among the Deputierten, supplemented by a qualitative survey in the form of guide interviews. On the other hand, the historical roots since the late Middle Ages and the developments up to the present day are worked out, as well as the legal situation in the background of constitutional history and reality, also in comparison to other German states. The author Stephan Meyn works as an administrative councilor at the Lower Saxony County Council. Prior to this, he studied Public Management (Bachelor) in Hamburg and Public Administration (Master) in Kassel.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008767-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063317-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4149122-1>
Cinematic Poetics of Guilt: The Audiovisual Accusation of the Senses as a Modality of Community Feeling ¤ How are complex sense, identity, and value constructions produced in the temporal and dynamic patterns of medial forms and practices? How do cinematic images generate and transform the affectively grounded structures in which the value horizon of a community is measured, confirmed, or revised? This work argues that the concrete temporal and dynamic structures of films produce culturally and historically specific patterns of world experience. Using the collective sense of guilt and the affect of irreversibility, this work shows how an aesthetic modulation of moral feelings can be described as the calculus of audiovisual staging patterns. This calculus is described and made analytically accessible through three exemplary objects – German post-war cinema, the Hollywood Western and Vietnam War film, and climate change films –. Audiovisual staging modes and their modeling of feeling are thus to be clarified as a cultural practice that works at the conditions of possibility of political communities and their historicity.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049716-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017102-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127324-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140048-3>
The Thuringian Party System: Emergence, Development, and Structure since 1990 ¤ Through a systematic structural analysis, this study provides an in-depth overview of the emergence and development of the Thuringian party system, from the peaceful revolution of 1989/90 to 2016. It focuses on the Thuringian parliamentary elections, which have structured the party system since 1990. Like the Free State of Thuringia as a whole, the Thuringian party system has developed continuously since its creation. But how has it developed since 1990? Do aspects of change outweigh those of continuity or vice versa? Has the system in Thuringia developed differently from those in the other federal states formed during German reunification in 1990? The author answers these and other questions in this comprehensive work, and thus bridges a gap in research about a regional party system in Germany’s new federal states.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075906-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034386-8>
Family External Corporate Succession: An Empirical Investigation of Acquisitions of Family Businesses ¤ Family businesses and the management problem of corporate succession -- Family external corporate succession as an acquisition process -- Explorative derivation of influence factors in a family external succession process -- Procedure and methodology of the empirical investigation -- Results of the empirical investigation -- Final considerations. What makes the acquisition of medium-sized family businesses so special and which critical influence factors can be identified? Hendrik Weber addresses this very practice-relevant question from a theoretical and empirical perspective. With a total of 408 examined succession cases, the empirical investigation is the most comprehensive in the German-speaking region and makes an important contribution to the identification and evaluation of relevant influence factors on succession success. It builds a bridge between family business research and M&A literature and provides valuable approaches for practice.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078600-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4503339-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061953-9>
The Function of Mediate Possession in the Acquisition of Movable Property: Investigation and Modification of Mediate Possession in View of its Significance for the Acquisition of Movable Property ¤ The transfer of movable property is carried out by delivery or delivery substitute. Uwe-Michael Voigt investigates the compelling consequences of delivery and the conditions that must be met accordingly, such as the establishment and transfer of mediate possession, in order to be considered a suitable 'substitute' for delivery in accordance with §§ 929–935 BGB. Functional equivalence is required, and thus the modification of mediate possession in relation to its common design. The reason for this is that important features of delivery – in view of the transfer of (legal-) factual transferability from the seller to the buyer side and the exclusivity of this transferability – cannot be consistently maintained if a transfer is carried out by establishing or transferring mediate possession. However, this is precisely what is required after the investigated function of mediate possession for the acquisition of movable property. A modification of mediate possession in accordance with this function is also possible without thereby violating the legally clearly defined conditions of mediate possession. It results in the most disputed cases of acquisition by an unauthorized party, e.g. the so-called 'sugar cases' and the 'framing machine case', that an acquisition by an unauthorized party cannot take place because the required mediate possession is lacking.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132511-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006308-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224988-0>
Development Systematics of Thermal Management for High-Quality LED Systems ¤ The demand for increasingly powerful LED systems while simultaneously limited space requires increasing demands on thermal management. Not only the lifespan, but also optical properties, such as light flux and color, depend on the LED chip temperature. As a result of a pronounced temperature dependence, the development process of LED systems is very complex. This complexity arises due to the larger number of interconnected elements, which are realized in different disciplines. Due to this fact, there is a need for a cross-disciplinary development process that takes into account the tasks, problems, and requirements of all disciplines. Within the scope of this work, a possible integration of the disciplines relevant to the error-free functionality of thermal management with the engineering approach in product development was specified. The result is a systematics that structures the development process of LED systems and assigns suitable methods and tools of thermal management. The applicability of the development systematics was presented using the design of two demonstrators. In this context, it was shown that the interaction of the various disciplines opens up potential for the design of new products and applications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035633-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197163-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4203793-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139402-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133187-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126056-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4382130-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112704-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064211-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125154-4>
School Development Inclusion: Empirical Single-Case Study of a School Development Process ¤ Which challenges and success conditions for a school development process towards inclusion are thematized by teachers? In order to be able to analyze the school development process on the actual implementation level, a school was accompanied over the course of two years on its way to becoming an inclusive school through a Grounded-Theory study. Data were successively collected and evaluated from the perspective of teachers through group discussions, photography single interviews, and document research. The qualitative single-case study shows the complexity of the development process. The interplay between personal change experiences of teachers and the changed framework conditions of the school are illustrated. An overview of the central themes in the inclusive school development process is given, a heterogeneous positioning within the faculty is shown, and the connection between both aspects is concretized. In the course of interpretation, for example, the school organization becomes visible as a hurdle in the inclusive school development process or the different interpretation of the inclusive school development project by the teachers is worked out.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126892-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7693897-9>

Universities in Strategic Competition : Empirical Analysis of Horizontal Differentiation of German Universities ¤ German universities are increasingly confronted with the challenges of a global market and rising competition intensity. Dominik Erhardt explains significant competition factors on the university market with their connections and shows the degree of horizontal differentiation of German universities. Although the majority of German universities have made an effort in recent years to align themselves strategically, it is shown that they often fail to achieve their goal. The author provides recommendations for action to overcome this strategic deficit and shows approaches to differentiation in university competition.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136439-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065835-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4503311-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072560-1>
Climate Policy in Urban Development: Between Discursive Guiding Conceptions and Political Practice ¤ What problems does local politics face in terms of urban development and climate, and why can't corresponding federal programs be simply implemented? From a politically-geographical perspective, Cindy Sturm shows, using the examples of Dresden and Münster, that these programs encounter different rationalities and problematizations and are adopted and modified in various, often unexpected or resistant practices of urban development policy. Based on discursive and governmentality-theoretical approaches, the study thus contributes to clarifying the complexity of local politics in general and climate policy in particular.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073648-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547705-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056730-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1079427864> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012475-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1>
Psychological Disorders in Autism Therapy ¤ The book aims to identify areas where autistic individuals with co-occurring mental health disorders see personal therapy needs and how these are currently addressed in autism therapy. To this end, the research question „How do adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder and psychiatric comorbidity distinguish their therapy concerns between so-called autism therapy and psychotherapy and how well does this fit with the view, possibilities, and competences of autism therapy?“ is posed. Building on a theory-based part with presentation of the most common comorbidities in Autism Spectrum Disorders as well as the current framework conditions of psychotherapy (health insurance benefits) and autism therapy (integration assistance benefits) a qualitative study was conducted to answer the question. The results of the interviews show that a distinction between therapy concerns between autism therapy and psychotherapy only succeeds to a limited extent. Autism therapy providers are and see themselves predominantly not in a position to specifically address psychotherapeutic issues, even if the autistic individuals feel predominantly well taken care of in the respective autism therapeutic setting. The author Rebecca Frese is in training as a child and adolescent psychotherapist. Since the Bachelor's degree, she has been active in counseling and therapy in the field of mental health disorders as well as autism.

The Construction of the "Others" : Barbarian Images in the Letters of Sidonius Apollinaris ¤ Sidonius Apollinaris was a politician, bishop, poet, and member of a self-assured Gallo-Roman aristocracy. He is one of the most important personalities of the 5th century in Gaul. His life - shaped by the increasing disintegration of the Roman Empire - is reflected in his letters. In these, he reports on political agreements, intrigues, friendship conventions, and processes the changes of his patria symbolized by the real and literary presence of 'barbarians'. Using a theoretical framework that connects concepts of alterities, identities, and tradition, Veronika Egetenmeyr analyzes in her study the letters originating from Sidonius and intended for public circulation systematically. The 'barbarian' appears as a literary construct subject to a series of conditions and cannot be dichotomously resolved. The strict and paradigmatic opposition between 'Roman' and 'barbarian' cannot be maintained in the letters of Sidonius Apollinaris. Depending on the context of the letter and the readership, not only the image of the 'barbarian' changes, but also the literary identity of the author. In the end, the letter-writing author Sidonius appears as a multiple personality. The true Sidonius, however, remains in self-chosen obscuritas	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124605-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127240-7>
The "equally efficient competitor" : Cost-Price Comparisons in Cartel Law at the Example of Abuse of Disability ¤ The benchmark of the "equally efficient competitor" has not least gained great practical significance for the prohibition of abuse of disability in the framework of the "more economic approach". The work goes into the historical and economic background of the benchmark, examines its application history and provides a critical evaluation on this basis. The work is comparative law and strongly interdisciplinary oriented, in which it makes a significant contribution to the complex of controversial questions, how insights of industrial economics can be cast into a practical legal framework in the face of various restrictions. It increases the clarity in the interpretation of the demanding prohibition of abuse of disability, by providing important assistance for the application of the "equally efficient competitor" test.

Reinvention of the Nation after National Socialism? : Conflict Lines and Positions in West German Post-War Politics ¤ Shida Kiani examines the process of the „reinvention“ of the German nation after National Socialism. The focus is on the west German post-war politics, particularly on the central controversies fought by the parties during the Adenauer era (1949 – 1963) in the German Bundestag on the West integration/european integration of the Federal Republic, the relationship to the GDR and the Oder-Neiße border as well as the handling of the NS past. It is pursued which conceptions of nation competed with each other at that time and how in the political disputes of the early Federal Republic again a pre-state or pre-constitutional conception of the German nation could prevail over a state-related, understanding the nation as a subjectively constituted political will community conception. The content · From the discontinuity to the continuity crisis · Supranational breakthrough in national interest · Unity in conflict · On the persistence of „we“ · Between demarcation and integration The target groups · Lecturers and students of the social sciences as well as history The author Shida Kiani is an editor with a focus on political science.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044737-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194747-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041279-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038461-5>

The Influence of Induced Sadness on the Olfactory and Gustatory Thresholds of Healthy Women ¤ The sense of smell and taste are closely linked to emotions and are influenced by our mood. Depressive patients have a reduced olfactory sensitivity. Similarly, a changed perception of taste has been shown in depressives. However, even healthy people are susceptible to their sense of smell by an induced sad mood, which is experimentally induced. We set up the hypothesis in this work that a sad mood can reduce both olfactory and gustatory sensitivity. To this end, we induced a sad and a neutral mood in healthy subjects using the Velten mood induction procedure. We investigated the perception of taste and smell before and after the induced mood using threshold tests. In contrast to our established hypothesis, the olfactory sensitivity of the subjects who received the sad mood induction did not decrease. Rather, we were able to show a significant decrease in the perception thresholds for the two odorants n-Butanol and Phenylethyl alcohol in the sad affect, which means an increase in the sense of smell. No significant change in the perception of the sweet and sour taste substance could be recorded after the sad mood induction. Our results are in contrast to the studies conducted with depressive patients. We assume that an induced sad mood has a different influence on the perception of smell and taste than a depression. How a sad mood affects perception can only be speculated. Probably, changed attention aspects play a crucial role in an induced sad mood.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183349-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157029-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019702-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156907-6>
Front End Decision Making : The Emergence of Highly New Innovation Projects in Companies ¤ The initiative is the triggering impulse for an innovation project. However, the individual decision to take the initiative is not observable and therefore difficult to control. Despite the high importance of this early phase of the innovation process, it has so far received relatively little attention. Dietfried Globocnik examines different theoretical reference points on their explanatory contributions to the emergence of initiatives, derives basic conditions and develops a model of how the decision to take the initiative comes about. Supported by an innovative empirical study, he shows which personal characteristics make a „initiator“ and which work environment promotes the proactive taking of the initiative.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4374764-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027089-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061963-1>
Extraterritorial Obligations : International Human Rights Law and German Foreign Trade Promotion ¤ Human rights relevant economic projects, such as dam constructions, projects of the extractive industry and exports of weapons or nuclear facilities, always raise the question of whether the home state has a human rights responsibility to limit the behavior of its private economic actors on foreign territory. The legal problem becomes particularly acute when the home state even financially promotes such projects. The examination of the question of whether home states can be held völkerrechtlich accountable in this regard is a litmus test for the legal reality of the repeatedly reaffirmed claim of the universal validity of human rights. -- The author takes up this problem area on the basis of the example of German foreign trade promotion and examines international law on the existence, scope, and fulfillability of extraterritorial protection obligations, i.e., state obligations to guide the behavior of private economic actors and positively affect the human rights situation on foreign territory. He comes to the result that the current international law already demands an extraterritorial protection, albeit only to a limited extent.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074725-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133886-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136939-7>
Sulfate reduction and iron-manganese cycling in intertidal surface sediments of the southern North Sea ¤ The main focus of this thesis is the investigation of factors controlling the cycles of manganese, iron and sulfur in different types of intertidal sediments. Seasonal biogeochemical investigations in sand, mixed, and mud flats of the backbarrier region of the North Sea Island Spiekeroog give insight into the microbial processes and their geochemical consequences during organic matter decomposition. Concurrent measurements of microbial sulfate reduction, dissolved and reactive iron and manganese pools, organic matter availability and temperature dynamics in different sediments demonstrate the strong effect of the activity of sulfate reducing bacteria on metal cycling. These findings show, that besides temperature, the availability of reactive organic matter is the main controlling factor for microbial sulfate reduction in the investigated intertidal flats. The exchange of dissolved iron and manganese across the sediment-water interface indicates that intertidal sediments act as an important location for the transformation of manganese. <engl.>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4461613-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164552-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180416-8>
The Alien Tort Statute and Transnational Tort Claims: In the Context of Multinational Corporate Human Rights Responsibility ¤ Can one use a norm dating back to the 18th century, which has almost faded into obscurity, to compensate for constitutional deficits and negative effects of modern globalization? At first glance, this seems like a strange undertaking. Probably also because of the initially unfamiliar approach for German legal scholars to force global human rights protection through national civil proceedings, the studied Alien Tort Statute has often been viewed critically. The work examines the US phenomenon of „Transnational Human Rights Litigation“ and bridges a gap to a trend also perceived in Europe, which goes in the direction that comparable forms of strategic civil litigation also gain importance in Europe. Furthermore, the author deals with the fundamental question of how global legal or social standards can be better established through a multidimensional regulatory network.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075092-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4276272-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4203630-6>
Policy-Integration and Sustainability: Integrative Policy in the Sustainability Strategy of the German Federal Government ¤ Introduction -- Policy-Integration: Concepts and Criticism -- Reconceptualization: Policy-Integration as Analytical Perspective -- Sustainability and Integration: Sustainability as Integration Idea -- Sustainability Policy and Policy-Integration: Integrative Policy of Sustainability -- Governmental Sustainability Strategies -- Integrative Sustainability Policy: Evaluation Approach -- Integrative Sustainability Policy in Germany -- Summary, Reflection, and Research Perspectives. The call for a 'policy from one mold' is not new; recently, however, it is particularly loud in the context of sustainability. So, effective treatment of complex sustainability problems requires the integration of sectoral policies into a comprehensive and coherent sustainability policy. But what exactly is meant by policy-integration in the context of sustainability? Basil Bornemann provides a systematic clarification of the relationship between policy-integration and sustainability in conceptual and empirical terms. Based on a criticism of the existing discourse, policy-integration is developed as a generic analytical perspective. It forms the basis for the formulation of a normative concept of integrative sustainability policy together with an interpretation of sustainability as an integration idea. In a detailed empirical case study, the strategic sustainability policy of the German federal government is then analyzed to see whether and to what extent it meets the requirements of an integrative policy of sustainability.

Sign Dialogues: Language-Analytical and Interpretative Impulses for Interreligious Learning between the Three Abrahamic Religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) ¤ At the end of the 90s, the language-analytical approach of the sign didactics by Michael Meyer-Blanck read against the symbol didactic conceptions of Hubertus Halbfas and Peter Biehl from a semiotic perspective and thus accounted for a paradigm shift to the current performative didactics. This communicative approach, which has already thought of non-believers or latent believers, is expanded here to other believers and applied in dialogue form to interreligious learning between the religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4305881-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049422-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4664707-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128325-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027743-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114087-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4010074-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7695925-9>
The "Enthusiastic Maids" : Middle German Prophetesses in Radical Pietism at the End of the 17th Century ¤ The »begeisterten Mägde« – so named at the end of the 17th century some women who appeared as prophetesses in the milieu of radical Pietism and who could temporarily gather a considerable following behind them. Why were these women able to convince people in their immediate surroundings, as well as prominent representatives of Pietism such as August Hermann Francke, that they had received divine revelations? To answer this question, the situation is reconstructed in which the bearers of revelation appeared to the public. The conclusions drawn from this give insight into the living conditions of the late 17th century on a micro-historical level, but also form a contribution to the religious sociological discourse on the conditions of the possibility of reports of revelations. The study addresses several questions currently being hotly discussed in the field of religious studies, such as the connection between religious dynamics and nonconformity, religion and gender, or religious individualization and pluralization processes, and makes a contribution to these current discourses.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018202-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4762345-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4448649-2>
Tensor-based signal processing with applications to MIMO-ODFM systems and intelligent reflecting surfaces ¤ The use of tensor algebra techniques in signal processing has increased over the past two decades. Applications such as image processing, biomedical signal processing, radar, machine learning, deep learning, and communication in general use tensor-based processing techniques for signal restoration, estimation, and classification. One of the main reasons for the use of tensor signal processing is the exploitation of the multi-dimensional structure of signals, where the uniqueness properties of tensor decomposition are exploited. For example, in wireless communication, signals can have multiple "dimensions" such as space, time, frequency, polarization, etc. This work is divided into two parts. In the first part, we consider the application of tensor-based algorithms for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems taking into account the presence of phase noise disturbances. In this part, we propose a two-stage tensor-based receiver for joint channel, phase noise, and data estimation in MIMO-OFDM systems. In the first stage, we show that the received signal can be modeled as a PARAFAC tensor of third order on the pilot subcarriers. Based on this model, two algorithms for estimating the phase and channel noise in the pilots are proposed. In the second stage, the transmitted data are estimated. For this purpose, we propose a Zero Forcing (ZF) receiver that takes advantage of the tensor structure of the received signal on the data subcarriers by capitalizing on the proposed selective Kronecker product operator (SKP). The simulation results show that the proposed receiver achieves better performance in terms of both symbol error rate and normalized mean squared error of the estimated channel and phase noise matrices compared to the state-of-the-art. The second part of this work deals with the application of tensor modeling to reduce the control signaling overhead in future wireless systems supported by intelligent reconfigurable surfaces (IRSs). For this purpose, we propose an approximation of the nearly optimal IRS phase shifts, which would otherwise cause a prohibitively high communication overhead on the BS-IRS control links. The main idea is to represent the optimal phase vector of the IRS, which can have hundreds or thousands of elements, by a low-rank tensor model. This is achieved by factoring a tensorized version of the IRS phase shift vector, where each component is modeled as a Kronecker product of a predefined number of factors with smaller size, which can be preserved by tensor decomposition algorithms. We show that the proposed low-rank models drastically reduce the feedback requirements for the BS-IRS control links. The simulation results show that the proposed method is particularly attractive in scenarios with a strong line-of-sight. In this case, almost the same spectral efficiency is achieved as in the cases with nearly optimal phase shifts, but with a drastically reduced communication overhead.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7540075-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1188755676> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054947-1>
Surface Analytical Investigations on Carbon-Based Materials ¤ Carbon-based materials are of high technical relevance in energy technology, sensorics, bioelectronics, micro- and nanosystem technology, and wear protection technology. For example, a wood-based polymer mixture can be used as a cost-effective alternative for electrically conductive components and thus be used as a bipolar plate in a direct methanol fuel cell. Investigations using photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, UPS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) were carried out to understand the pyrolysis processes at cellulose, lignin, and wood-based polymer mixtures and to test the methanol resistance of the pyrolysis products. It has been shown that cellulose and lignin are suitable candidates for the production of such bipolar plates. The incorporation of carbon fibers can further increase the form stability and conductivity of the base material. Contaminations that have occurred could be identified and further process steps could be concretized. Coatings made of nanocrystalline diamond are in the focus of current research work in the field of electronic components. Additional functionalizations aim at applications such as biocompatible DNA sensors. In order to implement such functionalizations successfully, investigations of the surface properties are indispensable. By heat and oxidation processes, the NCD layers are often pre-treated for further process steps. Investigations of the functional groups at the surface after various heat and oxidation processes were carried out in this work using high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and XPS. At a temperature of 1050°C, the previously bound hydrogen is completely desorbed. The compositions of the functional groups and the oxygen content at the surface vary depending on the oxidation process. In comparison to the NCD layers, amorphous and hydrogen-containing carbon layers (DLC) are used as wear protection layers. The investigations with HREELS and XPS showed that there is an enrichment of the diamond-like phase at the surface of DLC.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172243-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145668-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4561133-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4727954-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031677-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076787-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176510-2>
Manuel Quintín Lame : The Thoughts of the Indian Who Educated Himself Within the Colombian Jungles : A Text Analysis ¤ Manuel Quintín Lame Chantre, a Páez Indian and leader of an indigenous resistance movement in southern Colombia in the first decades of the 20th century, wrote a manuscript in 1939, which he titled: „Los pensamientos del indio que se educó dentro de las selvas colombianas“. This manuscript was first published in 1971, after Lame's death, under the title „En defensa de mi raza“. Later, the text appeared in two further, each abridged, editions and in an English translation. This text, which I became aware of during my stays in Popayán / Colombia, sparked my interest from the very beginning. Above all, due to its unusual origin, but also because of its difficult-to-access style. In this over hundred-page work, autobiographical descriptions and philosophical reflections alternate and overlap with each other, with the author using a very figurative language. Questions like: What is this text, which was kept under wraps for decades? What reasons led the rebel Quintín Lame to write a written work? And: Even Quintín Lame could, like every author, only write because he himself had read – but what? Which sources, which literature had he himself received? The present work is an attempt to explore and present the peculiarity of this text and to place it in a further literary context. The few works of secondary literature that deal with Lame's „Pensamientos“ focus on a content-based interpretation of the work. A formal description of the text has not been made yet.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194196-2>

Proof or Exclusion of Bacteremia in Antibiotic-Untreated Horses Before, During, and After Tooth Extraction ¤ Horse, Bacteremia, Tooth Extraction. - The occurrence of bacteremic phases in connection with tooth extractions has been known in human medicine for a long time and has also been confirmed in veterinary medicine. Serious infectious diseases can be the consequence of this transient bacteremia. Within the framework of the present study, the occurrence of bacteremic phases in connection with tooth extractions in antibiotic-untreated horses should be checked and the spectrum of microorganisms that occur during this process should be determined and compared with the flora of the extracted teeth. The study was conducted on a total of 20 horses, for which a clinical, oral endoscopic, and radiological examination was performed and the indication for the extraction of a tooth was established. Ten of these horses underwent the extraction of a molar tooth, while the other ten were subjected to the extraction of a incisor or stallion tooth. To prove bacteremia, blood samples were taken at various times before, during, and after the operation, which were examined for bacterial growth using the blood culture system Oxoid SIGNAL (Oxoid Limited, UK). In addition, blood samples were taken for the determination of laboratory diagnostic parameters. The horses were clinically monitored throughout the entire procedure and in the perioperative period. In total, 18 of the 20 participants showed bacteremia at least once during the tooth extraction. Two participants already had bacteremia before the start of the procedure, and one of these horses lasted until the end of the operation. Another horse was still bacteremic until the end of the tooth extraction. In the evaluation of the blood cultures, bacteria from 13 different genera were isolated. In 12 horses, both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms were found. The blood cultures of two participants showed only obligately anaerobic growing bacteria, and in four horses, only aerobic ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190495-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045503-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4203542-9>
Beliefs of Teachers on Teaching and Learning Arithmetic ¤ Katinka Bräunling investigates teachers' subjective conceptions regarding the mathematical subfield of arithmetic. Based on the assumption that these conceptions (beliefs) are relevant for teachers' lesson planning and their actions in the classroom, the author focuses on the identification of beliefs and belief systems in the empirical study. In a mixed-methods design, she analyzes qualitatively and quantitatively collected data from pre-service and in-service teachers and relates their belief systems to each other. In doing so, these systems are considered in terms of their structure, long-term development, and action relevance.

Grundrechtsbindung der kirchlichen Gerichtsbarkeit ¤ The (constitutional-)juridical position of the churches in Germany always is an object of social and juridical debates. This thesis is concerned with the question, whether ecclesiastical jurisdiction is bound to fundamental rights. First the whole churches and their jurisdiction as a part are the object of the discussion. On this occasion, a possible commitment is examined to the state fundamental rights as well as the situation in the internal ecclesiastical law. In a second step it focuses especially on the ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Within the scope of that the available structures are described. Then a commitment is discussed to procedural fundamental rights. This thesis concentrates upon the Catholic church and the Protestant church in Germany.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022344-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4163953-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112766-3>
Parents between Daycare and Elementary School: Reconstruction of Interactive Processes and Transition Theoretical Reflections ¤ Elterliche Transition -- Elterliche Perspectives on Cooperation -- Method and Methodology of the Documentary Method -- Heterogeneity Dimensions at the Transition Miriam Buse reconstructs with the “Documentary Method” in her qualitative longitudinal study parental orientations towards cooperation with pedagogical professionals and focuses on the relationship between parents and pedagogical actors in daycare and elementary school in the context of transition management. The developed typologies are connected in the framework of a relational type formation and the results are reflected against the background of the current discourse on cooperation between parents and educational institutions as well as transition research.

Cooperation Successfully Shaped: Success Factors of Cooperative Processes in Regional Development ¤ Cooperation between people and institutions has proven to be one of the most important factors of successful regional development in recent years. Currently, several hundred designed cooperation processes are being carried out in Germany. Not all of them achieve the self-set goals and some fail due to avoidable errors. The present book is based on 27 investigated processes, in which actors from ten districts in the old and new federal states were involved, with the relevant factors for success and failure. The basis is a comprehensive empirical investigation. Four case examples are examined in depth, and a further 23 processes are analyzed. Sorted according to the W-questions What? Who? How? Why? the success factors are treated to goal setting, content framework, organization, actors, political involvement, administrative involvement, networking, process management, moderation, result orientation, external accompaniment, marketing, benefit, motivation. Findings from other studies are incorporated. The work provides moderators and those responsible with indications of what they should pay attention to when shaping processes. The results are transferable to all processes with bottom-up components and are not limited to the field of regional development.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076605-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197034-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4455020-0>

Work and Value Change in Postmodern Germany: A Historical, Ethical-Systematic Study of Professional and Work Ethics ¤ In terms of content, it deals with one of the most burning issues of our time, work, profession, and unemployment. In a more general context, the question is first raised about the human being, society, and ethics, because this serves as the basis for the treatise. Then, the first main chapter provides a historical overview, because only after historical foundation can many questions, including those about work and action, be answered better and trends in here and now be evaluated more clearly. In the second chapter, the phenomena of change in the current working world are addressed. In this context, important attention is paid to the areas of unemployment, the right to work, leisure, ecology, poverty, and exclusion. Finally, guidelines are formulated, rounding off the dissertation, which orient themselves towards the principle of the person, solidarity, subsidiarity, and the common good, in order to highlight the genuinely social-ethical aspect as the actual result of the investigation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4206782-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117636-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073315-4>
Archive of Memory : Literary Testimonies of Survival after the Shoah in France ¤ Publisher's information: In France as well as in other countries, the texts of Shoah survivors are marked by two incompatible topoi. On the one hand, only eyewitnesses can testify to the inhumanity of Nazi extermination policy. On the other hand, they themselves are not in a position to name the cruelties they suffered and witnessed. To what extent memories are an expression of a national cultural environment is demonstrated by this study. It presents the literary testimonies as part of a culture of remembrance that initially propagated the myth of the Résistance and only hesitantly was willing to acknowledge France's involvement in Nazi extermination policy. Following a reflection on the figure of the witness, the European debate on the 'Jewish question' is presented as the starting point for the following interpretations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035964-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113615-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122228-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4212507-8>
Gender, Religion, and Ethnic Nationalism: The Doctor and Antisemite Mathilde von Kemnitz-Ludendorff (1877 - 1966) ¤ The doctor, women's rights activist, and antisemitic theorist Mathilde von Kemnitz-Ludendorff was one of the most contentious figures of the Weimar Republic. Together with her third husband, the general and politician Erich Ludendorff, she led the nationalist 'Tannenbergbund' and founded the völkisch-religious association 'Deutschvolk', from which successor organizations still exist today. The author analyzes the complex communication relationships in which Mathilde von Kemnitz-Ludendorff developed her radical renewal and redemption concepts up to the early 1930s. In this context, both the medical historical context and the connections to the women's movement are taken into account in a cultural and gender-historical review.

Reading of Visually Impaired Students: Diagnosis and Support ¤ Inclusion is mandated by the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and is anchored in the German school pedagogy. Now it is necessary to implement it in schools in a disability-appropriate and understandable way. Franz-Josef Beck presents applied inclusion using the example of reading with visually impaired children in a clear and practical manner. He focuses particularly on the role of the script. What script design do visually impaired readers need? Based on the results of a reading study, he answers this question and makes it clear that a suitable diagnosis and an individual text design based on it are indispensable. The author describes the topic of reading with visual impairment in detail from the perspectives of medicine, physiology, psychology, and school pedagogy and the resulting impairments in everyday life due to visual impairment. In addition to the attached observation sheets and progress protocols, which can be used to diagnose visual impairment in children in everyday school life, he also provides materials for everyday measures and reading promotion possibilities. In this way, reading can be made easier for visually impaired readers in inclusive lessons, and reading efficiency and reading pleasure can be increased.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7663654-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4259224-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035448-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077330-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035439-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7693876-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116466-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053369-4>

Evaluation at Universities: Development and Validation of a Behavior-Based Measurement Inventory for Student Course Evaluation ¤ The University - an Organisation in Change -- Evaluation at Universities -- Student Course Evaluation in Focus -- Development and Validation of the Behavior-Based Measurement Inventory (MILVE) -- MILVE in Practice Elisa Knödler deals with student course evaluation as an instrument of quality assurance at universities. Based on several sub-studies, she designs an effective overall process for capturing and improving teaching quality. The result is the theory- and empirically-supported development and validation of a behavior-based measurement inventory for student course evaluation. In addition to the widely discussed and researched question of validity, the author addresses further, at least equally pressing questions, such as: What does quality mean in the teaching context and how is it operationalizable? It can be shown that generic template models in the sense of tailored measurement instruments for capturing and improving teaching quality are promising.

Theory and Typology of Narrative Unreliability: An Example of English-Language Narrative Literature ¤ Unreliable narration is one of the most discussed phenomena in narratology. Questions concern the semantics of the concept, differentiation criteria, the yardstick for assigning unreliability, the explanation of the concept, and its scope. The work systematically addresses these various problem fields. In doing so, it broadens the perspective to narrative unreliability, which encompasses both various forms of unreliable narration and unreliable focalization. By drawing on concepts from possible-worlds theory and cognitive narratology, models and categories are developed to differentiate the various forms of narrative unreliability and explain the reception behavior of readers. By means of exemplary analyses of English-language narrative works, the performance of the theory is illustrated, before the metacognitive functional potentials of narrative unreliability are shown	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195138-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152967-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7661868-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014777-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047497-5>
Relationships between Founder and Foundation ¤ In this book, Axel Schulte deals with the existence and nature of the genuinely foundation law relationship between founder and legally capable foundation. The focus is on the possibility of the founder, taking into account a fundamental right to the existence of the foundation in the event of failure of internal or external control mechanisms, to proceed against the foundation for withdrawal or omission of a foundation resolution if he endangers, threatens, or contradicts the objective will of the founder. The author shows the practical need for such an intervention by the founder in „his“ foundation and prepares the dogmatic basis for such a procedure, detached from any statutory provisions. Furthermore, the author explains how the influence of the founder on the foundation can take on corporate law dimensions and is to be understood and solved as a corporate law problem.

War and Art : the Visualization of English Claims to Sovereignty in France (1422-1453) ¤ The time of the English occupation of France in the final phase of the Hundred Years' War has been studied mainly in terms of political and military developments so far. Independent of this, the art production of the time has been researched. In her interdisciplinary study between political cultural history and art history, Julia Crispin deals with the use of art to visualize political claims by representatives of the English crown in France for the first time. She takes into account both the existing stock of preserved artworks, especially illuminated manuscripts, as well as written records of visual representations of political conceptions in the context of political ceremonies and entrances. She opens up a wealth of previously overlooked source material in the process. She asks, on the one hand, which motives and traditions were used and which messages were conveyed in concrete terms, and, on the other hand, which audience was intended to be reached and actually reached. Her work thus makes an important contribution to the research of political history as well as art and cultural history of the Late Middle Ages.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074442-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008650-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006632-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4024596-2>
Development of the Art Portal ARTRIKAT based on the Content Management System TYPO3 ¤ The aim of this bachelor thesis is to document the development of the Art Portal ARTRIKAT based on the use of the content management system TYPO3. The Art Portal ARTRIKAT is a new community platform for artists and the art-interested public. The artists themselves can purchase a registration and show their works virtually in 2D or 3D galleries and offer them for sale. Additionally, ARTRIKAT offers some common portal features, such as personalized event calendar, an internal messaging system and an upload function for the photograhpies of their of works. Furthermore, ARTRIKAT provides a news module, a collection of links to recently checked and proved internet sources, a museumsshop as well as catalog of works of art which presents artists in relation to their works. The main part of this bachelor thesis presents mainly the first phase of the portal development process -- beginning with the brainstorming up to the conceptual design, the programming and finally the launch. The subject of this thesis is also to evaluate to which extent a content management system as TYPO3 is suitable for a such project. Additionally, some typical main problems, which came up during the development, are described and discussed and possible solutions or approaches are presented. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5>
Transactions in US-Dollar und sekundäre Sanktionen : ist die US-amerikanische Sanktionspraxis mit dem Völkerrecht vereinbar? ¤ BEGIN: The application of US economic sanctions is very broad and conflicts with internationally operating companies and other states are predestined. The foundations of the sanction programs and also the sanction practice are complicatedly built. Especially in the area of financial transactions, the application practice is not visible at first glance. This poses particularly problems for European financial institutions. And even if an application is not given, there is the danger of being taken into the sights by US authorities through secondary sanctions. US authorities are moving in the border area of internationally recognized law and regularly cross borders. The work checks a part of the US sanction practice for compatibility with international law and also exemplarily presents US law and shows the possible legal consequences of US sanctions.

Antidiscrimination in Labor Law : New Developments in Community Law Based on Directives 2000/43/EC and 2000/78/EC and Their Incorporation into German Equal Treatment Law ¤ Employee equal treatment belongs to the foundations of labor law. The principle of equal treatment is considered a formative source of law for all employment relationships. The practice of the European legislator, shaping labor law in the member states primarily through new regulations of discrimination protection, has received new impetus in 2000 through the adoption of Directive 2000/43/EC on the application of the principle of equal treatment without discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin and Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation, which had to be implemented by 19 June 2003 and 2 December 2003/2006, respectively. As a result, European discrimination protection has been significantly expanded beyond the characteristic of sex. This is an occasion for a new evaluation. The directives, whose scope of application includes the entire employment relationship from job posting and application to general employment and working conditions up to the conditions of its termination, contain seven new prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of race, ethnic origin, religion, worldview, disability, age, and sexual orientation. They prohibit direct and indirect discrimination as well as harassment and instruction to discriminate as new forms of discrimination. The legal definitions of direct and indirect discrimination in Directives 2000/43/EC and 2000/78/EC are characterized by hypothetical elements and thus strengthen a value-based, typifying approach. In the case of direct discrimination, the comparison person can be the subject of a potentially more favorable treatment. In the case of indirect discrimination, a statistical proof is no longer required that a neutral regulation in particular affects persons with a specific personal characteristic in the sense of the directives. The simple possibility or danger of disadvantage is sufficient to affirm the existence of indirect discrimination. Unequal treatment of employees with regard to the mentioned characteristics is generally only allowed in three exceptional cases under the directives, namely in accordance with the regulations of the Equal Treatment Directive 76/207/EEC a.F. and thus a ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4451062-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137814-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002769-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123073-5>
Quo vadis, PKV? : A Branch with Latin at the End? ¤ The substitutive private health insurance (PKV) is one of the institutional peculiarities of the German healthcare system. Long considered a guarantee of high-quality medical care, it is now under greater pressure from health policy reforms than ever. On the one hand, the institutional dualism between statutory and private health insurance is increasingly being questioned, and on the other hand, there are also significant structural deficiencies within the PKV. In this book, the question is addressed of how the problems of the PKV could be solved in the context of already implemented health reforms. The goal of this interdisciplinary approach is to analytically capture the current problems of the PKV, analyze the conditions and limits of possible changes, examine arguments and solution approaches, and submit practical proposals for a constructive further development of the PKV.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020775-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071796-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032326-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047291-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115716-3>

Using micromagnetic spin dynamics simulations, Monte Carlo simulations and effective equations of motion, an optimization of the skyrmion-based racetrack data storage device is proposed. Here, spin-orbit torques are manipulated to suppress the skyrmion Hall effect. Moreover, the existence of individual biskyrmions, as well as periodic lattices of magnetic bimerons and antiferromagnetic skyrmions are predicted. By utilizing the Berry theory and the Landauer-Büttiker approach, the topological Hall effect of electrons and the magnetoelectric properties of skyrmions are quantified. Furthermore, a purely topologically induced Hall effect of electrons in bimeron crystals and a topological spin Hall effect of electrons in antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystals are predicted.

Automated Vehicles in the Light of Swiss Licensing and Liability Law ¤ In this work, legal aspects of increasing vehicle automation are addressed. Following an introduction to the topic, a legal analysis of licensing and liability questions related to automated vehicles is conducted. In the context of the licensing examination, licensing hurdles on both international and national levels are treated. The focus is on the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. The revision of this agreement and its significance for national law are investigated. In the context of the liability examination, three questions are answered: The question of liability for unlawful traffic behavior using automated vehicles, the question of liability for road traffic accidents involving automated vehicles, and the question of liability for defective automated vehicles in the sense of a product defect. The treatise concludes with findings from this analysis and a look ahead	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7714938-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4622983-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022898-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057933-5>
School Cultures in the Upper Secondary Level of Gymnasium: An Explorative Study on Cultural Compatibility and School-Milieu Complexes in Secondary Level II ¤ The present work takes a look at the upper secondary level of gymnasium and discusses the structural and content-related transformations and reforms of the last 60 years from the perspective of the sociological works of education by Pierre Bourdieu. In an extension of school culture theory, several upper secondary levels of gymnasium are analyzed in terms of cultural compatibility on an individual school level. A quantitative research approach is realized in relation to school cultures. In the framework of a correspondence-analytical consideration, relationships between schools are shown along with cultural and compositional features, which have been largely excluded from recent empirical educational research on the upper secondary level. The work was awarded the dissertation prize of the University Society Bielefeld.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120627-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075806-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4259045-0>
Financial Compensation for Lacking Creditor Cooperation in Construction Contracts ¤ Standstill on the construction site! What is a contractor entitled to under German law (BGB and VOB/B) if he cannot continue or even start his work due to the lack of cooperation from the client? Although a clear line seems to be emerging in case law and literature, there is still a lack of agreement in many areas. This work deals extensively with this question. In the first chapter, the current handling of the facts and consequences of § 642 BGB, which still dominates the above-mentioned discussion, is presented. In the following second chapter, the current practice is critically examined. Using classical interpretation methods, the norm of § 642 BGB is examined in detail and the results found are compared with the current practice. A focus is placed on the historical analysis of the norm, which makes it possible to filter out the will of the historical legislator. It becomes clear that the current handling of the norm no longer corresponds to this will. In the subsequent third chapter, an alternative solution path is shown, which corresponds to the will of the historical legislator mentioned above and brings a dogmatically sound concept with it. Initially, the norm of § 304 BGB is brought into focus and also subjected to a classical interpretation. It quickly becomes apparent that the norm has been unfairly relegated to a kind of shadow existence. In contrast to the practice in connection with § 642 BGB, which is understood too broadly in practice, § 304 BGB is understood too narrowly and holds considerable potential for the treated problem. Based on these findings, the last chapter shows what exactly is replaceable under § 642 BGB and what under § 304 BGB, and how the claims are composed in detail. In total, a sound overall concept emerges, according to which a fair financial compensation for the entrepreneur can be achieved in the event of lacking creditor cooperation in construction contracts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143435-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4192074-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143425-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014900-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170266-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126005-3>
A Knot Without End? : Robert Musil's Confusions of Young Törless in the Mirror of Sociological, Psychoanalytic, and Philosophical Discourses ¤ The Confusions of Young Törless, Robert Musil's first novel, is one of the most enigmatic works in literary history. Appearing shortly after 1900, the text describes the gradual loss of ontological security and the intrusion of an 'irrational', hidden world behind the everyday facade. Despite an almost unmanageable secondary literature, the reader is in the same situation as the title character Törless: again and again, he believes he has grasped the depicted confusions - only to have to realize that they have once again eluded linguistic access. Roland Kroemer's book describes this 'endless knot' and unravels it against the background of various discourses from sociology, psychoanalysis, and philosophy. In detailed text analyses and extensive references to diverse contemporary contexts, the study shows for the first time that the most important of Musil's (spiritual-)scientific discourses are found again in the spatial and personal text design. Törless turns out to be an intertextual and polyphonic narrative text, in which the most diverse worldviews collide and fight for dominance	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114051-5>
Institutions and identity in economic decision-making ¤ This dissertation analyzes the role of identity and institutions in economically relevant decision-making situations. It is argued that economic decision-making behavior is typically characterized by a combination of conceptions that people have of themselves and others, as well as the norms that restrict these conceptions. Within this work, this combination is investigated in a series of laboratory experiments in three economic situations: a bartering relationship, a situation of employee hiring, and two tasks involving resource allocation. In total, the results presented here emphasize the importance of identity and institutions in understanding economic decision-making behavior. Furthermore, the findings presented demonstrate the usefulness of laboratory experiments in exploring fundamental questions regarding identity and institutions. The chapters of this dissertation are based on the identity theories of Akerlof and Kranton (2000) and Benabou and Tirole (2011) as well as on the theory of institutional economics by North (1991). The identity theory of Akerlof and Kranton assumes social diversity and considers how social categories bring about certain behavioral prescriptions. The theory of Benabou and Tirole focuses on moral behavior and how conceptions of oneself and the environment influence the current decisions of an individual. In both of these theories, institutions play a significant role. Douglass North (1991, p.3) defines institutions as “humanly devised constraints that structure political, economic, and social interactions.” In the first chapter of the dissertation, the fundamental concepts are explained that guide the investigations of the following chapters.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027208-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113448-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161215-2>
Improving condition and sensitivity of linear inverse problems in magnetic applications ¤ The identification of non-directly accessible processes based on measured data is of great importance in many fields. The focus of this work lies in applications in magnetostatics, magnetocardiography, and magnetic induction tomography. An approach to identification consists in solving a corresponding linear inverse problem. Unfortunately, errors and noise contained in the data have a significant impact on the inverse solution. The goal of this work is to reduce the influence of errors and noise by improving the condition of the problem, as well as increasing the sensitivity of the measurement arrangements. To determine the condition, the ratio of the largest and mean singular value of the kernel matrix is proposed as a new measure. In addition, approaches to analyzing sensitivity with respect to the measurement of electromagnetic sources and the capture of electrical conductivity changes are presented. Strategies for improving condition and sensitivity are described in four simulation studies. In the first study, a tabu search approach is presented for optimizing the arrangement of magnetic sensors. Arrangements with optimized sensor positions result in a significantly better condition than regular arrangements. In a second study, parameters are adapted that define the source area for imaging by magnetic nanoparticles. As a conclusion, the source area should be defined as slightly larger than the sensor area. This work also shows that variations in sensor directions for monoaxial sensor arrays lead to an improvement in condition. Furthermore, the sensitivity of coil arrangements for magnetic induction tomography is evaluated and compared. By using relatively large coils that almost completely cover the measurement area, condition and sensitivity can be significantly improved. The presented methods and strategies enable a substantial improvement in the condition of the linear inverse problem in the analysis of magnetic measurements. In particular, the arrangement of sensors with respect to the measurement object is critical for the condition, as well as the quality of inverse solutions. The presented methods are also applicable to linear inverse problems in numerous fields.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4328701-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4661072-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055072-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4309013-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213726-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4168601-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4813360-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125161-1>
Small-scale statistics in turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection ¤ Detailed investigations in turbulent Rayleigh-Bénard convection in a cylindrical cell with isothermal upper and lower plates and adiabatic side walls are performed using direct numerical simulations (DNS). The focuses of the investigations are the statistics of the temperature T, its fluctuations Theta, and their gradients; the statistics of the thermal dissipation rate Epsilon T and its scaling with the Rayleigh number Ra; the dependence of the heat transport on the aspect ratio of the cell γ and related changes in the large-scale circulation (LSC) as well as the Lagrangian particle dynamics in convection. The simulation parameters are Ra = 10^7 - 10^9, γ = 0.5 - 12, and the Prandtl number Pr = 0.7. The probability density functions (PDFs) of T and Theta deviate from the Gaussian case in all regions of the cell. Based on the skewness of ð Z Theta, the return of small-scale turbulence to local isotropy with increasing Ra in the interior of the cell was found. Similarly, as in scalar mixing, the PDF of the thermal dissipation rate of the temperature fluctuations, Epsilon Theta, deviates from the log-normal form. The PDFs are always stretched exponential distributions, whose tails increase with increasing Ra due to increasing small-scale intermittency. The degree of intermittency is stronger both in the thermal boundary layer (TBL) and in the volume. It is always stronger in the side wall region than in the interior of the cell. Furthermore, Epsilon Theta not only contributes dominantly to the total dissipation in the volume but also significantly contributes in the TBL. The power-law <Epsilon T> ~ Ra Zeta always yields a negative exponent Zeta, both in the volume and in plume-dominated regions and in the turbulent background. This is in contrast to the scaling theory of heat transport, but agrees well with experiments. The Nusselt number, Nu, follows the law Nu = A(γ)×Ra ß (γ) with a power-law dependence of the parameters A and β. The minimum of the curve Nu(γ) lies exactly where the LSC undergoes a transition from one large roll to two. Nu(γ) varies between 3%-11% and becomes geometry-independent for γ≥ 8. The patterns in the fully turbulent regime have similarity with structures in the weakly nonlinear regime. Five- or six-fold rolls are observed when Gamma ≥ 8. The Lagrangian particle dispersion in convection shows a transition from the ballistic regime to the Richardson regime, but no Taylor regime due to the finiteness of the convection cell. The existence of the Richardson regime depends sensitively on the initial separation of the particles in the pair, similar to homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Our interpolation scheme correctly reproduces the Nusselt numbers in the Lagrangian reference frame. The statistics of the components of the acceleration vector are very intermittent, similar to isotropic turbulence. All three distributions collapse in contrast to convection in an infinitely extended flow layer.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4346728-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144456-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274466-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4233958-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055072-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139581-5>
Arbitrational Investment Protection within the European Union. The Implications of the Achmea Judgment of the ECJ ¤ The relationship between investor-state arbitration within the European Union and the legal system of the latter has been intensively discussed for a long time. With the »Achmea«-judgment, the ECJ has now established that corresponding arbitration clauses in so-called intra-EU-BITs are incompatible with European Union law. -- The present work examines the problems arising from this decision for investment protection agreements, for arbitration proceedings based on them as well as for annulment and enforcement proceedings before state courts. A particularly controversial consequence of the »Achmea«-judgment is still the Agreement on the Termination of Bilateral Investment Protection Treaties between the Member States of the European Union. The regulations contained therein are analyzed and commented on both legally and factually, before a glimpse into the future of intra-European investment protection is given.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048849-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7708477-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4199281-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170174-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027556-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121615-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048737-4>
The Political Economy of the 'Surplus': Socio-ecological Conflicts and the Struggles of the Mapuche against the Forestry Industry in Chile ¤ Introduction -- Theoretical Debates on Structural Heterogeneity and Entanglement -- Research Design and Method -- Peripheral-extractive Capitalism and Socio-ecological Conflicts in Chile -- Border Conflicts in Southern Chile -- Socio-ecological Conflicts of the 'Surplus': Central Findings and Theoretical Discussion -- Outlook: The Political Economy of the 'Surplus' as a Socio-ecological Alternative? -- Literature. In this open-access book, Jakob Graf raises the question of how socio-ecological conflicts on the periphery of the world economy can be sociologically understood. He shows that in countries of the Global South marked by the exploitation of raw materials, large parts of the workforce are not integrated into the global capitalist system through wage labor. From the perspective of the capitalist world economy, large parts of the global poor are rather 'surplus'. The author shows that these people are not simply 'unemployed', but are often economically active; they make a significant contribution to the survival of people in poorer countries. How socio-ecological conflicts arise from the contradiction between these local 'subsistence economies' and the capitalist economy is illustrated by Graf using the example of the indigenous Mapuche in southern Chile. They resist the expansion of industrial forestry, which produces cellulose in massive plantations for the world markets. As historically 'dispossessed', the Mapuche fight for the reappropriation of their land and resources. Graf analyzes the functioning of such conflicts, asking how the social group of the 'surplus' can be sociologically understood. The author Jakob Graf studied political science, social studies, and social theory at the Free University of Berlin and the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena. He currently works at the Center for Climate Resilience at the University of Augsburg.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4100130-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055707-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017966-7>
Customer Satisfaction and Involvement ¤ Blurb: Customer satisfaction is a crucial prerequisite for long-term corporate success. Factors such as brand loyalty, repeat purchase behavior, attitude changes, word-of-mouth, and complaint behavior are closely linked to this. Kurt Matzler examines how customer satisfaction comes about, what relationships exist between product properties and customer satisfaction, and what role the depth of customer information processing plays in this.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129147-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114330-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123428-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197450-5>
Vulnerability in the Ethics of Emmanuel Lévinas ¤ A largely overlooked topic in Levinas research is vulnerability as radical passivity and receptivity for the Other. In this context, the passion of responsibility, which Levinas' philosophy is all about, is unthinkable without vulnerability – because only because human existences are vulnerable, they intersect and impinge on each other, desire and hurt each other. From Jutta Czapski's perspective, vulnerability makes the most comprehensible and dramatic contents of Levinas' thinking accessible and connects it with the traumatic life story of the philosopher as a Holocaust survivor. With fine sensitivity and analysis, the author shows the dimensions in Levinas' thinking in which vulnerability is expressed above all: the face, the skin, the inspiration, mortality, language. Based on these sensory experiences, she shows how Levinas develops a radically new thinking of humanity that breaks with traditional answers to the question of the essence of man.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015602-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188166-7>
Behavioral Anomalies: Critical Triggers and the Effect of Financial Literacy : A Regression Analysis of Panel Data from the Subprime Crisis Period ¤ The power of an economic crisis can harm the prosperity of a society for generations and change its political and social order. Human financial behavior can not only cause individual losses but also maneuver entire markets into disequilibrium. Standard economics explains financial behavior with the principle of utility maximization, behavioral economics with psychosocial influences. Empirical models that combine both aspects to assess the degree of individual rationality of individuals have been rarely investigated. Marius Oleksy uses standard and behavioral economics to address the question: What critical triggers lead to individual misconduct by stock investors and what influence does financial literacy have? He shows that a combination of a lack of financial competence, bounded rationality, and a low degree of individual rationality promotes individual errors. The author Marius Oleksy cooperated in his dissertation at the Pedagogical University of Karlsruhe with Prof. Dr. Prof. h. c. Dr. h. c. Claudia Wiepcke and Prof. Dr. Prof. h. c. Dr. h. c. Ewald Mittelstädt from the University of Applied Sciences South Westphalia. Marius Oleksy is an external lecturer at the Pedagogical University of Karlsruhe at the Institute for Economics and its Didactics and at the University of Applied Sciences South Westphalia in the field of Business Administration & Entrepreneurship Education.

Capital Contribution in GmbH and AG: Delineation from Capital Preservation - Liability in the Pre-Society ¤ Main description: With the capital contribution in GmbH and AG, four central questions are connected: When must the contributions be made? Which objects are eligible for contribution in kind? What liability standard applies in the case of overvaluation of contributions in kind? What impact do usage agreements (hidden contribution in kind / give-and-take) have? In addition, the question of pre-encumbrance liability arises, which is obliged to fill the stated capital at the time of entry. -- Adrian Cavin examines these questions and shows that numerous fundamental questions can neither be answered securely nor convincingly, because the historically grown elements of capital contribution law are only insufficiently coordinated with each other and not sufficiently coordinated with the valuations of capital preservation law. Based on the current and historical answers to these questions through literature, legislator, and case law, as well as divergent models in other European legal systems, the author works out the connections of the individual aspects and proposes a coherent overall set of individual answers. By this means, the existing contradictions are to be eliminated and the ongoing criticism of the legal uncertainty in this core area of capital company law, which persists even after MoMiG and ARUG, is to be alleviated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4021365-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029567-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000937-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139150-0>
Ruling through Prevention : A Critical Analysis of Burnout Prevention after Michel Foucault ¤ In light of the global mental health crisis, it is essential to consider burnout prevention as a governance issue and part of a prevention dispositif. From the perspective of governmentality, Jozef Zelinka shows how the prevention of mental disorders is used to secure the neoliberal performance society: subjects are pushed towards self-management through continuous risk pressure and risk calculation. The critical dispositif analysis makes these discursive, everyday practical, and above all material manifestations of prevention visible Frontmatter -- Content -- Illustrations -- Dedication and Acknowledgement -- Introduction -- Current Research Status -- 1 Psychological Investigations of the Burnout Syndrome -- 2 Sociological Observations of the Burnout Syndrome -- 3 Sociocultural View of the Burnout Syndrome -- 4 Cultural Historical Perspective on the Prevention of Mental Suffering -- 5 The Value Added of Previous Research and the Existing Desideratum -- Theoretical Foundation: Michel Foucault's Power Analysis -- Introduction -- 1 History of Thought as Analysis of Problematisations -- 2 Foucault's Analytical Tools -- 3 Governmentality – a Thought on Governance -- Methodological Process of Dispositif Analysis -- 1 The Concept of Dispositif by Michel Foucault -- 2 Scientific Reception of Foucault's Dispositif Concept -- 3 Operationalisation of Dispositif Analysis -- Empirical Part: Critical Analysis of the Prevention Dispositif -- Introduction -- 1 Discourse -- 2 Non-discursive Practices -- 3 Objectifications/Objectifications -- 4 Subjectivation/Subjectification -- 5 Societal Theoretical Contextualisation -- 6 Connections between Dispositive Elements -- Discussion of Results -- 1 Landscape of the Prevention Dispositif -- 2 Power Effects and Resistance Potentials -- 3 Ruling through Prevention -- Conclusion and Outlook -- Bibliography	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1079427864> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076308-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195380-0>
The Intention-Behavior Gap : An Analysis of Selected Purchase Barriers in the Example of Eco-Products ¤ Despite the strongly increased interest in eco-products, a clear discrepancy between the expressed purchasing intention by potential consumers and their actual purchasing behavior is noticeable, where this phenomenon is also referred to as (ecological) Intention-Behavior Gap (IBG) in research. Within the scope of the dissertation, the current state of research on this ecological IBG is systematically worked out and expanded by empirical findings on real purchasing behavior.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4428726-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062644-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073328-2>
Data assimilation in European regional and coastal seas (Black Sea and German Bight) ¤ The work is divided into two parts, which deal with the development and application of data assimilation approaches for the Black Sea and the German Bight. The main goal of the first part, which deals with the Black Sea, is an assessment of the steric heights in the region. A fundamental condition for the applied procedure is the independence of the assessment from observations on the basin scale, which can be considered one of the main new developments. Furthermore, it is the first application of a model based on the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) framework system for this region. The second part of the study deals with the German Bight. In it, the potential of FerryBox surface temperature and surface salinity measurements for data assimilation is investigated for the first time. In particular, the 'aliasing' problem in connection with the M2 tide is discussed. Furthermore, it is shown that varying correlations throughout the year have a strong impact on the quality of the state assessment.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4803260-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025352-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274370-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4221269-8>
Construction of ZnO/ZnS core/shell nanotube arrays on AAO templates and relevant applications ¤ Nanotechnology is a multidisciplinary technology that encompasses various aspects of science and engineering in the nanoscale. It is more than the creation of very ordered nanostructures through the simultaneous fusion of nanomaterials and it requires practical possibilities for precise manipulation and monitoring of the developed nanostructures. In other words, the greatest challenge in nanotechnology is that we need to learn more about the materials and their properties. Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a semiconductor with a large bandgap (3.37 eV) with excellent electrical, optical, catalytic, and sensing properties and has a variety of applications. On the other hand, zinc sulfide (ZnS) has high chemical stability in alkaline and weakly acidic media. The unique properties of the combination of both materials, ZnO and ZnS, can pave the way for the realization of future devices (e.g. optoelectronic components, sensors, transducers, biomedicine, etc.). The main part of the studies presented in this dissertation has focused on the design of very ordered nanostructures from ZnO and ZnO/ZnS nanotubes that were produced using anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) as a solid template. The dissertation is particularly relevant to nanostructure-based electrochemical sensors and photoelectrochemical (PEC) applications for water splitting or hydrogen production. In this work, ZnO/ZnS nanotubes were successfully synthesized by combining three methods: (i) AAO template (ii) atomic layer deposition (ALD) and (iii) rapid thermal deposition. It was found that the AAO template could be completely removed during the growth of the ZnS shell without any additional treatments by rapid thermal deposition. The evenly arranged ZnO/ZnS nanotube arrays with high crystallinity showed improved optical and electrical performance compared to ZnO nanotubes. This is a cost-effective method for the production of tubular core/shell structures with different compositions using AAO templates without additional necessary processes for template removal. In contrast to conventional studies focusing on the change of the optical absorption band edge of a single material through so-called quantum confinement effects, the optical absorption properties of ordered ZnO/ZnS core/shell nanotube arrays, i.e. quantum confinement effects beyond material boundaries, were investigated. The data show that the profile of the absorption spectrum of the ZnO/ZnS nanoarrays is determined by both components and their geometric parameters. Both material components show a reduction in the optical bandgap with increasing ZnS shell thickness and nanotube array diameter, which is interesting in terms of explaining aspects of the material. Subsequent finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations supported the observations and showed that the geometric and periodic parameters influence the optical absorption of the core/shell nanostructure arrays, even without quantum effects. These results provide a new perspective on the shift of the optical bandgap, which is of importance for research in photoelectronics. Furthermore, the sensor produced and characterized in this work was applied to detect changes in chemical and biochemical substances. Measurements with the device as primary sensors were successfully performed and used for glucose biosensing. The studies show that the heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant (ks) of ZnO/ZnS is higher than that of pure ZnO (0.95 s^-1) against glucose (1.69 s^-1), which is responsible for the improvement of performance and higher sensitivity. In addition, experiments have shown an improvement in PEC hydrogen production with the produced nanostructures, with higher saturation photocurrent densities (1.02 mA/cm^2) and higher conversion efficiencies (62%) at ZnO/ZnS compared to ZnO structures without any shell (corresponding to 0.23 mA/cm^2 and 55%).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4844582-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213727-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190877-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190864-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4204530-7>
The Dream of Sleep in the 20th Century: Knowledge, Optimization Fantasies, and Resistance ¤ The Sleep: for thousands of years a subject of myths, stories, and images. Humans sleep a good third of their lives. The time we spend sleeping is an unconscious, unproductive, and inactive, but also a necessary and longed-for time. How does a society, in which scientific understanding, rationality, and efficiency play a central role, deal with such a recalcitrant phenomenon as sleep?

Personal Assistance for Children with Disabilities: Legal Guarantees under Special Consideration of Participation, Social, and School Law ¤ The participation opportunities of children with disabilities are rarely discussed. More often, social participation is linked to vocational and professional rehabilitation and therefore, mostly focused on the participation of adults with disabilities in the world of employment. By contrast, this book deals with the participation of children with disabilities and specifically, with personal assistance as an individual support service. In recent years, it has entered the social discussion in the context of school inclusion. However, the need for personal assistance on the part of children with disabilities goes beyond the school context. For this reason, the book initially explains what personal assistance is and which needs on the part of children with disabilities may exist in which areas of life. The work systematises whether and how these needs may be covered by regulations of the German legal system (e.g. by means of the law on rehabilitation and integration of people with disabilities, social law or school law) and which legal and/or actual limits children may encounter as assistants. The fundamental changes for the law on rehabilitation and integration and the assistance service are discussed and evaluated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7693897-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030550-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048737-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7737596-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112696-8>
Musicians among themselves : Cohesion and Performance in Semi-Professional Music Groups ¤ The book focuses on the concepts of expertise, personality, cohesion (group cohesion) and performance, which are integrated into a model of performance-related interaction of music groups from the perspective of a social psychology of music-making through the consideration of five bands. The work is characterized by new and adapted methodological approaches and a continuous methodological discussion, in which approaches from psychology are discussed in terms of a musicological fit. The result is an extended concept of expertise and the realization that the necessary social and organizational competences for successful music-making in a group must develop. For practice, the book offers suggestions and sensitizes to consider group interactions differently and to evaluate group performances differently.

Kurt Lewin's Field Theory: A Forgotten Metatheory for Educational Science ¤ Dirk Paul Bogner examines the relevance of Kurt Lewin's field theory in the field of educational diagnostics. He supports the thesis that Lewin's field theory would open up a completely new perspective on learning, development, and educational processes, and explains how the inclusion of the dimension of space could refine the analysis of these educationally relevant topics. He discusses this using hermeneutic text interpretation and comparative document analysis, why Lewin could not generate educational resonance, although terms that either directly come from the field theory or are consistently defined from it are still intensively used in educational science today. < The Content Educational and school pedagogical re- and deconstruction of the field theory The ideological and antisemitic prejudice of the humanities pedagogy Points of contact: Mollenhauer, Bollnow and Winnefeld The actuality and potential of the field theory for educational diagnostics The target groups Lecturers and students of the social sciences, especially educational and educational science and educational psychology Teachers of all school types The Author Dr. Dirk Paul Bogner teaches and researches in the Department of School Pedagogy at the Institute for Educational Science of the Eberhard Karls University in Tübingen Educational and school pedagogical re- and deconstruction of the field theory -- The ideological and antisemitic prejudice of the humanities pedagogy -- Points of contact: Mollenhauer, Bollnow and Winnefeld -- The actuality and potential of the field theory for educational diagnostics	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035408-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016699-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121444-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4199656-2>
Streptococcus-suis-Serotyp-9-Whole-Cell Vaccine : Immunogenicity, Protective Efficacy and Combination with Serotype 2 ¤ Streptococcus-suis, whole-cell monovalent vaccine, combination vaccine. - Streptococcus (S.) suis is a significant pathogen in the pig industry, causing high economic losses through meningitis, arthritis, septicemia, and serositis. As a zoonotic pathogen, S. suis has great importance for humans who process pork. In some Asian countries, S. suis serotype 2 is one of the main bacterial meningitis pathogens in adult humans. To date, 35 serotypes of S. suis have been described, which can be differentiated based on differences in the structure of their polysaccharide capsule. In Europe, serotypes 2 and 9 are mainly involved in diseases in pigs. A vaccine against S. suis is not licensed here, so that specific vaccines are often used. In this work, i) the immunogenic and protective effect of a serotype 9 whole-cell vaccine, ii) the immunogenic effect of serotype 2 and 9 combination vaccines mixed with different adjuvants, and iii) the immunogenic and protective effect of a serotype 2 capsule conjugate vaccine should be investigated. In the first part of this work, a whole-cell monovalent vaccine based on a serotype 9 strain of the important clonal complex 16 was investigated.

Accounting and Corporate Financing: An Analysis of Listed Companies in Germany and Switzerland ¤ Capital markets have strongly influenced corporate financing and financial management over the last few years. Companies have a wide range of financing instruments with different characteristics available to them, the accounting of which affects the capital structure and company valuation. Michael Schachtner examines the corporate financing of listed companies from Switzerland and Germany over a period of 1995 to 2006 against the background of regulatory changes. Based on a systematics of five theses, the author discusses, among other things, the following questions: What influence did the transition to IFRS-Accounting in Germany have? How is the external financing of companies structured? To what extent do macroeconomic determinants determine the financing behavior of companies? The empirical part shows with a detailed analysis of specific financing instruments from annual financial statements the change in the financing of listed companies in Switzerland and Germany.

Investigations on the Load-Bearing Behaviour of Hybrid Composite Structures Made of Polymer Concrete, Fibre-Reinforced Plastics and Wood ¤ The development of wood-concrete composite construction has shown that hybrid wood composite construction methods represent a very efficient solution for increasing the load-bearing capacity and stiffness of wood components subjected to bending loads. In such wood composite components, the efficient design of shear force transfer in the composite joint between the material layers represents a certain weak point. Furthermore, the scattering strengths and growth- or manufacturing-related properties of the wood arranged in the tensile zone also significantly limit the performance of such hybrid composite components. An innovative solution for these problem areas has been found in the production of hybrid composite structures made of reaction resin concrete, fibre-reinforced plastics and the existing wood construction. In the bending compression zone, high-performance polymer concrete is used. The tensile zone is reinforced with fibre-reinforced composite materials bonded or glued on and structural limits are overcome.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130981-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128805-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125874-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177121-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193001-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4333049-6>

Reporting Obligations in IT Security Law: Data Protection, Critical Infrastructure, and Special IT Services ¤ By analysing legal aspects concerning the reporting of cyber security incidents, this book highlights both German and European regulations. As cyber security threats have rapidly increased during recent years, many new laws have and will come into effect. As regards data protection, in addition to the current law, the book examines the European General Data Protection Regulation, which has applied since May 2018. Legislation has also substantially increased for critical infrastructure and certain IT-services legislation. Therefore, the book takes a closer look at the German Cyber Security Act (IT-Sicherheitsgesetz) of 2015 and the Network and Information Security Directive of 2016. Its findings and conclusions are not only interesting on a theoretical level in relation to legal research, but can also be of practical use in the interpretation of requirements concerning specific applications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126049-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011134-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011159-3>
The Erasure of Racist Normality: A Critical Analysis of the Opening of an Asylum Shelter in Berlin-Hellersdorf in the Summer of 2013 ¤ This dissertation investigates a public, local conflict surrounding the opening of an asylum shelter in Berlin-Hellersdorf in the summer of 2013. The perspectives and actions of stakeholders and groups who were involved in the event are focused upon, contextualized and analyzed. To this end, various texts (statements on websites/blogs, press releases, published interviews, speeches held during rallies) are examined. A central finding is the reproduction of racism: a limited understanding of racism which ignores larger, societally present and conveyed forms of racism is evident. Instead, racism is linked primarily to violence, certain persons or certain groups of persons. Furthermore, articulation of a person's own involvement in racist structures is avoided in favor of creating images representing refugees almost exclusively as subjects 'in need of help'. This analysis not only provides insights into a local conflict but offers important material for political education in the context of refugee/asylum issues, and raises awareness for a more considered approach to handling related conflicts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076527-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194196-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4307158-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017604-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032081-9>
Un-Peace State GDR : Mobilization, War Readiness and Militarization between 1970 and 1990 ¤ The GDR was a deeply militarized state, in which all social areas were placed under the primacy of military defense of socialism.

The China Policy of the Federal Republic of Germany after Reunification: A Balance Act between Values and Interests ¤ Values and Interests in International Relations -- Sino-German Relations from 1972 to 1989 -- Institutional Structures of German China Policy -- German China Policy under Kohl, Schröder, and Merkel in Comparison -- Scenarios and Basic Trends of German China Policy Ying Huang examines the guiding principles of Germany's China policy after reunification using the theory of neoliberalism. The analysis shows that German China policy is always a balance act between value dominance and interest rule. This balance act manifests itself differently under Helmut Kohl, Gerhard Schröder, and Angela Merkel, so that China policy preferences are a product of powerful actors on the national (Federal Government, Bundestag, interest groups) and international levels (EU, USA, NGOs). The author explains the circumstances and reasons for the fluctuations and provides an in-depth insight into the formulation and implementation of German China policy.

Image and Text in Wirnt von Gravenberg's 'Wigalois' ¤ Summary: This study focuses on the text-image relationship in the illustrations of the post-classical Arthurian romance 'Wigalois' by Wirnt von Gravenberg: in the Leiden manuscript (University Library, Ltk. 537, Sigle B), in the former Donaueschingen manuscript (No. 71, Sigle k) as well as in the 'Wigalois' cycle at Runkelstein Castle in South Tyrol. A sign of the great popularity of the novel is not only its rich textual transmission, but also its text-bound illustration in manuscripts, early prints, and in the text-independent testimony of the wall paintings at Runkelstein Castle. The evidence situated in different 'usage contexts' is precisely analyzed by Antonia Gräber to answer the question of how the independent illustrations each establish their own proximity to the text or to what extent they go beyond the text and influence the interpretation of the novel	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123412-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059596-1>
Efficient human situation recognition using Sequential Monte Carlo in discrete state spaces ¤ This dissertation analyses these challenges and provides solutions for SMC methods. The large, categorical and causal state-space is the largest factor for the inefficiency of current SMC methods. The marginal filter is analysed in detail for its advantages in categorical states over the particle filter. An optimal pruning strategy for the marginal filter is derived that limits the number of samples.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4230127-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4240945-7>
Comparison of E-Learning Materials for Students in the Field of Cattle Reproduction and Determination of the Training Needs of Breeding Stock Managers ¤ A thorough education of performing and breeding stock managing professionals in the field of reproduction is a key factor for cattle breeding. In this study, the questions were in the foreground whether the digital learning media Whiteboard Animation (WA) and Video-Tutorial (VT) compared to PowerPoint presentations (PP) can facilitate the achievement of learning goals in the field of reproduction and to what extent training needs exist among practicing breeding stock managers (EBBs). The comparative use of learning media took place in a blended learning course. For the evaluation of the training measures, the evaluation model according to KIRKPATRICK (2006) was applied as well as measurement accesses (surveys, knowledge tests, observations) were integrated into the course. According to this study, neither the WAs nor the VTs are better in the transmission of knowledge compared to PPs. Also, in the transmission of practical skills, the VT was not superior to the PP. Nevertheless, a subjective and objective significant improvement through all learning media could be established in the evaluation. The learning effects are to be classified as strong (COHEN 1988; HATTIE et al. 2013). Furthermore, the entire course, the learning materials, the presence term, accessibility, structure, and design were rated as	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012494-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113937-9>
Beyond Brecht ... : Productive Theatre Reception in Brazil by the Example of Bertolt Brecht ¤ On the research field of reception research, under the aesthetic perspective of reception, the reception and effect of Bertolt Brecht's theatre work in Brazil is analyzed. On the basis of concrete staging descriptions, the respective adaptations of Brazilian theatre groups are presented. Their increasingly free Brazilianizations of Brecht's theatre, the interplay between self-cultural repertoire and foreign cultural horizon are in the center of interest. The productive-creative reception of the author on another continent and in a different cultural circle is highlighted and the changes, enrichments and re-codings within this foreign literary communication are emphasized on both work and reception level. Furthermore, the Brazilian theatre literature, which shows influences of Brecht, is particularly interesting to observe. The authors' oscillation between conscious adoption of the literary model and 'fear' of unwanted adoption is discussed in the background of the influence theory of the North American Harold Bloom. From the content: Reception theories - Reception of foreign literature - Theatre literary reception - Brazilian theatre performances - Creative adaptation forms - Influence theory - Interplay of foreign literary communication.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012899-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059702-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027223-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049716-1>
Catalogs of Truth: On the Staging of Authorship in W. G. Sebald ¤ W. G. Sebald is today celebrated as one of the most important German writers of the last century. Since his tragic death ten years ago, he has received fervent veneration from literary and academic reception. As a memory of the Germans, Sebald is stylized as a melancholic wanderer between worlds, as a voice for the victims and the forgotten. However, a second side of Sebald is mostly ignored, that of the polemical literary scholar and essayist, who provocatively attacked canonical authors such as Alfred Döblin, Alfred Andersch or Jurek Becker, and thereby profiled his own position in the literary field under the guise of enlightenment. Schley presents his work as a masterful staging of authorship. Fridolin Schley makes Sebald himself the subject of a critical analysis for the first time.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046449-0>
Posttranscriptional Regulation of the Retrotransposon TRE5-A in Dictyostelium discoideum ¤ TRE5-A and DIRS-1 are retrotransposons from the eukaryotic organism Dictyostelium discoideum. Both have both sense and antisense transcripts. This led to the assumption of posttranscriptional regulation of both retrotransposons by cell-specific RNA interference processes. Previous work identified the host factor C-Module-binding factor A (CbfA) from D. discoideum as a transcriptional regulator that binds to the C-Module of TRE5-A in vitro. Reduced expression of CbfA leads to a drastic decrease in the TRE5-A transcript amount and retrotransposition compared to the wild type. The comparative RNA-Seq experiments performed in this work to further elucidate the function of CbfA showed an overexpression of the Argonaut proteins AgnC and AgnE at reduced CbfA expression. This confirmed the existing assumption that RNAi processes could be involved in the regulation of TRE5-A. The available agnC- and agnE- strains showed an overexpression of TRE5-A, which suggests a direct function of the two Argonaut proteins in the regulation of TRE5-A. To be able to overexpress agnC or agnE in the CbfA wild-type background, gene activation mutants (GA) of AgnC and AgnE were generated. These strains were characterized for their influence on TRE5-A expression and retrotransposition. The overexpression of agnC or agnE led to a decrease in the TRE5-A transcript amount and the GA-AgnC strain showed a significant reduction in the retrotransposition frequency of TRE5-A. This suggests posttranscriptional regulation of TRE5-A. However, CbfA seems to suppress this regulation, thereby maintaining the TRE5-A retrotransposition activity in the genome. The phylogenetic analyses of CbfA performed in this work within and outside the social amoebae enabled the representation of a new protein family: the CbfA-like proteins.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012135-5>

Long-term unemployment in the growth process: a theoretical analysis ¤ That the explanation of long-term unemployment is an extremely current topic is shown by the strong increase in long-term unemployment in the industrial countries since the mid-1970s. The increase in long-term unemployment at the same time as economic growth - both in a closed and in an open economy - is the subject of the investigation. In order to explain long-term unemployment in a growing economy theoretically, a growth model is extended by a labor market that is characterized by a heterogeneous pool of unemployed and by search frictions. -- Due to the qualification mismatch, which increases with rising technical progress, long-term unemployment increases in a growing economy. As further determinants of the increase in long-term unemployment, the duration of unemployment and the motivation of the long-term unemployed are held responsible in economics. -- The two-factor growth model is extended to a three-factor growth model, so that the integration of the goods and capital markets can be analyzed with regard to domestic long-term unemployment. The terms-of-trade effect of the opening of the goods markets and the integration effect of free capital flows are examined in two model extensions and their implications for long-term unemployment are worked out. The analysis shows that both the integration of goods and capital markets at world market interest rate reductions induce a reduction in domestic long-term unemployment.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127141-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4233396-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4225604-5>

Development and application of RNA-seq bioinformatic tools to explore non-model organisms in ageing research ¤ Within this work, I have developed a software that performs all necessary steps to arrive from sequencing data to transcript catalogs. This is achieved by efficiently connecting both publicly available and self-made programs to perform transcript assembly and annotation, as well as to improve assembly weaknesses. The competitiveness of FRAMA compared to genome-based methods was demonstrated by applying it to sequencing data of the naked mole rat. The naked mole rat is increasingly in the focus of aging research, due to its exceptionally long lifespan of >30 years in captivity, accompanied by extreme resistance to age-related decay and lifelong fertility. Considering its eusocial lifestyle, lifelong fertility is remarkable, as in a colony, a single female bears the metabolic burden of reproduction and becomes at least as old as her reproductive-inactive sisters. As part of this work, I have compared reproductive-active and -inactive naked mole rats using gene expression analyses and based on the previously created transcript catalog. Furthermore, I have applied FRAMA to sequencing data of seasonal fish of the genus Nothobranchius. This genus shows, likely in adaptation to the short availability of water in their habitat, a very short lifespan and includes one of the shortest-lived known vertebrates. The transcript catalogs served as a basis for the analysis of positive selection to identify genetic determinants of short lifespans. Both analyses have revealed interesting gene candidates related to aging and have provided insights into the sexual maturation of naked mole rats as well as the evolution of short lifespans in seasonal fish.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116522-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4611085-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068596-2>

National Identity in the Berlin Republic 1998-2007 : a Frame-Semantic Approach to Knowledge of Social Self-Understanding ¤ The study inquires into how 'national identity' appears linguistically in the period of the so-called Berlin Republic as an epistemic magnitude. Since the connection between language data analysis and the exploration of national identity is not trivial, a theoretical foundation reflection is necessary, which integrates linguistic, cultural, and social scientific instruments into a specific methodology. The goal is to break down the knowledge formation that we connect with the linguistic expression 'national identity' in a mental-historical interest and a discourse-linguistic tradition. It is guided by the conviction that access to social knowledge reserves is created to a large extent by linguistic products - and that in both social reality and analytical practice. The book is addressed to all those who are interested in the analysis of social knowledge with linguistic means or want to know how (epistemologically understood) frame semantics is suitable for content-oriented language historiography.

Social Work and Systems Theories ¤ System theory is currently a dominant paradigm of the scientific discourse. In the context of Social Work, systems thinking has become known primarily as a counseling concept. Furthermore, the adoption of systemic approaches is also associated with the expectation of a stronger independent profiling of a theory of Social Work. The author examines the various stages of development of system theory and its reception within Social Work and inquires about their applicability on different levels of theory formation of Social Work, from interaction to societal functional determination.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058812-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055676-1>
The Citizens' Movement in Dresden 1989/90 ¤ Dresden was the first city in East Germany, where in the autumn of 1989 an understanding between the population and representatives of the state power was successful. The group of 20, which formed on October 8 from the ranks of the demonstrators and had talks with the mayor of the Basic Democratic Fraction, found forms of cooperation that could change the dictatorial system from within and eventually democratize it.

Investigations on the Influence of Acute CDV Infection on the Function of Ex Vivo Cultivated Canine Monocytes ¤ Monocytes, CDV, Demyelination. - In the acute phase of infection with the canine distemper virus (CDV), classical neurological forms typically lead to immunosuppression followed by demyelination in the white matter of the central nervous system (CNS). The pathogenesis of demyelination is not fully clarified, but various hypotheses are postulated. On the one hand, the cell metabolism of oligodendrocytes can be directly disrupted by CDV infection, resulting in damage to the myelin (primary demyelination). On the other hand, CDV infection leads to the activation of microglia, which produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a mechanism of unspecific immune defense. Oligodendrocytes are particularly sensitive to ROS and can be damaged as innocent bystanders, which can also lead to myelin damage (secondary demyelination). Another immune system-initiated reaction during CDV infection is the recruitment of monocytes from the peripheral blood into the CNS, where they differentiate into macrophages. As soon as the monocytes have entered the CNS, differentiation from the resident microglia is difficult. Therefore, it is not clear what the origin of ROS production represents, as the invading monocytes are just as capable of producing ROS as the microglia and can therefore also contribute to the pathogenesis of secondary demyelination. Accordingly, the goal of this work was to prove the hypothesis that CDV-infected monocytes produce ROS and that the extent of this production depends on the virus strain and thus reflects the influence on the immune system. Furthermore, the isolation of microglia should be optimized to establish a pure culture of microglia for the processing of further questions. To optimize microglia isolation, various protocols were applied and their effectiveness was determined by flow cytometry using the expression of CD11b, CD18, and CD45low. Density gradient centrifugation with subsequent MACS separation provided the highest cell number with the highest purity and vitality of the isolated microglia. Furthermore, the conditions should be defined that allow microglia to be kept in pure culture. For this, two media, Microglia Medium (MM-prf) and Sato-Medium, were compared, each with and without macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (m-csf). It was shown that cultivation in MM-prf culture medium achieved a higher total cell number, purity, and vitality of microglia than in Sato-Medium. However, the microglia in the pure culture showed a very high mortality rate after 24 hours. Therefore, an investigation of microglia could only be carried out within the first 24 hours. To investigate whether microglial cells can be infected with CDV in vitro, they were incubated with two different virus strains, the attenuated Onderstepoort (OND) and the virulent R252 strain. Interestingly, infection of microglia with R252 could be demonstrated by flow cytometry, while infection with the vaccine strain OND could not be demonstrated. For the investigation of monocytes, 10 ml of whole blood from ten healthy beagles was taken and the monocytes were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. The monocytes were then cultured and infected with the vaccine strain OND or the R252 virus strain and compared with non-infected monocytes as a negative control. The detection of intracellular CDV antigens, the expression of CD14, and ROS production were determined directly after infection (p.i.) and after three hours...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4349365-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067637-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4216136-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026181-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4285013-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4769989-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4301913-4>
Optimized Charging of Electric Vehicles as a Markov Decision Process using Machine Learning Algorithms ¤ Electric mobility with partly high charging powers is a challenge for the safe operation of the electrical distribution networks in the future. To reduce overloads in low voltage, control algorithms are needed to control the charging power of the vehicles. However, the problem arises that low-voltage networks are usually not monitored technically and so input data for control algorithms are missing. In this work, the combination of two machine learning algorithms is investigated. The control of the charging power of electric vehicles is defined as a Markov decision process, which is solved using reinforced learning. For the provision of input data, an artificial neural network is used, which estimates the state of a low-voltage network. Through the interaction of both algorithms, the network overloads triggered by the charging of electric vehicles can be reduced.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193754-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151795-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138980-3>
Children's Rights and Bildsamkeit: A Critical Plea from an Educational Science Perspective ¤ Although it would be expected from the politically-legal situation standardized by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child since 1989, the rights of children and adolescents in education have not yet been seen as a problem. The present investigation takes up the question of how the legal status of young people in education can be formulated and sheds new light on debates about democracy education and the implementation of children's rights in pedagogical practice. With interdisciplinary explanations, the author presents what needs to be considered when talking about children, childhood, and children's rights, and what should be taken into account in future interdisciplinary and public discussions. By means of a historical reconstruction of the entire convention history, she shows how it came about that children's rights are spoken of today and in what ways the bildsamkeit of humans allows for a new perspective on the relationship between education and law.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030550-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044302-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074725-6>
The Police Concept in the NS State: Police Law, Juridical Publishing, and Judiciary 1931 - 1944 ¤ Andreas Schwegel examines the profound change in the police concept during the NS dictatorship. His special interest lies in the influence of police law literature and jurisprudence. The investigation begins with the codification of the Prussian Police Administration Act (PVG) of 1931. This law gave expression to the liberal constitutional police concept in a contemporary version. Subsequently, it is shown how the police law changed in the early NS dictatorship (1933-1935) through the powers of the Political Police and a successive ideologization of the PVG. The years 1936-1939 are at the center, especially the ideological transformation of the police concept through the II. Police Law Committee of the Academy for German Law. Top jurists of the SS used this forum to implement their image of an executive protective organ of the people's community in publishing and jurisprudence. In the following period until the end of the regime, a new legal doctrine eventually established itself. It was oriented towards a radical-völkisch police concept and consistently excluded the lawful binding of the police.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115591-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115710-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046595-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005248-5>
Negotiations, Conversations, Letters: Savoy-French Royal Marriages in Early Modern Times ¤ Noble marriages in early modern times are considered instruments of politics. However, the accompanying peace treaties or alliances were not always lasting, which calls into question the strategic benefit of royal marriages. Why, then, were noble marriages a permanent part of political action for centuries? In this study, three Savoy-French marriage arrangements from the 15th to 17th centuries are examined from their beginnings. The focus is not on treaties or alliance agreements, but on negotiations, conversations, and letters that depict the communicative events before and after a marriage. It shows: marriages, but also marriage arrangements created relationships and allowed them to continue - even without a wedding. --	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046514-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013660-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013657-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000464-8>
In-vitro investigations on the permeation of various local anesthetics from different formulations through equine skin in relation to the horse's fetlock burn ¤ Horse, local anesthetics, permeation. - In Germany, a pain-relieving treatment must be performed during and after the horse's fetlock burn from 2019. Therefore, an effective and simple method of pain relief is being sought. The goal of this work was to find a formulation from which topically applied local anesthetics (LA) can permeate equine skin very well and achieve a probably effective concentration in the skin. Five different commercial drug products with the active ingredients Lidocain, Prilocain or Tetracain were tested: Emla®-Cream (25 mg/g Lidocain and Prilocain), Anesderm®-Cream (25 mg/g Lidocain and Prilocain), Pliaglis®-Cream (70 mg/g Lidocain and Tetracain), Xylocain-Gel® (20 mg/g Lidocain) and Xylocain-Spray® (100 mg/g Lidocain). In order to compare the formulations better, the LA were manually mixed into the formulations, which were not yet contained in the respective commercial drug products, so that ultimately all three LA (Lidocain, Prilocain and Tetracain) were contained in the formulations. The permeation experiments were carried out with the help of Franz diffusion cells with dermatomized horse skin (700 µm) from six horses. A comparison of the permeation of the LA from the formulations under occlusive and non-occlusive conditions was made. In addition, the effects of skin burns were investigated exemplarily with Emla®-Cream. Furthermore, the concentration of Lidocain and Prilocain from Emla®-Cream in equine skin was determined. Additionally, the dependence of Lidocain permeation on the pH value of the solution was investigated. The determination of the concentrations in the acceptor medium and the extraction fluid was carried out using UV-VIS-HPLC. Prilocain showed the highest permeation rate through horse skin, followed by Lidocain and Tetracain. This sequence can be explained by the physicochemical properties of the LA (e.g. molecular weight Tetracain > Lidocain > Prilocain). The largest permeated amount of Lidocain is achieved from Xylocain-Spray. However, Lidocain from Emla®-Cream showed the highest permeation rate. Prilocain permeates from Emla®-Cream in the largest amount and Tetracain from Pliaglis®-Cream. Prilocain showed a lower permeation when mixed with commercial drug products (Pliaglis®-Cream, Xylocain-Gel and Xylocain-Spray). Tetracain, on the other hand, showed no significant differences in permeation from the different formulations after one hour. The concentrations of Lidocain and Prilocain from Emla®-Cream in equine skin are higher than the values mentioned in the literature that have a pain-relieving effect. Therefore, it can be assumed that the found concentrations also lead to a pain-relieving effect in horses. This assumption must be confirmed by in-vivo studies. The permeation of Lidocain at different pH values showed the tendency that Lidocain permeates better through equine skin at a neutral pH value of the solution. The present work confirms that the permeation of LA through equine skin depends on the formulation. The best permeation rate of the three LA is achieved from Emla®-Cream. However, due to the practicability of the implementation, the application of Xylocain-Spray, which also enables a very good in-vitro permeation of Lidocain, should be tested in vivo on the horse.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4146475-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129181-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045503-8>

Network management is not only of great importance for companies in the trade sector, but also associated with significant challenges. In particular, when introducing cross-company process innovations such as, for example, RFID technology, management within and by networks plays a central role. Thomas C. Salditt shows a selection of current challenges for the trade sector, which increase the pressure for efficiency on individual traders. Cross-company process innovations such as RFID technology can be used to counter this pressure. Business networks and the management of these networks are a central aspect here. The author places trade processes and process innovations in the context of network relationships and derives concrete recommendations for management in networks from this.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4245322-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4023226-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4509863-3>
Digitale Weisungen : Employer Decisions Based on Algorithmic Calculations ¤ Since decades, it has been predicted when which professions will be taken over by machines. That also classical employer functions, such as the exercise of the right of instruction, are delegated to technical systems, is hardly noticed so far. The work defines digital instructions, as employer instructions, which are based either directly or indirectly on decisions of an algorithmic system. Digital instructions are issued mainly in shift and deployment planning. Their implementation in companies triggers not only the participation rights of the works council. The applicable law requires that automated instruction decisions are made transparent and reasonable (§ 106 GewO). Employees and works councils must have the opportunity to engage in an argumentative exchange with the instruction giver. Where technical systems do not yet meet the requirement of »Responsiveness«, instructions are subject to the reservation of a human final decision. / »Digital Instructions. Employer Decisions Based on Algorithmic Calculations«: ›Automated exercise of the right of instruction‹, ›issuing of instructions by robots‹ or ›AI-generated instructions‹ - digital instructions are gaining attention in the legal literature. -- In this context, it is important to answer which requirements the applicable law places on digital instructions due to the novel decision-making technology and due to their character as instructions in the conventional sense.

Tryptophan Synthases at High Temperatures: Characterization of Thermostable Enzymes from Thermotoga maritima and Establishment of a Selection System for Stabilizing Thermolabile Enzymes in Thermus thermophilus ¤ In the present work, the Tryptophan Synthase from Thermotoga maritima was structurally and functionally investigated. For this purpose, the operon-constituent genes tmtrpA and tmtrpB1 as well as the only in hyperthermophiles identified, non-operon-constituent gene tmtrpB2 were each expressed individually in Escherichia coli, the gene products purified and characterized. Both tmTrpB1 and tmTrpB2 catalyze the synthesis of tryptophan at 80 ʿC with high efficiency, with tmTrpB1 showing a higher kcat and tmTrpB2 a distinctly lower Km value for indole. TmTrpB1, but not tmTrpB2, forms a 2b2-complex with tmTrpA, in which the two enzymes mutually activate each other. The results suggest that tmTrpB2 functions as an indole rescue protein at the high physiological temperatures of Thermotoga maritima. In the second part of the work, a selection system was established, with the help of which the thermolabile TrpA protein from E. coli (ecTrpA) should be stabilized. For this purpose, a Thermus thermophilus trpA-deficient strain was transformed with a randomly mutated ectrpA gene bank and incubated at high temperatures on tryptophan-free minimal medium. Although control experiments showed the functionality of the selection system, no colony growth occurred and thus no stabilized ecTrpA variants were isolated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183784-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4357300-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070959-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4349967-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4310313-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4282597-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006902-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4330422-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186362-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4319830-2>

Screen Scraping and Freedom of Information ¤ Freedom of Information and Digital Economy: Using the phenomenon of Screen Scraping as an example, the work examines for the first time the commercial handling of publicly accessible information and data on the internet from a freedom of information perspective. Initially, the author discusses the points of contact between Screen Scraping procedures and constitutionally protected freedom of information, referring to European legal provisions. The core of the investigation is subsequently a comprehensive statutory evaluation of Screen Scraping. In this context, freedom of information influences are given particular consideration. The focus is on contractual, database, and competition law issues, as well as discussions on the so-called virtual house right. Finally, the author develops general criteria for the permissibility of Screen Scraping software on the basis of the findings and freedom of information considerations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127674-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148875-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4363898-3>
The Concept of Balanced Production in Supply Chains ¤ In the age of continuous change and global market growth, the business environment is increasingly facing challenges such as short product life cycles, international competition, new information technologies, and significant wage gaps. Existing production concepts have been under scrutiny for at least a decade. Stefan Tillenburg develops a concept of balanced production. This refers to the author's compromise between a stable, production-readiness-oriented manufacturing and a flexible production with minimal readiness costs. The considerations are long-term oriented, and the adaptability of production is brought to the forefront. However, later conversion problems and adaptation difficulties are also taken into account. Balanced production provides an explanatory and design framework for organizing production processes, even in more complex inter-company networks („Supply Chains“). Stefan Tillenburg develops a concept of balanced production. This refers to the author's compromise between a stable, production-readiness-oriented manufacturing and a flexible production with minimal readiness costs. Dr. Stefan Tillenburg graduated under Prof. Dr. Joachim Reese at the Institute for Business Administration, Production, and Information Systems, Leuphana University Lüneburg. He is an independent financial and management consultant with a focus on implementing and training financial planning systems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047360-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4684051-5>
Methodical Material and Process Development for Additive Series Production of Automotive Structural Components ¤ The powder bed-based laser beam melting process (LPBF) offers the possibility of creating end-conforming and highly complex metallic structures. In combination with flexible material systems, a variant-rich, load-path-optimized, and lot-independent component production is realizable, which is of particular interest for the automotive industry with a variety of vehicle derivatives and consistent lightweight design concepts. Currently, a widespread dissemination in the body-in-white construction is not yet given. In addition to the frequently limited formability of the materials, the lack of knowledge about the application behavior, in particular with regard to crash and corrosion, is a barrier to innovation in the framework of the extensive release processes of the automotive manufacturers. This work presents a systematic knowledge base for the applicability of existing and novel aluminum alloys for automotive series applications. Furthermore, methodical approaches and recommendations for action are given for the extended series integration of the technology. The content Systematic knowledge base for the applicability of additive manufacturing in automotive body-in-white construction Innovative methods and approaches for accelerating the development of novel material systems Material and process optimization with regard to crash-related loading cases and corrosive application conditions The author Andreas Lutz studied mechanical engineering with a focus on methodical product development and production technology at the University of Ulm and the Technical University of Berlin.

Secondary metabolites from Actinomycetes: Investigations on biosynthesis and regulation as well as verification of a Clustom-Sequencing method ¤ Zusammenfassung: In silico analysis of clustom-sequencing data. In this work, clustom-sequencing-data were screened for the existence of tailoring-enzymes. For the clustom-sequencing data, cosmid-libraries were generated from 121 actinomycetes strains. Consequently, these libraries were screened with specific gene-probes for PKS I-genes, genes for the biosynthesis of sugar moieties, and glycosyltransferase genes. Positive hybridizing cosmids were sequenced by the clustom-sequencing technology. The search for tailoring-enzymes was focused on finding new glycosyltransferases to enlarge the “glycosyltransferase toolbox of Freiburg”, resulting in the finding of 18 glycosyltransferases that are not characterized in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. Likewise, the clustom-sequencing-data were screened for other tailoring-enzymes including: oxidoreductases, group transferases, and halogenating enzymes; not characterized enzymes could be found.Activation of “silent” clusters in actinomycetes. Three regulator genes belonging to the group of cluster situated regulators (CSR) were constitutively expressed in the wild-type strain Saccharothrix espanaensis DSM 44229. As a result, activation of the corresponding “silent” cluster 1 (SARP(1)), cluster 11 (SARP(11)), and the lantibiotic cluster lan 1 (SARP(L)) should be attained. As the constitutively expression failed to induce the production of new secondary metabolites in all three cases, the regulator gene SARP(L) was heterologously expressed in the strain Streptomyces albus J1074. The production assay of S. albus x pTESb-SARP(L) resulted in a crude extract with antibiotic activity against Bacillus subtilis. Through purification experiments and structure elucidation via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-spectroscopy, the two secondary metabolites paulomycin A and B were identified to be responsible for the antibacterial activity. Investigations on the biosynthesis of didesmethylmensacarcin. Regarding the biosynthesis of didesmethylmensacarcin (DDMM), the cyclase genes msnC1, msnC2 and msnC3, as well as the gene msnH6, encoding for a protein with unknown function, were inactivated on the cosmid cos2. Cos2 contains the gene-cluster for the biosynthesis of didesmethylmensacarcin. All inactivation constructs were heterologously expressed in the host strain S. albus, resulting in the complete loss of the DDMM-production. Moreover, no new intermediates of the biosynthesis could be d ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4300564-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183507-4>

Media Representation as Personal Intellectual Creation ¤ The work deals with image protection in a completely new form: The author examines whether an image of a person is protected as a copyright work. The investigation is very careful to only deal with relevant problems and not to dilute the scientific thesis through digressions. This makes the reading extremely engaging and scientifically informative. In the examination, the scope of copyright law is explained and checked whether this can be transferred to the image of prominent persons in the media. In particular, the protection of the image as a work in accordance with Paragraph 2 UrhG, as a collection work in accordance with Paragraph 4 UrhG, and as a multimedia work is investigated. As a result, the author proposes a new pragmatic and methodically convincing way of legal treatment of matters from the field of image marketing. The book is aimed at experts dealing with the subject, the media industry, but also at interested laypeople.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122349-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117633-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026574-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4192358-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037877-9>

This Open-Access Publication deals with telling in the corporate context, which has been omnipresent since the introduction of storytelling in the late 1990s. The book shows in this context how companies explicitly use telling on the internet to present themselves positively to the outside (= image enhancement). The publication clearly shows that certain specifics of narratives are of particular importance for self-presentation. With their help, companies can, for example, concepts such as Corporate Responsibility be presented as lived values to target groups discreetly or stylize the working day as a special experience. In total, the author identifies four basic types of self-presentation with each specific narrative rhetoric and characteristic narrative realization forms to communicate these types on the WWW to the desired target groups. In this context, the linguistically analyzed findings are characterized by their interdisciplinary embedding. This opens up opportunities for connections to other disciplines. The author After Ulrike Ackermann 2021 in Germanistic Linguistics under an interdisciplinary perspective in the field of 'Telling' at the Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg was promoted, she applies her application-oriented linguistic findings as an independent partner in recommendation marketing today.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161289-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043188-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4379691-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061963-1>
Restrictions on Direct Investments from Third Countries ¤ The financial market and sovereign debt crisis have brought the importance of free capital movements to the forefront of societal, economic, and legal policy discussion. In this context, direct investments from capital providers in third countries, particularly from Asia and the Middle East, which enable significant influence on the business policy of target companies, have come into focus. The work examines the compatibility of central regulatory, societal, and tax law restrictions on direct investments from third countries with constitutional, EU, and economic international law. With the analysis of specific restriction provisions from different legal fields and the consideration of various levels of regulation, a fundamental investigation of the regulatory framework for direct investments from third countries is now available.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4247482-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4204817-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070496-8>
The Relationship of Labour Law to Art. 12 GG and European Fundamental Rights: Using the Example of Labour Disputes against Relocation ¤ Labour disputes against relocation have been increasingly occupying practice and science for several years. The „Viking“ decision of the ECJ has shown that their legal assessment does not only refer to national labour law, but also European law is to be taken into account in this regard.\\nThe work first examines the still undecided question of the admissibility of such labour disputes under German labour law. It is worked out that a labour dispute with the aim of preserving the location is generally admissible as long as the general labour dispute rules are observed. Then, the work deals with the legal assessment of such labour disputes under the assumption of European law. Here, under rejection of the ECJ's case law, it is explained that at least labour disputes related to collective agreements serve the protected autonomy of collective bargaining under Art. 28 GRCh and justify any impairment of fundamental rights	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061963-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182888-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120921-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4525992-6>
The Law of Statutory Pension Insurance and German Unity ¤ 20 years after reunification, there is still no uniform pension law. This book comprehensively and understandably deals with the questions associated with it. It presents both the pension law and social policy development to date and analyzes the transition process of West law to the new federal states. The more than 10-year-long legal disputes, the reactions and repair attempts of politics to the Federal Constitutional Court's jurisprudence are also discussed from a feminist perspective. The economic development in the new federal states and its effects on the catch-up process are examined and summarized, as well as the political solution approaches in the current debate and their possible consequences.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4235034-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4192161-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115743-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177215-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4217877-0>
Advanced signal processing techniques for two-way relaying networks and full-duplex communication systems ¤ Very high data rates and always available network coverage in future wireless networks require new algorithms on the physical layer. The use of relays is a promising approach, as network coverage can be increased. In addition, a cost-effective solution for connecting to the network infrastructure is available compared to copper or fiber optic cables. Traditional one-way relay techniques (One-Way Relaying [OWR]) use half-duplex procedures (HD procedures), which slow down the transmission system and lead to spectral losses. On the one hand, two-way relay techniques (Two-Way Relaying [TWR]) allow simultaneous transmission to the relay and reception from it, resulting in more efficient use of the spectrum compared to OWR. Therefore, we investigate two-way relays and, in particular, TWR systems for multi-pair/multi-user operation using amplify-and-forward relays (AF relays). Such scenarios suffer from interferences between pairs or between users. To overcome these interferences, advanced signal processing algorithms - or, in other words, spatial multiple access procedures (Spatial Division Multiple Access [SDMA]) - are required. On the other hand, the spectral loss due to HD operation can also be compensated if the relay operates in full-duplex mode. Nevertheless, a FD device is difficult to realize in practice due to strong internal self-interference (SI) and limited dynamic range of the transceiver. Therefore, advanced procedures for SI suppression should be developed. This dissertation meets these two goals by developing optimal and/or efficient algebraic solutions that maximize various utility functions, such as sum rate and minimum transmit power. In the first part, we study multi-pair TWR networks with a single multi-antenna AF relay. This application can also be viewed as multiple different service operators sharing relays and spectrum, with different user pairs belonging to different service operators. Current approaches focus on interference suppression. We propose a projection-based procedure for separating multiple service operators (projection based separation of multiple operators [ProBaSeMO]). ProBaSeMO is easily adaptable for the case where each user has multiple antennas or different system design criteria are applied. As a performance metric for ProBaSeMO, we develop optimal algorithms for maximizing the sum rate, minimizing the transmit power at the relay, or maximizing the minimum signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio [SINR]) at the user. For maximizing the sum rate, specific gradient-based methods were developed, which are independent of whether a user is equipped with one or multiple antennas. To guarantee a polynomial time complexity in the case of a 'worst-case', we developed an algorithm with polynomial time complexity. This is inspired by the 'Polynomial Time Difference of Convex Functions' method (POTDC method). Regarding the sum rate of the system, we finally investigate the conditions that must be met to obtain a gain through joint use. Subsequently, we investigate the maximization of the sum rate of a multi-pair TWR network with multiple single-antenna AF relays and single-antenna users. The resulting problem of sum rate maximization, bound to a certain total transmit power of all relays in the network, is similar to that of the previous scenario. Accordingly, an optimal solution for one scenario can also be used for the other scenario. Furthermore, global optimal solutions are developed based on the polynomial time algorithm. These solutions are either bound to a maximum total transmit power of all relays or to a maximum transmit power of each individual relay. In addition, we develop suboptimal solutions that are efficient in their time complexity and represent an approximation of the optimal solution.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049354-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4227294-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7540075-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054947-1>
Evaluation of Stress Load in Finishing Pigs Depending on Behavior Type ¤ When evaluating stress situations, individual assessment of the situation plays a crucial role. In pigs, a reactive and proactive coping type or coping style has already been described. Piglets can be assigned to these coping styles using the backtest. Less resilient animals in the backtest (LR) are associated with the reactive coping style, while very resilient animals in the backtest (HR) are associated with the proactive coping style. Here, piglets classified as LR and HR were kept in three different housing forms (conventional, Initiative Animal Welfare and high-enriched) and tested for the influence of coping style and housing form on potential stress parameters. Throughout the entire experimental period, LR pigs showed higher cortisol concentrations than HR pigs. In addition, LR pigs had a lower concentration of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-5, a lower thyroxine (T4) concentration, and the ratio of thyroxine and triiodothyronine (T4/T3 ratio) was lower in LR pigs than in HR pigs. In the study, it was shown that the cortisol concentration and the ratio of cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (C/DHEA ratio) in pigs in conventional housing and animal welfare housing decreased at the end of the fattening period, while these increased in high-enriched housing. The decrease in C/DHEA ratio may indicate potential exhaustion of the HPA axis in conventionally and after Initiative Animal Welfare kept pigs at the end of the fattening period. Established concentration differences were masked by an acute stress situation, which arose from the relocation and transport. After relocation to the fattening pen, the T4 concentration and concentration of reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) initially increased, but then decreased again to the 115th LT. This late but clear decrease in T4 concentration shows that T4 determination in pigs may possibly detect time-delayed stressors. In summary, the sole determination of cortisol in the context of long-term animal welfare studies is to be considered critical. Especially in the background of the influence of coping style on basal cortisol concentration. To depict long-term changes in the endocrine profile, the C/DHEA ratio and the T4/T3 ratio may offer new approaches in animal welfare research in pigs.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169071-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183681-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4541437-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4411619-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113937-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012494-0>

The Sovereign Debt Crisis in the European Monetary Union: Instruments of Crisis Prevention and Management ¤ Die Arbeit geht der Frage nach, ob die bestehenden Instrumente der Krisenprävention und des Krisenmanagements die bestmöglichen Handlungsoptionen darstellen, um der aktuellen Staatsschuldenkrise in der Europäischen Währungsunion zu begegnen und zukünftige Krisen zu vermeiden.Trotz der sich abzeichnenden Entspannung, bleiben die Finanzmärkte fragil und die Haushaltslagen einiger Euro-Staaten beunruhigend. Deshalb erscheint es notwendig die Architektur der bestehenden Kriseninstrumente zu verbessern und zu vervollständigen.Die Arbeit unterbreitet einen Vorschlag, wie die Emission von ESM-Anleihen wirksamer gestaltet werden könnte, und befürwortet die Vervollständigung der Krisenmanagementsarchitektur mittels der Einführung von strukturierten Eurobonds. This analysis provides an overview and assessment of the existing instruments of sovereign debt crisis prevention and management in the euro area. Even though the newly created mechanisms have strengthened the framework of crisis prevention and management and have improved the situation for euro area Member States, the question remains whether the measures taken so far are the best possible options.The author analyses whether alternative approaches are feasible in times of crisis and whether these might be more effective. More specifically two tools are developed to improve euro-area crisis management by applying securitization techniques to set-up structured Eurobonds and structured ESM-bonds.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200280-1>
Political Education in and through School ¤ Current discussions about political education address the concepts of democracy learning and democratic school culture. Through 'experienced democracy', students are to become mature citizens. The pedagogical norm comes into conflict with the simultaneous necessary legitimation and enforcement of the institution's demands against those of the students. Maturity is thus revealed in a voluntary adoption of the heteronomously expected. On the basis of clinical interviews with students of a regular and a reform school, Christoph Leser inquires how they react to the experiences of this contradiction and what significance the individual processing of such experiences has for political learning processes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076593-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046526-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125132-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055783-2>

The practical sense in scientific discussions: Topos analysis of a sociological theory debate ¤ Andrea Hamp investigates the scientific discussion of sociologists in a theory debate. The author addresses the discussion practices based on the concepts of newer practice theories and conducts a topological analysis of justification methods. She inquires about the practical sense that unfolds in the debate, incorporating the Bourdieu's assumption that in science, it is always about reputation and positioning in the university field. However, the analysis shows that the struggle for social positions is not the only practical significance of sociological theory debates. The work represents a contribution to the sociological research of science and, with its innovative methodological approach, makes a proposal for a knowledge sociology oriented towards the practice concept.

Generalized Trust in Automated Journalism: Significance and Influencing Factors on the Trust of German Readers ¤ In this Open-Access book, it is about the question of how readers in Germany perceive automatically generated news and what significance they attribute to the procedures in journalism. The focus is on the question of whether the public trusts automated journalism and which influencing factors play a role in this decision. For empirical verification, focus groups with specifically recruited readers were used. The results show that there are no monocausal answers to the question of the trust of the readers in automated journalism. In general, they are neutral and at the same time curious and – above all with a view to the future – skeptical towards the use of technology. The participants demand a transparent handling of media organizations with automated reporting and want more information on the use, dissemination, and technology. As influencing factors on the evaluation of trust, selected person-related, text-related, and publication-related characteristics and properties of the object of investigation were tested.

Information as Infrastructure : Towards a Competition- and Innovation-Related Framework for Public Sector Information ¤ Making public sector information accessible and re-usable is essential for the prosperity and stability of a liberal society. By combining public information law, EU competition law and intellectual property law, Heiko Richter's study conceptualizes public sector information as infrastructure and thereby gives the role that information plays in the economy, society and the state a firm foundation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4535099-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027089-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056673-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026944-9>
Crisis Protests in Athens and Frankfurt : Productions of Space in Politics between Hegemony and Moment ¤ The 2011 occupations of public spaces made clear: political struggles can unfold transformative potential and are closely intertwined with their action spaces. For Athens and Frankfurt a. M., Mullis reconstructs these struggles around the crisis of 2010-2015. He draws on the political philosophies of Laclau and Mouffe as well as Rancière on the one hand, and Lefebvre's considerations on the production of space on the other. He argues that the political constitution of space and the spatial constitution of politics are to be thought of in a relational manner.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001974-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200280-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079262-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7635855-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4226404-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172385-5>
The Monumental Art of Karl Friedrich Schinkel ¤ As part of the outstanding oeuvre of the Prussian architect and artist Karl Friedrich Schinkel (1781-1841), a large number of drawings for tombs or mausoleums belong.

Functions, Offices, Networks: Liberals on the Ground: An Examination of the Regional Party Work of the LDPD in the District of Erfurt between the Construction of the Wall and the Fall of the Wall ¤ The dissertation addresses the fundamental research question of how the Liberal-Democratic Party of Germany (LDPD) fulfilled its assigned role in everyday political life on a local level, in what relationship it stood to the system of the GDR, and which areas of action existed and were utilized. Its local party work from the construction of the wall to the 1980s remained largely unobserved by research, as interest was primarily focused on the ruling SED or the rebellious approaches of the LDPD in the 1940s and late 1980s. The present work has taken the first step in examining the liberal party on district and local levels, and contributes to closing these gaps. Based on the case studies of Gotha, Erfurt-City and Eisenach, the dissertation illuminates the internal party organization, behavior, and motivations of members, as well as, considering network-theoretical approaches, the interconnections of local party functionaries, which are involved in the municipal work before ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044737-6>
Family Enterprises as Category Brand: A Stakeholder-Specific Analysis of the Brand Perception of Family Enterprises ¤ Annette-Louise Hirmer examines whether the use of the term 'family enterprise' in the context of target group communication should be used as a differentiator and what advantages and disadvantages this would entail in the perception of specific target groups. She determines through a comprehensive stakeholder-cross-sectional survey how family enterprises are perceived and what associations are linked to the category brand 'family enterprise'. In doing so, she can identify a range of stakeholder-specific differences in the perception of family enterprises and derive action recommendations for companies on the use of the category brand 'family enterprise' towards different target groups.

Institutional and ideational challenges of organizations in public discourses : an ordonomic approach ¤ Public Discourse; Discourse Failure; NGO; Ordonomics; Social Dilemma; Frame Analysis; NGO Accountability; Self-Regulation; Accountable Now; International Trade Agreements This quasi-cumulative dissertation analyzes the institutional and ideational challenges of organizations in public discourses. Academic scholars with different theoretical backgrounds assign NGOs a leading role to promote and fertilize public discourses in democratic societies. However, empirical research documents numerous cases, in which NGOs fostered discourse failure by launching controversial campaigns, the use of distorting framing strategies or even misinforming the general public. Following the ordonomic approach, this dissertation provides new counter-intuitive explanations for discourse failure and outlines feasible ideational and institutional reform proposals. The first article identifies the problem of discourse failure in the case of the public controversy (2015-2017) in Germany about two international trade agreements. The second article investigates existing solution approaches to discourse failure. In particular, it presents a longitudinal case study (2006-2018) about Accountable Now, which is the leading global initiative of international NGOs to promote the effectiveness and collective reputation of the NGO sector. The third article theorizes that discourse failure is the result of two different types of social dilemmas that require specific reforms. The following discussion links the empirical findings and theoretical contributions of the three previous articles to an ordonomic analysis of discourse failure in the NGO sector. This dissertation yields valuable theoretical implications for deliberative and rational-choice theory, the research on NGO accountability, and NGO self-regulation in practice.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4258790-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012475-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131014-7>
Systematics of Evidence Evaluation: A Contribution to the Application of the Balancing Doctrine at the Example of the Violation of the Competence of the Investigating Judge ¤ In order to derive a ban on the use of evidence as a consequence of a procedural error, the case law conducts a balancing act. Naturally, this approach is associated with significant uncertainties. Against this background, this investigation starts. In doing so, the author does not question the balancing doctrine itself, but takes it as a starting point. The goal of the investigation is to abstractly determine and arrange the criteria that must be taken into account in the balancing act, using the example of the violation of the judge's reservation, and to provide more legal certainty in this way. In this way, the author succeeds in setting up a test canon in three phases and establishing it on a dogmatic foundation. In the second part of the book, he applies his phase model to the individual investigative measures and comes to hardly any other results than the case law. This is a positive result. Because the legal practitioner is left with the good feeling that the case law also comes to 'correct' results without this test canon. This does not, however, diminish the innovative character of the work, as it is precisely made clear by this how powerful the phase model is. The author Darvin Decker, born in Friesoythe, studied law at the University of Leipzig from 2011 to 2016 with a focus on criminology. After his clerkship at the Leipzig Regional Court, he returned to his hometown and has been practicing as a lawyer since 2018.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7753486-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062776-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141183-3>
The Protective Norm Theory: Historical Development and Backgrounds ¤ The subjective public law is an important topic of public law due to the dependence of nearly all legal protection – equally for science as well as for practice. Central is the protective norm theory. The work shows the historical development of the dogmatic figure and illuminates the relevant backgrounds. In the focus of consideration stand both the conception of the protective norm theory as well as its area of application. It shows that important developments took place at the time of late constitutionalism and the Weimar Republic, but the final form of the protective norm theory is also shaped by developments after 1945. The state-theoretical context of the respective time proves to be influential. The protective norm theory appears to be equally changeable and constant. The historical clarification serves a better understanding of the theory.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058319-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7793148-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128412-4>
MetropolRegionalPlanung : Opportunities and Risks of a Consolidation of Metropolitan Regions and Spatial Planning ¤ The book 'MetropolRegionalPlanung' deals with the opportunities and risks of a consolidation of the competition-oriented concept of metropolitan regions with the community-oriented spatial planning on a regional level. To this end, the discussion on the development of German spatial planning from order planning to an activating regional management is taken up, in order to develop theses for a consolidation of metropolitan regions and spatial planning.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7532090-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048590-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4455020-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049040-3>
The Desire for Diversity : Diversity Sensitivity in Social Pedagogical Relationships ¤ Why do professionals in child and youth welfare identify passionately with the justice ideal of diversity? And what promises are hidden in the professional ideal of the diversity-reflexive relationship? Marie Frühauf takes a look at that desire in her study, which is designed from a feminist-lacanian perspective, that professionals attach to diversity. The associated design of the pedagogical relationship indicates it against the background of a post-oedipal and at the same time gender-specific societal constellation, in which the Other paradoxically loses importance within the pedagogical relationship	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015602-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055864-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4236433-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079583-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186835-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4312811-7>

German Administrative Procedure Law under Pressure of EU Adaptation: Considerations de lege lata and de lege ferenda ¤ Again and again, administrative procedure law is under pressure of EU adaptation. This applies in particular to the protection of rights in environmental law, but also recently in data protection law. So far, the design of the claim to action based on a subjective legal infringement has been in the focus (change from the injured party to the interested party claim, expansion of the class action), the question of the introduction of new types of action or remedies is raised for the first time. The monograph examines in detail whether and to what extent central levers of German administrative procedure law can still be maintained in the face of EU requirements for protection of rights or should be changed (e.g. protection theory, protection of rights in procedural errors, principle of investigation, control density of administrative courts, material preclusion and alternatives)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117368-5>
Performance-Oriented Resource Management and Incentive Structures in the German Higher Education System: A National Comparison ¤ Using the examples of the University of Hanover, the TU Dresden, the TU Berlin, the TU Munich, and the RWTH Aachen, the author shows how financial resources are distributed in a performance-oriented manner, which incentive structures are applied, and how the management procedures are evaluated by scientists. The results clearly show that a broad spectrum of applied resource management procedures and incentive structures exists, whose design is largely dependent on the specific framework conditions of the higher education institutions. Within the framework of the investigation, interviews were conducted with representatives of university leadership and administration as well as with scientists. The evaluation of these shows that a general acceptance of the use of performance-oriented management procedures exists, but their control effects are limited. Their effectiveness is also restricted by the lack of fundamental prerequisites within the German higher education system. Table of Contents: A. Introduction. - B.

East German Large Residential Areas: Development and Perspectives ¤ Nico Grunze examines the diverse developments of East German large residential areas, which have shaped the cities since the housing program of the GDR. To this end, he identifies the overall group of new construction areas with a size of at least 2,500 apartments and investigates which types of large residential areas can be distinguished in the course of their development since 1990. The author presents approaches with which the actors react to the various changes and explains future tasks and possibilities for the settlement. At its core, the East German large residential areas are facing a new development phase, which will be determined more strongly than before by poverty among the elderly and increasing segregation, i.e. from social aspects. The content includes: Inspection of all East German large residential areas Typology of East German large residential areas Eight case studies: Poverty among the elderly, demographic change, generational change, demolition and new construction of apartments Future themes and tasks The target groups Lecturers and students of geography, urban and regional planning, and urban sociology Responsible persons in the areas of municipal, state, and federal administration and politics, urban and regional planning, architecture, housing industry The author Nico Grunze is self-employed in urban research.

Drugs in Chemistry Class: The Amphetamine Class: An Intervention Study ¤ This dissertation project is to be assigned to school-based drug prevention work in Germany. The focus is on the didactic development research of materials for chemistry lessons and the empirical investigation of prior knowledge and interest structures of learners. Both worldwide and in Germany, the market for amphetamines is still on the rise. Current results show that both young people and young adults come into contact with cannabis, especially with ecstasy and amphetamine. For school-based awareness work, a learning program was developed that conveys subject and health competences of the illegal drugs amphetamine, methamphetamine, and ecstasy. In the context of the development work, non-university research institutions, students, teachers, and students were involved. The learning stations address various learning approaches to convey subject knowledge on structures, historical aspects, synthesis routes, effects, and detection possibilities of the three substances. For the empirical accompanying research, in addition to descriptive-statistical, exploratory, and content-analytical evaluation procedures, structured observation protocols were also added. The results of the study show that the learning set is context-oriented to prior knowledge structures of the students and achieves gender- and school form-specific effects. Especially students and participants of the gymnasial classes show a higher interest in the topic of drugs and evaluate the situational interest in the learning object much more positively. Especially with regard to the effects and detection possibilities of amphetamines, differentiated knowledge structures and additional critical-argumentative competences for drug consumption as well as for the advantages and disadvantages of drug rapid tests can be recognized as a result of the intervention.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054365-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4009832-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123176-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020759-6>
European Collective Action : Reference Framework for an Efficient European Justice System ¤ The European legislator has been dealing with the introduction of collective actions for several years. All previous EU legislative initiatives have been occasionally scrutinized, as one feared the introduction of such procedures would bring American conditions. Nevertheless, the European Commission presented a package of measures for the harmonization of collective claims for damages in 2013. But is the time really ripe for a European collective action?In the context of the analysis, the author comes to the result that a European collective action currently appears to be unfeasible, but could be sensible in the course of harmonization of the Union law. Against this background, a coherent European reference framework for collective actions has been developed, which adjusts the procedural design of a collective action and creates a balance of interests between consumer and business side	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1271259419>
Functional Nanoparticles Based on Cellulose ¤ Novel polysaccharide nanoparticles (PS-NP) were developed and their application as sensors was investigated. Hydrophobic dyes were incorporated into PS-NP from cellulose esters during self-assembly. The particle properties of the composite-NP are influenced both by the hydrophobicity of the dyes and by structural interactions. By comparing the two production methods – dialysis and dropwise addition – particle size and the width of the size distribution of the composite-NP were optimized. Carboxyl groups on the particle surface were covalently coupled with antibodies to obtain colored conjugates. The conjugates showed lower detection limits in the lateral flow immunoassay than corresponding reference particles. Furthermore, cellulose esters with active ester groups based on N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) were synthesized under homogeneous conditions. N,N'-Disuccinimidylcarbonate proved to be an effective reagent. The derivatives could be converted into reactive PS-NP with activated NHS groups on the surface, to which an aminofunctionalized fluorescent dye or enzyme could be covalently immobilized directly and without the usual activation step in aqueous phase. Optimized reaction conditions allow the dye to be bound with high efficiency of up to 90%. For the conversion of 6-maleimidohexanoic acid with cellulose esters, iminium chloride proved to be an effective reagent. During the conversion to particles, a thiol-functionalized dye could be bound to the derivatives via thiol-ene reaction (click chemistry) to obtain fluorescent and reactive PS-NP. The obtained PS derivatives were characterized using elemental analysis, infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, while the PS-NP were investigated using dynamic light scattering, electron microscopy, and optical spectroscopy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4431018-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016465-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7700321-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4333369-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154818-8>
Stable Vinyl Cations ¤ Within this work, the representation and characterization of new beta,beta'-disilylsubstituted vinyl cations are described. The synthesis of these cations is carried out via a hydride transfer reaction from alkynylsilanes by Trityl TPFPB at room temperature. For the first time, the experimental molecular structure of an alpha-cyclopropyl-substituted vinyl cation is presented. The structure of the alpha-cyclopropyl-substituted vinyl cation reveals the structural consequences of the interactions of the vinyl cation with both the strained C-C bonds of the cyclopropyl ring and the sigma bonds of the beta-silyl residues. IR spectroscopic investigations on salts of alpha-alkyl and alpha-aryl-beta,beta'-disilyl-substituted vinyl cations show a systematic dependence of the position of the ny(C=C+) band on the expression and extent of the beta-silyl effect in these vinyl cations. For alpha-silyl- and alpha-germyl-substituted-beta,beta'-disilyl-substituted vinyl cations, an hitherto unknown degenerate rearrangement in carbocation chemistry has been proven.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170383-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188347-0>
Competing selective sweeps ¤ Zusammenfassung: The principle of natural selection, characterised by Darwin and Wallace in 1858 changed the way of thinking about the development of species completely and radically. They were the first to point out, that certain traits improve an individual's chance to survive and reproduce and are therefore inherited more frequently. Nowadays scientists are able to search for beneficial traits on the molecular level. In doing so particular detection tools are applied, which make use of the existing DNA variation in a population. Such tools are often developed using theoretical models and they try to find special DNA patterns, which indicate that selection might have happened in this DNA area.In this scientific work a situation is examined, where two selective sweeps within a narrow genomic region overlap in a sexually evolving population. For such a competing sweeps situation at first a mathematical model, based on reasonable biological assumptions, is set up to identify what kind of evolutions can happen. Of particular interest is the probability of a fixation of both beneficial alleles, in cases where these alleles are not initially linked. To handle this question a graphical tool, the ancestral selection recombination graph, is utilized, which is based on a genealogical view on the population. This approach provides a limit result (for large selection coefficients) for the probability that both beneficial mutations will eventually fix and enables us to analyse the role of selection, recombination and the population size. In particular, we could establish that under certain starting conditions the fixation probability is heavily dependent on the population size.The analytical examination is complemented by a simulation study. Here we analyse on the one hand to what extent the derived limit formulas are suited for large finite populations. On the other hand simulations are conducted to identify possible signatures for the considered scenario	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4477371-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046804-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4356678-9>
Umberto Eco Introduction ¤ Dieter Mersch's introduction to Umberto Eco is based on Eco's statement 'What one cannot speak of theoretically, one must tell in a story' (p. 8), i.e. Eco's work, which encompasses both his theory of semiotics and its literary implementation in 'The Name of the Rose' and 'Foucault's Pendulum', should be considered as a whole. Mersch places Eco's semiotic philosophy in the context of modern 20th-century philosophy and its specific problematics as 'philosophy of language' in a broad sense and, conversely, interprets Eco's new type of literature as 'large-scale Alexandrian text fabrics', 'meta-texts', Eco's books as 'narrative semiotics'. Mersch's book is solid, readable for interested laypeople and equipped with good, illustrative examples where it's about Eco's semiotics, with a timeline, current bibliography, and notes. To my knowledge, there is nothing comparable in direct comparison - in the balanced treatment of Eco's literature and theory. - Recommended. (Renate Stephan-Reister)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054498-9>
Management of Knowledge Risks ¤ Knowledge risk, knowledge management, risk management, knowledge assets, knowledge loss, knowledge diffusion, knowledge transfer, knowledge quality. Based on the increasing importance of knowledge as a resource for value creation on the one hand and the increased risk orientation (e.g. KonTraG, SOX) of companies on the other hand, the work sets out to address the currently inadequate consideration of knowledge risks, i.e. risks that affect knowledge as a resource. The goal of the work is to raise the status quo regarding the handling of knowledge risks in companies and to develop recommendations for action to improve the handling of risks of this category. Based on a broad literature analysis, the concept of knowledge risk was systematized on the level of business processes along the four risk categories knowledge loss, -diffusion, -transfer and -quality and on this basis a multi-stage empirical study with 129 companies in Germany was conducted. The survey was conducted on the basis of telephone interviews and written questionnaires, while descriptive, inductive and multivariate statistical methods were applied for evaluation. The central results of the work consist in the development of a catalog of knowledge risks and control measures, which is intended to support companies in identifying and controlling these risks. Furthermore, a portfolio for the classification of knowledge-related resources with regard to their protection needs was developed. On the basis of the empirical study, the potential of control measures, internal and external influencing factors on control as well as exchange relationships were identified. Furthermore, a concept for anchoring this management task in the organizational structure and process organization was developed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4561842-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114012-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121590-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066559-8>

Freiheit und Wettbewerb in der Republik : Remarks on Competition from the Perspective of Kant's Philosophy of Freedom, Law, and State ¤ Wettbewerb, also the entrepreneurial, is a fact. Life shows this. Competitive action has a compelling effect, because it forces competing companies to better and best performances on the market. Kant defines freedom, among other things, as »independence from another's compelling arbitrariness«. The concept of free competition is therefore obviously a contradiction in itself. Free entrepreneurial action, in which entrepreneurs try to assert themselves on the market according to their own and sole principles, is a prerequisite for functioning competition. The existence of economic power of some companies is capable of impairing the entrepreneurial freedom of others in an unbearable way. Having power and influence is not fundamentally reprehensible. It is therefore a matter of preventing the misuse of economic power, but distinguishing between (legal) use and (illegal) abuse of the same. This distinction is difficult, but possible on the basis of Kant's philosophy of freedom and law. / 'Freedom, Competition and the Republic' -- Competition is a fact and so are competitive markets. Therefore enterprises are pressured to better achievements and performances on the market. Immanuel Kant defines freedom as the 'independence of another urging arbitrariness', consequently the term 'free competition' is self-contradictory. The state regulates the market and is responsible to guarantee and protect the freedom of economic activity of all market participants by legislation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018326-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4212020-2>
Micro-Utopias of Architecture : The Utopian Moment of Architectural Minimal Techniques ¤ After utopia fell into disrepute with the entry into the 'postmodernity' from 1968, its return is shown in the current cultural discourses. The turning point of this development is marked by the collapse of the communist regimes in 1989/91. Sandra Meireis puts forward the central hypothesis for the architectural field that a return of utopia can be observed in the form of plural micro-utopias - microtopoi of architecture. In addition, she shows that utopia is a historical-philosophical model of social change and thus reflects the late modern tendency of cultural particularity Frontmatter -- Content -- Preface -- Introduction -- The Field of Study -- On the Sources -- On the Method of Work -- On the Structure of the Book -- Micro-Utopos.

Commutation Calculation for Permanent Magnet DC Commutator Motors of Small Power ¤ In the present work, a procedure for calculating commutation in permanent magnet DC commutator motors (PM-DC motors) is presented. Furthermore, the fundamentals of current usage and the factors influencing them are discussed. Within the scope of the work, a summary of the most important methods for measuring and evaluating commutation is also provided, as these investigations are still highly relevant for small machine development. The procedures are explained using concrete examples and evaluated in terms of effort and their validity, as well as used for the validation of the new calculation approach. The analysis of known calculation procedures on their suitability and limitations closes this topic. Using the newly developed simulation approach for a complete drive system, current usage can be analyzed in all operating states. The model description includes the influence of the magnetic circuit, control, drive mechanics, and brush-commutator contact system. The creation and parameterization of drive models is discussed, including specific characteristics of PM-DC motors of small power. A focus is on the behavior of the contact system and its representation with all essential influencing factors. Subsequently, practice-relevant questions on commutation behavior are analyzed using drive simulation.

The Disciplinary Measure of a Works Council Member due to Breach of Official Duties ¤ Table of Contents: This work deals with the question of the admissibility of disciplinary measures against a works council member due to breaches of statutory duties. It is shown by means of examples from the entire civil law that disciplinary measures must always be considered before the announcement of an extraordinary termination. Furthermore, a comparability of extraordinary termination and the exclusion procedure according to 23 BetrVG is shown, which justifies the transfer of the principles developed in the law of termination for disciplinary measures to the law of works constitution. This finally leads to the admissibility of justified disciplinary measures due to breaches of official duties, as the interests of the affected works council members are not opposed to their claim.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126757-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141074-9>
The Effect of Trust on Ex-Post Transaction Costs in Cooperation and Hierarchy ¤ Foundations -- Hypotheses -- Foundations of the empirical investigation -- Operationalization of the factors -- Verification of the hypotheses -- Summary and Conclusion. The transaction cost theory has developed into one of the most dynamic branches of economics in recent years. Its goal is the identification and analysis of institutions that allow for cost-minimal transactions. Trust is considered an important factor in reducing transaction costs. This thesis is verified by Alexandra Matthes using a comprehensive empirical investigation. In the foreground is the comparison of the effect of trust in different governance structures. The author shows to what extent trust has an impact on the quality of cooperation and thus the transaction costs.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063290-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4206592-6>
Literature History of German Unity 1989-2000: Alienation between East and West ¤ Review: How did literature react to German reunification? For three decades, readers, feuilleton, and literary science have been concerned with this question, without a systematic answer having been attempted so far. Now, on the occasion of the upcoming 30th anniversary of the fall of the wall, it is available. Born's pioneering work is the first comprehensive literary history of the literature of the turning point. It shows that the confrontation with German unity was the central theme for German literature in the 1990s. And it also meticulously and in detail shows that it is the alienation between East and West that holds the turning point literature 'in the innermost together'. The work offers not only an overview and orientation, but also suggests a canon with 74 individual analyses. -- 'With the	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4235034-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035964-5>
Design Parameters and Behavior-Influencing Effect of Ecologically Oriented Control Systems: A Case Study-Based Investigation ¤ Companies are increasingly formulating environmental protection goals and communicating them to their stakeholders. In order to prevent these goals and the behavior within the company from diverging, an ecologically oriented control system is needed. With such a control system, environmental protection goals can be implemented in the company, so that employees behave in a goal-conform manner. However, designing an ecologically oriented control system poses new challenges for companies. This book therefore deals with the design possibilities of an ecologically oriented control system and its effect on the behavior within the company. These contents were investigated in two case studies in German companies, whose results are described in detail. Among the central findings are the comparable patterns in the design of the control system in both companies and the proof of the behavioral effect of the control system	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4285859-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201709-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070102-5>

Citizen Budgets in Germany : Individual and Contextual Influencing Factors of Participation ¤ Democratic Innovation: Foundations, Causes, and Objectives -- Subject of Investigation: the Citizen Budget -- Factors Explaining Participation in Citizen Budgets. Sebastian H. Schneider investigates, based on individual and aggregate data, which individual and contextual factors influence the participation of citizens in municipal budget planning ("citizen budgets"). The author contributes to basic research in political science, as such consultative-dialogical participation procedures will increasingly gain dissemination. Furthermore, the study provides insights for municipal political practice, as it reveals causal relationships and thus can create understanding of success and failure of such procedures, although a mechanical control of participation is neither possible nor desirable.

Vergangenes verhandeln : Late Antique Status Discourses of Senatorial Elites in Gaul and Italy ¤ Frontmatter -- Foreword -- Table of Contents -- 1. Introduction -- 2. The Economy of Historically Grounded Communication in the Western Roman Context -- 3. Distinction through History with Sidonius and his Circle? -- 4. Negotiating the Past in the Ennodius Environment -- 5. Results -- Sources and Literature Index -- Indices Investigations into status characteristics and self-awareness of late Roman senatorial elites record a boom. Similarly, in the wake of a cultural-historical turn, media and practices of cultural memory have come into focus in research. However, looking at the follow-up question of past reference, elite communication, and constitution, concepts such as nostalgia, contingency management, or musealization are encountered. Yet, the meta-narrative of escapist nobles in the 'Twilight of Antiquity' is rightfully post-1968 constantly doubted. Based on these premises, this study devotes itself to past references in Gallo-Roman and Italian senatorial discourses of Late Antiquity. Initially, Meurer asks to what extent actors relied on historical education and orientation knowledge to position themselves. On a macro level, but above all through detailed case studies, she outlines strategies of past-related communication. Furthermore, general negotiation processes around senatorial status foundations are sketched. With a view to current discussions on regional differentiation, the study also problematizes the dependence of such discourses on political action spaces.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124227-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180978-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1033831689>

Infringing Use : The Dynamic Interpretation of the Concept of Infringing Use in European Trademark Law by the Court of Justice of the European Union ¤ In this work, the current understanding of the concept of infringing use in European trademark law is discussed. This depends on which use of a foreign trademark is free and which can result in an infringement of the rights of the trademark owner. In practice, this is discussed, among other things, for the use of trademarks in sports merchandising, keyword advertising, and comparative advertising. The author comes to the result that the Court of Justice of the European Union has established an 'individual, case-specific concept of use', and explains its effects on the scope of protection of the trademark, on the harmonization of trademark law in the EU and EEA, and on its role in the overall system of the internal market. By means of the member state Germany, the consequences for the national trademark laws of the member states are also presented. In this context, the relationship between the Court of Justice of the European Union and the German Federal Court of Justice for this area of law is also examined.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115710-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074580-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4168904-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048849-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005248-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144483-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074577-6>
Constructors of the Nation : Historians as Political Actors in the Vormärz and Revolution 1848/49 ¤ Cliff Notes: Nations are nothing self-evident - they are constructed by humans. Intellectual thinkers played a similarly important role as the interpretation of history, which forms the foundation for that construction. In 19th-century Germany, historians were leading figures in this process. This book takes a closer look at six such professors who were members of the Frankfurt National Assembly: Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann, Johann Gustav Droysen, August Friedrich Gfrörer, Karl Hagen, Georg Waitz, and Heinrich Wuttke. As deputies, they attempted to contribute to the founding of the national state in 1848/49. However, before 1848, they had already ideologically paved the way for the German national state. This book shows how their political and scientific work intertwined and thus contributed to the construction of the nation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041331-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128597-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025098-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041300-7>
Evolution and host-immune response in hepaciviral infection ¤ The Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) remains a global health burden, with over 70 million infected people worldwide. Despite a high cure rate of over 90% with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) medications, the effect on a population level is limited. The main reasons for this are underdiagnosis, lack of immunity, and limited availability of medications. Even if patients can be cured with DAAs, the risk of liver disease remains high. To achieve the WHO's goal of eliminating HCV, a prophylactic vaccine appears to be essential. However, the development of a vaccine is hindered by the lack of an immunocompetent animal model. The Equine Hepacivirus (EqHV) is the closest relative of HCV and is therefore suitable as a surrogate model for the study of Hepaciviruses. In this thesis, we analyzed the evolution, immune responses, transmission, and pathogenesis of Hepaciviruses. In fact, the mutation patterns of the glycoprotein (E1E2) in acutely and chronically EqHV-infected horses and HCV-infected patients were similar. However, the overall heterogeneity of EqHV virus populations was less pronounced compared to HCV, which may reflect the lower chronicity rate in horses. Interestingly, we found that the N-terminal region of E2 in EqHV appears to be truncated. This region, also known as hypervariable region 1, plays an important role in the immune evasion of HCV. Even in other Hepaciviruses that infect mammals, a HVR1-like region seems to be missing, which suggests an important evolutionary role of HVR1 in HCV in humans. HCV has a very limited tropism and only infects hepatocytes of humans and chimpanzees. EqHV infects both horses and donkeys. The rate of RNA-positive animals is lower in donkeys compared to horse cohorts, which suggests a higher resistance in donkeys. Here, we were able to show that donkeys are as susceptible to EqHV inoculation as horses, but show a less specific antiviral immune response. HCV is a blood-borne virus that is usually transmitted through needlestick injuries, blood transfusions, or during drug injection. The transmission route of EqHV is still unknown. To determine the minimal infectious dose, we infected eight horses with decreasing virus loads. 13 RNA copies per inoculation were still infectious, while seven RNA copies did not lead to productive infection. Interestingly, the duration of infection and seroconversion seemed to depend on the inoculation dose. An infection with a high dose led to a strong immune response, faster antibody induction, and faster decline of the virus load, while an infection with a medium or low dose showed a weaker reaction.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113937-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012494-0>
Intim Sphere and Witness Duty: Protecting the Intimacy and Privacy of the Witness during Examination in the Criminal Procedure ¤ Whoever is to testify in the criminal procedure must, according to the Code of Criminal Procedure, provide information about everything that can be relevant to the clarification of the facts. This also applies to very private information, such as about illnesses or sexuality. It is, however, questionable whether the existing absolute priority of the interest in the pursuit of truth over the witness's interest in the protection of their intimacy and privacy still represents a sensible solution today. Against this speak the increased sensitivity for the importance of privacy on constitutional and human rights level, but also a changed understanding of the importance of truth-seeking in the criminal procedure.Gudrun Fink proposes modern and balanced solutions for the problem areas, taking into account the legitimate defensive interests.

Videoprofis in Everyday Life : The Communicative Diversity of Video Analysis ¤ René Tuma presents focused ethnographic case studies on video analyses in market research, sports training, and police work. Through careful reconstructions of the communicative activities of experts, the procedures for interpreting video data are highlighted. The author illustrates these methods with meticulous reflexive video-graphic investigations of the relevance systems emerging as performative forms of showing, making visible, and interpreting. On this basis, he develops the concept of „vernacular video analysis“, which refers to the dissemination of a specific visual style: The video professionals also direct the finest action patterns to the respective field logics and organizational problems and establish the analyses as „service“ for the respective professions in the fields over time. In addition to this diagnosis, the reflection of the methods also offers new perspectives for common socioscientific approaches.

Attraction and Fascination of Media: Youth Socialization in the Context of Modernization and Individualization ¤ The socialization conditions of adolescents are characterized by complex and multifaceted societal and cultural processes of pluralization and diversification. To shape their socialization contexts, adolescents today use not only traditional socialization institutions, but also increasingly media. They function - as is often emphasized in recent times - in the everyday life of adolescents as "developmental helpers" and enable self-socialization. This new perspective on media from a macro-sociological perspective to be empirically founded, is the concern of this book.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028859-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055783-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120719-1>
Towards in-field sample-preparation and detection : development of new sample preparation formats using molecularly imprinted polymers for the combination with field-deployable detectors ¤ Molecularly Imprinted Polymer, Sample-Preparation, Ion Mobility Spectrometry, in-Field, Environmental Samples, Solid Phase Extraction, Solid Phase Microextraction, Acesulfame, Atrazine, 4-Nitrophenol Nowadays due to the introduction of vast amount of chemical compounds into the environment, its protection needs permanent monitoring. Therefore, development of the cost-effective and field-portable sample-preparation/detection methods is necessary. A selective sample-preparation method could help to concentrate the analytes of interest and mitigate the matrix effect. Due to inherent advantages of selective molecularly imprinted polymer materials, they were selected to be evaluated during my study. MIP sorbent materials were synthesized for 4-nitrophenol, atrazine and acesulfame and the selective sample-preparation methods were step-by-step developed to improve the sample volumes and flow-rates. Sample volumes were increased up to 500 mL with sample flow-rates of 30 mL min-1. Developed method was successfully used in-field for sample-preparation of environmental water samples. Finally, a constructed and optimized electrospray ionization-ion mobility spectrometer was used to analyze the obtained extracts from developed filter-paper extraction method.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4588977-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4589315-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4349293-9>
Horizontal Network Structures in the German Hospital Market: Potentials, Processes, and Practice ¤ The financing and permanent reform of healthcare services directly affect a basic need of the population. Hospitals, which account for the largest share of healthcare expenditures at around 26%, are required to increase their operational excellence and adapt to the constantly changing institutional conditions in order to reduce costs. Benjamin I. Behar examines to what extent hospitals in variously organized network types can meet these requirements. The author takes an advanced theoretical perspective, combining transaction cost economics with a strategic approach to dynamic capabilities. He conducts a comprehensive survey of 1,740 German hospitals, which, with 607 responding institutions, is representative of the German hospital sector. Based on the data thus obtained, he provides detailed insights into the network practice of German hospitals.

Opto-electronic characterization of polycrystalline CuInS2 and Cu(In,Ga)S2 absorber layers by photoluminescence ¤ Photoluminescence (PL) has established itself as a characterization method for solar cell absorbers, by formulating the generalized Planck radiation law, it is essentially possible to determine the splitting of quasi-Fermi levels and the absorption of a solar cell even before its completion. However, this applies primarily to homogeneous absorber layers for large-scale measurements (mm/cm scale). Due to the laterally varying opto-electronic and structural properties, this approach cannot be transferred one-to-one to the analysis of polycrystalline semiconductors. In this work, the lateral fluctuations in the properties of the polycrystalline semiconductor Cu(In,Ga)S2 are quantified and investigated with respect to their excitation state and absorption by means of laterally and spectrally resolved PL measurements with sub-micrometer resolution and the transition to macroscopic measurements.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000245-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166125-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174517-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121476-6>

Titan-Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydroaminoalkylation ¤ Because of the great biological and industrial relevance of amines new pathways for an easy and convenient access to this substance class have been investigated over many years. The metal-catalyzed hydroaminoalkylation of alkenes is a 100% atom-efficient reaction of great interest. In this doctoral thesis it was shown for the first time that titanium-based catalysts can be used for efficient metal-catalyzed hydroaminoalkylations of terminal alkenes. Interestingly, Ti-complexes with very different structures like Ti(NMe2)4, TiBn4 or Ind2TiMe2 showed a high catalytic activity. Besides the hydroaminoalkylation, the hydroamination of alkenes is also an elegant and 100 % atom-efficient pathway to more complex amines. The results presented in this doctoral thesis prove that the Lewis-acids GaCl3 and GaBr3 show a promising catalytical activity for the hydroamination of alkenes with p-toluenesulfonamide. <engl.> END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038906-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4217435-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160579-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4749938-2>

Challenging the state in Africa : MASSOB and the crisis of self-determination in Nigeria ¤ Nigeria; Igbo Question; National Question; Self-Determination; Ethnic Identity Politics; MASSOB; Igbo Identity; Citizenship; State; Memory Politics This work examines the 'Igbo Question' and emerging forms of Igbo 'self-determination' in contemporary Nigeria. It does this within the framework of contested citizenship, ethnic identity politics, and the unresolved crisis of state ownership and legitimacy, which all feed into the 'national question' in the Nigerian public sphere. The thesis takes a theoretical standpoint that the 'Igbo Question' occupies a place within the 'Tri-polar' power struggle and competition between the three major ethnic groups in Nigeria. Based on an idea of statehood prior, which is anchored in the failed attempts of the Igbo ethnic group to secede from the Nigerian state between 1967 and 1970, and drawing on the case of an Igbo ethno-nationalist separatist movement in Nigeria, such as the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), this work focuses on the use of 'territory' and 'space' as components of the repertoire of 'in the search for political change, sovereignty, and self-determination. This provides the context in which the demands 'and' counter-demands 'of security, territoriality, and sovereignty are issued. While the thesis draws primarily on various forms of group- and sub-national rights that have been established and studied in international law, political philosophy, and social scientific literature in general, it transcends these debates, but focuses more on the actual processes of appropriation, interpretation, and application of these rights and laws against the state in specific contexts. The analysis of the 'Igbo Question' draws on themes and perspectives around the salience, construction, mobilization, and politicization of ethnic identity and the dynamics of its introduction and use in national politics, connected with the various struggles, disputes, and conflicts that are embedded in it. The research offers an innovative and empirically grounded insight into the processes of 'legalization' of self-determination rights for groups within national states in Africa, the dynamics, constraints, and possibilities that are involved in mobilizing these rights and laws, the emancipatory potentials or transformative ends of these rights and laws, and the role of violence in nation-building processes in Africa.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041300-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169999-3>
Miniaturized Microstrip Circuit Composed of Composite Quarter-Circle Rings ¤ This work describes a new technique of conductor routing for efficient computer-aided design of circuits in microstrip technology. The method is characterized by the fact that the layout of the circuit to be realized is composed of quarter-circle rings. A grid, consisting of ring-shaped segments, serves as a tool. In comparison to the conventional implementation, microstrip circuits can be realized with relatively low effort, compactly and without noticeable impairment of the electrical properties, which is also shown by the examples given. Subsequently, the relevant mathematical apparatus for simulations on the circuit plane level is taken over from earlier works by Jouguet, Lewin, Wolff, Tripathi, Knoppik and Weisshaar and further developed with regard to microstrip lines consisting of quarter-circle rings. A new suitable waveguide model with magnetic side walls is proposed. Accordingly, each waveguide segment has both the effective radii and the effective central angle. The effective width is to be chosen equal to the effective width of the straight microstrip line of the same cross-section. For the calculation of the effective mean radius and the effective central angle, a simple empirical relationship is established. Based on this model, the known second-order perturbation calculation from the state of the art is used and the relations up to the sixth order are derived to improve the calculation accuracy of strongly curved lines. Furthermore, the determination of a general form of the differential equation for the calculation of disturbances of any order as well as direct approaches to their solution is carried out. The scattering parameters of each waveguide segment are calculated according to the relations derived by Weisshaar. The determination of the resulting scattering matrix is carried out taking into account every change in the curvature direction according to Gimeno. The further developed mathematical model of the curved microstrip line is verified by simulations and experimental investigations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4406753-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183636-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169897-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160442-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128765-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179389-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4312536-0>
Benjamin's Beetle : Investigations into the Visual Language of Walter Benjamin in the Context of "One-Way Street" ¤ Starting from the observation that central terms in Walter Benjamin do not correspond to the ideal of scientific terminology, the attempt is made to consider Benjamin's work from the perspective of the specific visuality of his writings. Central to this is 'One-Way Street' and the other 'thought images' designated by Benjamin. Image is understood not as a term converging on a message, but as a mode of a specific type of representation, which can be called 'diverting representation': In the image, more is shown than can be seen. In reference to Wittgenstein's late philosophy, Benjamin's language use is examined, above all in passages where he speaks in images. The central point of orientation is Wittgenstein's image of the 'beetle'. BEGIN END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006619-8>

For the operating surgeon, communication deficits and distraction can be concrete consequences of inadequate acoustics. Philipp Knöfler illustrates with measurements in the operating surgeon's ear canal that the recommended noise maximum level at the operating table is clearly exceeded. For the examined operating room, possibilities for reducing the level were developed, which can also be transferred to other operating rooms. However, to ensure an acoustic minimum standard in the realization of operating rooms, simple and manageable guidelines must be implemented in the planning process. The planning task 'quiet operating room' should urgently find its way into practice, so that the working conditions for the staff can be improved and an adequate environment can also be created for the patient.

Consent as a Negative Element of Criminal Offence ¤ In German criminal law, the consent of the victim can either be relevant as an element hindering the completion of the actus reus of the crime (»tatbestandsausschließendes Einverständnis«) or as a justificatory defense (»rechtfertigende Einwilligung«). However, this differentiation is neither dogmatically sound nor practically helpful. A unified theory of consent, based on a theory of wrongdoing which takes account of the interpersonal relations between offender and victim, should thus be established. Special attention has to be paid to the legal treatment of deficits in decision-making.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068165-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4336721-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184499-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189917-9>
Values as Cores of Competences: A Theoretical Study with an Empirical Analysis in Montessori Schools ¤ The terms 'competences' and 'values' are becoming increasingly popular in today's time, although the actual meaning of the terms is becoming increasingly blurred. In this work, the question is pursued of how the different scientific constructs of competences and values are connected. The author combines the two areas in a way that has not been available to date and transfers them to the pedagogical context of Montessori schools. This results in an important contribution to the educational science competence debate. The author theoretically and empirically addresses the fact that self-organized actions (competences) of a person always also necessarily involve value judgments (values) as a basis. 'It is to be noted that the theoretical parts of this study are impressive. The evaluation of literature and the differentiation of the presentation of the competence and value constructs deserve recognition. The work not only shows great diligence, it also has pioneering character and is innovative.' Prof. Dr. Rudolf Tippelt (retired) The author presents in his work the scientific constructs of competences and values in a clear and concise manner. There is probably no other academic book that analyzes and combines the current research and literature on values and competences in this comprehensive and impressive way. Notably, he systematically links the state of research in value research with the current competence research. In doing so, he deals with pedagogical, sociological, and system-theoretical aspects and develops a comprehensive picture that systematically takes up the value- and competence-oriented approaches of John Erpenbeck. Therefore, the work should become standard literature for education experts in all areas. – Werner Sauter, on: socialnet and WernerSauter.com.

Habitual Changes in Counseling Competence through Coaching Education: A Qualitative Investigation ¤ Through qualitative interviews with trainers and trainers in the second phase of teacher training, the author deals with the pedagogically and religiously pedagogically interesting and current topic of professional counseling practice. She tries to answer the question with the present study, to what extent the professional habitus in terms of conversation leadership competences, feedback culture and attitude expressions of trainers and trainers in the core seminar, who are also active as subject leaders and subject leaders for the subjects Evangelical and Catholic Religious Education, is changed through a successfully completed coaching education in terms of implementation in everyday counseling situations in the professional context. The interview evaluations show that the professional action in the field of counseling is improved through this coaching education in the subjective perception and subjective experience of the interviewed persons and significantly contributes to professionalization. This can be differentiated and concretely shown by branching into the fields of 'counseling competence', 'lesson review', 'personal image assumptions' and 'ambivalence of grading and counseling'.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153261-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124581-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4202020-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035093-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148114-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047376-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138623-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130081-6>
Automatisierungsprozesse in der mündlichen L2-Produktionen unter Berücksichtigung von lehr- und lernkulturellen Faktoren : an empirical investigation into university German as a foreign language instruction in Ukraine ¤ The topic of this dissertation deals with automation processes in L2 oral production, taking into account cultural factors of teaching and learning. In the theoretical part of the work, the question of the feasibility of rule- and example-based automation concepts in Ukrainian teaching and learning culture on the macro level is raised. The empirical part of the work addresses the research question of whether example-based automation can be successfully implemented in Ukrainian university German as a foreign language instruction, and how it is perceived by Ukrainian teachers and students. The study relies on a qualitative and action research-based approach. It was found in the work that Ukrainian teaching and learning culture on the macro level can be described as „traditionally oriented“, and that rule-based automation is mainly applied. Furthermore, it was observed that example-based automation can only be partially successfully implemented, because teachers and the majority of students have a critical attitude towards the realized example-based automation exercises and reject them. The difficulties that arose in the form of negative attitudes and reactions of most respondents to example-based automation can be explained by the „traditional“ teaching and learning culture on the micro level. With this work, it was proven that there is a lack of learning cultural basis in the investigated context, so that innovative concepts like example-based automation can be successfully implemented. Innovation in Ukraine only has a chance if society, foreign language teaching and methodology change from traditional to modern orientations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018424-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0>
Ab-initio Investigations of the Adsorption and Desorption Mechanism of CO on a Titanium Dioxide Surface ¤ In this work, ab initio studies are presented to describe the laser-induced photodesorption of CO molecules from a rutile (110) surface. The modeling of the substrate surface is performed within the embedded cluster approach using a Ti9O18 cluster. In addition to the electronic ground state, electronically excited states relevant to photodesorption are investigated. Building on 1D studies considering the desorption coordinate Z, 2D potential energy surfaces are calculated considering additional degrees of freedom of the CO adsorbate. Based on the potential energy surfaces, quantum dynamical wave packet simulations of laser-induced photodesorption are presented considering the desorption coordinate Z and the polar angle theta. By means of a systematic analysis of the wave packet dynamics, the underlying photodesorption mechanism of CO molecules from the TiO2(110) surface is elucidated in this dissertation. <dt.>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142423-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045873-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013384-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174484-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185549-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127186-5>
Fundamental Investigations on the Process Understanding of Laser Beam Micro Welding of Metallic Foils ¤ For the process-safe application of laser beam micro welding in the industrial environment, knowledge of the process is of paramount importance. Therefore, the laser beam micro welding process is systematically characterized in the present work using metallic foils. During laser beam micro welding of metallic foils, the thermally induced distortion and the resulting crack formation impair the reproducible welding process. The free, unobstructed distortion increases exponentially with decreasing material thickness. Therefore, the distortion must be minimized by process control measures and an optimized clamping device. For this purpose, the influences on the distortion and the corresponding temperature fields are investigated, and rules for distortion-free processing are derived. These concern the design of the welding regime, the selection of focus diameter and Péclet number for the welding process, as well as the used beam profile. In addition, a new clamping concept for metallic foils achieves a minimized distortion between the joining partners. Due to process-related fluctuations and external influencing factors, the weld penetration depth varies and can lead to insufficient bonding of the joining partners. Therefore, through weldings are necessary for process-safe micro welding. The process window for through weldings, depending on the power and the feed rate, has therefore great importance for process control. The process window is determined by the process limits, which can be described in dependence on the aspect ratio and the relative power. Another process-limiting influence arises from the Humping effect, which impairs the bonding cross-section and the strength of the weld connection. Based on the model of Rayleigh-Plateau instability, the entry of the Humping effect can be estimated by the ratio of melt pool length to focus diameter. The comparison of various high-strength steels shows that the results obtained in micro welding can be transferred to the investigated steels. During the processing of the additionally characterized titanium and aluminum materials, the same process phenomena in the micro welding process can be observed, which occur at other values of the process parameters due to the differing thermomechanical properties.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4279520-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074024-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132413-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003892-0>
Cultural Integration and the Basic Law ¤ Integration has not dominated public debate since the so-called refugee crisis.

Evaluation of a new AI-based software for camera-supported markerless objective gait analysis of the forelimbs in dogs ¤ Recent studies in the field of objective gait analysis in animals are concerned with the exploration and applicability of deep learning systems for markerless, kinematic, camera-supported investigations. The use of kinematics in combination with kinetic investigations is currently considered the gold standard in objective gait analysis. Most often, marker-based methods are used for kinematic investigations. However, the use of markers has some disadvantages. Above all, the possible influence of the gait image by the fixation of the markers on the animal is a significant impairment of an adequate gait image analysis. The use of markerless systems is therefore a sensible step. Only the developments in the field of artificial intelligence, which enable the automatic capture of interesting anatomical points, promise a practicable application, as otherwise a time-, cost- and personnel-intensive labeling of all individual images of a recorded video is necessary for analysis.

Management Concepts in Humanitarian Aid: On the Relationship between Social Semantics and Organizational Structure ¤ Antonia Langhof works out a differentiated conceptual and theoretically-conceptual framework for sociological management research using a communication-theoretical approach. This enables the examination of the conditions and consequences of the resonance of management concepts in all their dimensions, from social discourse to organizational adaptation and implementation. On this basis, empirically grounded answers are developed to the question of what the resonance of management concepts in a social field such as humanitarian aid can be traced back to. Here, economic gain is not intended, and economization processes are observed skeptically or even rejected for moral and political reasons. Content Conditions and consequences of the social dissemination and organizational adaptation as well as implementation of management concepts Resonance of management logics from the economy in humanitarian aid and development cooperation Target groups Lecturers and students of organizational, development, work, and industry sociology as well as political science Experts in management in the field of humanitarian aid and development cooperation The author Dr. Antonia Langhof is a research assistant at the Institute for Sociology and at the L3S Research Center for Web Science at Leibniz University Hannover.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115744-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4438965-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037278-9>
Mobilities in Europe: Migration and Tourism on Crete and Cyprus in the Context of the European Border Regime ¤ Dr. Ramona Lenz earned her doctorate as a research assistant under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Gisela Welz at the Institute for Cultural Anthropology and European Ethnology of the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main. Migration and tourism are usually researched separately. Ramona Lenz, however, shows that highlighting connections between these two forms of mobility and their infrastructure provides important insights into the European border regime. Building on the so-called 'mobility turn', overlaps between migration and tourism are shown on various levels. The core of the book consists of the results of ethnographic research on Crete and Cyprus, which are discussed in the context of mobility possibilities and restrictions in Europe. The tourism sector as a labor market for migrants and the diverse use of tourist infrastructure are at the center. §§The book is aimed at lecturers and students of the social, cultural, and humanities sciences as well as at migrants, tourists, and all those who professionally deal with migration and/or tourism in Europe.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018406-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4212404-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123761-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002623-1>
Organization of Regulatory Administration : An Example of German and Intergovernmental Energy Administration ¤ This book contains a detailed examination of action forms and decision-making procedures of German and European regulatory actors in the energy internal market. Starting from the Federal Network Agency, the cooperation with other national regulatory authorities, the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the European Commission is particularly highlighted in terms of organization and procedure. Based on a scientific classification of practice instruments according to action forms, legal effects and intensity of legal protection, model types are developed that show the interplay of organizational forms and decision-making procedures in the European regulatory union. This book reveals tensions in the European energy internal market by not limiting itself to the establishment of legal inconsistencies in the regulatory union, but instead addresses current practice problems and anticipates future developments through the Fourth Energy Internal Market Package.

Effectiveness of Law as an Institutional Project: On the Cultural Embedding of a Legal Concept ¤ The present book attempts to bring the central question of all legal theories of effectiveness to a post-fundamentalist level of description: Instead of providing a final answer to the question of the 'ground of validity' of law, the author provides approaches to understanding what is necessary in order to speak of 'valid law' and what we mean when we speak of it. The study deals with the epistemic, cognitive, infrastructural, and psychological – and that means: non-legal – conditions of law and leads them to the two-part thesis that law must always be both infrastructurally embedded ( 'Institution') and related to a possible future ( 'Project'). This change of perspective leads to an opening up of philosophical questions of law for knowledge assets of other knowledge fields and away from a theory of law that is primarily focused on the self-images of the legal profession. This focuses too strongly on the demarcation of law from other social practices and too little on the structural prerequisites and implications of legal operations themselves. The author thus offers a new point of approach to getting closer to the answer to the central question of legal theory formation mentioned at the beginning.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126505-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005248-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124033-9>

Investigations on the Characterization of Influencing Factors on the Satisfaction of Veterinarians and Animal Keepers with the Ingelvac CircoFLEX® Vaccination against PCV-2 ¤ PCV-2, Ingelvac CircoFLEX®, telephone survey. - Porcine circovirus type II (PCV-2) is associated with various disease patterns. These have gained great importance in global pig production in recent years. A successful therapy for porcine circovirus diseases (PCVD) is not known, so that effective control can only be achieved through prophylaxis. In addition to optimizing management and hygiene measures, commercial vaccines have been available for some time or are in the process of being approved. In Germany, the application of the pig vaccine Ingelvac CircoFLEX® against PCV-2 (manufacturer Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica GmbH, Ingelheim) was used until the approval of the vaccine in February 2008, following an exemption permit in accordance with § 17 c of the Animal Disease Act (Animal Disease Act). The aim of this study was to characterize factors influencing the satisfaction of veterinarians and animal keepers with the vaccination based on telephone surveys. In addition, it should be evaluated to what extent the telephone survey as a sole research method is suitable for describing application constellations of a vaccine, the satisfaction of users with a vaccine ....	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026655-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4338655-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005227-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129186-4>
Insolvency Reversal of Instructional Performances under Insolvency Law ¤ In the law of insolvency avoidance, the treatment of three-person relationships proves to be particularly problematic. This work systematically presents the possibilities of avoidance in the instruction triangle in the insolvency of the instructing party and the instructed party. In doing so, the author intensively deals with the criteria for evaluating the remuneration of the transfer and deviates from case law and literature by arguing that in the insolvency of the instructed party, avoidance against the recipient of the transfer should only be allowed in analogous application of § 145 para. 2 InsO. In the context of the discussion of the competition questions in the case of double insolvency, she puts the BGH's proposed recourse to the value judgments of the law of unjust enrichment to the test. With the help of the criteria of the protection and preservation of objections and the appropriate distribution of insolvency risk, the author develops a reasonable solution for the insolvency avoidance in the instruction triangle.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167266-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142759-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/115379487X> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178627-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013019-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114026-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4414630-9>
Mittelstand 2.0 : Type-Dependent Utilization Potentials of Social Media in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises ¤ Theoretical and conceptual foundations of Social Media -- Typology of small and medium-sized enterprises based on the configuration theory -- Enterprise-type-specific compatibility and application scenarios of Social Media in the SME sector -- Empirical analysis of the utilization potentials of Social Media in small and medium-sized enterprises. Small and medium-sized enterprises increasingly integrate Social Media into their value creation activities. Based on a SME-specific analysis of compatibility and utilization potentials of Social Media, Johannes Krämer examines, on the basis of a configuration-theoretical approach, whether and in which types of small and medium-sized enterprises meaningful application scenarios for Social Media exist and which SME-specific features may conflict with these under certain circumstances. He analyzes in which entrepreneurial functions and processes Social Media can be usefully integrated and what effects this has on the effectiveness and efficiency of the various enterprise types. This provides strategic recommendations for the purpose-oriented use of Social Media in small and medium-sized enterprises.

The Country of Origin Principle and Possible Alternatives from an Economic Perspective ¤ Ein wesentliches Argument fu¨r und wider den Einsatz von Herkunftslandprinzipien als Instrumente des Abbaus regulatorischer »Handelshemmnisse« ist ein möglicher Systemwettbewerb zwischen den beteiligten Staaten. Einerseits werden infolge von Systemwettbewerb ähnlich positive Folgen wie von einem Wettbewerb auf Waren- und Dienstleistungsmärkten erwartet; auf der anderen Seite wird eine empfindliche Einbuße staatlicher Steuerungsfähigkeit bis hin zu einem schädlichen Deregulierungswettlauf befu¨rchtet. Die vorliegende Untersuchung versucht die tatsächlich zu beobachtenden Folgen von Systemwettbewerb in Referenzgebieten darzustellen und mit den Erwartungen bzw. Befu¨rchtungen an Systemwettbewerb abzugleichen. Es zeigt sich, dass die hochrangigen Erwartungen an Systemwettbewerb keinesfalls eingelöst werden können und dass auf der anderen Seite in der EU kein »race to the bottom« zu beobachten ist. Weiteres Ergebnis ist eine grundsätzliche Kritik an der systemwettbewerblichen Modellbildung. / »The Country of Origin Principle and Possible Alternatives from an Economic Perspective« -- The author deals with the process and the consequences of competition between states in the field of law (systems competition). In particular, he considers systems competition in the European Union in consequence of the so-called country of origin principle. Based on the observation of reference areas, he comes to the conclusion that the high expectations of economic theory with respect to the benefits of such competition are unwarranted. He primarily recommends improving the legislation at the national and supranational level.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7559176-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4537710-8>
Sequential Investment Decisions under Uncertainty ¤ Real investments are associated with a wide range of different decisions. These decisions are highly interdependent. The initial investment decision must take into account the possibility of being able to make subsequent decisions. This fact becomes particularly relevant when income from investment projects is expected to be received in the distant future, i.e., when there is a long time span between the initial investment decision and the sale of products. In this case, uncertainty about prices, demand, or the behavior of competitors and the possibility of reacting to it play an important role. The author deals with the sequential character of investment decisions under uncertainty. For this purpose, models are developed that are based on options price and game-theoretic findings and can thus include both uncertainty about prices and demand as well as the behavior of competitors in the analysis. From these models, numerous findings can be derived that are of significant importance for the further development of investment theory	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070864-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162244-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121202-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128461-6>
Covering numbers and image dimensions of some stochastic processes ¤ In the present work, the size of images of stochastic processes is investigated. In this, an attempt is made to represent the size of the image in dependence on the size of the index set of the process and a characteristic or property of the process. As size measures, covering numbers and entropy dimensions are used. Before dealing with the newly gained results, an overview is given of similar results regarding Hausdorff- and packing dimensions. Special attention is paid to the special time-continuous processes fractal Brownian motion and alpha-stable Lévy processes. In the considered index sets, convex sequences play a special role. Furthermore, time-discrete random sequences defined by independent random sizes are also considered.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186551-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057630-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4149932-3>
Norms as factual circumstances : the substantive law consideration of overriding mandatory provisions in applicable contract law ¤ With its judgment in the case of Nikiforidis, the ECJ confirmed in 2016 that in international contract law under Article 9 of the Rome I Regulation, only the overriding mandatory provisions of the forum state and the place of performance state are taken into account. However, overriding mandatory provisions of other origin can be taken into account within the applicable law of the contract as 'factual circumstances'. Alexander Kronenberg establishes the concept of this substantive law consideration on a broader foundation, which, in addition to an analysis of Article 9 of the Rome I Regulation, also takes into account the constitutional dimension. Furthermore, he examines to what extent the solutions of German case law to the pre-Rome I Regulation legal situation are transferable to the current law and develops a comprehensive concept of substantive law consideration of overriding mandatory provisions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048765-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4306645-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4248885-0>
The Public Justification of Political Action: On the Argumentation Rationality in Political Mass Communication ¤ How does politics justify its actions to the public, and how do mass media deal with these justifications? Based on considerations of the rationality of public political argumentation, the author develops a content-analytical instrument to empirically clarify this research question. Using over 10,000 coded statements from the press releases of the Bonn ministries and factions, as well as a parallel sample from television, radio, and daily newspapers, the question is pursued of what chances political argumentation efforts have in the mass media filter. The results provide, inter alia, answers to the question of how far the logic of mass media (balance, audience orientation, etc.) still allows for rational political argumentation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037875-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128597-9>
Influence of Integrated Reporting on Judgments and Decisions of Private Investors: Theoretical and Laboratory Experimental Insights ¤ In this book, the author deals with a still young development in the field of corporate communication, namely integrated reporting (Integrated Reporting, IR), on a theoretical and laboratory experimental level. While the theoretically critical discussion aims at evaluating a potential added value, the laboratory experiment, which was conducted at the Essen Laboratory for Experimental Economic Research, focuses on the judgments and decisions of private investors. The results of the analyses enrich the discourse in science and practice on the advantages of the IR reporting form.

Investigations on fuel-efficient and locally emission-free operation of parallel plug-in hybrid vehicles and design of corresponding predictive operating strategies ¤ Tobias Schürmann deals with the fuel-efficient and locally emission-free operation of plug-in hybrid vehicles. To identify the predictive information decisive for such an operation, he builds a simulation environment consisting of a microscopic traffic and a longitudinal dynamics simulation.

Empirical evidence on the relationship between proximity, the formation and performance of R&D collaborations and the influence of R&D policy ¤ The present work deals with the determinants of successful R&D collaborations and the influence of innovation policy on the emergence of these collaborations as well as the diffusion of results from these cooperative innovation activities. The conceptual basis of this work is the systemic approach to explaining the emergence of innovations. Despite the prominence of the innovation system approach in research and policy, a deeper understanding of the processes on the micro level is still lacking, particularly the interplay between the emergence of connections and the exchange of knowledge between actors. Furthermore, the approach has so far presented some methodological difficulties as well as conceptual ambiguities. For this reason, the focus of this work is on a detailed, empirical study of the emergence as well as the dynamic development of connections between innovative actors, the quality of connections in terms of knowledge transfer and output, and the possibilities of influence by policy. In order to illuminate these interrelations comprehensively, the work is divided into two main parts. In the first part, essential determinants are empirically investigated that explain the emergence or persistence of connections between innovative actors. Specifically, the dynamic development of bilateral, innovative collaborations and the impact of public funding on this are investigated. The second focus lies on the question of the success factors of research collaborations. The analysis focuses on the influence of regional proximity on the success of cooperation on the one hand. On the other hand, the influence of public research funding on the diffusion of results from research projects is investigated. Here, too, the focus is on the cognitive proximity between knowledge producers and users.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133767-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027089-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046514-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197034-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4236001-8>
Sovereignty of States and ius cogens: An Investigation into the Origin and Future Viability of the Two Concepts in International Law ¤ The book investigates the relationship between state sovereignty and ius cogens from an idea- and legal-historical perspective and aims to make the historical finding fruitful for the current debate on the constitutionalization of international law. While the concept of ius cogens is closely linked to the call for the constitutionalization of an international (legal) community in current international law, the concept of state sovereignty is seen as a haven of unilateralism and ruthless striving for autonomy. The author, on the other hand, represents a more differentiated view. He undertakes an idea-historical investigation of the origins of both concepts and comes to the finding that the concepts of state sovereignty and ius cogens are based on the same ancient Roman conceptions of ius publicum. He analyzes these ancient Roman thoughts and shows how they – for example in the form of the quod-omnes-tangit-formula – shaped conceptions of mandatory supranational law and „sovereign“ rule in the Middle Ages and Modernity. According to the author's opinion, there is no „birthday“ of state sovereignty in antiquity or the Middle Ages, but rather an intellectual evolution that can be followed from the common ancient origins to modern conceptions of ius cogens and state sovereignty. Against the background of this finding, the book argues that the two concepts can also be understood and harmonized with each other in current international law as an expression of the same „republican“ basic principle. However, the book makes it clear that an understanding mediated by historical analysis can at best serve as an inspiration for the future design of the law, but historical findings cannot serve as legal arguments.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068274-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132367-1>
Transcriptome analysis of preadult hypobiotic and non-hypobiotic L5 stages as well as in vitro studies on the sexual maturation of preadult larvae of the bovine lungworm Dictyocaulus viviparus ¤ Dictyocaulus viviparus, Differential gene transcription, Sexual maturation + Hypobiosis, Differential gene transcription, Sexual maturation. - The survival of the bovine lungworm Dictyocaulus viviparus, which belongs to the most important parasites of cattle, is ensured by a developmental inhibition that is triggered by low temperatures. This developmental inhibition is also known as hypobiosis. The first part of the thesis used a subtractive hybridization approach to compare the transcription profiles of hypobiotic and non-hypobiotic preadult larvae (L5hyp and L5). In the course of this, 75 representative ESTs (rESTs) were identified in the L5hyp population and 58 in the L5 population. The subsequent search for sequence identities revealed that 28 L5hyprESTs and 11 L5-rESTs showed homologies with known sequences, whereas 47 L5hyp- and 47 L5-rESTs showed no homologies with previously published results. The latter could potentially represent parasitic or even Dictyocaulus-specific genes. The differentially transcribed genes were predicted to be involved in nucleic acid synthesis, DNA binding, metabolism, and signal transduction. After the transcriptome analysis, the development of the parasite was further investigated in the normal direction to understand the sexual development, differentiation, and maturation of D. viviparus and its sex-specific genes. Since a study of the aforementioned aspects over a period of 45 days in the host was not possible, an in vitro cultivation method was first developed. Therefore, the second part of the thesis deals with the development of an in vitro cultivation method for L5, the investigation of growth and morphological as well as molecular changes during sexual maturation. The best cultivation result, considering growth, motility, and survival time, was achieved with RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with L-glutamine, 50% fetal calf serum, amphotericin B (0.25 mg/ml), penicillin (10,000 Units/ml), and streptomycin (10 mg/ml) incubated at 5% CO2 and 39ʿC.

Recidivism and Criminal Careers of Violent Offenders: Results of a Nationwide Recidivism Study ¤ The study deals with the issue of violence crime from an empirical perspective, which is also in the focus of public interest. The recidivism and criminal careers of approximately 75,000 violent offenders are examined, who, according to the Federal Central Register, were sentenced to an outpatient sanction or released from a stationary facility in the reference year in Germany. In the evaluation, various groups of violent offenses are formed and compared with each other and with non-violent offenders; also, different forms of recidivism are distinguished. The entire history of the offenders depicted in the register is taken into account, and the further development is followed over an individual recidivism period of four years. Recidivism and criminal careers are differentiated and analyzed using both bivariate and multivariate methods. Risk factors for future recidivism are determined. With the present volume, the series of publications of the Institute of Criminology of the Faculty of Law of the Georg-August University of Göttingen is opened. It wants to be a mirror of the scientific work of the Institute and a forum for significant research works in the field of criminology. This work was awarded the Faculty Prize of the Faculty of Law of the Georg-August University in July 2007.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157236-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129203-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050841-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034036-3>
Inequality, Participation, Exclusion : systematic beginnings of special education as pedagogical theory and practice ¤ Starting from the possibility and necessity of a pedagogical justification of special education on the one hand and its still unresolved pedagogical self-understanding on the other hand, the present work attempts to locate special education in the self-understanding of modern pedagogy as an independent theory and practice and to demonstrate it as pedagogy. Along the reconstruction of the treatment of the problem statements of equality and inequality as well as participation and exclusion in the works of Comenius, Rousseau and Pestalozzi, the problem statement of inclusion and exclusion is presented as a fundamental problem statement of modern pedagogy and as a general pedagogical problem statement of special education. The understanding and shaping of pedagogy as an independent theory and practice moves in the relationship of independence and recognition, legitimation and responsibility as well as pedagogical transformation and transformation of pedagogy.

Principles of Proper Equity Capitalization under GoB and IFRS: Derivatives on Own Shares and Structured Financial Instruments ¤ Christoph Schober undertakes an overarching systematic and normative examination of equity capitalization under GoB and IFRS. Based on developed principles of proper equity capitalization, which have not been sufficiently clarified under GoB or IFRS to date due to different reasons, the author derives accounting principles for derivatives on own shares and structured financial instruments, taking into account societal legal valuations. In contrast to the observable multiplicity of representations, particularly in IFRS accounting practice, this can achieve clear problem solutions for various case constellations. The content includes interpretation principles for filling gaps and interpreting indefinite legal terms capital segmentation principles and equity capitalization accounting for derivatives on own shares, including written options to sell shares of non-controlling shareholders and employee stock options accounting principles for structured financial instruments, such as CoCo-Bonds The target groups are lecturers and students of business administration with a focus on accounting and financing auditors, standard setters, and decision-makers in accounting The author Christoph Schober earned his doctorate as a research assistant at the chair for business administration and auditing under Prof. Dr. Jens Wüstemann at the University of Mannheim and is active as an auditor. .

Press Coverage of the "NSU Cell" from a Media Law Perspective: An Investigation into Personality Rights Infringements ¤ The press operates in the field of reporting in general within the tension field of constitutionally anchored fundamental rights of freedom of opinion, press freedom, and general personality rights. Particularly through press reports on suspected offenders and the predominantly negative pre-qualification, the personality rights of those affected can be significantly impaired. The spectacular and widely discussed case of the terrorist organization National Socialist Underground (NSU) is a particularly worthy of investigation example in this context, as special case constellations such as previous public searches and different groups of people affected by press reporting are present. The goal of the work is to investigate possible personality rights infringements through a factually and temporally limited press reporting on the NSU cell, which takes into account the special circumstances. Exemplarily, both positive and negative examples are taken from the periodic press products BILD, F.A.Z., DER SPIEGEL, and Freies Wort in the period of November 2011 to illustrate the individual legal problem areas. After a formal introduction, a description of the circumstances and background of the NSU cell, as well as explanations of the relevant press reporting, the work initially deals extensively with possible personality rights infringements of the main suspects Beate Zschäpe through image reporting, naming, and word reporting. On this basis, differences and peculiarities regarding possible personality rights infringements of the suspected supporters of the cell, such as Holger G., Andre E., and Ralf Wohlleben, are worked out. The subsequent passages deal with the special constellation of a possible post-mortem personality rights protection regarding the two deceased suspects Uwe Böhnhardt and Uwe Mundlos as well as the alleged victims of the NSU. Finally, the gained insights are summarized and critically evaluated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074661-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005709-4>

Explanation of "Mean Reversion" on International Stock Markets ¤ Despite decades of research on the validity of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), essential related questions are still unresolved. One of them is the existence and explanation of time-varying excess returns ("Time Varying Excess Returns", TVER), which are suspected of generating Mean Reversion (MR) - as a counter-hypothesis to the Random Walk Hypothesis - in the time series of security prices. -- Norbert Tolksdorf aims to comprehensively uncover the theoretical framework for time-varying excess returns and establish an inference space that allows Mean Reversion effects to be modeled in the context of expectation utility theory as well as in approaches to Behavioral Finance on international stock markets. On the other hand, the author pursues the goal of quantifying the scope and type of Mean Reversion by relying on a broad econometric toolset, as well as verifying the timing ability of the signals extracted from the specified inference space using the example of the DJGI World (Total Return Index) and uncovering the potential for intertemporal arbitrage. Implications for asset management and monetary policy are derived.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137411-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4380086-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4257200-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141736-7>
Performance Measurement in Nonprofit Organizations ¤ Introduction -- Background for Performance Measurement in Nonprofit Enterprises -- Idea and Development Stages of Performance Measurement -- The State of Performance Measurement in Nonprofit Organizations from an Empirical Perspective -- Performance Measurement from a Theoretical Perspective -- Summary and Outlook. Many private nonprofit organizations are today under greater pressure than ever to use their resources efficiently and effectively. In addition, a publicly visible representation of their performance capability is necessary. In this context, Performance Measurement as a reporting and control instrument for private nonprofit organizations gains importance. Dorothea Greiling deals with Performance Measurement in private nonprofit organizations from a descriptive, empirical, and theoretical perspective and develops an overview. She presents the results of two primary surveys on the state of Performance Measurement and operationalization of success in free public institutions of the health and social sector. In addition, the author discusses the possibilities and limitations of Performance Measurement and provides recommendations for improving the reporting of individual nonprofit organizations as well as the nonprofit sector as a whole.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167290-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124261-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4293729-2>
Crystallization of a UV-structurable Glass in the System Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 ¤ UV-structurable glasses expand the material palette of materials used in microsystem technology. Micro-mechanical components, such as grippers, sensors, and micro-drives with high aspect ratios in the micrometer range can be manufactured through the process of photostructuring of glass. In this work, the process flows for the crystallization of a UV-structurable glass in the system Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 are investigated. The relationships found in this process expand the existing scientific understanding of the complex physical and chemical processes occurring in this specific glass. In accordance with the requirement to set the redox system necessary for UV structuring in the starting glass, the first part of the work briefly addresses the successful production of the glass melted in a small-scale plant. The main part of this work deals with the solution of still open questions about the mechanism of heterogeneous, UV radiation-supported formation of crystal nuclei. Using various experimental methods, the processes during the technological individual steps of illumination, tempering, and etching were investigated. It was largely possible to clarify the effect of silver as a nucleus former and to define the exact illumination and thermal conditions for nucleus formation and crystal growth. In contrast to previously assumed findings, the silver ions are not only located in the droplet-like inhomogeneities of the glass, but are finely dispersed both in the matrix and in the droplets. Only in the droplets can the crystal phase lithium metasilicate grow on the silver clusters formed in the structuring process, since only here the chemical composition is suitable. The conditions found for the production of micro-structured components for nucleus formation and crystal growth are used as a prerequisite for the production of well-etchable crystal aggregates. By applying a multi-stage temperature regime with holding times at nucleus formation and crystal growth temperatures, industrially usable forceps were produced with high reproducibility and yield. Furthermore, the relationships found between illumination energy density, nucleus formation, and crystal growth conditions can be used to deliberately change the mechanical properties of photo-structured glass components. Defined illumination and special thermal post-treatment increased the bending strength of micro-structured components from about 340 to about 540 MPa.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4476622-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4372981-2>
Cost Pressure and Standard: On the Effects of Financial Constraints on the Standard of Social Insurance Benefits and the Liability-Related Treatment Standard ¤ The German healthcare system is increasingly characterized by resource scarcity. Despite numerous efforts to curb costs, it has not been possible in recent decades to address the growing discrepancy between what is medically feasible and what is actually financially feasible. The present writing addresses two of the central legal questions arising from resource scarcity and previously little clarified. The possibilities of rationing medical services are investigated and critically evaluated. Existing conflict-prone tensions between medical liability and social insurance law are highlighted and solutions sought. The aim of the study is to develop a constitutionally compliant approach to allocating scarce resources and to achieve harmonization of the various disciplines. The healthcare system suffers from resource scarcity, and the discrepancy between what is medically feasible and what is actually financially feasible is growing. The book deals with two of the central legal problem fields that arise from this: the possibilities of rationing medical services and the conflict lines between medical liability and social insurance law. The aim of the study is to develop a constitutionally compliant approach to allocating scarce resources and to achieve harmonization of the various disciplines.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7864471-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4247917-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038270-9>

Empirical Studies on the Evaluation of Quality Information in the Adoption of Continuous and Discontinuous Innovations ¤ Manuel Skrzypczak investigates in the framework of two empirical studies how varying product innovativeness affects product evaluation. The first study addresses the question of which quality information dominates quality assessment and purchase intention in the evaluation of continuous innovations through two experiments. The second study examines, with special consideration of emotional and cognitive information processing processes, through a deductive text analysis procedure based on online product reviews, how the quality assessment process differs between discontinuous and continuous innovations. Both studies provide implications for practitioners and researchers by evaluating the relative effect and processing of quality information within the product evaluation process depending on product innovativeness. The author After his studies in technical business administration, Manuel Skrzypczak worked as a research assistant at the Chair of Innovation and Service Management of Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Burr at the Institute of Business Administration of the University of Stuttgart. In the context of his research, he dealt with the adoption of product and business model innovations. Since 2020, he has been working as a consultant for programmatic advertising technologies at a globally operating technology company.

From Marx to Mole : Left Book Trade in West Germany in the 1970s ¤ From the upheavals of the 1968 years, numerous left publishers and bookstores emerged nationwide. With classics of Marxism and key texts of the student movement, they shaped the political culture of the old Federal Republic in the 1970s. Uwe Sonnenberg examines the origin, character, and change of this book trade. In doing so, the author focuses on the Association of the Left Book Trade (VLB), a little-known, hitherto unique association. Founded in 1970, it united party-independent, collectively operated publishers, printing houses, distributors, and delivery services. It occupied the concept and practice of this movement book trade and formed its own political-literary field and an independent economic sector. Nationwide, between 150 and 200 projects were engaged in the VLB. Sonnenberg shows how the literature, worldviews, and ways of thinking produced and distributed by left book trade companies shaped their producers and recipients.

Concept, Development, and Organization of a Web-Based Learning Environment for Engineering-Technical Education Using the Example of Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering ¤ In this work, a systematic and comprehensive process and procedure model for the development of web-based learning environments with a focus on engineering sciences is described. In this context, the conception, creation, processing, and management of learning objects are embedded in a database management system according to the LOM standard. The work can be assigned to the research on the subject area of fundamentals of electrical engineering on multimedia and web-based learning environments. Using the example of GETsoft, concrete problem statements for the implementation of components of a learning environment are shown and discipline-specific solution models are offered. The motivation and objectives, the assignment of the work and the procedure, as well as an analysis of completed preliminary work are presented in the first chapter. In addition to a comprehensive analysis of learning environments in engineering disciplines, the conception of an adaptable process and procedure model for the creation of a learning environment consisting of learning objects and components is the task of this work. The second chapter deals with the basics of web-based learning environments in the engineering sciences, e-learning standards, software development processes, and database technologies. Already in the basics chapter, the idea of a layer model for learning environments in combination with a special model of learning objects is developed. The third chapter analyzes the state of the art in the field of web-based learning environments in some engineering basic subjects using a criteria catalog. In detail, the current situation in the subjects physics, mathematics, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering is analyzed. In addition, a brief look is taken at chemistry and medicine as well as the international language area. The media-technical analysis and conception of an adaptable process and procedure model for the development of web-based learning environments is described in the fourth chapter. Evolutionary prototyping and object-oriented design are in the center of a procedure model for layer-based system and learning object development. The fifth chapter describes concrete implementations of the general concept using examples from GETsoft. The theory is transferred to practice through tangible implementations of media design concepts. The functional features and interfaces of the GETsoft database for standardized reusable learning objects and their metadata are a focus here. In chapter six, examples and approaches to transfer, networking, and expansion of GETsoft are presented. The last chapter presents considerations on success factors of learning environments, briefly discusses open knowledge resources as a future model, and incorporates ideas for the further development of GETsoft.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4464685-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4727098-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4410512-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113276-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137304-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167412-1>

Democratic Practice and Pragmatism: Participation and Representation on Federal and Berlin State Level ¤ The idea of a pragmatic conception of democracy -- Democratic innovations and their effects.- Problem- and solution-oriented establishment of democratic innovations on the Berlin state level.- Civic engagement: Challenges and engagement policy recommendations -- Chances of a pragmatically enlightened democracy policy. . Katrin Winkler shows on the example of the federal and Berlin state level, how the representative political process can be designed participatory and yet effective. The basis is a synthesis of the pragmatic democratic conception by Archon Fung and the empirical research program of the criterion-based evaluation of democratic innovations. In this context, democratic and engagement policy recommendations are developed.

Predictive Dynamic Load Control for an Electric Steel Mill ¤ This work deals with the development of an adaptive load control for electric steel mills. Such large consumers not only pay for the consumed electrical energy, but also for the fundamentally provided power. The agreed power contingent is monitored via quarter-hourly power average values. The operator's requirement is to exhaust the power contingent as far as possible while avoiding any overstepping. The latter is automated by so-called load control systems, which may discard load at the end of the quarter-hour interval if necessary. Previous load control systems do not take into account the special characteristics and the unusual division of electrical loads in the electric steel mill. Therefore, there is an optimization potential when operating such a conventional system, which is to be exploited by better integrating process-technical processes into the load control strategy. The central idea of the work to solve this task consists in the prognosis of the expected energy demand for the electric arc furnace, the ladle furnace, and the base load of the steel mill in the tariff-relevant quarter-hour intervals. For this purpose, corresponding mathematical models are developed. In addition, a modeling of the expected energy demand for the current melt is carried out for the electric arc furnace, and based on this, a prognosis of the remaining power flow time is performed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151974-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4356752-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4207718-7>
Fiber Bragg Grating Stabilized Semiconductor Lasers for Optical Telecommunication ¤ A fiber Bragg grating laser is a development of the Fabry-Pérot semiconductor laser: A semiconductor amplifier, which is provided with an anti-reflection coating on one side, is coupled to a fiber Bragg grating (periodic modulation of the refractive index in the core of the fiber) as a wavelength-selective mirror via an aperture adjustment, here a silicon lens. Due to the integration of the grating into a quartz glass fiber instead of a semiconductor material, this laser type is attractive due to its improved temperature stability of the reflection wavelength of the grating. The treated fiber Bragg laser should be able to be used in optical telecommunications for data transmission at 2.5 GBit/s at direct modulation, i.e. without an external modulator. However, within the reflection bandwidth of the grating, a shift of the laser line and a change in output power are shown when varying the operating temperature (inter alia). To get a grip on the element, investigations of the outgoing spectrum and output powers are carried out using the transfer matrix formalism and the rate equations, which are reflected, inter alia, in the complex current-power characteristic curves. From the considerations, two extended configurations can be derived: This is the wavelength-stabilized and the wavelength-switchable fiber Bragg laser. Based on this, a comprehensive concept for the numerical calculation of the properties of the fiber Bragg laser is presented	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4342586-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139556-6>
The Damaged Security : An Examination of the Tortious Dimensions of Tangible Credit Securities ¤ The work examines security damage and its compensability. The work is divided into two parts. Initially, the compensation of security damage is investigated using the means of §§ 249 ff. BGB. On the one hand, criteria are developed to determine the similarity and equivalence of two credit securities. On the other hand, it is shown that security damage can only be compensated to a limited extent in money. Finally, a mechanism is developed to coordinate the damage settlement in multi-person constellations. The second part of the work focuses on individual security institutions: namely, the real and movable mortgage rights, the security transfer, the property reservation, and their respective extensions. The results from the general first part are transferred and adapted to the respective particularities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4215396-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4051927-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4273137-9>
Fiber Bragg Gratings for High-Temperature Applications ¤ Within the scope of the dissertation, the properties of fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) in two special fibers were investigated under the aspect of high-temperature stability (>800°C). The gratings were generated using a frequency-doubled Ti:Sa-based femtosecond laser in a two-beam phase mask interferometer in one single-crystalline sapphire fiber and in the other in an alumosilicate glass core fiber. For the gratings in the sapphire fiber, experimental temperature stability up to approximately 1900°C was demonstrated. The second fiber was first converted using a novel approach from a sapphire rod surrounded by quartz glass. The resulting alumosilicate glass core fiber (AluSi-fiber with approximately 50 mol-% Al2O3 content in the fiber center) shows a temperature stability of the inscribed FBG up to 900°C. Both fibers were investigated with regard to their guiding properties and based on these results, the reflection properties of the generated fiber Bragg gratings were modeled. Although both fibers are extremely multimodal, the different refractive index profiles (step-index profile of the sapphire fiber, parabolic gradient index profile of the AluSi-fiber) lead to fundamentally different FBG characteristics. Correspondingly adapted evaluation algorithms were used to obtain the temperature-dependent Bragg wavelength shift of the FBG from the broadband reflection signal (sapphire fiber) and the equidistant multi-peak spectrum (AluSi-fiber). In this way, single-measurement and repeat accuracies of a few Kelvin were achieved for the FBG-based temperature measurements with both fiber types.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127953-0>
Middleware for Architecture-Driven Game Development: Optimization of Development Effort for Browser-Based MMOGs ¤ Game development is a comprehensive undertaking and involves a wide range of disciplines. This raises the question of redundancies, particularly in the field of software development. With a focus on the realization of browser-based massively multiplayer online games, architectural characteristics for the provision of typical communication infrastructures are identified in this work, which can be found in different approaches. Using a realized middleware, for the derivation and generic provision of an infrastructure, the effort for the development of a game idea can be reduced to concept-related, technology-independent elements. Using the COCOMO II cost model, seven game concepts are analyzed, statements on the development of effort are presented, and the possibility of avoiding effort in the realized middleware is demonstrated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4426067-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4010457-6>

Iran's Nuclear Discourse: A Subsystemic Analysis of Foreign Policy Preferences in Iranian Nuclear Diplomacy (2003-2015) ¤ The Iranian nuclear program is regularly at the center of international politics. Since 2003, the conflict has not only been the subject of international discussion, but also of internal debate in Iran. The 2015 nuclear agreement was preceded by years of conflict in the Islamic Republic. Tehran had to modify its diplomatic approach several times. Iranian position changes were often attributed to external pressure and targeted sanctions. Intra-political dynamics were often overlooked. This study begins here. It represents the first systematic collection of the Iranian nuclear discourse. The research approach is actor-centered and methodically uses procedures of content and topos analysis. Based on Persian primary sources, common argumentation patterns (topoi) and foreign policy preferences in the Iranian nuclear discourse are determined. The study deals with the internal discourse in Iran during the period of international negotiations, which took place between 2003 and 2015. How did the discourse affect the diplomatic approaches of Presidents Mohammad Khatami, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and Hassan Rohani? What role does the Supreme Leader play in Iranian nuclear policy, and how are nuclear policy decisions made in Iran? The subsystemic approach reveals nuclear policy preferences as influencing factors of foreign policy action in Iran.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116489-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073359-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003846-4>
A coarse solution of generalized semi-infinite optimization problems via robust analysis of marginal functions and global optimization ¤ This work is mainly concerned with theoretical investigations for determining coarse starting solutions for generalized semi-infinite optimization problems (GSIP) using global optimization methods. GSIP problems possess the property that the index set, which describes the constraints, is naturally countably infinite, like (SIP) but further dependent on the problem variables, i.e., the index set is a point-set mapping. Such problems are of very complex structure, while there are large classes of natural-scientific-technical and economic problems that can be modeled in (GSIP). In general, the admissible set of a (GSIP) is neither closed nor connected. The closedness of the admissible set is secured by the lower semicontinuity of the index mapping. Many authors make this assumption to derive numerical procedures for (GSIP). This work attempts to dispense with the lower semicontinuity of the index mapping for the first time. Under these weaker assumptions, the admissible set may not be closed and (GSIP) may not have a solution. Nevertheless, one can determine a generalized minimizer or a minimizing sequence for (GSIP). For this purpose, two numerical approaches are proposed. In the first approach, the admissible region of the (GSIP) is described by a (usual) parametric semi-infinite approximation problem. The marginal function of the parametric problem is an exact penalty function of the admissible region of the (GSIP). In the second approach, two penalty functions are presented. One uses the semi-infinite constraint directly as a 'Max' penalty term and the second is obtained by the 'lower level problem' of the (GSIP). In both approaches, we have to deal with non-smooth optimization problems. It is shown that the resulting penalty functions are upper-robust (i.e., not continuous) and thus stochastic global optimization methods are applicable here in principle. The main contribution of this work is the investigation of robustness properties of marginal functions and point-set mappings with certain structures. This can also be considered as an extension of the theory of robust analysis by Chew & Zheng. At the same time, it is shown that the known statements for semi-continuous mappings and functions can be transferred to the robustness concept with a few exceptions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137036-3>

In-vitro Susceptibility Testing of Bacterial Infection Agents against Two Drug Combinations for the Treatment of Ear Infections in Dogs and Cats ¤ Canine/ feline ear infections, antimicrobial drug combination, in-vitro susceptibility testing, canine/feline ear infections, combination of antimicrobial agents, in-vitro susceptibility testing. - Ear infections represent a common disease pattern in small animal practice. Otitis externa is a multifactorial inflammatory event in which various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi can be involved. Antimicrobial chemotherapy in the form of locally applied preparations is an important part of the treatment. Within the framework of the present work, two test collections of bacterial agents were examined for their in-vitro susceptibility to two antimicrobial drug combinations consisting of Framycetin/Sodium fusidate/Nystatin (F/S/N) and Framycetin/Diethanolamine fusidate/Nystatin (F/D/N) as well as the two single substances Fusidic acid and Framycetin. Since the antifungal agent Nystatin is known to have no effect against bacteria, a separate test was waived. The in-vitro susceptibility testing was performed using broth microdilution according to the specifications of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the drug combinations was tested in comparison to the MIC values of the single substances. The first test collection consisted of feline and canine bacteria, which were collected nationwide in Germany within the framework of the BfT-GermVet study 2004-2006. This test collection consisted of a total of 157 coagulase-positive Staphylococcus spp., 100 alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus spp., 91 Pasteurella multocida, 42 Bordetella bronchiseptica, 28 Escherichia coli, 30 Proteus spp. and 64 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The second test collection came from dogs and cats suffering from otitis externa, which were investigated, sampled and treated with one of three different combination preparations (F/S/N, F/D/N, SurolanÒ) within the framework of a clinical field study by the company Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica GmbH.

The Dioxin Contamination of Slaughter Cattle from a Pre-Weaning Use of Exposed Grassland after a Decontamination with Uncontaminated Feed ¤ Dioxin, dl-PCB, beef. - The use of dioxin-exposed grassland for feed production or in the form of grazing is associated with the risk of exceeding maximum levels in feed and food. Nevertheless, there are weighty reasons (e.g. flood protection) that speak in favor of further use of such exposed sites. If the production conditions (feed production, animal feeding and keeping) are adapted to the exposure, corresponding limits for feed and food can be met. In this work, it should be checked whether a special form of beef production, namely pre-weaning use, allows the use of dioxin-exposed grassland. The hypothesis underlying the concept investigated here was: If the potentially dioxin-contaminated feed is replaced by uncontaminated feed before slaughter, the dioxin contamination in the animal will decrease to such an extent that safe beef (dioxin content < maximum level) can be obtained. The low dioxin content in the carcass should be achieved in particular by a decontamination with uncontaminated feed in the last months before slaughter. Not least, there is also a certain relief through dioxin excretion with milk. For this purpose, a farm was selected whose grassland is particularly exposed (Elbe Valley). On this experimental farm, 51 calves (three groups: F I, F II, F III) were available for the field experiment, which initially received potentially dioxin-contaminated feed (milkweed growth (summer: grazing in the Elbe dike land) or contaminated silage (winter: stall-keeping)). In order to use the partly highly contaminated feed at all, an exemption permit was required. For a well-founded assessment of the dioxin contamination of site, feed and animals, various matrices were investigated for the content of dioxins (PCDD/F) and dioxin-like PCB (dl-PCB) using HRGC/HRMS (LAVES, Oldenburg). Soil samples (LUFA Nord-West, Hameln) from the grazing area (Elbdeichvorland) and the contaminated feed (grass or silage from the Elbdeichvorland) were also investigated. To ensure that only uncontaminated feed was used before slaughter, this was also investigated. From the calves, colostrum and milk samples, as well as muscle (single animal sample) and liver samples (pool sample) were taken after slaughter. The carcasses were provisionally seized until the results arrived and only released if no maximum level exceedances were present. Since the livers had to be discarded anyway (status risk operation), individual investigations could be dispensed with (only pool samples for cost reasons). In addition to the 51 calves that went through the concept, also...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4260561-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4158359-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124791-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153530-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019014-6>
Influence of 25-OHD3 in Combination with an Anion-Rich Diet on Gastrointestinal Calcium Absorption in Dairy Cows ¤ 25-OHD3, DCAD, Calcium. - Parturient paresis, both clinical and subclinical forms, is a frequent and economically significant disease in dairy cows. The cause of this disease is a disturbance of calcium homeostasis in the peripartal period. With the additional burden of the calcium balance with the onset of lactation, the calcium homeostasis is often not maintained. In a recent study, it was shown that the combined feeding of 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-OHD3) with a ration with DCAD values (Dietary Cation Anion Difference) of about -150 meq/kg TS led to a positive influence on the peripartal calcium homeostasis (WILKENS et al. 2012). This was attributed to an increased gastrointestinal calcium absorption, which could not be further investigated due to the experimental design. To investigate the importance of the pre-duodenal and gastrointestinal regions with regard to calcium absorption, further experiments were carried out within the framework of the present work. These were carried out on six dairy cows, which were equipped with a rumen fistula and a duodenal cannula. In three consecutive periods, different feeding strategies (control feed, feed with acidic salts, feed with acidic salts and 25-OHD3) with a duration of five weeks each were applied. Feces and urine were completely collected and the duodenal flow was determined based on a chrom-oxid marker. In addition, plasma and milk samples were taken at regular intervals. The results of the experiments show that supplementation of acidic salts in combination with 25-OHD3 led to an increased gastrointestinal absorption and retention of calcium and phosphorus. Furthermore, these animals showed increased values of inorganic ....	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147852-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4291733-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019014-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4354814-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169916-6>

Modeling Procedures for the Design of Complex Systems in Television Production: Operationalization of Systems Engineering for Digital Transformation in Television ¤ Introduction -- Research process and research methodology -- Challenges and overarching problem statements in television production -- Research area television production -- Technology-oriented modeling approaches for television production -- Process-oriented modeling approaches for television production -- Structure-oriented modeling approaches for television production -- Development of a modeling procedure for analysis and design in the complex overall system television production -- Description of a generic structure model for media production -- Conclusion. The production processes in television production are characterized by an overwhelming number of different variants. Various production forms, such as news, live events or fictional programming, require a diverse interplay of the functional areas of a television production company. For the optimization of the production processes, editorially guiding, administratively accompanying and technically executing processes must be closely linked in overarching, integrated production systems. Against the background of this complexity, a comprehensive view of all functional areas involved in the production and their integration into the production process is required. A comprehensive modeling procedure is presented, which is capable of promoting both overall consideration and detailed consideration. In addition, the application of the method is explained using practical examples. It is a proposal to operationalize the scientific approach of Systems Engineering with regard to problem statements in television production and to support the continuous optimization process.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127335-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4353072-2>
Private Equity in the German Midst: A Behaviorally Funded Examination of Demand-Side Usage Intention ¤ Why is private equity in Germany used so little, although it is often mentioned as a solution for many financing problems of mid-sized companies? Philipp Espel deals with the specific properties of mid-sized demand behavior towards financing instruments. He approaches the core question both theoretically and empirically, which factors influence mid-sized entrepreneurs positively or negatively in a decision to use private equity and how practice can react to it. In contrast to the often investigated supply-side aspects, the author chooses the demand-side perspective of the mid-sized entrepreneur. From a practitioner's point of view, the results provide approaches to enable better marketing of private equity offers in the mid-sized sector. From a theoretical point of view, the possibility is confirmed to identify additional influencing factors on the financing decision through individual-psychological approaches in the mid-sized context and to evaluate them through innovative measurement procedures. and Subject of the work -- Concept formation -- Theoretical foundation -- Derivation of the research model -- Survey design, sample, and method -- Results of the empirical investigation -- Implications and critical evaluation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200451-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031031-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144978-2>

Remote Work and Leadership: An Empirical Analysis of Leadership Requirements in Distributed Organizational Structures ¤ New forms of work and organization, such as telework, are currently receiving great interest not only in science, but also in practice. However, the actual dissemination of flexible work forms lags behind the technical possibilities. In particular, the attitude of the middle management level is seen as a hindrance, which is rated as skeptical due to new requirements and the associated changes in traditional leadership behavior. Within the framework of an empirical research concept on telework, these changes in the leadership function in organizations have been investigated. For the analysis of leadership phenomena under telework, theories were applied that have the self-leadership of employees as their subject and, in addition, integrate group-related leadership functions beyond a dyadic perspective. Problem-centered interviews were used as a methodological instrument, which were conducted with direct supervisors of teleworkers. The results of this study are intended to contribute to the scientific discussion and to facilitate the implementation of telework forms in business practice.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121761-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018776-7>

New Methods for Investigating Metabolic Processes using Spectroscopic and Imaging 17O-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ¤ Abstract: Tumors and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease exhibit an altered rate of oxygen metabolism CMRO2 (English: cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption).\\nThe goal of this work was therefore the localized CMRO2 quantification using dynamic 17O-MRI at a clinical field strength of 3 Tesla.\\nTo this end, a SNR-efficient dense 3D radial sequence was implemented for the acquisition of the rapidly decaying 17O signal (T2* ≈ 2 ms) and a homogeneous circularly polarized 17O head coil was built. For the administration and recovery of the expensive 17O gas, an air system was used.\\nFrom the fit of a pharmacokinetic model to the H217O concentration curves obtained from the time-resolved 3D 17O-MR data sets for large regions of gray and white brain matter, mean CMRO2 values of 1.17 ± 0.18 µmol/g/min and 0.90 ± 0.10 µmol/g/min were obtained. These values agree with rates from 15O-PET studies.\\nIn addition, the cellular glycolysis in the mouse brain with 17O-glucose and dynamic 17O-MRS at 9.4 Tesla was investigated for the first time. The glucose molecules (Glc-1, Glc-6 and Glc-1,6) were marked with 17O at the anomeric carbon atom C1 or at C6 or at both.\\nFor the acquisition of the time-resolved MR spectra after injection of a glucose bolus, a SNR-efficient surface coil was constructed, as well as a FID sequence (English: free induction decay) with very short echo and repetition times of TE = 62 µs and TR = 5.4 ms was used. The signal dynamics of the glucoseresonances 1-OH and 6-CH2OH could be qualitatively observed with the suppression of the dominant H217O resonance by a HLSVD algorithm (English: Hankel-Lanczos singular value decomposition) (SNR ≈ 4 - 5). The results of the exchange measurements of Glc-1 and Glc-6 solutions as well as the in vivo experiments show that the 17O marking in the 6-CH2OH group is exclusively glycolytically converted into the metabolic end product H217O, while 17O in the OH group at C1 is metabolized both by direct hydrolysis and by glycolysis.\\nFrom the CMRGlc model fit to the temporal course of the H217O concentrations (temporal resolution: 10.5 s), a value of 0.07 ± 0.02 µmol/g/min was extracted. This rate is in the same order of magnitude as a value measured with 18FDG-PET	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179227-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129732-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4290005-0>
Employee Participation in Occupational Safety Law: Prevention of Psychosocial Work Risks in German and Spanish Law ¤ Psychological burdens at the workplace are steadily increasing due to the challenges of the modern working world. Occupational safety law must respond to these challenges. Prevention without employee participation promises little success. This connection was already evident when creating the framework directive on occupational safety. However, the participatory rights in the member states are differently conceived. The author therefore examines the participatory rights of employees in Spanish and German law – two different systems with varying levels of participation – and analyzes how EU law can achieve effective effectiveness in the field of psychosocial work hazards.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002623-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114608-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176184-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112578-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127850-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138738-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002643-7>
Rauschhafte Vergemeinschaftungen : a study on the Rhineland street carnival ¤ Rauschhafte Vergemeinschaftungen are momentary, exuberant forms of sociability. That they form a fundamental figure of social coexistence and can be effective as a social bond is shown in this book by the example of the Rhineland carnival. The ethnographically exploratory study describes the carnival as an opportunity to set aside everyday rules and experience the extraordinary. Spatially and ritually framed, the fifth season creates an alternative reality and intense feelings of togetherness. The temporary state of exception on the Rhine does not, however, endanger social order, but rather confirms its necessity. The bustling chaos on the streets, dance and song in overcrowded pubs, and cheek-kissing and arm-wrestling jesters - this extravagant joy of life knows that Ash Wednesday is all over! If not now, then when?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034929-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177088-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077624-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4276473-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016674-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020015-2>
Decisive distinction : a differential-logical proposal for observing the success and failure of economic interaction ¤ BEGIN Basis: (Un-)Likelihood of successful interaction -- Perspective I: Organisation and external environment -- Worst Case: autistic organisations -- Best Case: empathetic organisations -- Perspective II: Organisation and internal environment -- Integration: Organisation in the tension between their environments Successful (economic) interaction is fundamentally likely at first glance; however, upon reflection, it is extremely conditional and therefore unlikely. Stephan G. Hans develops a differential-logical model of the organisation, which shows blind spots and resulting challenges from interaction failures to the Worst Case of the „autistic organisation“, but presents complementary design options and the Best Case of the „empathetic organisation“. The author integrates references to current case studies, and also presents a practical instrument with the approach of Distinction Maps, with the help of which organisations can analyse their relationships to their relevant environments.

Architects in the GDR: Reality and Self-Understanding of a Profession ¤ Planning and building in the GDR is primarily seen as »State Architecture«. The involved architects are, however, hardly noticed. They are often seen as mere executive organs of an overwhelming building policy. But what role did they really play? Tobias Zervosen asks about the self-understanding of this professional group, without losing sight of the importance of the political. He presents a comprehensive account of how the history of architecture in the GDR is also a history of the architects themselves: They shaped its course in various ways – whether on a political level, in concrete planning on site, or in theoretical debates. The book is „an engaging and thought-provoking study of the self-image of architects in an era of German history shaped by diverse internal and external constraints“ (literaturkritik.de)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054438-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002844-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069340-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>
Closed and Open Form in Drama ¤ From the foreword: This work is concerned with insights into the form of modern German drama in the 18th to 20th centuries. The survey of dramatic texts and the results of previous research suggest that two stylistic trends are opposed in German drama: the closed or tectonic form and the open or atectonic form. How do these two dramatic style types appear in all their features: in the shaping of the action, the time and space, the characters, the composition, the language? What is their relationship to each other?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012899-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157021-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172481-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0>
Phenomenology of Symbolic Experience : Phenomenological Interpretation of the Eranos View on Symbols from the Perspective of Fantasy Life ¤ This book explores the vast field of symbolic experience by following two basic questions: What is it that we experience? How do we get this experience? Related to the first question about the intentional object, the idea and structure of symbols in the writings of the Eranos Circle (especially Carl G. Jung, Adolf Portmann, Joseph Campbell, and Gilbert Durand) are explored. Based on that, the focus of reflection moves to the symbolizing consciousness, or, in other words, to the question of how to arrive at the symbolic experience. Although Husserl's analyses are followed, other phenomenologists such as Fink, Merleau-Ponty and Waldenfels are considered too. The main idea is that fantasy life, or rather the perceptive fantasy, constitutes the original access of consciousness to the symbol. Nevertheless, the appearance of the symbol is characterized as a Widerfahrnis or an experience of the alien, but within the fantasy world created by the image.

Strategic Risk Management for Distribution Network Operators in the Liberalized Energy Market: Theory and Practical Implications ¤ The hard competition conditions in the liberalized electricity/gas market lead to frequent insolvencies of energy suppliers (providers), which cause significant financial damage to numerous creditors. A great concern is shown by the distribution network operators, whose supplier relationship is based on special energy economic conditions and existing business management approaches to risk-aware design of the supplier relationship cannot be easily transferred. Kerstin Eiselbrecher develops a strategic risk management model that provides distribution network operators with a practical risk management process with action recommendations for early recognition/evaluation, handling, and monitoring of supplier risk from insolvencies and claims, taking into account the energy economic framework conditions and specifically selected risk factors. Through their central position in the supply chain of energy supply, their actions can also counteract the risk of further market partners connected with the suppliers. Dr. Kerstin Eiselbrecher completed her part-time doctorate under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Iris Hausladen at the Heinz Nixdorf Chair for IT-based Logistics at the HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management. She has extensive professional experience in the energy supply sector and has presented at conferences on the claims management of distribution network operators. Already during her studies at the Technical University of Munich, Germany, and the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, she focused on energy economic issues. Her scientific focus is on the combination of energy economic and business management elements as well as the connection of theory and practice.

By analyzing the causes and consequences of customer-side opportunism in service processes using the example of advisory services at a travel agency, Julia Weisser shows ways to solve the opportunism problem. In this context, the proposed effect of institutions 'deposit' and 'incentive system' in the New Institutional Economics is empirically tested for the first time. The author shows that neither deposits nor incentive systems can be considered in isolation, but must be integrated into a context that includes the characteristics of the service and the concrete design of the marketing instruments of the provider.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027208-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073328-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4272573-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125929-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133767-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173985-1>
The Classification of Design Protection in the Law of Design, Copyright, Trademark, and Patent: A Comparison of the Legal Situation in the USA with the Latest Developments on the European Level, with Particular Consideration of the Protection Granting in the EU Member States Germany, Italy, and France ¤ The author deals extensively with the latest developments in design protection and presents both the protection granting in the USA as well as the new European design protection in its material content. In addition, she compares the regulations of Germany, France, and Italy, which have been largely aligned with European law, with each other. For this purpose, the respective protection granting is presented critically through the law of design, copyright, and trademark, and to the extent significant, patent law. Due to the current relevance of the topic and the rapid change in the field of design protection, the work is of high topicality and great interest for both practitioners and scientists.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062127-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020564-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074580-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048835-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011510-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115712-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044884-8>
Sexual Abuse and Religiosity: When Women Break the Silence: An Empirical Study ¤ Sexual abuse damages the ability to trust - oneself, other people, and God. The study lets those affected speak for themselves. Women with experiences of abuse break the silence and report in interviews about their coping processes. Despite bad experiences with church-mediated Christianity, they are looking for religious meanings for their lives. The investigation describes these in condensed form and reflects them theologically. It becomes clear: theology and church are only credible when they take the suffering of the victims seriously and show solidarity with them.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018202-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126865-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049428-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4482283-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132300-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195461-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182004-6>

New Fluorescent Copolymers for Sensitive Detection Systems in Water ¤ The goal of this work was the synthesis and characterization of novel fluorescent copolymers for analytical detection in aqueous systems. The detection system should enable simple switching of fluorescence upon analyte binding „Off“ or displacement „On“. For this, the synthesis of a functionalized monomer was planned so that the fluorophore and analyte are located within the same monomeric unit in direct proximity to each other. Thus, upon recognition of the analyte by a recognition structure functionalized with a fluorescence quencher, the fluorophore and quencher should be forced into a given distance from each other and the fluorescence of the fluorophore should be efficiently quenched. Upon subsequent displacement of the recognition unit by a more strongly binding analyte, the fluorescence should be „switched on“ again. Another goal for the detection system was high solubility and fluorescence intensity in water. Since the application of such sensors is particularly in medicine and biology, e.g. for...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154826-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4010542-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4311374-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124928-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147264-0>
Reconciliation in Judaism : a religious-scientific perspective on the Jewish concept of reconciliation in relation to God, the neighbor, the other, and oneself ¤ Reconciliation becomes necessary from a Jewish perspective only when the individual person or group transgresses the prescribed order of life.

Risk Management in Associations: Modules of a Risk-Aware Association Leadership ¤ Introduction -- Theoretical Foundations of the Work -- On the Relevance of Risk Management in Associations -- Development Status of Risk Management in Associations – An Empirical Analysis -- Modules for Risk Management in the Context of Association-Specific Factors -- Conclusion and Outlook. The importance of risk management has increased significantly in recent years. Associations are also facing changed framework conditions and developments that require a structured perception and control of risks and opportunities. Since associations have not yet consistently utilized the possibilities of risk management, a change of mind is required in these organizations to be able to cope with new challenges. Astrid Heilmair develops a theoretical, empirically founded, and practice-oriented approach that supports associations in establishing and operationalizing risk management. The author also shows how, with the help of an association-specific opportunity and risk control, the strategic further development of the association can be strengthened. The presented models support associations in a risk-aware perception of their coverage obligation (association mission) taking into account the financial perspective and thus offer valuable recommendations for action for association management.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197428-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121590-4>
Strafverfolgung und die Cloud : strafprozessuale Ermächtigungsgrundlagen und deren völkerrechtliche Grenzen ¤ Cloud-Dienste sind im digitalen Zeitalter nicht mehr wegzudenken.

Water Management of Inland Waterways Based on a Model-Based Prediction of System Behavior ¤ This work deals with the application of a model-based predictive control procedure for the optimized management of inland waterways. The primary goal of water management is to ensure the safety and ease of navigation. This requires the observance of partly very restrictive limits for the local water level (shoals, passage height under bridges). In contrast to typical control engineering problems, the task of water management is not to maintain a setpoint for the water level, but to exploit the defined setpoint range by the water level limits for the implementation of additional management requirements (minimization of operating costs, hydropower utilization, flood protection, ecology). The procedure of model-based predictive control is particularly suitable for the considered application area, as the permissible range for the process variables is considered in a very direct way by means of constraints. The derivation of control decisions is carried out by solving an optimal control problem based on a model-based prediction of the future process behavior. In extension of existing optimization-based approaches to water management, a structured model based on the Saint-Venant equations is used to describe the process dynamics. For the numerical solution of this hyperbolic PDE, a finite volume method (Godunov method) is used. In the work, further implementation aspects such as the calibration of the process model, the determination of the current state, the efficient solution of the optimal control problem under real-time requirements, as well as the effects of direct consideration of economic criteria in the quality functional (e.g. pump costs) on the emerging management strategy are addressed. After extensive simulation tests, the developed predictive control procedure has been successfully used for the management of the Mittelland Canal and the Elbe-Seiten Canal since September 1998. A simulation study for three water retention levels of the Lower Mosel demonstrates the advantages of coordinated management of water retention levels compared to the use of local controllers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064821-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064700-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116383-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170297-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189260-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006758-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124996-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006761-0>
Everyday Life in the Urban Quarter: An Ethnographic Study of Urban Coexistence ¤ Nina Berding provides a dense ethnographic description of everyday practices in a diversity-shaped quarter in Düsseldorf. The author describes the routine actions of residents in everyday life and shows how urban society is actually capable of handling urban diversity. She points out that effective integration paradigms are often not formed from the lived experiences in urban everyday life, but through hegemonic discourses that repeatedly disrupt the intrinsic balance of everyday coexistence.

Lamettasyndrom ¤ In the 1980s, the fear that the forest would die off on a large scale due to the input of anthropogenic air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides triggered the largest environmental debate in the Federal Republic of Germany to date, which still has a multifaceted impact today. The first warnings that a forest die-off was imminent or already underway came from forestry science. Forestry scientists played an important expert role in the subsequent public debate, and a generously funded forest damage research developed. The objective of this work is to present and analyze the handling of forestry scientists and forestry science with the phenomenon of forest die-off and their role in the forest die-off debate. In view of the contentiousness and indefiniteness of forest die-off, a constructivist approach is chosen and forest die-off is considered as a 'scientific object'. As a basis for the investigation of the forestry science forest die-off discourse and the scientific descriptions of forest die-off, a qualitative content analysis of articles on forest damage in three German-language forestry specialist journals was used in this work. In addition, numerous further publications and materials flowed into the analysis. Since the scientific specialist debate cannot be considered in isolation from the public discussion, the thematization of forest die-off and forest damage research in the mass media, as well as the treatment of forest die-off in politics and the appearance of forestry scientists in policy advice were also analyzed ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117580-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155069-9>
Revelation in Signs and Words: Investigations into the Prehistory of John 6:1-25a and its Reception in the Bread of Life Discourse ¤ John 6 represents a climax and a summary of the theology of the fourth Gospel. Michael Labahn focuses on the two introductory miracle stories, the feeding of the 5000 and Jesus' walk on the sea. He investigates the role of this narrative section as an introduction to the Bread of Life discourse and concludes that the miracle sequence can be understood as a kind of prelude to the Bread of Life discourse. With the help of historical parallels, he illuminates this introductory sequence, in which Jesus acts in the power of God and presents the world with the alternative of faith or unbelief. Due to the subtle connection between the feeding of the 5000 and the Bread of Life discourse, one can see in the Bread of Life discourse a staging of the feeding miracle as a Johannine sign. The Bread of Life discourse unfolds as a communicative act the feeding miracle, as it should be seen by someone who has seen and understood the feeding as a sign of the Son of God. The narrator draws on a story from his community tradition, which Michael Labahn identifies on the basis of an analysis of the narrative structure. The root of this story can ultimately be traced back to the synoptic narrative text, which is shaped by the Easter faith and the memory of Jesus' meals with social and religious outcasts. The phenomenon of secondary orality is invoked as an explanation of the connection between the narrative differences. Thus, a history of successive retellings of the narrative sequence of feeding and walking on the sea can be recognized.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015950-4>
Transnational Care Workers in 24-Hour Care: Between Public (Un-)Visibility and Institutional (De-)Addressing ¤ Christiane Bomert examines the public articulation possibilities of marginalized political interests of migrant women who are employed in home care across Germany. On various discursive levels, the author highlights the tension field between independent claiming of interests and a welfare state and trade union practice of representation. In doing so, she addresses the increasing relevance of the care debate and connects it with a positioning of social work towards transnational care work. The content includes Transnationality in the context of care, gender, and social work Agency from a poststructuralist-feminist perspective Discursive visibility of Eastern European care workers Institutional support for collective organization The target groups are lecturers and students of education science (especially social pedagogy and social work), sociology, and political science Social work professionals as well as representatives of welfare associations and trade unions The author Christiane Bomert is a research assistant in the Department of Social Pedagogy at the University of Tübingen.

Between Contingency and Necessity: On the Role of Design in Contemporary Society ¤ Design is an omnipresent phenomenon of modern society. Design decisions determine the appearances of material and immaterial artifacts and influence the invisible patterns of relationships between heterogeneous entities of everyday life. In theoretical discussions, it is often overlooked that the human-object relationships shaped by design are embedded in deeper systemic contexts and that design as a discipline represents a specific reaction to the contingency problems of modern society. Sandra Groll takes these contexts into view from a systems- and form-theoretical perspective. 1. Introduction -- 2. Society and Design -- 3. The Design of Modernity -- 4.

The Application of Informant Rules in Combating International Cartels ¤ Content: In combating hard-core cartels, the use of informant rules is increasingly gaining importance: almost no cartel is uncovered today without insider information. In the age of global markets, cartels, however, usually operate independently of national borders and are thus regularly subject to the jurisdictions of several countries. The successful use of informant rules is often problematic in such cases for legal and practical reasons. The author first compares a variety of cartel law informant rules, presents their respective characteristics, and then shows how they can also be effectively applied across borders.

Feedback from the Perspective of Pupils in the German Class of the Upper Secondary Level: Longitudinal Analyses on the Differential Perception and Motivational Effect of Feedback ¤ The feedback from teachers is of high importance for the learning development of pupils. For an optimal support of the learning processes, it is important how pupils perceive and use the feedback. Based on theoretical offer-use models, the present book deals with the question of how pupils of the upper secondary level perceive the feedback from teachers in the German class differently and how this perception affects the development of motivation of the pupils. The findings from latent-change models provide insight into the stability and change of the perception of feedback over the course of a semester as well as into differences in the perception of feedback between pupils. Furthermore, the longitudinal analyses show the interplay between different dimensions of the quality of feedback and the development of learning motivation. The findings expand the research status on the perception of feedback as well as on the emergence of differential effects on motivation and provide a variety of suggestions for pedagogical practice.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022648-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178647-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011975-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074164-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040364-6>
The State of Education and Pedagogy in Human Rights in Colombia: An Alternative for Building Citizenship and Peace from School in Times of War ¤ BEGIN The main objective of the present research work is a systematic analysis of the situation of human rights education in Colombia from a pedagogical and educational science perspective. For this purpose, it is necessary to establish temporal reference points that were crucial for the development of the research questions of the work. These include, for example, the measures of the UN (United Nations) and their recommendations to Colombia for the introduction of political strategies, particularly in relation to the dissemination and protection of human and children's rights as well as the right to education. The analysis enables the observation of both the implementation of these strategies in schools and the education system as well as their development in Colombia as a whole. Specific examples from practice are used to present the results. It is necessary to understand the difficult reality and the general human rights situation in Colombia, but the research work does not focus on this topic. Rather, the reality of Colombia defines the challenges and demands that human rights education must face, such as gender and ethnic discrimination as well as illiteracy. The research work will try to identify the internal and external factors that affect educational and pedagogical experiences in connection with human rights education and change them. These factors are related to sociopolitical violence, but also to the demand of modern society for democratic and participatory values such as tolerance, respect, solidarity or freedom, which are expressed in international law, Colombian national law and education policy. The analysis of the human rights situation in Colombia includes not only the political and legal framework, but also pedagogical and educational practice. In this context, specific Colombian experiences are used. In addition, an experience from Germany is presented, by which the basic principles of human rights education are discussed in a social, economic, political and cultural context. School and pedagogy are of central importance for social change. Therefore, it is necessary to uncover how human rights are implemented in school curricula and to what extent changes in school have an impact on the collective understanding of human rights. The school actively participates in the education of pedagogical, cultural, axiological and cognitive conceptions. These are outlined in the curriculum and implemented in everyday school life. Based on the programs and projects carried out in Colombia and by identifying existing challenges and weaknesses of the reality in Colombia on the one hand and the required skills for human rights education on the other hand, innovative alternatives can be developed that meet the expectations of improved human rights education.

Management Ethics and Workplaces: A Metaphysical and Moral-Economic Analysis ¤ Christoph Wagner conducts a management-ethical analysis of situation constellations in the context of the creation, maintenance, and abolition of workplaces. His metaphysical, micro-analytical approach to reality allows for the objective polydimensionality of empirical reality in companies to be grasped and thus to counter the danger of unjustified abstractions in the direction of the Economic or Moral Point of View. The author develops a differentiated moral-economic analysis framework for responsible workplace management from a business and ethical perspective. The content includes: Guidelines for Business Metaphysics The workplace as an object of analysis Normative ethics theories as content guidelines for management ethics From a management-ethical perspective, relevant areas in personnel management Management ethics: macro- vs. micro-approach Management-ethical analysis of various measures in the fields of personnel development and release on the basis of several distinction criteria The target groups are lecturers and students of economics and social sciences, especially business ethics and business administration with a focus on leadership and HRM Practitioners in the fields of management, personnel, and organization, management and personnel consulting, employer and employee representation The author Christoph Wagner is a research assistant at the Chair of Business Ethics of Prof. Dr. Michael Schramm at the University of Hohenheim Guidelines for Business Metaphysics -- The workplace as an object of analysis -- Normative ethics theories as content guidelines for management ethics -- From a management-ethical perspective, relevant areas in personnel management -- Management ethics: macro- vs. micro-approach -- Management-ethical analysis of various measures in the fields of personnel development and release on the basis of several distinction criteria	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045269-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4202404-3>
Paths to Responsible Organization : The Significance of Ethical and Theological Perspective for the Quality of Organizational and Personnel Development ¤ Organizational and personnel development is not a value-neutral method, but, equipped with an ethical perspective, it contributes to promoting the responsibility of decision-makers in an organization and, in this sense, making the organization a "responsible" organization vis-à-vis its members and the environment. In the context of the Church organization, a theological perspective is established from the theology of the Second Vatican Council, which fundamentally differs from traditional power- and expert-oriented change approaches and helps the Church to a credible and convincing way out of the current crisis	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121465-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121094-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126887-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4202404-3>
A Contribution to the Optimization of Knowledge Transfer in Single-Item Production ¤ Knowledge is increasingly becoming the most important resource for companies. In particular, in single-item production, the knowledge of experienced employees represents a critical success potential for maintaining competitiveness and building and expanding competitive advantages. Due to the characteristic properties of single-item production, such as little detailed work instructions, large work contents, and a high complexity of products and processes, extensive specialized and experiential knowledge is necessary for the quality- and goal-oriented implementation of work operations. To maintain this important resource in single-item production and to reduce the risk of knowledge loss when experienced employees leave, efficient solutions need to be established. However, conventional methods for knowledge transfer are not suitable for this purpose due to the characteristic properties of single-item production and the lack of consideration of the complex knowledge structure of experienced employees for regulating work operations in single-item production. Therefore, a method is developed in this work that enables the knowledge contents of the complex knowledge structures of experienced employees to be lifted and transferred to young employees for successful operation implementation in single-item production. To this end, the relationship between the knowledge of the experienced employee and their actions in the work process is first worked out based on work psychological theories of action regulation. Based on these findings, the requirements for the method are defined, as well as a general reference method for use in single-item production is developed. Subsequently, a specific method adapted to the field of application is developed and applied in a systematically guided participatory procedure with employees of the steam turbine production of Siemens AG at the Mülheim location. The multifaceted effectiveness of the developed method for the applying employees, the learning process, and the organization as a whole through the successful transfer of the specialized and experiential knowledge of experienced employees could be confirmed by the results of the pre-trials and expert interviews.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013967-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031370-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4561842-2>
Appropriateness and Taxation : Hidden Income Use by Capital Companies in International Comparison ¤ The hidden distribution of profits is a tax corrective for inappropriate relationships between capital companies and their shareholders. Even after decades of discussion, the conditions and standards of tax appropriateness control are still being fought over in Germany.

Comprehensive Evaluation of Modular Carrier Concepts: A Lifecycle Consideration ¤ Systematization of carrier types -- Concept development for modular carriers -- Process analysis of the carrier lifecycle -- Development and application of a comprehensive evaluation model. Antje Rosenthal has developed a comprehensive evaluation model that includes all costs and revenues incurred during the creation, use, and disposal of the carrier in the determination of the so-called lifecycle costs. The author shows that the modular design of carriers by using and reusing standardized components can make a significant contribution to reducing and avoiding complexity and associated costs. The higher the degree of reuse of components and modules, the higher the potential for cost savings. With the help of the model, decision-making between a special and a modular carrier concept can also be supported in order to evaluate the additional costs of a modular product structure of a carrier concept.

The Applicability and Enforceability of Union Fundamental Rights in EU Military Operations: An Examination Based on the EU NAVFOR Somalia Operation of the EU (ATALANTA) ¤ The EU is involved in numerous civil and military missions worldwide. At least since the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (CFR) has acquired legal bindingness, the question arises as to who is particularly responsible for the observance of human rights in military operations and how this responsibility can be enforced. This extremely complex question, which affects both international and EU law aspects, is examined in all its ramifications: the binding of the EU and its member states to fundamental rights within the framework of the GASP (Article 51 CFR), the extraterritorial applicability of the CFR, the problem of 'multiple binding' (CFR, ECHR and national constitutions), the legal enforceability of fundamental rights protection. The findings gained are subjected to a practical test by applying them to a case that occurred during the Atalanta operation (pirate suppression off the Horn of Africa).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4267736-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4472329-5>
Lorentz Force Anemometry of weakly conductive fluids ¤ Lorentz force anemometry represents a novel, contactless measurement method for determining flow rates or fluid velocities of electrically conductive fluids. The flowing fluid generates a Lorentz force in conjunction with an external magnetic field, which is measured contactlessly by a force measurement system. In contrast to other flow measurement methods, the fluids can be hot, chemically aggressive, and opaque. The Lorentz force, which is caused by weakly conductive fluids, such as electrolytes, in magnetic interaction, is in the order of a few micronewtons. The particular challenge lies in the fact that the magnet system attached to the force measurement system, which generates the required magnetic field, has a weight force of several Newtons. The focus of the present work lies in the development and investigation of a force measurement system based on the compensation principle. Here, the measured Lorentz force is compensated by an electromagnetically proportional counterforce. A calibration system is developed for characterizing and calibrating the force measurement system, which is based on the principle of electromagnetic force generation. The measurement properties and the measurement uncertainty of the calibration system are mainly determined by the orientation of the coil to the top magnet and the coil current. The calibration system enables a force generation that is independent of the Earth's acceleration. This represents a decisive advantage over calibration with weight pieces. The investigations on flow measurement using the Lorentz force anemometer based on the developed force measurement system are carried out with seawater. This model fluid is transparent and liquid at room temperature, so various commercial reference measurement systems can be used to determine the flow rate. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity of the fluid can be varied by the salt concentration. It is proven that the measured Lorentz force is proportional to the fluid velocity and the electrical conductivity of the fluid. Essential influencing factors on the measured Lorentz force are the inclination and the vibration of the measurement setup.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142400-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151826-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032716-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4296739-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129610-2>
Active Data- and Model-Based Sensor Positioning for 3-D Measurement ¤ In the field of three-dimensional object reconstruction and inspection, view planning is one of the central problems. It allows the determination of suitable sensor parameters to capture a measurement object accurately and completely with a few views. This results in shorter view plans, which lead to more accurate and complete reconstructions. Traditional methods for view planning, the determination of the best next view (Next Best View, NBV), either strive for maximum completeness or minimization of uncertainty. In contrast, the model-based multi-step planning presented in this work, considering the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue of the estimated measurement uncertainty (so-called extended E-criterion), allows for the simultaneous optimization of completeness and accuracy. To this end, the sensor used must be modeled exactly and its characteristic measurement uncertainty must be determined experimentally.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4150634-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7704418-6>
Comparative Constitutional Justice ¤ Stefan Martini untersucht, wie und warum Verfassungsgerichte in ihren Entscheidungsbegründungen vergleichend argumentieren, und liefert Begründungen für diese global zu beobachtende Praxis. Eingehend werden die ersten sechs Jahrzehnte der Rechtsprechung des Bundesverfassungsgerichts auf diese Argumentationsfigur hin quantitativ wie qualitativ analysiert. Dagegen wird die aktive Rechtsvergleichung des vom Common Law geprägten Südafrikanischen Verfassungsgerichts gehalten. Als Erklärung für den Status der Rechtsvergleichung in der jeweiligen Verfassungsrechtsprechung dienen die Offenheit des Verfassungsrechts, die »Einstellung« der konkreten Verfassungsordnung zu externen Rechtskontexten und die exogenen Effekte eines transnationalen Feldes der Rechtskommunikation. Unter diesen Bedingungen fügt sich vergleichende Argumentation legitim in überkommene Suchbewegungen des Rechts nach Rationalität, Konsens und Autorität ein. / »Comparative Constitutional Justice« -- How and why do constitutional courts reason comparatively? To find out, the jurisprudence of the German and South African Constitutional Court are analyzed in depth empirically. It is also shown that transnational developments open up traditional reasoning notwithstanding national attitudes. Comparative reasoning can accordingly be legitimately incorporated into accepted strategies to augment judicial reasoning to appeal to rationality, consensus and authority.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062801-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115712-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115710-2>
Paths to Good Bureaucracy: Explanatory Approaches and Evidence for the Performance of Public Administrations ¤ Germany is in the age of permanent administrative reform. Never before have the administrative apparatuses of the states been restructured as quickly and fundamentally as they are today. And never before have the directions of the reforms been more contradictory. Both can be justified by the lack of scientifically sound answers to the question of the characteristics of a high-performing administration. This question is taken up here: By integrating discussed approaches from the literature, a holistic causal model of bureaucratic performance is developed, which includes environmental factors, agency type, and leadership culture and discusses their effect on the rule of law, service quality, and employee satisfaction. The test of the model in the German administrative federalism shows that agency type and, in particular, the leadership culture of superiors have a significant impact on the reported rule of law, service quality, and job satisfaction from the authorities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063353-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7730862-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167290-2>
Measuring Therapeutic Relationships in Group Psychotherapies: The German Version of the Group Questionnaire ¤ BEGIN The aim of this work was the examination of the psychometric properties of the German version of the Group Questionnaire (GQ; Krogel, 2009). The Group Questionnaire (GQ-D; Bormann, Burlingame & Strauß, 2009) is a self-report instrument consisting of 30 items, which enables clinicians to capture helpful aspects of relationships within groups in an economical way. Thus, due to the brevity of the questionnaire, the cohesion of the group, the quality of the working relationship, and negative relationship aspects can be tracked over the course of a group therapy. Another advantage of the GQ-D lies in the differentiation and capture of the aforementioned relationship aspects on three different levels of relationship (group members, group leaders, and total group). After examining the dimensional factor structure of the GQ-D on the dataset of a multicenter study (N=438; Bormann & Strauß, 2007) using structural equation models, the validation of the GQ-D was carried out on a new dataset, which included 63 inpatient groups (N=424), using established process measures.

Freiwilliges Verhalten am Arbeitsplatz : the importance of competences for Organizational Citizenship Behavior ¤ Introduction -- Theoretically-conceptual framework -- Methodology -- Results -- Discussion -- Conclusion. In the context of changing work environments and the resulting demands, Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB) holds a special position for organizations. OCB research shows that the effectiveness of an organization can be positively promoted by OCB. Against this background, it is necessary to examine the antecedents of OCB. The focus of the work lies in answering the question of how the competences of employees are related to their voluntary behavior at work. This work is based on the assumption that more capable employees help or support other employees. Furthermore, empowerment will also be addressed as a moderating variable in this context. The author Dr. Saskia Hohagen is a research assistant at the Chair of Work, Personnel and Leadership at the Institute of Industrial Engineering at Ruhr University Bochum and was promoted by Prof. Dr. Uta Wilkens.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4474644-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4285859-8>
Smart Contracts Between Automation and Consumer Protection ¤ The discussion around so-called Smart Contracts has gained momentum, particularly in the wake of increasing familiarity with Blockchain technology. However, in light of the seemingly limitless potential of this technology, the risks associated with the automation of contract terms, which can be particularly relevant for consumers, are often overlooked. In one of the first monographs on this topic, the author examines the essential challenges posed by the potential use of Smart Contracts in mass transactions with consumers. The author considers the specific risks associated with the automated execution of contract terms for consumers, as well as the legal limits of Smart Contracts. On this basis, he develops recommendations to the legislator for the future handling of Smart Contracts in the consumer context.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003957-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7527895-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117338-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1210937344> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4246789-5>

Crowd Work and Platform Economy: A Labor Law Case Study ¤ This paper addresses the question of whether crowd workers on microtask platforms should be classified as employees. For years, this has been disputed from the perspective of labor law, but with a certain tendency to deny it. However, the BAG ruled in December 2020 that a crowd worker can be an employee by and large. So how are the circumstances to be assessed that make a crowd worker an employee (or non-employee)? That is what this paper investigates. In the first part of the paper, we review various empirical studies on crowd work and analyze the functioning of platforms. Economic and organizational sociology are also considered. In the second part, concrete case analyses from a self-experiment are presented in order to be able to evaluate them in terms of labor law. In the third part, two aspects are opened up, firstly, how the divergence between the national and the European legal concept of employee is again revealed in crowd work. On the other hand, new forms of regulation are suggested: For example, does Regulation P2B Regulation (2019/1150) not fit many of the problems of platform work? What about its applicability to platform work? What about "regulation by design"? Finally, it must be considered, how labor law can cope with new forms of work and, above all, forms of new organizational methods.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002769-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1217543651>
The Professionalization of German EU Journalism: Expertization, Staging, and Institutionalization of the European Dimension in German Journalism ¤ The European Union has gained increasing political significance since its founding. As a result, EU reporting in German mass media has become more comprehensive, but themes, actors, and evaluations are still shaped by the national state. This situation is the starting point for the question of the working conditions of those who, as producers of EU reporting, shape the image we receive of the EU and Europe. Anke Offerhaus examines the professionalization of German journalism as the development of a specialized profession segment, EU journalism, which is characterized by corresponding professional and organizational structures as well as specialized profession bearers. Against the background of a sociological approach to professions, structural changes in journalistic training and professional organizations are also the subject of analysis, as are changes in the work and working conditions of EU journalists from a theoretical perspective of action.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005709-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028779-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047376-4>
Supply Chain Sourcing : Concept and Design of Synergies through Multi-Stage Procurement Management ¤ Supply Chain Management is a holistic approach to end-customer-oriented alignment of inter-company flows of goods, finance, and information. However, the optimization of procurement from the Supply Chain perspective has played only a subordinate role so far. With the concept of Supply Chain Sourcing, Georg Mohr develops an approach to organizing procurement in multi-stage value chains at fragmented demand structures. Distributed demands in Supply Chains can be brought together through suitable business process models and thus contribute to the realization of significant cost-saving potentials. Through a cross-industry study, existing models in the industry are identified, analyzed, and conceptually further developed.

From the Absolute Poem to the Aporia of Modernity: Studies on the Concept of Literature in the Federal Republic of Germany of the 1950s ¤ The study deals with the concept of literature, which from the end of the 1940s to the beginning of the 1960s is explicitly or implicitly assumed as the basis of literary communication in the literary public of the Federal Republic of Germany, based on three exemplary case studies. Gottfried Benn's "Transcendence of Creative Lust" and Hans Magnus Enzensberger's reflection on the "Aporia of the Avant-garde" form - in confrontation and continuity - the horizon of this time span, before the effort of "young German literature" to join the literary modernity finally receives its historical and theoretical contours. The selected time frame coincides socially with the epochal concept of "1950s", politically with the concept of the Adenauer era (1949-1963). Historically, it is the time when the Group 47 gradually moved to the center of the literary public and finally set new literary standards. The interest in knowledge focuses on the normative concept of literature of the author, i.e. on artistic conceptions and intentions, the functional determination of literature, and the conceptions of the role of the writer. These dimensions are developed based on theoretical and programmatic statements of the authors - not based on literary works. Gottfried Benn, the young authors around Hans Werner Richter, and finally Hans Magnus Enzensberger represent three generations of writers. Benn's artistry is of paradigmatic importance for the development of the concept of literature in the 1950s; with it, the other authors have dealt with it to varying intensities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046449-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039827-4>
On the Autonomy of Union Agencies: An Investigation of the Energy Agency ACER and its Participation in the Adoption of Tertiary Union Law ¤ In 2011, the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, abbreviated as ACER, began its work. Due to the lack of provisions in European primary law, it remains unclear to this day how the relationship between an agency and the member states and the Union institutions should be designed. There is a need for clarification regarding control and legitimacy. This applies particularly to ACER. As a precursor to a European regulatory authority, it has significant powers. The agency is involved, among other things, in the adoption of binding tertiary Union law in the form of so-called network codes. In certain cases, it regulates cross-border infrastructure. The investigation addresses the question of whether the establishment and operation of ACER are legally permissible. The development of legal boundary-drawing is decisive in this regard, with the legal institution of the so-called institutional balance in the shaping of the Meroni decisions of the European Court of Justice from 1958 being of particular importance.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4218735-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186820-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4384593-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071013-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4480144-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003974-2>
Conditions for Success of School Reform: Historical Educational Findings as a Key to Pedagogical Understanding of School Development Processes and as an Extension of the Theories of School Reform ¤ Historical educational research and school development research have a comparable research interest in school reform processes, but have not been in scientific dialogue so far. Nevertheless, almost all practices of current school and teaching development already existed in the school reform processes of historical reform pedagogy. Based on eleven historical and pedagogical studies of source materials, a structure and action model of successful school reform processes is developed, which is derived from the actor-related logic of pedagogically practical reform processes. The studies analyze the reform practices at historical reform schools of the 20th century in a case-oriented and source-based manner and provide in-depth insights into historical school (reform) practice. The point of reference is always the individual school as a pedagogical unit of action. The historically empirically developed „Five-plus-two-K-structure of successful school reform processes“ was checked at 100 current reform schools and could be validated as recurring in a period of around one hundred years. The findings contribute to the pedagogical understanding of school reform processes and form a profession-related reference for theory formation within school development research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126892-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115719-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4735179-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006672-1>
Regulation Topology for R-744 Heat Pumps in Vehicles ¤ The book provides an introduction to the regulation of cold vapor processes using the example of vehicles. The derived, generic control concept can be applied to a large class of regulation problems in refrigerant circuit systems. In addition to a detailed path analysis, particular emphasis is placed on the reusability and universal application of the developed control loops. Author Sven Twenhövel currently works in the research and development department of a large German automobile manufacturer in the field of pre- and series development of innovative interior climate control and thermal management concepts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165435-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073757-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162985-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064195-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7725954-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031177-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177447-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031648-8>
Investigation of Yersinia enterocolitica Infections during the Piglet Rearing Phase ¤ Yersinia enterocolitica, piglets, sow. - Yersiniosis is the fourth most common foodborne zoonosis in Germany and the EU, after Campylobacteriosis, Salmonellosis, and EHEC infections, and is primarily caused by Y. enterocolitica. Human infections in Europe are mainly caused by virulent strains of serotypes O:3, O:5,27, and O:9, and contaminated food, especially undercooked pork, is considered the main source of infection. Pigs are the primary reservoir of the pathogen. In these usually asymptomatic carriers, isolation is primarily from tonsils and intestines. The epidemiology of Y. enterocolitica is complex, and despite intensive studies on the presence of the pathogen in pig herds, the potential spread and contamination routes, knowledge of the course of the infection is still incomplete. For the introduction of preventive measures, knowledge of the time of infection is of particular interest. For this purpose, piglets and sows in a conventional farm were investigated from the day of birth to an age of 12 weeks for the presence of Y. enterocolitica and potential antibodies. A total of 13 sows and 86 associated piglets were included in the study. Blood, feces, and a tonsillar swab were taken from the sows within 24 hours after birth. Another fecal sample was taken a week later. The piglets were individually marked and blood, tonsil, and fecal swabs were taken within the first 24 hours of life, on the 7th day of life, and at weaning. After relocation, regular sampling every two weeks up to an age of 12 weeks followed. The swabs and fecal samples were cultured for Y. enterocolitica. After enrichment in ITC-broth and isolation on CIN-agar, identification by latex agglutination and detection of the ail-gene by PCR followed. The serological investigations were...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4287241-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139255-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053848-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142678-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4632576-1>
Electronic Cross-Border Company Formation ¤ Over the question of whether the German legislator should enable a purely electronic formation of capital companies, a heated discussion has been sparked by the EU Commission's proposal for the SUP Directive. The electronic cross-border formation and in it the guarantee of identity are the subject of the present dissertation. The scientific achievement of this work lies on the one hand in the comprehensive capture of the rich argumentation for electronic formation, its systematic focusing and critical penetration; on the other hand and above all, the investigation provides a critical and forward-looking engagement with the electronic identification means, on which the EU Council has essentially based its compromise in the General Orientation to the SUP Directive in this central question.

Exclusion and Self-Assertion : How Young People Experience Poverty ¤ How does it come to pass that young people live on the streets, and how do they feel about their lives on the periphery? Stefan Thomas develops in his ethnographic study a 'theory of poverty', in which social aspects - exclusion - are linked with individual aspects - psychic disintegration. At the centre are young people who hardly manage to cope in our society shaped by individualization and precariousness.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4300539-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176265-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042870-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4303267-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034929-9>
Conflict Management in Family Businesses : Systematic Use of Judicial and Extrajudicial Dispute Resolution Methods for Conflict Resolution ¤ The personal connection of the actors in family businesses often leads to conflicts developing into lengthy, complex, and ultimately emotionally motivated disputes. Solving such a situation requires a flexible application strategy that systematically selects the appropriate procedure from the variety of judicial and extrajudicial dispute resolution procedures. To conceive of such an interdisciplinary conflict management strategy, the author analyzes the typical interest situation in the conflict in family businesses and answers the questions to be solved: Which conflict resolution procedures are suitable for use in family businesses? What paths are there to guarantee a systematic and case-specific procedure selection? And how can it be ensured that the actors in the dispute case also follow the properly established conflict resolution strategy?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4284136-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139832-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164958-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4503339-0>
Landscape Development in German and Japanese Middle Mountains - Examples from the Black Forest and the Harima Region ¤ The cultural landscape is shaped by the interplay between natural conditions and socio-cultural influences. The middle mountain cultural landscapes in Germany and Japan leave the impression that there is a certain similarity from several perspectives. This was the starting point of the research. To test this impression and to capture similarities and differences between the landscapes, a comparative cultural landscape analysis was conducted. Methodically, historical landscape analysis and empirical social research were combined. As research areas, the Yach district of the city of Elzach in the middle Black Forest, the municipality of Fröhnd in the southern Black Forest, and the Isarigami district of the municipality of Takacho in the Harima region in western Japan were selected. The goal of the research was to compare cultural landscapes in different (world) regions by analyzing the individual components of the landscape. Through a comparative analysis, similarities and differences between them were captured. Subsequently, the region-specific manifestations were to be developed. Written sources, historical maps, as well as specialist maps and aerial photographs were evaluated. The cultural landscape elements mapped during field surveys were entered into a GIS program for evaluations and representation. In addition to the GIS-generated maps, sketches and photos served as documentation. Numerous informal interviews with residents supplemented the reconstruction of historical land use. The reconstruction of the cultural landscape history, which covers the period from settlement to the present day ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034348-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126088-0>
Integration of Inorganic Fillers in Polysulfon Membranes and Effects on Gas Transport Properties ¤ In the present work, the production and characterization of mixed-matrix membranes (MMM) for gas separation are discussed. For this purpose, various fillers were used to produce MMMs in combination with the membrane material polysulfon. As fillers, 3 active and 2 passive fillers were used. The active fillers had pore openings that are able to separate gases depending on the molecular size. This results in a higher ideal separation factor for certain gas pairs than in polysulfon itself. Due to the permanently formed channels in the active fillers, a faster gas transport (permeability) occurs than in polysulfon. The active fillers were the zeolite SAPO-34 and 2 batches of the zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) ZIF-8. The two batches of ZIF-8 differed in their specific surface area, which should be taken into account especially in the investigations on gas transport. For the passive fillers, it was ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155585-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7749014-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175314-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4312791-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067660-2>
Registered Assets in Cross-Border Insolvency Proceedings under the EU Insolvency Regulation ¤ With the growing international interlinking of corporate activities in the European Internal Market, the number of insolvencies with cross-border connections is also increasing. The European Insolvency Regulation (EU Insolvency Regulation) creates a uniform international insolvency law for this purpose. The work examines how registered assets, i.e. real estate, ships and aircraft, which fall into the insolvency mass of a cross-border proceeding, are treated under the EU Insolvency Regulation. In essence, the work answers the question of how a insolvency proceeding that has been opened in an EU member state affects the registered assets of the debtor in another member state and how a realization by the insolvency administrator or a secured creditor can take place. The recent insolvencies of the airlines Air Berlin and Niki in 2017 as well as numerous ship funds demonstrate the relevance and topicality of this topic.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4214276-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4348075-5>
Hardware-in-the-Loop Test Stand for Vibration Investigations on Vehicle Drive Train Components ¤ A Hardware-in-the-Loop test stand for the investigation of the rotational vibration behavior of vehicle drive train components is presented. The simulation of the internal combustion engine is carried out by two electric motors with different dynamics and torques, which are connected via a torsionally elastic shaft. Due to the additional degree of freedom, the two torques can be added and, by means of a suitable control, the rotational irregularities of the internal combustion engine can be represented. At the component outlet, an electric motor is torsionally coupled, which simulates the vehicle end drive.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129297-2>
The Legal Situation of Non-Occupying Residential Tenants ¤ The scarcity of housing offers in large and university cities leads to an increasing number of rental agreements being concluded with tenants without their own intention to use the property. This often happens at the insistence of the landlord, who only accepts weak rental applicants as users, not as contract partners. The intended separation of residential tenant and user is foreign to the housing rental law system of the BGB and raises numerous legal questions. For example, it needs to be clarified whether and in what form the housing rental protection provisions are applicable to the user's advantage and whether the unlimited contractual liability of the non-occupying tenant is valid in the context of § 551 Abs. 1, 4 BGB. The application of the legal institution of the contract to the benefit of third parties is also checked. After thorough analysis, the author presents solution proposals for the different cases of the involvement of non-occupying residential tenants.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022898-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169786-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188083-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039168-1>
Heroic Idealism in Dreams : Psychoanalytic Readings of Commissioned Communication ¤ Andreas Galling-Stiehler investigates the phenomenon that scandals surrounding politicians and top managers increasingly appear as a result of personalization through public relations, public affairs, and other forms of commissioned communication, as well as their reception by the media. From the perspective of a psychoanalytic hermeneutics, he develops a new understanding of this form of commissioned communication based on the human image of Sigmund Freud. A central role is played by the figure of the hero in the daydream and mass daydream at Freud and his successors. The concept of productive fictions developed from narrative theory and philosophy provides the basis for interpreting commissioned communication and its strategic orientation in a deep hermeneutic sense and exemplarily interpreting the political scandal surrounding a former president.

Equalization of Burden in the Constitutional Value Order : On the Justification Requirements for Unequal Taxation ¤ Although the principle of ability to pay is almost unanimously recognized as a standard for equal taxation, German tax law is characterized by numerous breaches of this principle. However, the justification requirements for tax unequal treatment are also highly controversial even after some fundamental decisions by the Federal Constitutional Court. The confusion is further exacerbated by the fact that the dogmatics of the general equality clause are not fully clarified in principle. Based on an analysis of the value judgments of the Federal Constitutional Court and the importance of the equal treatment obligation in the constitutional value system, the author develops her own equality law examination schema. Special aspects of equality examination in tax law are dealt with in detail. After that, the consequence requirement applied by the Federal Constitutional Court is to be given up in favor of a general examination procedure corresponding to the requirements.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135971-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129062-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062801-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4021231-2>
Sexism in the Workplace : Gender and Power in East German Industry ¤ Women were generally equal in the workforce of the GDR. This strengthened their independence in the workplace and family, but did not mean that there was no sexism. Based on the gender relationships in two large companies, Henrike Voigtländer works out the informal mechanisms by which male superiors and colleagues reproduced their hegemonic position: networks in the management levels, unequal standards in controlling pair relationships, a tactical handling of cases of sexual violence, and finally increasingly spreading sexualized images of women in company newspapers and on brigade festivals. From company documents, brigade diaries, and photo material, interviews, and Stasi files, this pioneering study reconstructs subtly the 'longue durée' of patriarchy in the GDR.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002641-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020548-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188514-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116483-0>
Activists of Normal Biography: On the Biographical Dimension of Precarious Work ¤ Following studies on precarization, insecurely employed individuals lament the lack of opportunity for life planning and strive for the normal biography. At the same time, it is a truism that individuals have long since parted with the normal biography and live (want to live) discontinuous 'patchwork biographies'. Daniela Schiek theoretically and empirically connects these two discussion threads, examining the current relevance of the normal biography through precarious employment situations. As a result, it appears not as any and therefore past biographical option, but as a hinge between individual and working society: as a life - the only one that individuals know.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167050-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139195-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002799-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132300-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4437731-9>
Kinetics and catalyst overheating in the gas phase polymerization of propylene ¤ Scope of this PhD work is the kinetic study of four Ziegler-Natta catalysts in the gas phase polymerization of propylene under industrially relevant conditions. The focus is placed on the effect of catalyst overheating in lab-scale with particle heat transfer conditions that apply to those of industrial plants. First, the effect of a seed bed is analyzed for two catalysts in detail. A kinetic study is conducted for three Ziegler-Natta catalysts with focus on the effect of hydrogen on the catalyst activity and melt flow rate. An experimental solubility study is conducted in a high pressure magnetic suspension balance. State-of-the-art thermodynamic models relevant for process modeling are tested in describing the propylene/polypropylene system. The analysis of the polymerization kinetics is extended by developing a phenomenological kinetic model which is combined with an experimentally validated thermodynamic equation of state.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175940-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121946-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4491947-5>
Scientific Education in the Context of Greil's School Reform (1922-1924) ¤ In educational and educational policy research, with regard to the state of Thuringia and the time of the Weimar Republic, the name Peter Petersen and his Jenaplan reform pedagogy are primarily in focus. However, the early years of the 1920-founded state of Thuringia are characterized by societal and parliamentary debates due to the school policy of the social democratic government. As the core of school policy in Thuringia from 1922 to 1924, the draft of the unified school law by the Minister of People's Education, Max Greil, is considered, with which the education system of Thuringia was to be fundamentally reformed. For the Weimar Republic, this step was a novelty, as no other country had such an approach, which was introduced by law. The present work makes a contribution to the investigation of the school policy work of the social democratic government from 1922 to 1924 with regard to the discussion of the possibilities and limitations of the Greil school reform in the contemporary school reality. A particular focus is on the analysis of the new scientific lesson plans for the Thuringian unified school, which are examined in the context of the reform of scientific education at the beginning of the 20th century due to the Prussian lesson plans of 1901 and the Meran proposals of 1905. Furthermore, indirect references to the practical implementation of the lesson plan guidelines for the sciences are made through a textbook analysis of contemporary chemistry textbooks.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035117-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062005-0>
Fabrication of functional thin-film elements on the front surfaces of optical fibers using high-resolution lithographic structuring techniques ¤ This work deals with the development of technologies for lithographic processes for the production of high-frequency diffractive thin-film building elements directly on the front surfaces of optical fibers. For this, optimized lithographic procedures need to be suitably modified for process execution on wafers. This concerns both the production of layers and the adjustable process parameters as well as the process control. Depending on the materials used and the structure dimensioning, different functionalities of the structured layers can be generated. For illumination, two systems are used. For the production of structures with periods greater than 3 mym, direct writing laser illumination is used at a wavelength of 442 nm. For the generation of high-frequency grids with periods less than 1 mym, DUV interference lithography is used under the use of an excimer laser emitting at a wavelength of 248 nm. At this wavelength, the interferometric structurability of a resist originally specified for electron beam lithography is investigated, which is particularly well suited for the production of structures on the front surfaces of optical fibers due to its properties such as low moisture sensitivity, high long-term stability, good adhesion, and simplified process control during development. The suitable illumination and other processing parameters for process execution on substrate layers made of different materials are determined for the realization of high-frequency grid structures. The structuring of metallic layers on the front surfaces of optical fibers leads to fiber-based lithography masks, with the help of which efficient and reproducible photolithography on fiber front surfaces is enabled using fiber-to-fiber illumination. Through direct surface structuring of high-frequency grids on quartz glass optical fibers coated with high-refractive-index layers made of As35S65 using excimer laser interference lithography, efficient fiber-coupled grids with high refractive index contrast are generated. Based on such grid structures, wavelength and polarization filters are designed, suitable illumination conditions are determined, and the properties of realized structures are compared with simulation results.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174545-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136339-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191584-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167589-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4603135-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147542-2>
The Three Generations of European Market Abuse Law ¤ Notably, the financial crisis prompted the European Commission to propose new legislative acts (Proposal for a Regulation on insider trading and market manipulation, Directive on criminal sanctions for insider trading and market manipulation) to prevent insider trading and market manipulation (market abuse). The work traces the path to these new legislative acts by presenting the legislative acts that have been adopted at the European level so far to prevent market abuse (Directive 89/592/EEC and 2003/6/EC). It also addresses the legal situation, in particular in Germany. The aim is to determine the state of integration of European market abuse law.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029578-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7749818-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170174-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114025-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020682-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037627-8>
Acceptance of Large Projects: An Examination of Conflicts, Cost- and Benefit Aspects, and Communication ¤ The book focuses on conflict and acceptance of large projects and the role that communication and participation play in this context. Using a project-based research design, the author characterizes the large project landscape in Germany in qualitative and quantitative terms. 60 projects from various thematic areas are examined in terms of predicted conflict determinants, such as cost and benefit aspects, as well as the effects of different communication and participation forms. It shows, among other things, that communication and participation can positively affect the finding of a jointly accepted solution, for example, through their effects on cost and benefit aspects in large projects. The content includes the importance of large projects for social change, themes, actors, and distribution of large projects in Germany, the role of central determinants of conflict and acceptance, effects of different communication and participation forms, and potential conflict cost savings through communication and participation. The target groups are lecturers and students of communication science, sociology, and politics as well as urban and spatial planning, communication responsible, conflict interveners, planners, and carriers of large projects, active in politics and authorities. The author Inkeri Märgen Schmalz is now active in the middle-class economy as a communication expert after various activities in science and practice.

Interaction of light and matter in metal-semiconductor hybrid nanostructures ¤ Ultrafast nanooptics explores the behavior of light in nanostructured materials on femtosecond time scales and could bring the next major breakthrough in data processing. The knowledge from this research area is the basis for future purely optical circuit technology, which can process data much faster than conventional electronics. On nanostructured metal surfaces, surface plasmons (SPPs) can be excited. This involves collective oscillations of the electron gas in the metal and the electromagnetic field. SPPs can focus light onto a spatial area smaller than the Abbe limit and propagate always along the metal surface. As a result, they are particularly suitable as information carriers in nanooptic devices. Organic and inorganic semiconductors are another important component in nanooptic components. They enable the light-light and light-matter interaction necessary to amplify and switch light. The present work describes theoretical calculations that have arisen in close cooperation with experimental colleagues. The modeling process, which is closely related to the choice of numerical methods, is discussed. Furthermore, evaluation methods are described that link the numerical results with experimentally accessible quantities. The results of the calculations are finally compared with experimental results. In its first part, the present work discusses subtle aspects of the excitation of SPPs on metal grids, where the symmetry of the grid is broken by individual scatterers. The theme of the second part of the work is a metal grid that has been coated with a dye. In such a system, SPPs and excitons in the dye form collective, coupled modes, which are also known as excimons or plexcitons. This can be proven by the avoided crossing of the dips in the angle-resolved reflectivity spectrum caused by SPPs or excitons. In the last part, the localization of light in arrangements of zinc oxide nanorods is discussed. The nanorods are randomly distributed on a substrate, but all stand vertically. Due to their forest-like appearance, such arrangements are also called nanoforests. Incident light experiences multiple scattering at the nanorods in this system. It turns out that a part of the light is localized - it is caught in the nanoforest.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4273564-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1024960048> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4204530-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172251-6>
Motivating in Computer Science Education: A Characterization of Practicable Entries from the Perspective of Teachers and Learners ¤ Motivations enable learners to be interested and enthusiastic about course content. This work examines motivation in computer science education through practical entries. In an exploratory study, 12 types of motivating teaching entries are identified, covering a range of topics in computer science education. The types of motivating teaching entries are described, illustrated with examples, and classified. The main investigation is conducted from both teacher and student perspectives. As a theoretical basis, the ARCS model of motivation by Keller is used, which has been expanded to include a didactic component. With the help of vignettes in text and video form, a characterization of the identified types is made based on their motivating properties. It can be shown that top groups can be identified that embody individual motivation factors in a special way. It is worth noting that the motivation types	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026898-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040364-6>
Dem Göttlichen ganz nah : "Leisure" and Theory in Late Antique Philosophy and Theology ¤ What is »leisure«? What is »theory«? And how are the two connected? Andreas Kirchner explains that according to Aristotle's basic definitions of the concepts of »theoría« and »scholê«, both undergo characteristic developments in the course of history, and that the philosophy and theology of late antiquity significantly contributed to this. Plotinus' Neoplatonism thus decisively extends both concepts in their essential respects, and the emerging Christian theology, which the author examines by taking Marius Victorinus, Ambrose and, above all, Augustine as examples, then builds up its definition of »leisure« and »theory«. While based on philosophical foundations on the one hand, on the other it develops its own characteristic concepts following the personal concept of God and Christian assumptions. Andreas Kirchner shows how fundamentally the thought systems as well as the respective concept of God affect the conceptual design.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045791-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170872-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059758-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041862-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185104-3>
The Private "House Right" ¤ The originally criminal law concept of the 'House Right' has only recently established itself in private law. The dogmatic foundations of this law have so far received little attention in science. This gap is closed by Tobias von Bressensdorf with his treatise, in which he comprehensively examines the dogmatic function, the property law design, and the general limitations of the private 'House Right'. The goal is to demystify the 'House Right' by reducing the legal institution to known dogmatic structures and figures. The central thesis of the treatise is that the function of the concept lies in the ordering and systematization of the legal material, but it does not have its own regulatory content. The private 'House Right' is reconstructed and concretized on the basis of the statutory provisions on possession and property. The work was awarded the Dr.-Feldbausch Prize of the Leipzig Faculty of Law.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4159274-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128412-4>
Fit for the Classroom: Concept and Evaluation of a Resilience Promotion Program for Teacher Trainees ¤ Within the scope of this work, the RefueL program was developed and positively evaluated to promote the resilience of teacher trainees before the practical semester. The program supplemented the professional and didactic preparation of prospective teachers during their studies with an offer to train psychological and social resistance ability. The developed program consists of five modules on the topics of resilience in the teaching context, shaping social relationships, well-being, setting goals and solving problems, as well as regulating emotions. These modules contain various practical exercises for resilience promotion and are realized in a face-to-face setting. A longitudinal control group design was chosen for the evaluation. Hierarchical regressions were also calculated. The program proved to be effective on four different evaluation levels. It was found that participants after the practical semester, under control of the initial values, showed a lower burnout symptomatology, more positive affect, and a higher teaching-related self-efficacy expectation than students in the control group. The study results suggest anchoring resilience promotion programs at universities with practical semesters in the curriculum and thus contributing to the professionalization of prospective teachers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4383904-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005961-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131946-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4817917-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074098-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076308-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195380-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126412-5>
Representation of Synergy Potentials between IT Requirements in Scrum ¤ Fabian Sobiech investigates an improvement of the planning of agile iterations. He shows how values for user stories can be determined in the context of agile software development with heterogeneous customers. Furthermore, he develops a solution for representing synergy potentials between requirements, which arise and can be used when considering multiple requirements together. The author's goals are to avoid duplicate developments of similar functions and subsequent interface adjustments, while keeping the processing of requirements by customers understandable. Building on this, he describes valid and optimal iterations in a mathematical model. Project managers can be relieved in the iteration planning through a semi-automatic procedure. Investigations show that an algorithmic approach saves time and increases the values per iteration. Content: Foundations: Project management with Scrum Determination of the value of IT requirements Systematic use and representation of synergy effects Determination of valid and optimal iterations Target groups Lecturers and students of computer science Practitioners in the IT industry The author Fabian Sobiech worked during his external promotion at the TU Clausthal within the corporate IT of a large automobile manufacturer. Currently, he is working as a systems analyst in the data analysis department for production and logistics of the same conglomerate.

Societal Images in Sardinia: On the Social Construction of Local, Regional, and National Identities ¤ Two communities in Sardinia are the starting point of this study, which examines the constructions of collective identity on the local, regional, and national levels from a sociological, socio-anthropological, and socio-historical perspective that combines these interests. Beyond the already widely recognized constructional character of these phenomena, attention is given - in contrast to the common focus on elites and their 'invention of tradition' - to the reception conditions of identity offers as well as to everyday cultural self- and foreign images. The investigation keeps the social structural and socio-historical framework in view and reflects the empirical results in a critical way that criticizes the one-dimensionality of many approaches to collective identity. After an introduction to the concept of societal images, the presentation begins with an overview of the history of the island and Sardinian images, and then compares local paths of structural change and different forms of local border-drawing and identity politics in detail. The subsequent investigation of connections between images of the local, regional, and national is continued in a separate case study of an economic and political identity enterprise that, with its mix of themes of localism, traditionalism, globalization, and the internet, appears as a world-open variant of a regionalism that refers to ethnic or national community.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140349-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157063-7>

The Consequence in the System of Penal Sanctions: An Investigation into the Doctrine of the Consequence as well as the Classification of Norms as a Consequence ¤ Between punishments and measures, the StGB contains another sanction, which is registered under the unassuming title 'Consequences': In §§ 45 ff., the temporary loss of capacity to act, eligibility, and voting rights is regulated. In the secondary penal law, numerous other such losses of rights are found, which sometimes burden the perpetrator more heavily than the punishment itself and occur thousands of times a year. Nevertheless, the contours of the consequence are largely unclear. The work therefore aims to clarify both the general legal nature of the consequence and shed some light on the secondary penal consequences. Starting from the history of the creation of § 45, a new definition of the consequence is developed, which is capable of being distinguished, where various norms discussed as consequences are newly classified. In addition, the author discusses general legal problems in connection with the occurrence of consequences. The conclusion is a criminal policy consideration. -- Awarded with the Peregrinus Foundation Prize 2015.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171389-8>
Management of Open-Innovation Networks ¤ Theoretically-conceptual positioning: Management of innovations and networks -- Empirical investigation: Networks for urban future design -- Results: Identification of network governance forms -- Discussion: On the management of open-innovation networks. . This book contributes to the as yet outstanding theoretical foundation of open-innovation research. In doing so, the author takes a look at the management of interorganizational innovation networks on a network-wide level. His results show that the forms of network governance prevailing in the literature should be confirmed and supplemented by the control form of the 'Impartial Organization'. As a result, control in a network is informal and maximizes overall utility for all actors. Furthermore, it becomes clear that selected features of structural, procedural, and cultural dimensions can promote interorganizational knowledge exchange and bring about the emergence of innovations.

Medical Expert Opinions of the 17th and 18th Centuries: A Historical Study of a Text Type Class ¤ Historical text type research is still a relatively unexplored field for German, and so far only a few historical text types have been recorded and described. This study takes a historical text type class, medical expert opinions, into view, which was of central importance for medical communication in the 17th and 18th centuries. The starting point of the investigation are common, present-day text-linguistic description approaches, which are modified and expanded for historical contexts with important pragmatic categories. The stronger consideration of metacommunicative knowledge assets, as they manifest themselves in rhetoric textbooks, text type guides, and text type naming, proves to be particularly fruitful. On the basis of this comprehensive analysis model, the corresponding text types – Consilia, court expert opinions, and section reports – are investigated and described from a cultural and scientific historical perspective as well as with regard to their typical linguistic features. The study thus offers not only an interesting insight into medical professional communication of the time for linguists and medical historians, but also for cultural scientists.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059664-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074675-6>
Power and Dependence of Stakeholders: Influence Configurations in Various Crisis Stages and Organizational Forms ¤ The topic of corporate will formation is as old as business administration itself. Concepts such as the shareholder value approach, however, fall short of depicting the entire spectrum of influence management. Michael Völpel develops a formal-analytical model with which influence configurations in various organizational forms can be examined. In this, both resource-based and structural power sources of various stakeholders are taken into account.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4300861-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151276-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078605-5>
Application of a Modern Group Contribution State Equation for the Synthesis of Thermal Separation Processes ¤ The knowledge of the real behavior of substances and their mixtures as a function of pressure, temperature, and composition is essential for the development and design of industrial plants. Only by considering all relevant substance-specific properties, it is possible to develop new plants according to economic and ecological aspects and to optimize existing ones. Today, process engineers have a wide range of models available that are able to predict the thermophysical behavior of the considered substances to a greater or lesser extent. In this work, it was checked whether the VTPR model can be used as a modern group contribution state equation universally for the synthesis of thermal separation processes and possibly further developed. Through a detailed model analysis, some weaknesses could be localized and improved, which led to a significant improvement in the prediction quality.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4426503-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137770-9>
Content and competence : a descriptive approach to the concept of rights ¤ Jakob Weissinger approaches this central problem of jurisprudence by critically examining the purpose of such normative concepts and carefully analysing the fundamental elements of normative practice like actions, decisions, the logic of norms and values as well as the plurality of normative practice. Interlinking the insights won, he outlines a stand-alone theory of rights which emphasises the empowering dimension of rights in the process of justifying (legal) rules. Not only does he question well-established theories, such as Hohfeld's famous analysis of legal conceptions, but aspires to set future debates in legal theory, especially those surrounding rights such as the long-standing dispute between interest and choice theories of rights, on new and more solid meta-theoretical ground.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126505-1>
Doing Junior Uni : Evident and Hidden Order of a Children's University ¤ School order, generational order, generational ordering – a theoretical introduction -- The 'Junior Uni' in the mirror of its self-presentation -- Spatial relationships -- Introducing oneself, checking presence and clarifying rules -- 'Starting right' – Entering the dialogue about knowledge. Organized learning takes place in our society in specific order arrangements that regulate far more than just the acquisition of certain intellectual skills. Miriam Böttner provides insight into the interaction processes in the 'Junior Uni' and the observed order processes through fine analyses of video data. Through various forms of data preparation, the author makes it visible that it is difficult for almost all actors involved in the interaction at a children's university to fulfill the claim to transfer learning into a new arrangement. They often fall back on a teaching-learning arrangement in which school- and age-specific body-space constellations and speech and silence prohibitions are solidified.

Application of Molecular Biological Strain Comparison Techniques in Clinical Mastitis Epidemiology ¤ Molecular biological strain comparison methods are currently not part of the routine diagnostics of mastitis secretions in Germany. These methods were used to trace the spread of microorganisms within a herd, to distinguish between contagious and non-contagious infection courses, and to determine the proportion of persistent infections under recurring infections. The results show that strain comparison techniques have the potential to make a significant contribution to solving individual farm mastitis problems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050061-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4242875-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153233-8>
Commitment Agreements in EU Competition Law: An Examination of the Functions and Limits of Commitment Decisions Pursuant to Article 9 of Regulation 1/2003 with Particular Regard to the Energy Sector ¤ In the wake of the 'modernization' of EU competition procedure law in 2004, the European Commission was provided with a new instrument for enforcing competition law. Pursuant to Article 9 of Regulation 1/2003, it can declare commitment agreements binding on companies that address their competition law concerns without finding a breach of law. Commitment decisions have since become of paramount importance in the Commission's administrative practice. With them, there is hope for a new form of competition law enforcement. The focus is on procedural economy and the effectiveness of competition law enforcement. On the other hand, there is concern that the legal binding nature of the enforcement of competition rules will be impaired by a broad use of the commitment procedure. This tension is examined in the present work on the basis of the Commission's decision practice	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014743-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130578-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4438928-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131889-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7>
British Cultural Policy in Germany : 1945 - 1949 ; Literature, Film, Music and Theatre ¤ What significance did cultural policy hold within the framework of British Germany policy after 1945 and what functions did it fulfill? The author addresses these central questions in depth and, based on the evaluation of British sources on Germany policy and a detailed analysis of British cultural programs for Germany, arrives at new results. The cultural image of Germany held by the British, the cultural self-awareness of the British and its challenges, particularly due to the decline of Britain as a great power in the 20th century, are examined in detail and the effects of these various factors on the shaping of cultural policy are shown.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033581-1>

Mission: Kidnapping : Abductions of West Berliners and Federal Citizens by the Ministry for State Security of the GDR ¤ On open streets brutally attacked, doped and kidnapped in familiar surroundings or lured to GDR territory by perfidious deceptions and held illegally. Approximately 400 people share a fate: They were abducted in the 1950s and 1960s from the Federal Republic and especially from West Berlin to the GDR and imprisoned there. Many returned after weeks, months or even years from GDR imprisonment. Some disappeared forever. Responsible for the abduction actions was primarily the Ministry for State Security (MfS), which initially acted under the guidance of the Soviet secret service. It is an unknown chapter of German division history. Based on numerous MfS files and federal documents, the study analyzes the mechanisms and functions of MfS kidnapping practice	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121200-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038645-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4279877-2>
The Purpose Determination of Medical Devices and its Impact on Liability and Responsibility of Users and Operators ¤ Users and operators of medical devices often disregard the original purpose determination of the manufacturer in practice by reprocessing products brought into circulation as single-use products or combining medical devices from different manufacturers. Unlike the „Off-Label Use“ in pharmaceutical law, the consequences of such use have only been superficially clarified in medical device law so far. In the present work, the complex questions related to medical device, doctor and hospital liability and product liability law are comprehensively examined in the context of the new Regulation (EU) 2017/745 for medical devices and convincing practical results are found. In particular, the central importance of purpose determination for medical device law and its previously unclarified definition are highlighted.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4024018-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4270237-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022898-8>
Empirical essays on agriculture in Germany : past and present ¤ Landwirtschaft, Klima, Variationskoeffizient, wirtschaftliche Entwicklung, Marktintegration, Napoleonische Kriege, Preisvolatilität, Staatswachstum, Wetter, Ertragsschwankungen Getreide ist ein wichtiges Grundnahrungsmittel. In dieser Dissertation analysiere ich gemeinsam mit meinen Koautoren, wie Mensch und Natur Getreideproduktion und -handel in Deutschland zu verschiedenen Zeiten beeinflussen. Im ersten Papier entwickeln wir einen Ansatz, um die gegenwärtige Ertragsvolatilität sowohl verschiedenen Produktionsfaktoren als auch dem Wetter zuzuordnen. Das zweite Papier ist der Messung der Integration von Getreidemärkten in der vorindustriellen Zeit gewidmet. Marktintegration verbesserte sich in Nordwestdeutschland und entlang wichtiger Flüsse. Drittens zeigen wir, dass die territoriale Expansion von Staaten während der napoleonischen Kriege zu Getreidemarktintegration führte. Die Dissertation zeigt einerseits, wie Wetter und geographische Lage Agrarproduktion und -handel beeinflussen. Anderseits entscheiden Menschen, wie produziert wird. Sie formen die Institutionen, die den Handel mit Agrarrohstoffen lenken, und entwickeln neue Produktionstechnologien. Cereals are an important staple food. In this thesis, I analyze together with my coauthors how humans and nature shape cereal production and trade in different periods. In the first paper, we develop an approach to attribute current wheat yield volatility to both production factors and weather. The second paper is devoted to the measurement of grain market integration in the pre-industrial period. Market integration improved in North-Western Germany and along major rivers. Third, we show that the territorial expansion of states during the Napoleonic Wars entailed the integration of grain markets. On the one hand, the thesis shows how weather and geographical location impact on agricultural production and trade. On the other hand, humans decide how to produce. They form the institutions governing trade in agricultural commodities, and develop new production technologies. agriculture, climate, coefficient of variation, economic development, market integration, Napoleonic Wars, price volatility, state growth, weather, yield variability END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121356-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157198-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152914-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020796-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065852-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200279-5>
Die Auslegung mehrsprachiger völkerrechtlicher Verträge : a characterization of the rules of interpretation with due regard to their historical development ¤ Da völkerrechtliche Verträge in der Regel nicht nur in einer, sondern in mehreren Sprachen abgefasst sind, können sich bei der Auslegung besondere praktische Probleme ergeben, insbesondere wenn die verschiedensprachigen Texte inhaltlich nicht exakt übereinstimmen. Diese Probleme wurden in Artikel 33 der Wiener Vertragsrechtskonvention von 1969 aufgegriffen, welcher hierzu völkervertragliche Auslegungsregeln bereithält. Die vorliegende Arbeit versucht erstmals, die Auslegung mehrsprachiger völkerrechtlicher Verträge anhand der historischen Völkerrechtspraxis rechtsquellensystematisch aufzuarbeiten und die hierbei gewonnenen Erkenntnisse im Verhältnis zur Darstellung des Art. 33 WVK einfließen zu lassen. Die Arbeit geht weiter auf die Implikationen des völkerrechtlichen Fragmentierungsdiskurses sowie die Anwendung von Art. 33 WVK im innerstaatlichen Bereich ein und schließt mit einem Plädoyer für mehr Fremdsprachenkompetenz als notwendige juristische Qualifikation. / »The Interpretation of Multilingual Treaties.

The Polemics of Restoration: Metapolemical and Idehistorical Considerations on the Initial Volume of Karl Ludwig von Haller's Restoration Script ¤ <p>After the French Revolution came the era of 'Restoration': European politics at the beginning of the 19th century wanted to restore the pre-revolutionary order of the Ancien Régime. The politician Karl Ludwig von Haller wrote the script 'Restoration of State Science', whose unhidden and well-considered fighting spirit is directed at the reader. Alexander Kruska shows in how far Haller's first volume, which caused a sensation, is to be understood as a politically motivated and systematic polemic. In the endeavor to bring an end to the question of legitimate rule, Haller sets against the enlightened state thinking a 'better doctrine': Instead of a rationally justified public order, he proclaims a natural order of mere power relationships. But were his ideas at all suitable for a restoration of the Ancien Régime?</p>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115590-7>
Segmentation of Lifestyle Based on Content-Based Evaluation of Digital Images : -- ¤ Market segmentation is one of the most discussed topics in marketing. One of the least used data sources in this context is the content-based evaluation of digital images. Digital images are increasingly gaining importance in today's society and are being increasingly disseminated publicly. As a result, numerous new data are emerging for market research, which can provide new insights. Against this background, Ines Daniel investigates whether photographs reflect the activities, opinions, and interests of their owners. She also examines whether and how photographs provided by participants can expand data collection and evaluation. The developed concept of lifestyle segmentation based on photography was validated through two empirical studies. Content Market segmentation Content-based evaluation of digital images Basics and concept of lifestyle segmentation Validation of lifestyle segmentations as well as recommendations for action Target groups Lecturers and students of business administration, computer science, and engineering with a focus on market research and innovation management as well as image processing Professionals and executives in market research institutes and consulting firms The author Dr. Ines Daniel was promoted by Prof. Baier at the Chair of Marketing and Innovation Management at the Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus.

Digital Capitalism? : A Systematic Classification in Marx’s Critique of Political Economy ¤ In the debate on ‘digital capitalism’, Marxian theory plays an essential role. While the majority of approaches merely adapt individual theorems and concepts, in this book, the Marxian theory of value is applied in its entirety to the phenomena of digitalisation in value creation. In particular, the central connection between Marxian value and money theory is retained. With recourse to the new reception of Marx which began in the mid-1960s, the so-called Neue Marx-Lektüre, the book clearly distinguishes itself from Marxist orthodoxy and, despite the systematic coherence of that doctrine’s argumentation, reveals the necessity of additions, for example from post-Marxist theories.

Youth Media Protection for Video and Computer Games in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom: Comparative Law and Analysis of Development Perspectives Considering the Assessments of System-Involved Actors and Experts ¤ Germany, France, the United Kingdom: Three countries, three different basic attitudes towards youth media protection in violent video games. After an overview of the current state of media effects research in this field, this study analyzes the national systems and evaluates them in terms of 21 selected quality criteria. Following a presentation of the European legal relationships, a look at the current development perspectives of this complex matter concludes the consideration. A special focus of the investigation lies on the possibilities of a progressive harmonization of the systems on the European level as well as on the optimization potential of the German youth media protection. Both the failure of the reform of the youth media protection treaty in December 2010 and the since February 2011 applicable, revised procedure guidelines of the USK are taken into account. The scientific basis of the study consists, in addition to the evaluation of literature and case law, of the expert interviews conducted by the author with 20 actors of the European youth media protection for video games, including representatives of the European Commission as well as participants in the procedures of all classification systems (USK, BPjM, PEGI, BBFC). The results are also illustrated by numerous colorfully designed images and tables as well as by illustrated examples of controversially discussed video games (e.g. Dead Space, Manhunt, Left 4 Dead, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063465-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4010457-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4232692-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115712-6>

Strategic Diversity Management: Corporate Leadership in the Age of Cultural Diversity ¤ Cultural diversity is developing into a success-critical resource for multinational companies in the face of dynamically advancing globalization and demographic change. In awareness of the diverse potential benefits of diversity, André Schulz considers diversity management as a strategic concept of international corporate leadership. He explains how, through the use of diversity-conscious personnel and environmental management, both the cultural diversity of internal employees and external customers, markets, and societies can be made economically usable and leads, within the framework of a strategic diversity control, concrete recommendations for the successful handling of diversity.

Coordinating Personnel Control: Development Trends and Barriers ¤ In personnel control, numerous theoretical concepts have been developed over the past fifteen years, but they have only hesitantly or not at all been implemented in practice. In addition, a systemic theoretical framework has emerged in the discipline of controlling, whose central theme is the coordination task in the management system. Based on two extensive empirical studies conducted among European managers in accounting and the most important Austrian companies, Alfred Gutschelhofer analyzes the approach of coordination in personnel control and examines functional relationships in the management system. Furthermore, the author deals with acceptance barriers in the management system and explores the possibilities of accounting in the context with personnel control.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4280519-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061963-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022149-0>
Price Behaviour and Competition Law: Behavioural Analysis of Price-Related Consumer Protection Regulations of the UWG and the Price Indication Ordinance ¤ Does a specific price, price advertising or a price tag violate the German law against unfair competition (UWG) or the German Price Indication Ordinance (PAngV)? The analysis of these legal questions requires assumptions about legislation and legal practice on how consumers understand and react to such commercial practices. This book contrasts these assumptions with the findings of behavioural sciences on the “real” price-related behaviour of consumers.It compiles the findings of behavioural sciences on consumers’ price-related behaviour and thereby makes them available to legal practitioners, scholars and legislators. Where the legal assumptions on consumer behaviour deviate from the findings of behavioural sciences, the consequence of this interdisciplinary result is assessed: Should findings on “real” price behaviour be taken into account in the law against unfair competition, which is based primarily on normative assumptions, and if yes, how?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047103-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047118-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115618-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117338-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7751254-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062644-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061842-0>

The Significance of Particle-Associated Cadmium for Bioavailability and Bioaccumulation in the Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans ¤ Um die Bedeutung unterschiedlicher Aufnahmewege für die interne Verfügbarkeit und Akkumulation von Cadmium zu untersuchen, wurde C. elegans über verschiedene Partikel und über Medium dem Schadstoff exponiert. Die biologische Verfügbarkeit wurde anhand der veränderten cdr-1-Genexpression mittels Real-Time-PCR bestimmt. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass für die Wirkung und Akkumulation von Cadmium die Exposition über Nahrungspartikel entscheidend ist. To investigate the impact of multiple cadmium exposure pathways on internal availability and accumulation, C. elegans were exposed to different particles and to dissolved cadmium. Internal cadmium availability was determined using the transcript level of cdr-1 gene, as quantified by real-time PCR. Particle-associated cadmium exposure was the predominant contributor to cadmium bioavailability and bioaccumulation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5>
Aerosol jet printing : contactless deposition technique for solar cell metallization ¤ The approach of using two layers consisting of a seed layer and an electroplating layer for contacting solar cells is an established concept in photovoltaic research. The combination of printed and fired seed layer for optimized contact formation of the ink with the emitter and the subsequent electroplating of high-conducting metals on this seed layer, enables an improvement of solar cell performance and reduction of the expensive silver used. For this, a thin seed layer is desired. Aerosol jet printing is a promising technology to produce such a seed layer. In this work, the aerosol jet printing technique was thoroughly investigated and improved. An efficient and reliable deposition of thin and uniform seed layers is enabled. With nozzle diameters of 150 [my]m, lines widths of only 18 [my]m were produced on wafers with pyramid surfaces. To describe this printing technology, a model was designed. With this model, the width of the printed seed layer can be predicted and the influence of process parameters and printing nozzles of different size can be explained. The impact of the aerosol on the substrate and the quality and width of the printed lines were numerically and empirically investigated. With numerical flow simulations of gas and particle flow, new aerosol printing heads were developed. To allow for fast and reliable printing of the seed layer, advanced flow guidance was integrated. A 78-nozzle aerosol printing head suitable for mass production of solar cells was manufactured and tested. On a 15.6 x 15.6 cm^2 large wafer, the seed layer was printed in only 3.9 s. A line width of L = 38 ± 5 [my]m was achieved. The impregnation of the ink on solar wafer surfaces is linked to the process conditions and the topography of the wafers. The deposited seed layers were optimized for a low electrical contact resistance to the emitter. Thin seed layers performed best and are also the most cost-effective. The amount of printed silver for contacting industrial silicon solar cells is less than 9 mg per 15.6 x 15.6 cm^2 wafer. Low-doped boron and phosphorus emitters of the next generation as well as newly developed solar cell designs were successfully contacted using the aerosol printing process. Efficiencies of [eta] > 20 % were achieved on industrially relevant solar cells. In this work, the aerosol printing process was improved to enable the printing of seed layers also on an industrial scale. With this technology, it is now possible to contact solar cells of the next generation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4276669-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7739364-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165128-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4803438-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4296760-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4181740-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176074-8>
The Discourse of Civil Society: Political Contexts and Democratic Theoretical References of the More Recent Conceptual Usage ¤ Dargestellt wird in einem ersten Teil die Entwicklung des Diskurses über die Zivilgesellschaft in seinen politischen Kontexten: bei den ostmitteleuropäischen Bürgerbewegungen, im demokratischen Sozialismus, in den neuen sozialen Bewegungen, im Feminismus und in den Diskussionen über eine "internationale Zivilgesellschaft" bei den Nichtregierungsorganisationen. Vor dem Hintergrund der Rekonstruktion des politischen Gehalts erfolgt in einem zweiten Teil die Einordnung des Zivilgesellschaftsdiskurses in die politische Ideengeschichte und die neueren demokratietheoretischen Diskussionen über die Zukunft der liberalen Demokratie.

Eta-forms and adiabatic limits for fibrewise Dirac operators with varying kernel dimension ¤ We consider the behaviour of the eta-invariant of Dirac operators in the adiabatic limit if the kernel dimension of the fibrewise operators is allowed to vary in a certain way.First, we prove that the eta-form of Bismut and Cheeger exists as a singular differential form with integral coefficients and that its currential differential fulfills a transgression formula.Second, we investigate the large time behaviour of the integrand of the eta-invariant and prove a similar formula as already known for constant kernel dimension	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4150118-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012251-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012248-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140055-0>
Systemic Risk Precaution : through Banking Supervision, Banking Company and Board of Directors ¤ Unforeseen financial crises can be of such magnitude that they rock the world's economy. How can the law help prevent them from developing in the first place? Mechanisms are needed to enhance the stability and resilience of financial systems. Tim Engel's study analyses the legal regime for systemic risk precaution in European banking regulation and the effects it has on supervisory competences and the management responsibilities of banks.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064030-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032950-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004436-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076308-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004450-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177251-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1164452932>
Automating Service-Oriented Computing through Semantic Service Descriptions ¤ Service-oriented architectures will then reach their full potential when it is possible to bind services automatically at runtime. The goal of this dissertation was the creation of a suitable semantic service description language. Its approach is to divide the basis of the language into two parts: a lightweight part for capturing domain knowledge as well as additional elements for capturing the characteristics of services. Thus, descriptions emerge that put the achievable states of services in the center and can be compared efficiently in this way.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4688372-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131473-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4691234-4>
Defective Shareholder and Defective Organ: A Discussion of the Decision BGHZ 196, 195 ¤ The doctrine of the defective company and the doctrine of the defective organ are interrelated principles that cannot be ignored in corporate law practice. The legal consequences of the invalidity of certain measures, as ordered by law, are too rigid and would lead to unworkable results in practice. -- Daniel Doetsch examines the connection between the two doctrines, reveals contradictions and inaccuracies, and then shows that both legal institutions are based on the same foundation and also have the same prerequisites. After discussing the decision on the defective supervisory board election BGHZ 196, 195, the author concludes that all statements made in one doctrine are also transferable to the other doctrine. While the case law is characterized by increasing individual case decisions rather than consistency, the author proposes a stringent and simple application concept.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153597-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153594-7>
The Antifascism of the PDS from an Anti-Extremist Perspective ¤ Introduction -- Definition -- History of Antifascism in Germany -- Antifascist Organization of the PDS -- Antifascist Ideology of the PDS -- Antifascist Strategy of the PDS -- Antifascism in Comparison -- Antifascism of the PDS and Democratic Constitutional State -- Conclusion -- Sources and Literature Index The antifascism belongs to the central policy fields and identification features of the PDS, which was renamed to "The Left Party" in the run-up to the 2005 federal elections. In the study, the history of antifascism in Germany as well as its importance for the ideology, organization, and strategy of post-communists are analyzed. The author evaluates the policy of the PDS from an anti-extremist perspective, i.e. from the point of view of the democratic constitutional state. To what extent does the PDS antifascism benefit democracy? To what extent does it harm it? The work draws a comparison of the handling of right-wing extremism between CDU, CSU, SPD, FDP and Alliance 90/The Greens on the one hand and the PDS on the other hand	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026486-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122803-0>
International Companies, Society and Responsibility: A Critique of Management Science as a Framework ¤ The scientific discussion of corporate social responsibility is limited by the methodological and epistemological boundaries of economics on the one hand and ethics on the other. An epistemologically pluralistic and evolutionary management science can overcome this and enrich the discussion. Philipp Seidel characterizes the science discipline of international management as a language game and works out its peculiarities. Based on an extensive analysis and systematization of existing research on corporate responsibility, he identifies weaknesses and develops a framework that, based on the theories of Kirsch, Luhmann, and Habermas, relates changed concepts of the company, society, and responsibility to each other.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114040-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7697760-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117665-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127678-4>
Money, Banks, and State in Socialism and Transformation: From the Collapse of the Soviet Union to the Financial Crisis in the Russian Federation ¤ The Russian financial crisis of 1998 not only exhibited characteristics of a classical currency crisis, but also expressed the inconsistent reforms of the financial sector. Although the deep-seated tension between the only partially implemented domestic payment economy and a dynamically increasing foreign debt became apparent at least with the currency crisis, a comprehensive investigation of the functional conditions of the Russian financial sector was still lacking. The author attempts to close this gap. Based on models of financial development, the effects of the necessary liberalization of the financial market in the course of transformation on growth are investigated in relation to different state interventions in financial transactions (financial repression). Building on the argumentation of Pagano and King/Levine (endogenous growth theory), she shows the connections between the transaction costs on the financial market caused by financial repression and the expansion of quasi-fiscal activities. The analysis of the functions of money, but also of the financial sector in the collapsing Soviet Union reveals that already during the Perestroika, manifestations of financial repression substituted the	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032950-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060633-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037653-9>
Genre and Gender: On the Complexity of the Connection between Two Categories in the Musical Discourse ¤ The relationship between genre and gender is a focal point of various assessments and effects. But how does the knowledge about both categories in their connection take shape? And how is it to be grasped in its constitutive reciprocity? Based on this question, Johannes Breuer designs a methodically precise discursification, which, using the example of the musical, shows how genre and gender condition each other and, at the same time, evoke moments of tension. In his detailed elaboration, the complexity of both categories emerges, as various designs of gender studies and media studies are brought together across disciplinary boundaries.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012475-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071776-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040801-2>
Prearious Narration : narrative Orders in Robert Walser, Franz Kafka and Theodor Fontane ¤ Robert Walser, Franz Kafka and Theodor Fontane fundamentally address the order problem of modernity narratively. While Fontane attempts in Der Stechlin, just before the turn of the century, to contain the ambivalence through controlled narration, Walser sets a proliferation of ambivalence in motion: In digressive and performative narrative forms and the blending of contradictory order patterns, the order problem is intensified. Kafka finally shows in the late, fragmented text The Bau, how any differentiation collapses and narration presents its own impossibility in a paradoxical turn. From the narrative orderings of these authors, the present study develops a concept of precarious narration, which connects narratological and cultural-scientific aspects.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124854-5>
Investigations on impulse-separated charging on a four-cylinder Otto engine ¤ Washing charge exchange at the flooded intake concept -- Two-stage exhaust stroke and shifted exhaust phase -- CFD investigations on the silencer evaluation -- Modeling of a mass- and friction-affected, oscillating wastegate. Adalbert Wolany investigates various aspects of impulse-separated charging and presents new methods for this purpose. The author develops suitable exhaust opening times for the washing charge exchange at the flooded intake turbocharger and optimizes the charge exchange in the nominal power range in terms of consumption by means of partial flooding separation. He presents a new method for evaluating the flow quality of exhaust silencers in CFD simulation, which takes into account the entire usable energy content of the fluid at the silencer outlet. In order to make the oscillating behavior of wastegate valves excited by gas pressure pulses capturable in 1D flow simulation, Wolany discusses a new modeling approach in which the wastegate has both fluid-dynamic and mechanical properties.

Völkerrechtliche Vorgaben für die Verleihung der Staatsangehörigkeit ¤ The law of nationality is often seen as one of the last bastions of state sovereignty despite its relevance to international law. Patrick R. Hoffmann challenges this traditional assumption by taking a fresh look at the legal institution of nationality and examining the international law requirements for its conferral. In order to correctly capture modern practices in the field of nationality law – such as the so-called sale of nationalities or passportisation – he fundamentally takes international law into account in the context of nationality. The author examines, among other things, the often proclaimed human right to a nationality as well as the requirement of a reasonable connection between the person and the state as a condition for the conferral of nationality.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074725-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063696-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056630-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013828-8>
Development of an Endoscopic Fiber Probe for Optical Biopsies using Nonlinear Spectroscopy ¤ An early detection and exact diagnosis of diseases such as tumors is essential for optimal treatment and improvement of prognosis for affected individuals. The gold standard for tissue examinations is still histopathology, where painful patient biopsies and complex post-processing of tissue samples are necessary. From tissue removal to diagnosis, valuable time is spent, and in many cases, biopsies must be repeated multiple times until diseased tissue is completely identified and localized. Therefore, new optical technologies have been developed and applied in recent decades to optimize tissue analysis and enable a more patient-friendly treatment. Nonlinear, multimodal in-vivo imaging with CARS (coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering), SHG (second harmonic generation) and TPEF (two-photon excited auto-fluorescence) can offer an attractive solution here, which is non-invasive and enables the detection of microscopic tissue changes in real-time. However, the implementation of nonlinear imaging procedures in an endoscopic design for hard-to-reach tissue sites is still a technological challenge. The present research work presents a fiber-based approach for a multimodal, endoscopic probe, where a multi-core fiber is used to guide the excitation lasers and specially designed GRIN lenses take over the beam formation in the probe head. The probe design is completely without movable parts or the use of electrical power, so that a robust and compact design is achieved. The functionality of the probe is demonstrated with multimodal recordings of thin sections of human skin tissue as well as fresh tissue samples of a pig. Based on the results, it can be shown that multimodal recordings with the presented probe are qualitatively comparable to conventional LSM recordings, and a faster imaging is possible. Thus, the presented probe design has a high potential to be used in future clinical routine examinations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055510-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014670-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056138-0>
Error Culture in Organizations: An Organizational Ethnographic Study in Stationary Elderly Care ¤ The focus of this study is on the interconnection of error culture with decision-making and action practices in an elderly and care facility. For this purpose, a pedagogical organizational ethnography was chosen as an exploratory approach to the research subject, which provides a deep insight into the social world of elderly care. The core is a conceptual representation of field-specific practices and a subject-related theory development, which was implemented in the sense of Grounded Theory. The genuine dilemma of elderly care between profitability and care ethos leads to practice patterns that, as problem-solving strategies, also shape the error culture. The author Dr. Kerstin Bestvater has been a scientific staff member at the Research and Development Department in Organizations at the University of Koblenz-Landau since 2016, which she has been leading since 2020. Her teaching and research focuses are organizational pedagogy, error and organizational culture, responsibility and sustainability.

A Contribution to the Investigation of the Aerodynamic Properties of Vehicles under Böing Side Wind ¤ Aerodynamic development tools -- Design of an active system for generating side wind in a wind tunnel -- Investigations of the transmission behavior of the wind tunnel jet -- Investigations of the DrivAer notchback model in different test environments. Daniel Stoll investigates the side wind sensitivity of vehicles and the influence of the wind tunnel environment on the measured transient forces and moments using experimental and corresponding numerical methods. He presents an approach to describe the wind tunnel jet using methods of linear time-invariant system theory. This allows him to show that the flow field in a wind tunnel with an open test section has a dynamic behavior that overlaps with the behavior of the vehicle under side wind excitation. With the presented validated simulation model and the numerical simulation environment without interference effects, it is possible for the first time to determine the aerodynamic transmission behavior of a vehicle. The work makes a decisive contribution to the future development of the transient aerodynamic vehicle properties.

Development of Basic Solid Catalysts for Industrial Applications ¤ Within this work, mixed oxides obtained from hydrotalcite precursors with various cation compositions as well as basic zeolites with faujasite structure were investigated for their catalytic activity in the transesterification of triglycerides and in the aldol condensation of n-butanal. The hydrotalcite precursors were synthesized via co-precipitation and converted into mixed oxides by calcination. The mixed oxides and hydrotalcites were thoroughly characterized by elemental analysis, powder X-ray diffraction, coupled TG/DSC/MS measurements, and N2 adsorption measurements. In total, the synthesis of hydrotalcites and mixed oxides with various Mg/Al ratios as well as the heteroatoms Fe, Cr, Y, La, Er was realized. Mixed oxides with high Mg/Al ratios showed high catalytic activity in the aldol condensation, while the basic zeolites and lanthanide-containing mixed oxides had very good transesterification activities. <dt.>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123377-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4324196-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170118-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4661178-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4265450-6>

Genetic and biochemical basis of indole alkaloid formation in Basidiomycetes and biotechnological production of psilocybin ¤ In the present work, the structural diversity and the genetic and enzymatic bases of indole alkaloid biosynthesis in Basidiomycetes in Psilocybe spp. were investigated. Through in silico analyses and heterologous expression, it was possible to clarify the biosynthesis of psilocybin, identify the responsible genes, and biochemically and phylogenetically characterize the resulting enzymes. The psilocybin biosynthesis is catalyzed by four enzymes, namely the L-tryptophan decarboxylase PsiD, the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase PsiH, the kinase PsiK, and the N-methyltransferase PsiM, which are unique secondary metabolite enzymes and whose substrate specificities established a sequence deviating from the previously postulated biosynthesis. Based on the knowledge gained from the psilocybin biosynthesis, the successful development of several in vitro and in vivo routes for psilocybin and the three non-natural derivatives Isonorbaeocystin, 5-methylpsilocybin, and 6-methylpsilocybin was described. This could be the basis for the further development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly production methods for the highly relevant pharmaceutical natural product. The generated derivatives could also help to better understand serotonergic neurotransmission in humans. The results obtained in this work could help to ensure the supply of psilocybin, which could support the conduct of further clinical studies. In a repeated secondary metabolome analysis of various Psilocybe species, in addition to other indole alkaloids, various β-carbolines were identified, which as potent monoamine oxidase inhibitors may possibly have an as yet undiscovered synergistic effect on the effect of psilocybin.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176170-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161560-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077821-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006902-3>
Family Work in Strategic Youth Therapy: An Evaluation of Psychotherapeutic Work with Youth and Their Significant Others ¤ Youth time with its numerous developmental tasks poses particular challenges to young people and their significant others. Psychological symptoms are to be understood as an attempt to escape. With the Strategic Youth Therapy (SJT®), healthy development is to be put back on track. The SJT® aims, in addition to symptom reduction, to improve the regulation of emotions and relationship design of young people. At the same time, the therapy supports development-promoting parental behavior. Sandra Peukert presents her evaluation study as a comprehensive and integrative therapeutic method for psychotherapeutic work with young people and their families. In doing so, the author explains the development of attachment, emotion regulation, and relationship design theoretically and describes the role of parents as the central socialization agency. In a practical way, she deals with therapy goals and treatment planning and sketches the therapy components of individual and group therapy with young people as well as parental and family work in the part-time station setting. Finally, the results of the conducted effectiveness check of the SJT® are presented.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028924-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123183-1>
Effective internal control and corporate compliance : a law and economics impact analysis of the mysteries of a German Aktiengesellschaft listed on the NYSE ¤ The work investigates the prerequisites including best practices for an effective internal control and compliance system in Germany and the USA. The four pillars of an effective system and a test to verify its effectiveness are developed. In addition, the effects of U.S. regulations on German listed companies that are also listed on the NYSE, and the importance of these legal transplants for German corporate governance are examined. The influence of U.S. regulations on German corporate governance, as well as the incentives for companies to establish an effective internal control and compliance system, are worked out with the help of economic analysis of the law. From this, proposals for changes in German and U.S. law are developed, so that companies receive a higher incentive to implement an effective internal control and compliance system to ensure lawful behavior.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4442497-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000937-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125994-4>
Development of a CAE Tool for the Design of Flight Control and Hydraulic Systems ¤ The practical support of the engineer in the design of flight control and hydraulic systems - including the computer - is the focus of this work. Starting from the data that are set during the aircraft design for a new aircraft project. From this, the requirements for the flight control system are derived: What moment is necessary to move the control surfaces of the aircraft in all flight situations? At what speed must the control surfaces be released? What influence does the required reliability have on the design? With the help of these considerations, the hydraulic, linear actuators of the flight control can then be dimensioned and integrated into the wings or tailplanes. Furthermore, the connection of the actuators to the energy systems and computers of the aircraft is investigated. With the help of a stationary calculation, the hydraulic system is designed. Finally, it is shown how the design of the aircraft systems can be economically evaluated based on the "Direct Operating Costs".	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143715-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113196-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127621-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154782-2>
Child and Youth Poverty in Germany ¤ Until the end of the 1970s, it was assumed in many Western industrialized countries that child and youth poverty was exclusively a phenomenon that occurred in so-called developing countries. It is only today that the realization is gaining ground that there is a poverty problem in Germany as well - with far-reaching consequences for the affected children and young people. Restrictions in the living and leisure areas, poor academic performance, unfavorable starting conditions for education and career, and negative health effects are still widespread but not inevitable consequences of child and youth poverty, as presented in the current volume. After a comprehensive theoretical clarification of what is understood by poverty today and who is affected by poverty, the author deals with the extent, causes, consequences, and possible approaches to preventing child and youth poverty in Germany. - Structures and conditions of growing up in children and young people - Poverty and social disadvantage: sociopolitical discussions and definitions - Poverty and social disadvantage: socioscientific discussions and definitions - Socioscientific definitions of poverty - Results of poverty measurement - The project \	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030550-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002963-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028859-6>
Social Capital and Political Orientations of Young People in Germany ¤ Associations, trust, norms, and values ? in short: social capital ? are the key to the functioning of modern democracies; so concludes Robert Putnam in his intensive engagement with the Italian regional administrative reform. Subsequently, in many political science research works, it was investigated to what extent associations function as ?schools of democracy?, social trust acts as a ?lubricant in the machinery of the social system?, and cooperative norms form the ?moral foundations? of social coexistence. Although it is assumed that social capital already represents an important resource in youth, only adults were the focus of such studies. Therefore, Julia Schäfer examines the causal relationships to which social capital is subject in the youth phase. Based on seven youth studies, the conditions and consequences of social capital in youth are considered. It shows that social capital plays an important role in political socialization, but is already clearly dependent on the overall resource equipment. - Social capital concepts in political culture research and youth research - Social capital among young people - Conditions of social capital among young people - Consequences of social capital among young people - Social capital in the youth phase	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028859-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076217-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4510173-5>
Model of the Properties of Modular Product Structures ¤ Introduction -- Background to the problem field -- State of the art -- Model of modular product structures -- Application of the model to a product family of vacuum cleaning robots -- Evaluation of the model -- Conclusion. The present book contains a generic model that defines the properties of modular product structures as causes and links them to subsequent effects in various business areas. The model pairs specific effects with resulting economic effects for companies. For example, decoupling modules enables the possibility of parallel development of modules in the product development phase, resulting in a shortening of the development time. The model combines numerous such cause-effect chains into a cohesive model. It shows cause-effect chains in the product life cycles of product development, procurement, production, sales, and use and service. The contribution of the model lies in the connection of the data to a comprehensive picture and the visualization, which enables a generic view of these cause-effect relationships. The gained transparency improves decision-making ability in designing product family structures. The author Jennifer Hackl studied mechanical engineering with a focus on product development at the Technical University of Hamburg (TUHH). There, she worked as a research assistant at the Institute for Product Development and Construction Technology from 2012 to 2017. During this time, she worked in the research field of developing modular product families, in which both the processing of projects for developing modular product families took place, as well as the research work for the present book was carried out. After completing her activity at the TUHH, she worked initially as a project engineer in the modular product design of a mechanical engineering company in the drive technology, before she took over the leadership of the corresponding team.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4240639-0>
Peer Education & Violence Prevention : Theory and Practice presented at the Project Schlag.fertig ¤ The book deals with the topic of violence in adolescence and the peer approach. Detailed theoretical explanations are made about peer involvement, respectively. peer education as a pedagogical method, which is applied in an increasing number of projects. In this context, the peer approach is considered in terms of its practical relevance for participatory work with children and adolescents and especially in terms of its possibilities for violence prevention. The topic of youth violence, which has increasingly come into focus in public and media, is presented and analyzed under consideration of causes and origin and actual occurrence. Characteristics of adolescence, current violence statistics and violence in school are in the focus here. A special focus of the book lies on the connection between peer education and violence prevention. For this purpose, the violence prevention project 'Schlag.fertig' is presented and evaluated. Empirically, the question is addressed whether violence prevention in school can be practiced with the help of peer education. For this purpose, data from school classes are examined that have participated in a 'Schlag.fertig' prevention action. In the 'Schlag.fertig' project, former violent adolescents are trained and develop prevention actions, which they then carry out with school classes. The students of these actions are questioned in writing at three points in time with regard to their own (violence) behavior and in terms of the effectiveness of the prevention actions. Both the theoretical foundations and the results of the evaluation are examined in terms of their practical relevance and the possibilities of transfer as well as in terms of critical aspects.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028859-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053474-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157237-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076308-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075968-4>

Carl Schmitt's Role in the Consolidation of Power of the National Socialists: A Temporary Engagement ¤ Stefan Hermanns sketches a Weimar Republic in a state of exception and chooses the historical site as a starting point, with the goal of bridging the hardened fronts that have existed to this day and approaching the topic in a positive and naive way. He shows that Carl Schmitt's article 'The Leader Protects the Law' became the turning point in his life. Hermanns describes Schmitt's steep but short career within the National Socialist system and investigates the questions of whether Schmitt developed new ideas at this time, adapted his teaching to the National Socialists, or revealed himself as an anti-Semite. In addition, he questions which criticisms of Schmitt and his engagement are verifiable and which have only been reproduced over time. The content • Carl Schmitt and the State of Exception in the Weimar Republic • 'The Leader Protects the Law' • Schmitt on the eve of his defamation • Carl Schmitt, National Socialism, and the Jews • Carl Schmitt, Rudolf Augstein, and the Spiegel The target groups • Lecturers and students of political science, history, and law • Practitioners with an interest in the Weimar Republic, the political upheaval, and the young Federal Republic of Germany The author Stefan Hermanns researches, in particular, Carl Schmitt and his teaching on the state of exception with an interdisciplinary approach, understanding theory and person in the social and historical context.

The Parliamentary State Secretaries in the Federal Government: A Developmental History since 1967 ¤ The introduction of the institution of the Parliamentary State Secretary remained the only significant structural change to the parliamentary government system since the existence of the Federal Republic of Germany. As a prelude to a comprehensive reform of government organization, whose rest never followed, the creation of the office in 1967 was linked to clear goals: relieving ministers, testing ministerial staff, depoliticizing civil service state secretaries, and improving the connection between government and parliament. The institution, however, took its own development, determined solely by political practice. Not for nothing is this office probably the one in the Federal Republic that is under constant justification pressure and is repeatedly declared unnecessary from various sides. Nevertheless, it was never really endangered in its existence. Because the statutory provisions for the selection of office holders remained as minimal as the office contents, maximum freedom was created for the design of this office. At the interface between parliament, government, and parties, the office has sometimes become the end stage on the career ladder of federal political elite, a plaything of patronage. On a broad empirical basis, Julia Hefty examines the institution and its development from its introduction in the Grand Coalition of 1967 to the present day.(Source: Booklet Publisher).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173375-7>
Hydrogen in V-Fe thin films and Fe/V-Fe multi-layered thin films ¤ In this work, hydrogen-induced biaxial stress and local distribution of hydrogen in V-Fe films and V-Fe/Fe multi-layered films were investigated. The stress development and relaxation behavior in the films were interpreted by combining in-situ stress, in-situ acoustic emission, and in-situ XRD measurements. The stress development of V-Fe thin layers thinner than 100 nm showed remarkable correlation with defect-H interaction at very low concentrations. With increasing H concentration, intermittent stress relaxation due to restoration of intrinsic dislocations was found, until the film relaxed at the stage of hydride formation. The V-Fe/Fe multi-layered films showed enormous tensile stress on hydrogen loading, which was considered to be due to preferred site occupation of hydrogen in the lattice ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014002-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187375-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4244347-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064784-5>
Fabrication of functional thin-film elements on the front surfaces of optical fibers using high-resolution lithographic structuring techniques ¤ This work deals with the development of technologies for lithographic processes for the production of high-frequency diffractive thin-film elements directly on the front surfaces of optical fibers. For this, optimized lithographic procedures need to be suitably modified for process execution on wafers. This concerns both the production of layers and the adjustable process parameters as well as the process execution. Depending on the materials used and the structure dimensioning, different functionalities of the structured layers can be generated. For illumination, two systems are used. For the production of structures with periods greater than 3 mym, direct writing laser illumination is used at a wavelength of 442 nm. For the generation of high-frequency grids with periods less than 1 mym, DUV interference lithography is used under the use of an excimer laser emitting at a wavelength of 248 nm. At this wavelength, the interferometric structurability of a resist originally specified for electron beam lithography is investigated, which is particularly well suited for the production of structures on the front surfaces of optical fibers due to its properties such as low moisture sensitivity, high long-term stability, good adhesion, and simplified process execution during development. The suitable illumination and other processing parameters for process execution on substrate layers made of different materials are determined for the realization of high-frequency grid structures. The structuring of metallic layers on the front surfaces of optical fibers leads to fiber-based lithography masks, with the help of which efficient and reproducible photolithography on fiber front surfaces is enabled using fiber-to-fiber illumination. Through direct surface structuring of high-frequency grids on quartz glass optical fibers coated with high-refractive-index layers made of As35S65 using excimer laser interference lithography, efficient fiber-coupled grids with high refractive index contrast are generated. Based on such grid structures, wavelength and polarization filters are designed, suitable illumination conditions are determined, and the properties of realized structures are compared with simulation results.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191584-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147542-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4603135-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136339-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174545-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167589-7>
Quintilian Reception by the Founding Dean of the Salana Johann Stigel ¤ Quintilian's Institutio oratoria contains the famous literary chapter in book 10,1. In the present comparison of four commentaries of the Melanchthon school, this chapter is at the center. This makes it clear how Quintilian was understood in the 16th century in Wittenberg and Jena and what benefit one expected from dealing with his writing. Students should be shown, through exemplary speeches of important ancient authors, what they should pay attention to when drafting, style, and delivery of their Latin practice speeches. The clear-thinking and equally formulating Melanchthon is a keyword for the other commentators with his commentary. Among them, Johann Stigel, one of the founding deans of the University of Jena, stands out with his extensive annotations. In his pedagogical presentation of the material, he also shows the connection between rhetoric and higher education. The importance of Stigel's commentary is made clear by the editio princeps of his lecture manuscript. Both this and the mentioned commentaries have been translated into German. The work is aimed at students and teachers who want to inform themselves about the situation of Latin and rhetoric in humanism or about the Praeceptor Germaniae, Philipp Melanchthon. For linguists, it may be interesting that the Institutio oratoria, which was intended as a rhetoric textbook for Latin native speakers, was refunctioned by the commentators into a rhetoric textbook for German Latin speakers. And all this in the time of Luther's Bible translation. A broad index helps with the exploration of the material.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076704-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049716-1>

Characterisation of optical metamaterials : effective parameters and beyond ¤ This work deals with the characterisation of metamaterials. For a more comprehensive introduction to the topic, reference is made to Chapter 1. As artificial media with periods smaller than the relevant wavelength, these are usually described as effectively homogeneous materials. This type of description and its critical examination and evaluation are the focus of Chapters 2-4. In Chapter 2, the foundations for the description of artificial structures using homogeneous Maxwell equations and, in particular, the corresponding material equations are laid. In this chapter, the description of artificial magnetic materials is derived on the basis of a complex, spatially dispersive material response. The material equations obtained for media with weak spatial dispersion are then used in Chapter 3 as the basis for determining the effective properties. The determination is carried out by the so-called S-parameter retrieval, i.e. the inversion of the Fresnel equation for reflection and transmission at an optical layer. This method is also extensively considered from the point of view of generally periodic media, allowing fundamental relationships and, in particular, limitations to be derived. In Chapter 4, the previously provided characterisation methods are applied to metamaterials with increasing symmetry. It is shown that a reduction of the optical response to individual effective material parameters is rarely possible.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547278-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213728-7>
Transparency in the European Union's Cartel Procedure ¤ The concept of transparency has received increased attention in recent years in legal discussions. Although its content is often left undetermined, the concept is closely linked to a fundamental procedural justice, which is of major importance in view of the intensity of the cartel law regulations. The work offers an analysis of the European cartel procedure with the aim of showing, in the light of the primary law transparency principle and taking into account international references, to what extent the European cartel procedure is already designed to be transparent, where transparency deficits exist and how these are to be evaluated when taking into account conflicting interests.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130280-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185917-0>
Output feedback control and robustness in the gap metric ¤ The presented work deals with the design and robustness of three different control strategies for linear differential equation systems with multi-dimensional input and output signals (MIMO): stabilization by output derivative feedback, lambda-tracking and funnel control. In order to achieve the desired stabilization/control of a linear system using these controllers, explicit knowledge of the system matrices is not necessary. Only structural properties of the system need to be known: the relative degree, that the system is minimally phase, and that the so-called "high-frequency gain" matrix is positive definite. These structural properties are treated in detail for MIMO systems in the first chapters of the work. For MIMO systems with non-stiff relative degree, a normal form is derived that has the same properties as the known normal form for SISO systems or MIMO systems with stiff relative degree. The normal form, as well as minimal phase and positivity of the "high-frequency gain" matrix, form the basis for the above-mentioned control strategies to stabilize systems with these properties in the respective sense. Robustness or robust stabilization describes the following principle: if a closed loop consisting of a linear system and a controller is stable in some sense and the gap metric (distance) between the system considered in the closed loop and another "new" system is sufficiently small, then the closed loop consisting of the "new" system and the same controller is again stable. The same statement also holds for the case where the controller and not the system is exchanged. - For output derivative feedback, it is shown that, if this stabilizes a system, the occurring derivatives of the output can be replaced by Euler approximations of the derivatives, if these are sufficiently accurate. For lambda-tracking and funnel control, it is shown that both controllers can also be used for the stabilization of linear systems that have a small distance to a system that satisfies the above conditions, even if these conditions are not satisfied.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4452554-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177447-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4206985-3>
School Competitions as a Catalyst for School Development: Perspectives of Participants of the German School Prize ¤ The German School Prize in Public and Research -- School Competitions: Research Status and Scientific Discourse -- School Development: Individual School Development in the Context of the System.

Constitutional Judges between Free Expression, Bias, and Constitutional Loyalty ¤ Constitutional judges must be exceptionally well-suited and have made themselves known through prominent expressions of opinion before their election – what follows from this for the unbiased evaluation of the questions presented to them? The reader gains a critical overview of the chronology of constitutional court bias and exclusion. The investigation develops solutions for problematic constellations from about 50 decisions of the Federal Constitutional Court itself and, in line with the topos of constitutional loyalty, makes the principle of mutual consideration of the constitutional organs usable for these questions. It contributes to shaping public opinion on when an unbiased decision-making process can be assumed and makes the principle of mutual consideration of the constitutional organs usable for these questions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144276-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038463-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4470590-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4689768-9>

A Peer-to-Peer-based Approach for the Live Transmission of Multimedia Data Streams ¤ Stability and network efficiency are the most important properties of distribution topologies in peer-to-peer-based live transmission of multimedia data. Stability, both against random node failures and targeted sabotage attacks, is a condition for commercial use, high network efficiency is a prerequisite for the performance and scalability of the service provided. A reliable localization service with low response times and the procedure for constructing distribution topologies are the decisive functional areas to achieve these required properties. Previous approaches for overlay streaming systems focus either on constructing efficient topologies or on stability against random node failures. This dissertation describes a new approach for overlay streaming, which constructs topologies that are both network-efficient and stable against random failures and targeted attacks. The contribution of the work is divided into five points. A formal model for describing localization and streaming overlays is developed. With this, existing metrics are formally defined and two new metrics are proposed: hop_penalty, which measures network efficiency, and resistance as a metric for the attack stability of streaming topologies. Using the model, different topology classes are investigated and central properties are identified that significantly affect the efficiency and stability of the topologies. From these properties, an optimally stable topology class for streaming overlays is derived. It is further formally described, and principles for its construction are given. A localization service that distinguishes itself by high hit rates and low response times is designed and specified. Finally, with the knowledge of optimally stable and efficient topologies, a distributed procedure for constructing network-efficient and stable streaming overlays is developed. It optimizes topologies based solely on local knowledge of the nodes and uses a total cost function that combines individual cost metrics both to reduce dependencies between nodes and path coverage as well as to minimize path distances. This enables optimization of topologies for high stability, high network efficiency, or adjustable trade-offs between them. To evaluate the proposed distributed procedures, an extensive simulation study is conducted. The results show that the localization service distinguishes itself by lower response times and a higher hit rate than comparable systems. The evaluation of the procedure for constructing streaming overlays is performed by investigating the topologies generated by it in simulations on their network efficiency and resistance. It can be proven that the procedure constructs very stable or very efficient topologies and also enables adjustable trade-offs between stability and efficiency.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4841015-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4835035-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4208537-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4343110-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195351-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4614855-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4770227-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4496068-2>
Internationalization Strategies in the Trade Fair Industry ¤ Internationalization is rapidly gaining importance in the German trade fair and exhibition industry. In parallel to the increase in the internationalization rate of domestic trade fairs, trade fair companies have begun to internationalize their trade fair concepts in such a way that they also appear as trade fair organizers abroad. Norbert Stoeck analyzes the importance of internationalization in the trade fair industry and shows the challenges that arise from this process. The author develops an integrated strategy systematics for trade fair companies that plan to expand their in-house event activities abroad. In addition, influencing factors and empirically based action recommendations for the design of such a strategy are presented. "The consistent decision-oriented approach, above all, but also the theoretically and empirically based action recommendations demonstrate the high practical orientation and make the work equally interesting for theorists and practitioners."

The tectonic evolution of the southeastern Terceira Rift/São Miguel region (Azores) and associated submarine volcanic & sedimentary processes ¤ BEGIN The Terceira Rift extends along the westernmost section of the Eurasian-Nubian (African) plate boundary. At a right angle to the prevailing extension direction, it connects the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, briefly MAR, with the area of the Gloria Fault, in which the plate boundary is formed by a transform fault. This work thus provides a comprehensive study of the processes that shape the origin of the Azores Islands and their submarine environment. These processes include the geodynamics in the archipelago area and the plate kinematics of the adjacent tectonic plates, local tectonics, volcanism, oceanic currents, turbidity currents, as well as destructive processes, such as shelf erosion, subsidence, and mass accumulations.

Investment Protection and Business Foundation ¤ Various national legal orders provide for a fundamental change of circumstances, as does public international law in Art. 62 of the VCLT. However, can a host state invoke Art. 62 of the VCLT against a foreign investor to justify new legislation during an economic crisis? Is the VCLT’s rule applicable against a private individual or entity?This thesis examines the field in which public international law and private law intersect, unravelling the different issues underlying this question. In an abstract theoretical analysis, it finds that Art. 62 of the VCLT is also applicable in a mixed arbitration. Consequently, its concrete application to the cases filed against Spain’s withdrawal from solar power promotion demonstrates that Art. 62 of the VCLT is in fact the more appropriate solution, as opposed to state necessity or the FET standard.

The Irresponsibility at Plato: On the Problem of Akrasia in Protagoras ¤ Gang Yi presents a new perspective from which the problem of the so-called conflict between Plato's rejection of akrasia in Protagoras and his recognition of akrasia in Politeia is considered. He combines philological analysis of the original text with philosophical treatment of the theme. The two-level structure of hedonism is thus clearly expressed. With these results, the Socratic rejection of akrasia is justified on a new level against the objections of interpreters such as Irwin, Vlastos, and Manuwald. The Content The concept of akrasia The relationship between the problem of akrasia and that of the unity of the parts of virtue No one goes voluntarily bad: Two Socratic paradoxes Interpretations of Socrates' rejection of akrasia in research A two-level structure of hedonism in Protagoras A new solution to the problem of rejecting akrasia in Protagoras The target groups Lecturers and students of philosophy, classical philology, and ethics The author Gang Yi studied philosophy and ancient Greek at Heidelberg University and received his doctorate there on Platonic philosophy. He works as an Associate Professor at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. His focuses are Plato, Aristotle, and ethics.

Quantum Optics in Schools: A Mixed-Methods Study on the Evaluation of the Erlangen Teaching Concept for Quantum Optics ¤ Quantum physics already forms the foundation of numerous current technologies. Future quantum technologies, such as quantum computers, will gain importance both in industry and for society. In many national and international school curricula, quantum physics has meanwhile become a fixed topic for physics lessons. However, despite the enormous increase in importance of quantum technologies, teaching quantum physics at schools is still dominated by semi-classical models and quasi-historical approaches, while modern concepts of quantum physics are often disregarded. The result is often classically mechanistic conceptions of learners about quantum physics. This work builds on this: with the Erlangen teaching concept for quantum optics, a concept is presented with which learners in the upper secondary school can learn quantum effects through quantum-optical experiments. Concepts of quantum optics, such as the preparation of quantum states, anti-correlation at the beam splitter, and single-photon interference, help learners to form a modern image of quantum physics. In the framework of a summative evaluation in the mixed-methods design with 171 students, it was shown that learners with the Erlangen teaching concept can arrive at quantum-physically dominated conceptions and widespread learning difficulties can be avoided.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047990-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045977-9>

Man and Story: Helmuth Plessner, Paul Ricœur, and Literary Anthropology ¤ Man lives naturally in and with stories. Through narratives, he determines who or what he thinks he is and who or what he is. The investigation examines the anthropological and subjectivity-theoretical foundations and functions of storytelling by systematically combining Helmuth Plessner's philosophical anthropology with Paul Ricœur's narrative theory and current literary theoretical approaches. Analyses of human images in (post-)modern and contemporary literature show that the attempts to determine them, as well as the perceived ungraspabilities, also affect the literary forms and appropriations of the narrative – and ultimately produce an eccentric telling. 1.

Mobile Ions in Homogeneous and Nanostructured Polymer Electrolytes: Mobility, Polarization of Inner Interfaces, and Orientation ¤ polymer electrolytes; ion-mobility; time-of-flight; block copolymer; Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars polarization; electric field; alignment; orientation This work deals with ionic transport and polarization effects by mobile ions in homogeneous and nanostructured polymers. In the first part, a new method for the separate determination of charge carrier concentration and ion mobility in polymer electrolytes at low salt content is presented. This electrical method is based on polarization and transient current measurements with high applied voltages. These voltages allow all mobile ions to be transported from the volume of the electrolyte to the electrode. In this case, the integral over the measured polarization current is directly proportional to the concentration of free and mobile ions in the sample. The prepared charge distribution serves as a defined initial state for transient current measurements with reversed voltage. Based on a qualitative model for charge dynamics, a value for ion mobility can be obtained from the current curve in these voltage reversal measurements. This method is demonstrated exemplarily on a polymethylmethacrylate doped with different concentrations of lithium salt. The independently obtained values for charge carrier concentration, mobility, and conductivity are consistent. On the other hand, we investigated the interface polarization in a nanostructured polymer electrolyte based on a lamellar block copolymer and the effect of this interface polarization on the orientation of the lamellae in high electric fields. It is first shown that the chosen model system polystyrene-block-polymethylmethacrylate with added lithium salt selectively dissolves in the polymethylmethacrylate domains. Impedance spectroscopy combined with frequency- and field-strength-dependent orientation experiments allow for a quantitative analysis of the ionic polarization occurring at the inner interfaces and a direct demonstration of its orienting effect. The observed time constant of the ionic polarization is greater than predicted by the usual Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars description and is attributed to diffusion effects. The stronger orienting effect of ionic compared to dielectric interface polarization opens up a new possibility of orienting ion-conducting microdomains.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162305-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175165-6>
Influence of NADPH Oxidases on Cell Proliferation, Differentiation, and Migration: Investigated in a Murine In-Vitro Model of Embryoid Body ¤ Reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated by the enzyme complex NADPH oxidase (NOX), can act as second messengers and regulate cellular processes. In the present study, the influence of NADPH oxidases NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4 on cardiac and vascular differentiation in the murine in-vitro model of embryoid body (EB) of the embryonic CGR8 stem cell line was investigated in two independent experiments: (I) Inhibition of NOX activity by DPI, Apocynin, and AEBSF and (II) Establishment of CGR8 stem cell lines, which suppress the expression of NOX1, NOX2, or NOX4 using shRNA. For the investigation of differentiation, the endothelial marker PECAM-1 was used for vascular, and alpha-Actinin, beta-MHC, and the counting of contracting areas for cardiac differentiation in the EBs. The appearance of different NOXes was measured over 14 days using real-time PCR, where NOX1 and NOX4 showed a maximum on the 6th day, but NOX2 showed a maximum on the 10th day of differentiation in the EBs. The measurement of ROS in the EBs also showed a maximum on the 6th day. DPI showed the strongest effect on the differentiation of EBs. The contractility of EBs was reduced by 20%, while Apocynin and AEBSF had no effect on cardiac differentiation in the EBs. Furthermore, the suppression of NOX4 clarified that it is responsible for the formation of the contractile apparatus during cardiac differentiation. The number of contracting areas was reduced by 60% and the expression of alpha-Actinin and beta-MHC was significantly restricted. In vascular differentiation, the inhibition of NOX1 delayed the formation of blood vessel-like structures. These selected results demonstrate the achievement of the work goal, contributing to the clarification of cardiac and vascular differentiation in dependence on ROS.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4699648-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274582-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121138-8>
J.R.R. Tolkien : Romantic and Lyricist ¤ In Joseph v. Eichendorffs (1788–1857) known poem, the core of the romantic worldview is embedded: a transcendent secret surrounds humans and can be awakened through poetry, thereby enchanting the world again. The historical era of Romanticism can be dated to the first half of the 19th century, but a romantic attitude is also found in numerous representatives of later times, including the work of the British author J.R.R. Tolkien (1892-1973). The consideration of Tolkien as a Romantic represents a previously little-noticed reading. Based on a definition of the romantic attitude, this work presents the romantic motives in Tolkien's fantasy theory („On Fairy-stories“) and his literary work. As Tolkien's romantic spirit is particularly reflected in his previously little-appreciated lyric poetry, his songs and poems are extensively appreciated and interpreted. Julian Eilmann's study thus represents the first comprehensive appreciation of the Romantic and lyricist Tolkien. Furthermore, the romantic motives in classics of fantasy literature such as George MacDonald's Phantastes (1858) or Lord Dunsany's The King of Elfland’s Daughter (1924) are investigated, thereby making the influence of Romanticism on modern fantasy as a whole clear. Tolkien's literary defense of creative fantasy and his immense popularity make him one of the most influential representatives of the romantic worldview in the 20th and 21st centuries.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036774-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050491-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201485-2>

Titan-Catalyzed Hydroamination of Alkenes and Alkynes in Drug Synthesis ¤ Within the scope of this work, titan complexes regarding their activity for the hydroamination of alkenes were investigated and compared. It turned out that all investigated complexes show catalytic activity in the conversion of Amino-2,2-diphenylpent-4-en. The main part of the present work deals with the synthesis of 1-Benzylisochinolin derivatives with electron-poor as well as electronically neutral A-ring. Furthermore, the electronic situation at the C-ring could be varied. The connection of the A- and C-rings was carried out by a Sonogashira reaction. The B-ring was built up by an intramolecular hydroamination. The thus obtained 1-Benzyl-3,4-dihydroisochinolin derivatives were directly reduced to the 1-Benzyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisochinolin derivatives or oxidized to the 1-Benzoyl-3,4-tetrahydroisochinolin derivatives. Finally, the synthesis could be significantly simplified by the development of a one-pot procedure. This includes two Sonogashira couplings as well as a desilylation reaction and provides a fast and efficient access to differently substituted bisarylalkynes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4223132-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001207-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4749938-2>
Investigations on novel oxygen-substituted donors and acceptors for singlet oxygen ¤ Throughout this work, aromatics such as naphthalene and anthracene were converted with singlet oxygen, a reactive form of ordinary oxygen, to so-called endoperoxides. The systems used here were modified with functional groups linked to the aromatics via an oxygen bridge. The resulting endoperoxides are mostly highly labile and could be isolated and comprehensively investigated in this work. In this process, the reaction behavior was investigated. It was shown that the aromatics react with singlet oxygen at different rates depending on their functional groups. The thus determined reactivities were additionally supported by theoretical calculations. The resulting endoperoxides were investigated under various conditions such as increased temperature or an acidic or basic environment for their stability.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326498-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174537-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142626-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4227240-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4181538-5>

Methods of Soft Computing for Regulation and Diagnosis of Magnetic Bearings ¤ There is a worldwide trend to use active magnetic bearings to avoid mechanical friction and wear, as well as to enable adjustable system stiffness and damping. Such systems are currently regulated using fixed-control-design or linear strategies, which use frequency filters with low efficiency, limited cutoff frequency, and reliability in the conventional control concept. The industrial use of active magnetic bearings in conjunction with the technological process, especially under load, fault, and influence of strong noise, presents a high demand for the stability of positioning, functional reliability, and smooth operation. This leads to a significant renewal of the control concept compared to conventional control concepts. Thus, stable magnetic bearings and controllability of dynamic properties up to the technical limit are enabled. In this work, a new control concept is developed using soft computing and implemented at the test facility FLP 500 at the Institute for Process Technology, Process Automation, and Measurement Technology of the University of Applied Sciences Zittau / Görlitz. In particular, the integration of soft computing into the regulation, filtering, and online identification technology in the system is offered. The leadership behavior, disturbance behavior, the rotation test, and identification test are carried out. The identification test presents the results of online identification with sufficient speed and robustness against process noise. The further test results show that the stability of positioning with a variable operating point or the smooth operation, especially under the condition of strong process noise, under the influence of electronic or mechanical eigenoscillations, measurement noise, and measurement disturbance in sensorics, are significantly optimized. Due to the adaptability, the magnetic bearing is also significantly less susceptible to variations in operating points. The advantage of state observation is utilized by applying the Kalman filter. In this way, the almost complete elimination of disturbance and signal falsification in measurement signals is possible. Investigations carried out in the real test stand demonstrate the practical applicability of the concept.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000457-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121753-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114487-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130759-8>
Copyright Systems and Collective Rights Management in Southeastern Europe ¤ This publication casts a glance beyond the great European collecting societies and contributes to the transparency of the perception systems of young and future EU member states. Since Slovenia and Bulgaria's accession, the EU has also extended to the Southeastern European region. Nevertheless, in EU scientific circles, collective rights management of copyrights and related rights in Southeastern Europe is largely unknown. In the last twenty years, a diverse and partly specific landscape of collecting societies has emerged there, whose legal foundations and peculiarities deserve a scientific appreciation. This treatise also addresses the question of how these collecting societies can find their place in the context of the increasingly strong need for cross-border licensing in the online area and the trend towards more competition between collecting societies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062127-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063381-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1033443778>
The Social Responsibility of Capital Companies in the Context of the European CSR Directive ¤ This work analyzes the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in a fundamental way and subjects the European CSR Directive as well as its effects on the German legal system to a thorough and critical examination. This includes not only questions of company and constitutional law, but also those of general state theory, legal philosophy, and business ethics. The work is therefore not only addressed to legal scholars, but can be of interest to business ethicists and economists and political scientists due to its interdisciplinary approach.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7697760-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129472-5>
Integration of Heterogeneous Spatial Objects from Fragmented Geodatasets ¤ The task of integrating heterogeneous spatial objects from fragmented geodatasets, which is encountered in various forms in practice, is analyzed and solved in this work. Starting from an analysis of the applications of geometric integration, various process models for solving the integration problem are shown. The three essential steps of geometric integration are the assignment problem of homologous spatial objects, the search for implicit geometric relationships, and the determination and implementation of a transformation that converts all source datasets into a homogeneous target dataset. A simple model of a map is defined, in which geometric integration is represented as a transformation problem between the idealized true map, which is only partially given in practice, and multiple realizations of maps that are distorted by random and unknown systematic errors. In the statistical model, the relationship between the true map and its realizations is perceived as a vector spatial random process and is investigated using the methods of geostatistics and classical estimation procedures. A significant result is a statistical justification and modeling of the distance-dependent relative positional accuracy (neighborhood accuracy) in spatial datasets. Based on this hypothesis, two transformation models are proposed using intrinsic kriging and colocation. As an alternative to stochastic modeling, the deterministic model of the topology of the Euclidean plane is considered ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197730-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4261642-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020202-1>
Leadership Practice and Future Shaping in Family Businesses: Traditional Thinking and Action Patterns Under Scrutiny ¤ Change drivers as harbingers of pattern change -- The structural leadership dilemma -- Two promising leadership relationships -- Empirical search for change patterns -- Approaches for future research. Aaron Brückner shows that family businesses are faced with the paradoxical challenge of having to become a conglomerate without becoming one. The traditional thinking and action patterns of the person-oriented 'success recipe' of family businesses are under scrutiny, and two leadership relationships are discussed that accept the family and the company as co-evolutionary units. The directing Chairman and the professional successor reveal that the cooperation environment can benefit from both family-foreign management resources and entrepreneurial family resources in coping with the change from family-like to organizational leadership relationships.

Evaluation of the Health Status of Dairy Herds Based on Farm Indicators Before and After Intervention with a Clostridium Vaccine ¤ Worldwide, diseases in cattle herds caused by pathogenic agents of the genus Clostridium are feared due to massive animal losses and economic losses. Clostridium vaccines offer prophylactic protection for endangered herds. The influence of Clostridium vaccines on the health and performance of dairy herds suspected of chronic botulism or HBS is still not clarified. The aim of the study was the retrospective collection of the health status of affected dairy herds based on selected indicators before and after a Clostridium vaccination and the comparison of the results with the subjective impressions of farmers. [...] Overall, the health status of the investigated dairy herds in the test period after vaccination intervention appears to be unchanged based on the selected health and performance indicators, the subjective impression of the farmers could not be proven (Source: Author).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026656-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148085-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138548-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020754-7>

Unionsbürgerschaft und Migration im aktuellen Europarecht ¤ Migration is one of today’s major subjects, whose legal processing follows two different regimes: one for EU citizens and another for third-country nationals. Both topics are currently in a state of flux. The legal position of EU citizens needs to be re-determined after a restrictive turn in the ECJ’s case law and the general EU crisis. The rules for third-country nationals are in upheaval as a result of Europeanisation and the EU’s refugee policy. This anthology links the two developments with contributions from aspiring young academics. While the articles in the first part deal with the concept of EU citizenship, the texts in the second part focus on selected problem areas of immigration law in matters of third-country nationals.With contributions by:Daniel Thym, Tobias Klarmann, Maria Florentia Haag, Kathrin Hamenstädt, Kevin Fredy Hinterberger, Joshua Lessmann, Christina Neier	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7578209-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0>
The Stolpe Doctrine and its Application to Concealed Statements and Image Reporting ¤ The book deals with the virulent question of whether the Stolpe Doctrine, as a constitutionally developed instrumentarium for the legal treatment of ambiguous statements, can be transferred to the phenomenon of concealed statements and image reporting in order to achieve a rights-compatible expansion of the ambiguity case law in the end. Under the premise of establishing a practical concordance between the freedom of opinion of the person making the statement on the one hand and the general right to personality of the person affected on the other hand, the legal and qua natura existing peculiarities of the respective types of statements as well as their effect on the rights-related positions of the affected actors are taken into account.

Flight and Expulsion in European Museums: German, Polish, and Czech Perspectives in Comparison ¤ Die Ausgestaltung musealer Erinnerungskultur zu Flucht und Vertreibung deutscher Minderheiten am Ende des Zweiten Weltkrieges ist ein umkämpfter Schauplatz - sowohl zwischen Deutschland, Polen und Tschechien, als auch innerhalb der drei Nationen. Vincent Regente arbeitet in seiner Studie die Ursachen für diesen Konflikt am Beispiel von sieben aktuellen Museumsprojekten in Brüssel, Berlin, Danzig, Kattowitz, Görlitz, Aussig und München erstmalig vergleichend heraus. Durch einen konsequent trinationalen Ansatz, eine erste Historisierung des Diskurses nach 1989 und die Berücksichtigung der zunehmenden Bedeutung der Geschichtspolitik der Europäischen Union liefert er umfassende Einblicke in das Thema	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200793-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1041864515> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129601-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160032-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017598-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070334-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4281014-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063299-4>
Off the Metropolises: The Jewish Minority in Schleswig-Holstein ¤ This comprehensive representation examines the history of the Jewish minority in the region of Schleswig-Holstein from the beginning of the 17th century to the early phase of the Federal Republic. (S. Gülck) This comprehensive representation sets standards, as it is attempted for the first time to comprehensively present the conditions and manifestations of Jewish existence in a primarily rural structured and thus located outside the metropolitan centers of a federal state through an intra-regional comparison. Structures of Jewish life are examined, including both Jewish communities, associations and clubs as well as Jewish families, their friend and acquaintance circles. Special emphasis is placed on the relationship between the long-established German and the Eastern European Jews who immigrated from the 1890s. Another focus is on the relationships between the Jewish minority and the non-Jewish majority society. The period of observation ranges from the beginning of the 17th century to the early phase of the Federal Republic of Germany. The years from 1918 to 1945 are at the center. The study is based on a wide range of newly accessed sources from German, American, and Israeli archives, as well as on 80 interviews with Jewish former residents of Schleswig-Holstein and documents from private ownership. (Publisher's text, partially shortened) Despite its scientific orientation (e.g. the apparatus accounts for almost 1/3 of the scope), the representation is also readable and interesting for a non-scientifically oriented audience. It should at least have its place in larger ÖBs. (S. Gülck)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028808-0>
Oilseed rape in high-intensity crop rotations ¤ In this work, the impact of a self-following of winter rape on yield, yield-forming parameters and root collar and stem rot (Leptosphaeria maculans) was investigated. The investigations were carried out at the location Etzdorf in the winter rape concentration experiment. This was established in 2002 and was based on the crop rotation winter wheat (WW)-WW-WW-winter rape (WRa)-WRa-WRa and a long-term winter rape monoculture. The results show that the yield of winter rape decreases in an increasing self-following, and the lowest yields were determined for the winter rape monoculture. Furthermore, the infection intensity and the severity of the root collar and stem rot increase in self-following. In addition, international crop rotation studies were evaluated in this work. Here it was shown that rape worldwide especially benefits from legume pre-crops and from two- or three-year cropping breaks with higher yields.

Racism as a Flexible Symbolic Resource: A Study on Racist Argumentation Figures ¤ Racism in the midst of society cannot be sufficiently understood by conventional analyses of youth violence and individual-centered interpretations, nor by a racism understanding that is defined by the German National Socialism. The author examines it instead as a societal phenomenon and in its forms variable. The study combines racism concepts (Hall, Miles, Balibar) with Bourdieu's theory of social inequality to an analysis model of racism as a flexible symbolic resource. The empirical part shows in group discussions with academics and professionals how this resource is communicated in the form of specific argumentation figures.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157063-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076527-1>
Computer Criminal Law in Comparative Law - Germany, Austria, Switzerland ¤ BEGIN\nMain description: Daniel Schuh presents the amended (§§ 202a, 303a and b) and newly introduced (§§ 202b and c) provisions of the German Criminal Code, as amended by the 41st Criminal Code Amendment Act, to combat computer crime. After explaining the foundations for the reform (Cybercrime Convention and EU Framework Decision), a comparison is made, using selected examples such as phishing and hacking, with the provisions of our neighboring countries Austria and Switzerland. -- The author concludes that the German norms consistently implement the requirements of the Cybercrime Convention and the EU Framework Decision, effectively combat computer crime, and only require minor adjustments. The regulations in the Austrian and Swiss Criminal Code, on the other hand, reveal gaps in criminal liability. Considering the results, the author ultimately submits proposals for amendments to the German provisions.\nEND	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115712-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057795-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4010452-7>

Fachdidaktische Analyse von Lehrbüchern für den Rechnungswesenunterricht in Deutschland und den USA ¤ In this dissertation, the didactic dimensions of textbooks for accounting education in secondary level II in Germany and the USA are compared with each other. The requirements of accounting didactics and the framework plan for industrial clerks serve as an interpretation of the results. The focus of this textbook analysis lies on the one hand in the examination of the contents and the cognitive requirement level of the accounting books, which was obtained in the framework of a task analysis. On the other hand, elements of learning support are analyzed, namely illustrations, readability, typography, and indexes of accounting books. The investigation provides the empirical foundation of assumptions of accounting didactics, according to which accounting books for German vocational schools establish few connections to other subjects and contents, possess a relatively low student orientation, and exhibit an overwhelmingly low cognitive requirement level. With the description of the balance equation method, a widely practiced approach in the school practice of the USA for introducing accounting is presented, which is largely unknown in Germany, and represents an alternative to the prevailing balance method in German accounting education. The work contains recommendations for action for an improved selection and creation of textbooks or teaching books in accounting, for example, the stronger consideration of readability, which can be measured using readability formulas. The adapted analysis grid for accounting can also serve as a basis for further textbook analyses and textbook comparisons in the commercial education sector.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053458-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048732-5>
Audiovisual Media Rights for Professional Sports Events: The Example of the German Football Bundesliga ¤ The total revenue from the media marketing of the Football Bundesliga amounts to approximately EUR 1.4 billion per season; in comparison, the annual total revenue from television rights in the early years of the Bundesliga 1965/66 was approximately EUR 333,000. Despite this development, neither the national nor the European legal order provides special provisions for the protection of professional sports events, particularly with regard to their audiovisual exploitation. The investigation highlights that neither property nor copyright nor personality rights serve as a suitable legal basis for audiovisual sports media rights, and that the legal positions invoked by the case law in this regard, including house law, unfair competition law, and tort law, prove to be merely patchy makeshift solutions, so that the creation of a special sports event protection law – preferably at the EU level – appears to be indispensable.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130886-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121662-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124238-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061842-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155736-0>
Making Sex Revisited : Deconstruction of Sex from a Biological-Medical Perspective ¤ Sex is socially constructed. That this also applies to biological sex - a postulate of queer-feminist theories - can be proven by this volume for the first time using biological theories. The natural philosophical and biological-medical sex theories of different time periods (Ancient, early Modern, Present) are presented and linked to social sex orders. Heinz-Jürgen Voß presents the competing positions in a differentiated manner and shows: With process-oriented views, many sexes are conceivable in biological theories - instead of just two or three.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4581727-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020555-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054684-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7568353-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041358-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071776-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129772-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006851-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038243-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071781-1>
Biofuels and Land Competition: Social-Ecological Regulation of Land Use in Brazil and the EU ¤ Biofuels as part of climate strategies until 2050 -- Biofuels currently: production, trade and sustainability indicators -- Sustainability rules for biofuels in the EU -- Brazil – a country on an expansion course -- Key players in Brazilian land competition -- Brazil's social-ecological regulation of land use. Nikolaus Ludwiczek shows with his empirical research that the displacement of food production, peasant agriculture and ecologically valuable forest areas can be avoided when expanding biofuel production. The author analyzes the regulation systems of the EU and Brazil and conducts interviews on Brazilian land use with representatives of peasant agriculture, the landless movement, the agricultural business, the sugar and ethanol industry and forest protection organizations.

This also applies to people with learning difficulties, who are mostly employed in workshops or inclusive enterprises. Sarah Karim's ethnographic study examines, following sociological Disability Studies and subjectification and practice theories, how work practices influence the behavior and self-understanding of employees. It is shown in a tangible way that people with learning difficulties are exposed to an ambivalent handling at the workplace. In this way, they develop individual and creative practices to cope with the challenges of specification and inclusion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002818-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005279-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006005-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077349-8>
Duckweed and Azolla as livestock feed for improving resource efficiency and nutritional quality ¤ Klappentext: The floating plants duckweed and Azolla have the potential to produce many times more biomass and protein than conventional crops. They can be used to substitute conventional feed crops in livestock production. Trials with poultry have been conducted, where the offering of both plants was shown to substantially decrease feeding costs and the content of Omega-3 fatty acids in the eggs could be increased.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019014-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139627-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189220-3>
Speaking and Narrating at the Stricker: Communicative Formats in Middle High German Short Narratives ¤ This study highlights the relevance of historical communication pragmatics for the poetics of the Stricker's short narratives, which stand at the beginning of German-language novella literature in the 13th century. In doing so, it presents a new perspective on the widely-held notion that medieval short narratives' interest in linguistic structures is to be interpreted poetically. The narratives, as is demonstrated by the example of the speech acts of advising, disputing, and religious speaking that are treated in them, explore the underlying logics and functional mechanisms of these communicative formats. In this way, the study not only outlines a new approach to the Stricker's work or to the genre of Middle High German short epic poetry and morning song, but also pursues methodically systematic questions in the fields of historical narratology and mediality. In this way, it makes a contribution to central research fields of medieval literary studies beyond the concrete object of investigation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4273141-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129548-1>

Preferences in Group-Housed Laboratory Mice for Various Bedding Structures and Materials ¤ Labor mice, Animal welfare, Bedding preferences. - Bedding is an important environmental factor in the housing of laboratory mice with effects on colony hygiene, health, and physiology of the animals, animal welfare, occupational safety, and research quality. The offer for laboratory animal bedding is diverse, in Europe, wood bedding, increasingly from beech wood, is still the most widely used. This work investigated various types of wood bedding under animal welfare aspects using classical preference tests (parameters: residence times). Unlike in previous studies, the mice were tested in groups of three and a clear distinction was made between the factors bedding structure and bedding material. In total, 252 female mice of the two inbred strains C57BL/6J and BALB/c were tested. In two experimental blocks, nine different wood bedding products were investigated in pairs: in preference test 1 (structural aspect) a fiber structure against three granular structures (fine, medium, coarse), in preference test 2 (material aspect) four coniferous wood products of different structures against structure-equivalent products from leaf (beech) wood. The experiments were conducted in a double cage system, which recorded the residence times on the two alternative choices for each animal individually.

Normalities in Motion : Reconstruction of Narrative Identity of Psychiatric Caregivers ¤ Storytelling is omnipresent in psychiatric care. People being cared for, as well as professionally caring individuals, continuously tell stories – stories about themselves and their lives. This study focuses on the self- and life stories of psychiatric caregivers and explores how these individuals construct their narrative identity. Based on autobiographical-narrative interviews, Nicole Duveneck reconstructs the central meaning-making pattern of identity construction and develops a model that captures the personal narrative identity of psychiatric caregivers as a process of changing and maintaining normality. This result highlights the unbroken power of normality in the psychiatric care system and calls for a critical discourse on and for good psychiatric care, despite the exclusionary practices associated with normality. The author, Nicole Duveneck, is a nursing scientist and professional educator. She currently works as a research assistant at the Institute for Public Health and Nursing Research at the University of Bremen; her research focuses on critical theory development in nursing, qualitative social research, education, and professionalization of nursing, particularly in the field of psychiatric care.

(De-)Thematisierung von Geschlecht : Rekonstruktionen bei Studierenden der Erziehungs- und Bildungswissenschaften ¤ Ihre Stärke [der Arbeit] liegt in der ausführlichen Darstellung, Einordnung und Herleitung des Forschungsgegenstandes sowie der empirischen Methode. Netzwerk Frauen- und Geschlechterforschung NRW 37/2015 The book by Sabine Klinger seeks an answer to the question of how gender is addressed in educational and educational sciences and how students handle gender issues. To this end, the author has conducted an empirical study, which is based on group discussions. In six chapters, she illustrates the results and presents her findings. Newsletter of the Vernetzungsstellefür Gleichberechtigung, Frauen- und Gleichstellungsbeauftragte 9/2014 The work can be read with profit, theoretically and also in terms of illustration. Its result leaves a rather shocking impression. However, this can also lead to new efforts: it can serve as a didactic guide for all those working in the university, especially in pedagogy and educational sciences. It also offers a wealth of suggestions for educators in other fields on how to conduct conversations with young adults about gender, so that the belief in equality no longer covers up the real circumstances. Socialnet.de, 01.09.2014 How is "gender" received by students of educational research, pedagogy and related fields? What are the students' views on gender issues? Based on the observation that interest in gender issues is perceived more as an individual and somewhat anachronistic phenomenon, the empirical study reconstructs the influence of the educational institution university and the study of the specific subject area on students.

The Bundestag as Building Owner in Berlin: Ideas, Concepts, Decisions on Political Architecture (1991-1998) ¤ Against the background of the building history of the Bonn parliamentary buildings and the Reichstag building, the present book examines the numerous ideas, concepts, and decisions with which the commissions convened by the Bundestag's Presidium for the construction of the Bundestag were concerned in the period from 1991 to 1998. At the center of attention is the question of how the Bundestag, in the eyes of a constantly vigilant public, made its decisions in the field of tension between representation claims, functionality, cost awareness, time pressure, and historically burdened building substance. In addition to conceptual questions of relocation and the reconciliation of Bonn and Berlin interests, the book describes the relevant building decisions: from urban planning competition and the construction of new buildings, to the dome and the design of the Federal Eagle, to the color concept in the plenary hall. The decisions made by a small group of deputies at the time shape the external appearance of the German capital and thus an important part of the state's self-presentation and the political architecture of reunified Germany - the 'Berlin Republic'.(Source: Publisher / Dust jacket).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4799769-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173377-0>
Influence of Controlled Charging of Electric Vehicles on Grid Operation under Volatile Wind Power Feed-in ¤ The work summarizes findings on controlled charging of electric vehicles (EVs) under volatile wind power feed-in. Based on the state of the art in controlled EV charging, two operational procedures are shown on the basis of procedures currently under development for the exchange of information between EV and charging point for the negotiation of charging processes. The Wind-2-Vehicle procedure (W2V) is an example of the use of controlled EV charging to realize a regenerative power feed-in demand. The Local Load Management (LLM) is an example of using information from the distribution network to limit the charging power of EVs in time. In a case study, fifty EVs are controlled by a reduced W2V approach. In a second case study, it is shown by time series simulations that controlled and uncontrolled charging can lead to violations of established limits in distribution networks. The application of the developed LLM procedure shows that large and small fleets can be controlled charged with a low reduction of the achievable W2V quality without further violating operationally established limits.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151718-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121178-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4259675-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7708028-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151795-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079329-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057472-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166843-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139998-5>

Social Media and Knowledge Gaps: News Usage and Political Awareness of Young People ¤ Relevance and Functions of News -- News in the Social Web -- News and Political Awareness - Knowledge Gap Perspective -- From „Print vs. TV“ to Individual Content Preferences -- Knowledge Gaps in the Social Web -- Factors for an Illusion of Knowing Patricia Müller examines in her study how the use of news in the Social Web affects the political awareness of young people. The work highlights, based on the knowledge gap research, various factors for political knowledge acquisition: Based on a two-wave panel survey of 16-29-year-olds, the author shows how education, motivation, differential news use, information processing, as well as political conversations and the exchange of politics on Social Network Sites influence the development of knowledge gaps. In addition, the Illusion of Knowing is taken into account and analyzed, what can promote an overestimation of one's own political awareness.

Employee Magazines and Internal Web 2.0: An Empirical Comparative Study of Printed Employee Publications ¤ Communication departments in companies are currently under strong pressure for change: Expectations for internal and external communication have risen due to digitalization among decision-makers and employees in the company as well as from other demand and consumer groups. The digital acceleration of information transport, 'round-the-clock' availability of communication and IT offers, the increasingly shorter cycle of technical innovations, an 'information competition' of various offers, and much more, lead to internal communication offers being put to the test in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and economic success contribution. Starting from the printed employee magazine as a classic, successful tradition medium of many companies, this work examines a comparison of two representative studies to investigate whether and how the medium has changed over the past twelve years in terms of form, content, and organization in the face of digital challenges. In summary, it can be concluded that the 'printed employee publication' can still be a strong communication and dialogue medium if it is strategically and content-wise meaningful to the company and the communication needs of the employees. The author Christian Cauers, responsible for communication in the Volkswagen Group, graduated from the Institute for Journalism and Communication Research (Hannover).

Interdisciplinary Assurance of Production Planning in the Automotive Industry ¤ The automotive industry is one of the most significant industrial sectors in Germany, constantly moving in the field of tension between quality, productivity, and costs. Global competition leads to shorter innovation and product cycles - customer requirements to extensive product individualization. The complexity of a car today is enormous. A complexity that constantly presents new challenges to product development, production planning, and production, and ends in a striving for perfection and continuous improvement. It is impressive to experience how all processes are integrated during a production launch and how, during series production, a finished vehicle runs off the production line approximately every 90 seconds. To ensure an efficient production launch, this is secured in advance. In terms of manual assembly ranges, this occurs in the so-called production preparation, which is carried out interdisciplinarily with the involvement of various planning areas. Production preparation is assigned to series development and series preparation. In this phase, physical prototypes of the product are built station by station, with the associated work contents. In addition to the verification of the actual product, this phase serves to ensure an efficient production launch. The assurance of product and production is well established in the automotive industry and is applied early on. In addition to physical assurances, virtual assurances are increasingly used through the use of IT systems and simulations. The present work deals with the phase of production preparation and the associated assurance of the production launch in terms of manual assembly ranges in the automotive industry. In focus here is a virtual assurance of production preparation and the support of collaboration and documentation of interdisciplinary production preparation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165423-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040126-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047360-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032690-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113545-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4158971-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016901-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126388-1>
The Production of Diversity in Urban Administrations: Change and Persistence of Organizations in the Migration Society ¤ How do public organizations react to migration-induced diversity? The book examines urban administrations and the employment of immigrants and their descendants. Based on an organization sociologically based study of Berlin administrations, it focuses on the interaction of various practices, structures, and contexts in which access to employment is created and may change. The book shows both driving forces of organizational change and persistence forces that hinder the opening of administrations and result in the exclusion of certain 'diversity'. The content Employment of immigrants and their descendants in urban administrations.- The Co-Production of Diversity in Urban Administrations.- Empirical Approach and Methods.- Genesis and Change of a Political Problem in Berlin.- The Selection of Trainees in Berlin Administrations.- Administration A: Continuity of Established Recruitment Routines.- Administration B: Temporary Change of Hiring Practice.- Administration C: Normalization of Hiring.- Conclusion: Organizational Change in the Urban Migration Society.

On the Back of the Past : A Comparative History of Ideas of German and American Conservatism ¤ This comparison of German and American conservatism—in terms of the history of ideas—analyses the divergent developments of the Conservative Movement in the United States and right-wing conservatives in the Federal Republic. Through a parallel reading of the magazines National Review and Criticón, the study examines these countries’ respective forms of conservatism with regard to political positions, leading representatives and structural composition. The result of this work is the enumeration of a series of premises necessary to democratise an originally anti-democratic political philosophy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032187-3>
Marketing Innovations: Empirical Studies on Success Effect and Drivers ¤ The success effect of marketing innovations -- Comparison of marketing innovations and product innovations -- Drivers of radical marketing innovations -- Implications for management practice. This book deals with marketing innovations, i.e. innovations that relate to the areas of sales, pricing, and communication. Manuel Hütter examines these in two empirical studies in more detail. In one cross-industry survey, the question is pursued of whether and under what conditions marketing innovations are successful and where the differences to product innovations lie. In a second study, the focus is on under what conditions companies produce particularly innovative marketing concepts. In total, the results speak for a stronger engagement of science and practice with the topic of marketing innovations. The content The success effect of marketing innovations Comparison of marketing innovations and product innovations Drivers of radical marketing innovations Implications for management practice The target groups Lecturers and students of business administration with a focus on marketing and innovation management Professionals and executives in companies with these focuses The author Dr. Manuel Hütter graduated with Prof. Dr. Martin Klarmann (Research Group Marketing & Sales) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161817-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037589-4>
Numerical Simulation of Corrosion Processes for Industrial Applications ¤ The current goal of preventing corrosion damage efficiently and in the long term is pursued by a large number of engineers and scientists in companies and research institutions. Since corrosion itself is, however, a consequence of the striving of all metals to overcome to the least energetic state and is therefore unavoidable, it cannot be finally stopped. It is, however, possible to slow down the corrosion process through targeted measures and thus minimize the practical effects. This leads to the need to continuously review the functioning of corrosion protection and develop additional measures for additional conditions, such as new material compositions and loading situations. Accordingly, industrial prototypes must be continuously subjected to experimental corrosion tests, which inevitably destroy these prototypes. This approach is therefore both cost- and time-intensive and is only very limitedly available to development engineers. Mathematical modeling-based corrosion simulation is thus spreading in increasing extent as the means of choice to understand corrosion processes. However, there is currently no software tool that can sufficiently simulate the corrosion process for industrial applications, as the various modeling approaches do not currently meet the necessary requirements. Either only a static consideration of the corrosion risk is calculated, in which the temporal corrosion course is neglected, or the temporal development of various parameters is presented over a short period at small test geometries. Above all, the deformation of the geometry due to the corrosion progress over long time scales represents a major challenge that has not yet been satisfactorily solved. It is necessary to describe the movement of the surfaces attacked by corrosion according to the material ablation. The most promising approach is the Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian method, which must be used very sensitively in the framework of this work.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032518-0>
The Historikerstreit and the Search for a National Identity of the Eighties ¤ The theme of this historical work is the roughly ten-year-old, transgressing the scientific disciplinary boundaries and reaching into current politics, Historikerstreit. The author places this controversy in a broad field of reference of earlier, similar controversies and historical case studies of the early Federal Republic. A leading thesis reads: In the Historikerstreit of the mid-eighties, it was not only about the questions of the classification of National Socialism, but in the core about a collective political consciousness, about the contents and necessity of a national identity of the Germans, the actual controversy was conducted in West Germany.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4203188-6>
The Urban Indoor Swimming Pool in Germany from 1870 to 1930 ¤ The book deals with the urban indoor swimming pools erected from 1870 to 1930. Their task was to provide the entire population with a covered washing and swimming facility in the form of shower, bathtub, and sauna baths as well as swimming pools. - - The investigation is based on a broad material foundation. For the specified period, around 200 indoor pools could be proven, of which 55 pools were described and analyzed in detail. - - The development of the architecture of the urban indoor swimming pool is presented and historically classified. As part of the complex municipal building task, the bath was in the field of tension between functional and representative building, where the decorative architecture corresponded to the conditions of the bathing facilities and technology. - - In order to draw a comprehensive picture, the economic and social framework conditions that were formative for the development of the municipal building task of the indoor pool in the considered period are incorporated into the investigation. - - To date, the architectural development of the baths has not been comprehensively investigated and considered. Thus, the work makes an important contribution to the systematic exploration of the new building types developed by architects and engineers in the 19th century for the prospering municipalities	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4638381-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025142-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4023030-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077288-3>

Consultation, Organisation and Contract Design according to the Fee-Based Investment Advisory Act ¤ Considering European regulations, this book explains the impact of the Fee-Based Investment Advisory Act on the supervisory and civil law requirements for proper fee-based investment advice. The European MiFID II financial markets directive, among other things, aims to strengthen independent investment advice. The German legislator has already reacted to this in 2014 by passing the Fee-Based Investment Advisory Act, which is intended to strengthen and establish independent investment advice. Because fee-based investment advice has often led to false advice for investors in the past. Against this background, the book deals extensively with the new supervisory requirements for fee-based investment advice. In addition, the contractual obligations of the parties to the fee-based investment advisory contract are comprehensively examined, and the possibilities of designing the fee claim are presented. 1 Introduction -- 2 Regulation and Organisation of Fee-Based Investment Advice -- 3 Radiation of Supervisory Law on Civil Law -- 4 Nature and Contractual Obligations of Fee-Based Investment Advice -- 5 Design and Amount of the Fee -- 6 Summary of the Essential Results.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4741959-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129764-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128408-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002094-0>
Grundrechtsfähigkeit Künstlicher Intelligenz ¤ Artificial Intelligence (AI) is partially entitled to fundamental rights. This counterintuitive result is the central hypothesis of the exploration, which is supported by an interdisciplinary, theoretical and dogmatic framework. However, the position of AI is not comparable to those of humans. The author develops a model to show in which circumstances AI is entitled to fundamental rights under the Grundgesetz. This model may also serve as a basis for the regulation of AI.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123065-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020588-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033447-8>
Change Agents in the Structural Dilemma: A Qualitative-Reconstructive Study on the Orientations of School Steering Groups ¤ Against the backdrop of societal change, schools face the challenge of taking responsibility for their own school development processes. Organizational, personnel, and curriculum development should be advanced not only by school leadership but also by school steering groups. Their tasks are complex, and the lines of demarcation from the fields of activity of school leadership are vague. In his empirical study on the practice of steering groups, Nikolaus Schröck shows the fields of tension in which these groups act and reconstructs the dilemmas to which they are exposed. With this qualitative-reconstructive study, the conceptual designs of school development counseling are supplemented for the first time from the perspective of the actors. The book is aimed at lecturers and students of education science and qualitative social research as well as at staff in teacher education, school counseling, school development moderators, and school leadership personnel (school principals, department heads, school steering groups). Nikolaus Schröck earned his doctorate under Prof. Dr. Sibylle Rahm at the Chair of School Pedagogy at the Otto-Friedrich University of Bamberg. He is the academic director there.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175875-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126892-1>
Analysis of coproscopic examination results from sheep and goats from 2007-2016, as well as detection of Haemonchus contortus using lectin-bound fluorescence staining ¤ The aim of the study was to determine the minimum infection probabilities of parasites and influencing factors on their excretion in sheep and goats. The sample set from the laboratory of the Clinic for Small Animals Hannover consisted of 10,227 sheep and 3,929 goat fecal samples from the years 2007–2016, as well as 402, for the detection of H. contortus, fluorescently stained samples from the years 2016 and 2017. Goats excreted significantly higher MDS egg counts and coccidian oocyst counts than sheep. They were more frequently positive for Trichuris spp., Capilaria spp. and Eimeria spp. and excreted 7 times more small lungworms compared to sheep. Sheep were twice as often excreters of tapeworms and their lambs were twice as often excreters of Strongyloides papillosus compared to goat kids. The probability of infections with small lungworms, MDS, Capillaria spp., Fasciola hepatica and Dicrocoelium dendriticum increased with increasing age in sheep and goats. Lambs were more frequently infected with Eimeria spp., Nematodirus spp., Strongyloides papillosus, Trichuris spp. and Moniezia spp. than old sheep. Fecal samples of female sheep were more frequently positive for MDS, small lungworms and liver flukes. Fecal samples of male sheep, on the other hand, showed more frequent infestations with Trichuris spp., Strongyloides papillosus, Nematodirus spp. and Eimeria spp. Male sheep and goats excreted significantly more Eimeria oocysts. During the investigation period, an increase in the detection frequency of Fasciola hepatica, Dicrocoelium dendriticum and Paramphistomum spp. could be demonstrated. H. contortus was detected in 91% of the samples with high MDS egg counts. The proportion of H. contortus eggs in MDS egg counts was significantly higher in the summer months.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012494-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113937-9>

Heat Treatment of SiCr-Alloyed, Oil-Quenched Spring Steel Wire ¤ This work deals with the question of how the mechanical load-bearing capacity and the lifespan of screw-down springs can be increased by combining the heat treatment steps of wire and spring production. An analytical model is presented, which enables the calculation of temperature-time courses of wire hardening. Based on laboratory experiments, optimal regimes are determined for each subprocess of heat treatment, the characteristic values for analytical calculation are determined, and the calculation model is validated. Various influencing factors on the microstructure formation of the wire material as well as the effects of all process sections on the mechanical properties of the hardened spring steel wire are discussed. It is shown that torsion-loaded springs made of optimized material exhibit a significantly reduced preload and, in the context of fatigue tests, an increased lifespan in the time-dependent strength range.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153822-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4696403-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064180-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4150524-4>
A comparison of locally analytic group cohomology and Lie algebra cohomology for p-adic Lie groups ¤ Abstract: The main result of this work is a new proof and generalization of Lazard's comparison theorem of locally analytic group cohomology with Lie algebra cohomology for K-Lie groups, where K is a finite extension of the p-adic numbers. We show the following theorem: Let K be a finite extension of the p-adic numbers and let G be a K-Lie group. Then there exists an open subgroup U of G such that the Lazard morphism, which is induced by differentiating cochains, is an isomorphism. The proof of this theorem is independent of the proof of Lazard's comparison result. Our strategy to prove the comparison isomorphism between locally analytic group cohomology and Lie algebra cohomology uses the theory of formal group laws. And in a second step we consider standard groups	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4398268-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031700-6>
Investigations on the Analytics and Diagnostic Significance of IL-6 and TGF-β1 in Dogs ¤ Cytokines, IL-6, TGF-β1. - Cytokines are regulatory proteins responsible for the cell cycle and differentiation as well as the immune response. Their involvement in numerous diseases has been repeatedly shown. The recovery of regulatory cytokines from dog blood would thus represent an easily accessible biomarker. The aim of the present work was therefore to investigate the significance of IL-6 and TGF-β1 in internal diseases of dogs and to examine their possible significance for veterinary everyday life. Between April 2008 and May 2010, a total of 227 dogs were examined in the Small Animal Clinic of the Veterinary Institute of the University of Göttingen with commercially available ELISA kits regarding IL-6 and TGF-β1 in the blood.

Pedagogy and Irony ¤ The relationship between pedagogy and irony presents itself as a split, if not even disturbed one: In normative theory, irony is spoken of as the "unpedagogical" (Nohl) or a "hypocritical hiding of the intended meaning" (Baacke), where practice shows that irony penetrates it incessantly. Thus, does practice undermine the theoretical requirements for it, or did theory think ahead of practice? These questions are dealt with by the present work both theoretically-reconstructively, as well as empirically-reconstructively.

Dem composing in music education has long been attributed a special aesthetic and creative educational potential - yet without empirical findings to date. Elisabeth Theisohn underpins the music pedagogical claim to composing in school. She reconstructs creative action and learning of students during joint composing, which spans between practical task fulfillment, assertions of one's own and collaboration. In doing so, she develops not only didactic design principles for agile, norm- and context-sensitive music education, but also designs a differentiated view of teaching and school from a praxeological perspective.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040843-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123176-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133320-2>
Digital Integration of Migrants? : ethnographic case studies on digital divide in Germany ¤ With the Lisbon Strategy, European heads of state and government wanted to make the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. Information and communication technologies are seen as innovation drivers in these progress visions. On the other hand, the digital divide of the population is considered a danger, which is countered with support measures for disadvantaged people. Oliver Hinkelbein examines the development and implementation of strategies for the 'digital integration of migrants' in state and civil society organizations in Germany.

Content Management in Public Administration ¤ Everything online. This is the goal of large-scale e-government initiatives. The European Commission has set itself the goal with the eEurope initiative, as well as the federal government with BundOnline 2005, to improve the service quality of their administrations by making public services online-capable. Our state and local governments have also begun initiatives, but are still lagging behind in development. It shows that there is still a huge need for expansion in terms of internal and external resources for Internet technologies, both for strategy and conception/architecture as well as for development, introduction, operation, and evaluation. Strategic approaches are needed to show how organization and technology must interact in the administrations in order to create online services quickly, cost-effectively, and customer-oriented. For this, a comprehensive, strategy-based approach is developed in this book. This consists of a content management architecture and a framework for strategy-based content management in public administration. From this, a procedure model for the introduction of a content management system is derived. The operation of the system is described using reference models, which are divided into performance, content, functional, organizational, and control models by a viewing model. The application of the concept is described at a concrete practice example, the Internet/Intranet project of the Saarland state administration. The book offers decision-makers and practitioners from the administrations a helpful instrumentarium for planning and implementing content management projects	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4393385-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115645-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4673954-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4728387-7>

Historical and Current Water Use on the High Rhine and in the Southern Black Forest: Processes and Conflicts ¤ Summary: This work attempts to present the most diverse use claims that are made by humans on water of all kinds. The region of the High Rhine and the southern Black Forest serves as the area of investigation. This region is characterized by a very strong change in structure. A formerly strongly rural region with poor living conditions for its population stood suddenly at the end of the 19th century in the focus of an industrially shaped change. This change was triggered by the construction of the first Rheinfelden power plant, which went into operation in 1898. From then on, numerous industrial companies settled along the High Rhine, and further power plants were successively planned and built, which further advanced the development of industrialization in the region. Before the Rheinfelden power plant was built, there was a demand for the expansion of the High Rhine to a shipping route. In Germany and Switzerland, numerous interest groups emerged, which saw the navigation of the High Rhine as a means to boost the economic development of the High Rhine region. With the expansion of the High Rhine to an energy axis, the groups hoped for the simultaneous implementation of shipping interests. They hoped for a technical cooperation between shipping and power generation. The power plants were to receive sufficiently large locks at the time of their construction. This calculation, however, did not come to fruition. The inland navigation could not assert itself and ended until today in Rheinfelden. The utilization of water power, however, expanded to the peaks of the Black Forest. Pumped storage power plants were built to inject energy into the grid as needed. The Schluchseewerk (1928 – 1953) and the Hotzenwaldwerk (1962 – 1976) were created. Such massive and far-reaching interventions in the water use of a whole region, of course, led to strong ecological and economic changes that also had an impact on the social structure of the region. With the construction of the power plants, the income base of old professions (fishermen, raftsmen, boatmen) was eliminated. The power plants functioned as barriers for fish, rafts, and also ships. At the same time, however, new opportunities arose through the settlement of industrial and factory facilities ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189214-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116383-7>

Liability Privilege of the Works Council: Applicability of the Principles of Limited Employee Liability to the Works Council and its Members ¤ The works council office is designed as an honorary office in the works constitution law. Nevertheless, the chairperson should be liable with their personal assets to third parties outside the company if the works council has entered into a cost-causing contract and exceeded the boundary of what is necessary for works council work. This causes irritation: Should works council members actually be subject to a stricter liability than non-office-holding employees, for whose benefit a liability privilege is granted in the internal relationship with the employer according to the principles of internal damage compensation?

Fathers on Parental Leave : (Non-)Recognition of Family and Work Efforts in Couples ¤ With the Federal Parental Allowance and Parental Leave Act, the figure of the active father came into focus. At the same time, traditional references in social policy regulations, norms, and company cultures are at work. Stefanie Aunkofer analyzes paternal parental leave-taking based on qualitative couple interviews with a view to recognition of family and work efforts and shows: gainful employment remains the source of recognition. Opening fathers' access to the familial sphere partially through parental leave is not enough. For a genuine equalization, a fundamental change in the gender and recognition relationship is necessary.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037363-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127643-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062386-5>
Disclosure Obligations of Board Members in Capital Companies ¤ What information, especially of a personal nature, must board members disclose to corporations and their shareholders? What does the financial market need to know about those at the helm of companies listed on the stock exchange? Constitutional law is at loggerheads with data protection regulation on the matter. Elena Dubovitskaya investigates whether this conflict ought to be resolved in favour of the individual's privacy or the sake of transparency.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129472-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134205-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112623-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185917-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123980-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188726-8>
Abandoned Works : An Analysis from an International Perspective ¤ Abandoned works are copyright-protected works whose right holders are not identifiable or locatable and whose use poses risks in the absence of the right holder's consent. The author examines the problem of abandoned works from an international perspective, which is particularly discussed in the context of creating extensive online libraries. He analyzes the emergence, the possibility of preventing the emergence, and the legal utilization of abandoned works. In addition, he deals with the question of whether and how the orphan status of a work can be determined and terminated. The investigation is carried out on the basis of numerous regulations and regulation proposals of various states, taking into account the provisions of international copyright agreements. In doing so, the peculiarities of the continental European droit d'auteur and the Anglo-American Copyright Systems are highlighted.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7851410-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114050-3>
Bio-optical Investigation of Arctic Coastal Systems: From Measurement to Modeling ¤ This work analyses the bio-optical conditions in five arctic coastal systems in Greenland and Iceland. These systems differ in their hydrographic structure which influences the bio-optical conditions and biological activity. All systems show only low inorganic SPM (SPMi) concentrations. Exceptions are stations near freshwater runoff and glacial melt water. CDOM absorption was low in all systems. Higher Chl a concentrations were observed in the Vaigat and at two stations in Breiðafjörður. 1 % PAR depth was dominated by Chl a and SPMi concentrations. A simple model was used to derive PAR in dependence of different concentrations. For hyperspectral light field data, CDOM shows its influence at low wavelength. Modelling with Hydrolight has shown greater differences between measurement and model. <engl.> This work analyses the bio-optical conditions in five arctic coastal systems in Greenland and Iceland.

Regional Networks and Corporate Success: An Empirical Analysis of the German Photovoltaic Industry ¤ Abstract: In this study, the relationship between networks and the success of photovoltaic industry companies is empirically examined. Based on a first-time collection and analysis of the cooperation behavior in the German solar industry, factors of cooperation arrangements are identified that are causally responsible for positive effects on the performance of the companies. In this context, in addition to patent and regression analyses, particular reliance is placed on the method of social scientific network analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078604-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7856923-0>
The Reduction of Liability in Europe: Opportunities for the Introduction of a General Reduction Clause in European Tort Law ¤ Reduction clauses are actual breaches of the principle of full compensation, which in the field of tort law reduce the claim for damages proportionally. Reduction clauses in German law are, for example, damage caps or rules on damage apportionment in cases of contributory negligence. Instead of specifying the conditions under which a reduction of the claim for damages is considered in special reduction clauses and possibly in what amount the reduction is to be made, some legal systems in Europe have created a general reduction clause instead or in parallel, which leaves it to the discretion of the court whether and to what extent a reduction of the claim for damages is to be made. This study aims to contribute to the necessary harmonization of European law by examining the suitability of a general reduction clause for European tort law and clarifying how the need for appropriate limitation of liability can be taken into account in individual cases. This question is examined in more detail through comparative law at the hand of selected European legal systems. The Swiss, Dutch, German, and English legal systems are considered.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048849-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4247482-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116364-3>
Indirect Discrimination. Constitutional criticism of a questionable concept of equality ¤ In the central decision on indirect discrimination, the BVerfG dealt with a regulation that was allegedly indirectly discriminating against women, although it was linked to the gender-neutral characteristic of part-time employment. In fact, however, the majority of women are employed part-time, so that indirect discrimination was acknowledged by the BVerfG. Whether a prohibited reference to gender can also be present in a gender-neutral formulation appears questionable. For under Art. 3 Abs. 2 and Abs. 3 GG, the legislator is required to enact primarily gender-neutral regulations. Ultimately, gender-neutral regulations do not have the same discriminatory quality as directly discriminatory regulations. In most cases, indirect discrimination on the basis of gender is a matter of reflecting disadvantages that result from raising children. The standard for this is, however, Art. 3 Abs. 1 in conjunction with Art. 6 Abs. 1 GG.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062801-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012472-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071878-5>
Professionality in Change : Individual Professional Action at the Example of Temporary Work ¤ At the example of temporary work, the dissertation examines how professional action changes through structural change. With which action requirements are employees confronted and with which strategies do they react to them? The author analyzes these questions in the framework of a qualitative study, which she evaluated with guided interviews with temporary workers, dispatchers and works councils. The social background is formed by long-term processes such as the deregulation of the labor market, digitalization and globalization, which have led to a strong increase in atypical and discontinuous employment relationships. The results show: temporary work is characterized by a strong market-related dynamics and a high degree of uncertainty and discontinuity. With her work, the author gives impulses for educational offers that deal with topics such as professional identity work or professional orientation search of people in discontinuous employment areas	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074122-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128237-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002641-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069349-1>
Honesty in Budgeting ¤ Anja Schwering identifies, based on a comprehensive analysis of existing literature, economic and behavioral explanations of honesty in budgeting. Furthermore, the author gains new insights into the influence of the behavior of equal colleagues on honesty in the budgeting process through an experimental study and can provide recommendations for the disclosure of budget information. Dishonest behavior in the budgeting process is a central challenge for companies that use participatory budgeting for corporate governance. Therefore, it is of great importance for the design of budgeting to know the factors that promote dishonest behavior.

Reduction of Veterinary Drug Residues in the Environment with More Degradable Sulfonamides ¤ Sulfonamide, antibiotic residues, pigs. - Veterinary antibiotics and among them the sulfonamides enter the environment through numerous entry paths, especially however through manure, the environment. Even contaminated pig manure poses a contamination risk to the environment (BOXALL et al. 2004; HAMSCHER 2008). The aim of the present work was to determine various procedures by which the entry of sulfonamide residues into the environment can be reduced. Under the aspect that sulfonamides are photooxidizable, the photodegradation of nine different sulfonamides was investigated and detected by HPLC. Under UVA/UVB light irradiation, sulfanilamide and sulfathiazole are highly degraded, while sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfachloropyridazine, sulfamerazine, sulfamethazine, sulfadimethoxine, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfadiazine are moderately to slightly degraded. Comparative studies between the used UVA/UVB light and UVA radiation illustrate that the wavelength affects the degradation rate. Even under field conditions, exposure to sunlight leads to different degrees of photo degradation of the individual sulfonamides. The photooxidation products were subsequently investigated for their biocompatibility. Using the MTS viability assay and the crystal violet proliferation assay, it could be shown that the photodegradation products, which arose from an unirradiated sulfonamide solution in an original concentration of 50...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136447-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050855-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186812-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4313172-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134081-4>
Migrating - Working - Falling Ill: A Biographical Theoretical Investigation ¤ When speaking about illness among migrants and migrant women, categorizations of cultural difference and foreign experience are quickly invoked. To overcome culturalistic and generalizing objectifications, the study examines psychological, physical, and social world phenomena in the context of migration experiences through biographical narrative interviews. Turkish people diagnosed as 'medical cases' were asked to tell their life story. These biographical everyday stories with their interpretations of migration experiences and falling ill in Germany are at the center of the study. The own life practice is valued as biographical work in balancing life and family historical experiences and societal demands. The study follows these questions: In which life historical and societal constellation are experiences of illness embedded? What role does the individual migration history play? How do people speak about their own life and the world, and how is this speaking influenced by the influences in the country of origin as well as in the country of migration?.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137952-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032844-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124897-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4482283-2>
Trade, climate policy and carbon leakage : theory and empirical evidence ¤ This volume was prepared by Rahel Aichele while she was working at the ifo Institute. It was completed in December 2012 and accepted as a doctoral thesis by the Department of Economics at the University of Munich. It includes five self-contained chapters. The chapters investigate how, in a globalized world, partial international climate policy has shaped international trade and the location of emissions. The main research question is whether carbon leakage empirically occurs, thus undermining the effectiveness of unilateral climate policy. The thesis provides new empirical tests for leakage based on a newly developed panel dataset of the carbon content of bilateral trade and country-level carbon footprints for 40 countries over the period 1995-2007. The Kyoto Protocol constitutes a quasi-natural experiment of international climate policy. We exploit policy evaluation techniques to study its effects on CO2 emissions (Chapter 1), carbon footprints (Chapter 2), trade values (Chapter 3) and the carbon content of trade (Chapter 4). To deal with self-selection into treatment, fixed-effects, instrumental variables or matching econometrics techniques are employed. We find empirical evidence for carbon leakage in the data. The extent of carbon leakage is then quantified with a structurally estimated trade model (Chapter 5). Simulations of counterfactual climate policy scenarios show moderate but non-negligible leakage rates.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4572791-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547705-1>
Hilde Domin : Theoretical Reflection on Poetry and Artistic Realization ¤ At the age of 23, the Jewish woman Hilde Domin left Germany with her future husband in 1932. After a long odyssey through Europe and a 12-year exile in the Dominican Republic, she returned to her homeland in 1954. In a severe life crisis, she began to write, and her first poetry collection was published in 1959. In Germany, she was euphorically celebrated by almost all critics and fellow poets. The reading public was enthusiastic. This volume traces the contemporary reception of Hilde Domin and examines both her lyrical work and her poetological essays. Both form a unity insofar as the artistic work is the starting point for the artistic considerations. Since the beginning of the 1970s, Hilde Domin turned to the sociopolitical situation of the Federal Republic with resolutions, appeals, and critical reader letters, and she wrote few poems. Nevertheless, her poetry has lost none of its effect to this day. In what this consists and what makes the lyrical texts still so current will also be clarified in this volume.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036774-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046449-0>
Poesie and Conspiracy : Sense of Relationship and Semiotics of Conspiracy Scenarios in Journalism, Literature, and Science 1750 - 1850 ¤ Conspiracy theories fascinate: Already in the 17th century, ideas about the supposedly omnipotent Jesuit Order and its global undertakings circulated. 18th-century journalism observes numerous Arcanum societies and searches for the secret path of human machinations. Unknown superiors seem omnipresent in the Age of Enlightenment; disguised and with invisible poison, they steer bad fortunes or plan the overthrow of the existing order. The present investigation reconstructs for the first time comprehensively and on a broad material basis the literary design of conspiracy scenarios between 1750 and 1850.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035964-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4207571-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195203-0>
Multicomponent reactions with fullerenes ¤ Fullerene; multicomponent reactions; Ugi reaction; Passerini reaction; photodynamic therapy; Carbon nanomaterial The curious carbon cage structure of fullerenes, coupled with their unique chemical, physical and biological properties makes this class of compound valued assets in many research areas. To supply the demand of novel derivatives, just a few classical reactions offer products with good yields under mild conditions. Multicomponent reactions on the other hand, can add the desired diversity in the synthesis of fullerene derivatives, presenting an alternative pathway and boosting its applications in material and medical science. Looking to provide an efficient and versatile method for the decoration of fullerenes, herein its reported the first C60 derivatization strategy applying isocyanide-based multicomponent reactions, specifically the Passerini and Ugi reactions. Representative compounds were evaluated as photosensitizers for photodynamic activity showing promising results. Additionally, a new multicomponent process is described, generating fullereno derivatives with an unusual scaffold.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4009816-3>

The political economy of international prohibition regimes : a transaction cost perspective on relational contracting between states ¤ What are the calculations of states in the international system when it comes to cooperation in the area of prohibition? By shifting the focus from normative policy outcomes to the importance of relationship-specific negotiation incentives, this work helps to explain the emergence and stability of international regimes in terms of the regulation of drugs and small arms/light weapons (SALW). It develops a model which focuses on the interplay between transaction and governance costs in order to explain the varying extent of cooperation we observe in international prohibition.

Safety Concept for Considering Corrosion on Steel Gas High-Pressure Lines ¤ Gas high-pressure lines made of steel are measured using a deterministic safety concept. In the unchanged design state and in the intended operation, the static load-bearing capacity of the gas high-pressure lines is given. With the years, gas high-pressure lines made of steel undergo geometric changes, which are often caused by corrosion. The assessment of the static load-bearing capacity then takes place under consideration of these geometric changes. Deterministic safety factors of the assessment of new gas high-pressure lines cannot be used for the assessment of existing corroded gas high-pressure lines, as these assume a defined load and geometry state, which no longer exists due to the geometric influence of corrosion. The work deals with the determination of deterministic safety factors for the assessment of corroded gas high-pressure lines based on failure probabilities and presents an application concept for their use.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054790-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032518-0>
Self-similar Polyhedra ¤ In the present work, in addition to the k-replicating convex and non-convex polygons, k-replicating d-dimensional polyhedra with d ≥ 3 are also studied. So far, very little is known about such polyhedra. E. Hertel has investigated the 8-replicating three-dimensional simplexes [14] and determined a class of 2d-replicating d-dimensional polyhedra [16]. Furthermore, there is a remark by Ch. Bandt that one can obtain 2-replicating polyhedra by product constructions, for example, of two right-angled triangles [1]. A conjecture by McMullen states that for d ≥ 3, every k-replicating d-dimensional polyhedron is combinatorially equivalent to a Cartesian product of simplexes [5, p. 88]. Just as one can construct decompositions of the plane into pairwise congruent polygons using k-replicating polygons, one can construct corresponding decompositions of the d-dimensional Euclidean space using k-replicating d-dimensional polyhedra. Decompositions of the d-dimensional Euclidean space into pairwise congruent polyhedra are the subject of numerous works (e.g. [6], [10]). Another application can be found in applied numerical analysis. If one has a decomposition of a region into k-replicating polyhedra, this decomposition can be refined without changing the shape of the decomposition parts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175161-9>
Orders of the Other: On the Problem of the Own in the Sociology of the Foreign ¤ Encounters with the foreign are familiar to us, even if we often perceive the other as unfamiliar. However, it is less the foreign that makes the 'one' into the 'other', but rather our own reality constructs and practices of interaction. The author analyzes these practices of othering, which range from everyday labeling and stigmatization to scientific practices of 'othering': Reconstructed are Simmel's 'trader', Park's 'mulatto', Schütz's 'emigrant', Mead's 'significant/ generalized other' as well as ethnographic practices of 'altering' the foreign. In doing so, the gaze is repeatedly directed from the familiar images of the foreign to their subtle production processes and resonances, making it possible to return from the constructions of the foreign to the constructions of the own.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4220302-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018421-3>

Aesthetics of Deceleration: Ernst Jünger's Travel Diaries; (1934 - 1960) ¤ Note: International Hölderlin Bibliography, p. 121f.: Unshakeable like Hölderlin: the necessity of the island Ernst Jünger has left behind a comprehensive travel work. Throughout his life, he undertook more than 80 trips, some to exotic overseas locations. Based on largely unknown documents from the estate of authentic travel notes and unpublished letters, Weber adds the hitherto unwritten chapter of an intense travel life to the biography of this century man. Jünger reflected modernity as a history of acceleration and documented the attempts to preserve oneself, the catastrophic upheavals, and the permanent change of the 20th century in a literary way. Ernst Jünger's Aesthetics of Deceleration thus provides not only an aesthetics of tourism and literary modernity, but also holds guidelines for an era in which having time for oneself becomes increasingly impossible.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177612-4>
Ethics Councils in Politics: Genesis, Self-Understanding, and Working Method of the German Ethics Council ¤ This work is the first comprehensive examination of the German Ethics Council.

Depth and Nest Material Preferences of Laboratory Mice in Group Housing ¤ Depth, Nest material, Mice. - Bedding and nest material are central components in the housing of laboratory mice. In the framework of three experiments, these were investigated in more detail and their importance for mice characterized. The goal of this work was, on the one hand, to examine nest materials from different starting materials and structures using various evaluation criteria for their suitability in the housing of laboratory mice (Experiment 1). On the other hand, in the framework of classical choice experiments, the preferences of laboratory mice for three different bedding volumes (0.5L, 1.5L, 6L) (Experiment 2) and the preferences for nest material in comparison to a large bedding volume (Experiment 3) were determined. For the investigations, female mice of the inbred strains BALB/cByJRj and C57BL/6NRj were used. The animals were kept in each of the experiments in stably homogeneous groups of four. In the framework of the first experiment, three nest materials (Nestlets (cotton squares), Lignocel® nesting large (wood wool), Crink-I´Nest (paper strips)) were compared with each other in three evaluation criteria (Nestscore according to HESS et al. (2008), Factor 1 = amount of used nest material, Factor 2 = manipulability of the material). The choice experiments were carried out with the help of an automatic system. This was validated before the study and consisted of two Type III cages, connected by a Plexiglas tube. With the help of subcutaneously implanted transponders and antennas at the ends of the connecting tube, the location of each animal could be recorded at any time. Experiment 2 examined three bedding volumes, which were paired in a total of three test combinations with each other (A: 0.5L vs. 1.5L, B: 0.5L vs. 6L, C: 1.5L vs. 6L). Experiment 3 consisted of a test combination (0.5L bedding + nest material vs. 1.5L bedding without nest material).

Strategic Design of the Life Cycle of Mega-Events ¤ Mega-Events such as the Olympic Games, FIFA World Cup, and World Expositions have developed into a crucial element of modern society over the last century. These events are a significant economic factor with regular investments in the billions and require a tremendous complexity to be managed during planning and execution. Dirk P. Weiß provides a comprehensive description of the phenomenon of Mega-Events for the first time. In doing so, he structures the strategic design problems and develops a solution approach for practical application. The result is a decision-oriented problem-solving process, whose steps follow the relevant design questions. This comprehensive planning instrument offers applicants for a Mega-Event and its organizers a helpful heuristic for managing planning tasks and provides interested researchers with a basis for targeted further research.

History of Technology as a Subject of General Technical Education: Didactic and Methodological Aspects for Technology Education ¤ In this work, historical learning is established as a further possibility in technical education and ways of implementing it in teaching are shown. But what justifies the effort of the 'learning path' through the past? And what additional learning opportunities does the historical approach open up? Is it even the task of technology education to address historical content? An answer to these questions is given through an engagement with the tasks and goals of technical education in general education schools. Educational and learning theoretical considerations lead to a technology- and history didactically justified and methodically concretized concept of historical learning. Thus, a general education profile can be developed for technology education that differs more clearly than before from training. Practically tested examples in teaching illustrate the subject theory and provide exemplary access to an extension of the possibilities in technology education.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139574-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059217-0>
Integrated Campaign Planning in Logistical Networks of the Chemical Industry ¤ In the chemical-pharmaceutical industry, production often takes place in globally operating companies distributed over many locations.

Task-Appropriate Information Provision in Times of Big Data: Consequences for Information Management ¤ Marco Pospiech examines in this book the consequences of the Big Data movement for corporate information management. As a possible scenario, he implements a Big Data system for the energy trade, whose consideration enables the derivation of general consequences for information management. For these challenges, current technologies and methods are identified in the form of a catalog of measures to ensure the success of future Big Data developments. In doing so, the contribution does not only list existing solutions, but rather enriches science and practice with own methods, whose applicability is not limited to the energy trade.

Enhancing Chemical Measurement Signals for Improved Detection Limits ¤ The goal of this work is to optimally enhance measurement signals from the field of analytical chemistry in order to lower detection limits. For this purpose, three mathematical methods of signal processing were employed and compared: convolution with Gaussian curves, Fourier transformation, and wavelet transformation using various wavelet functions. The comparison is shown by means of measurements of two inorganic and organic arsenic species each using HPLC-ICP-MS.

War Crimes against Property: Their Anchoring in the Statute of the International Criminal Court and Implementation in the German Penal Code for International Crimes ¤ War crimes against property stand in the shadow of crimes committed directly against humans. However, they are of non-negligible practical relevance. For the destruction and appropriation of property have far-reaching consequences for the affected people, who lose their vital property. Moreover, destruction of property is often used as a means of expulsion. The author presents the development of war crimes against property in the law of armed conflicts. In doing so, she provides an overview of post-war jurisprudence, the jurisprudence of the Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal, as well as that of the International Criminal Court. The war law regulations underlying war crimes against property are explained in detail in the systematic context of the characteristics of the offense. Furthermore, the author praises the implementation of war crimes against property in the Penal Code for International Crimes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4438193-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137568-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013793-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188481-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033151-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013798-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4222882-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201732-4>
Quantum Chemical Investigation of Carbonic Anhydrase Analog Model Systems ¤ The mechanism of the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) between COS and water was investigated using quantum chemical methods. Furthermore, the reaction behavior of various zinc hydroxide complexes in the gas phase could be explained. In a detailed study, it could be shown that the mechanism of the Mitsunobu reaction is significantly more complex than previously assumed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190863-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147291-3>
Don't steal my steel : how interest group systems impact iron and steel policies ¤ Do some interest group systems make it easier for interest groups to succeed? This book answers the question by looking at the relationship between interest groups. If all interest groups either cooperate or compete for influence, the chances of a special interest policy decrease. This conclusion is derived from several empirical analyses which use various qualitative and quantitative methods, such as case studies, fsQCA and panel analysis. The book contributes to the literature on interest groups and lobbying, as well as to the broader literature on comparative political science and political economy. Furthermore, the book caters to readers interested in the political economy of resource policies in general.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121718-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145198-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115586-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200339-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129409-9>
Foreign Armies East: Hitler's Military Intelligence ¤ The General Staff Department Foreign Armies East, which operated under the leadership of Reinhard Gehlen from April 1942, formed the center of Hitler's military intelligence on the Eastern Front. The department worked professionally and operationally tactically reliably. However, its work on a strategic level showed clear deficits: The performance of the Soviet armaments industry, the military-political intentions, and concrete offensive plans of the Red Army remained largely hidden from it. At the end of the war, Gehlen handed over the files and staff of Foreign Armies East to the Americans. With their support, he was able to establish a new foreign intelligence service in the young Federal Republic, from which the Federal Intelligence Service (BND) later emerged. "The successful representation and sovereign source interpretation also result from the author's familiarity with military connections and relevant terminology. Those who are also familiar with this can enjoy reading it around; those who enter new professional territory will be taken by Pahl through the clear structure of the book and the comprehensible argumentation. Almost a hundred pages of annotation apparatus are added to the representation part, which makes reading somewhat laborious; the expert would rather read footnotes. Nevertheless, this careful proof belongs to the strengths of the book: If espionage history (even if Foreign Armies in the classical sense was not a secret service) is to develop further into a seriously considered subject in historical science, it is not least necessary to prove its seriousness in dealing with the sources - as a craft prerequisite for proving that it meets academic requirements in terms of its content relevance" (sehepunkte.de)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056287-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079167-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143395-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076906-9>

Model USA? : Americanization of University and Science in West Germany 1945-1976 ¤ The current debate on the reform of universities is clearly directed at US-American models. It may be surprising that this confrontation goes back to the immediate post-war period. Stefan Paulus illuminates American-German interactions and American influence on German university and science policy after 1945 for the first time. From a cultural and historical perspective of science, the prerequisites, course, and results of the reform discourse from the occupation period to the adoption of the first University Framework Act in 1976 are analyzed. The orientation towards American models is always addressed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4221615-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072560-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025255-3>
Color Preferences in Stingless Bees and Honey Bees: Analysis Considering Individual Color Parameters ¤ Jessica Bossems develops a completely new procedure for testing spontaneous color preferences of bees and tests it successfully in the field on stingless bees in Brazil and under laboratory conditions on honey bees in Germany. Bees belong to the most important pollinators of flowers, where the detection of their flowers often runs over visual signals such as flower size, shape, and color. The author's behavioral biological color preference experiments with stingless bees and honey bees show that bees prefer certain colors over others and react differently strongly to the color attributes prevailing wavelength, color purity, and color intensity. Flowering plants use these color preferences to specifically attract certain pollinators and deter others from visiting the flowers.

Innovative XUV and X-ray plasma spectroscopy to explore warm dense matter ¤ In summary, this work is devoted to the exploration of defined states of warm dense matter. This knowledge is of outstanding importance for laser-fusion research, the study of high-density matter states, as well as a variety of astrophysically relevant questions in plasma research. The present work shows innovative methods for the generation and characterization of warm dense matter. This non-equilibrium state between cold solid and ideal plasma is created by experiments with high energy density. Its properties were studied with high precision. The generation of a defined state of warm dense matter with the help of high-intensity optical short-pulse lasers is challenging. High-energy electrons from a small, hot plasma on the target front surface heat the cold matter through collisional ionization. High spectral and spatial resolutions are necessary to avoid averaging over different plasma states. The author applies advanced X-ray spectroscopy of characteristic emission lines, followed by numerical data processing. The result contains many information, as the line shape is influenced by the plasma parameters and the X-rays are also transparent to solid densities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7843792-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050331-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046265-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139081-7>

Humor and its Benefits for Social Workers ¤ In social work, humor is a still little treated topic. To expand the findings in this field, Markus Frittum deals with the benefits of humor in the working day of social workers, within the team and in dealing with clients. He relies on the current state of knowledge of humor research, which he links to interesting results from practice. The author shows on the basis of problem-centered interviews that humor in practice represents an indispensable resource for the psychohygiene of social workers and thus contributes to the prevention of burnout disease.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127633-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055676-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026170-0>
Oswaldus Crollius and Daniel Sennert in Early Modern Istanbul: Studies on the Reception of Paracelsism in the Work of the Ottoman Physician Ṣāliḥ b. Naṣrullāh Ibn Sallūm al-Ḥalabī ¤ This study examines the reception of Paracelsism in the Ottoman Empire of the 17th century. The focus of the work is the investigation of the Arabic translations of Oswaldus Crollius' Basilica Chymica and Daniel Sennert's De Chymicorum cum Aristotelicis et Galenicis consensu ac dissensu (al-Kīmiyā’ al-malakiyya and at-Tibb al-kīmiyā’i al-dschadīd). They are attributed to the chief physician Ibn Sallum al-Halabi, who is considered a reformer of medicine in the Ottoman Empire and is said to have introduced the Orient to new diseases, Paracelsism, and the Nova medicina through his work. However, this work shows that Ibn Sallum is not considered a translator of the mentioned works and that a Paracelsus reception cannot be attributed to him. Rather, the investigation of his works and the sources in their environment shows that Ibn Sallum was a pragmatic eclectic and remained true to the doctrine of qualities and grades. However, the investigation of the works attributed to Ibn Sallum reveals a broader translation activity that reflects the intense interest of Ottoman scholars in the medical and pharmaceutical literature of Western European countries in the middle of the 17th century. The study works out the textual and cultural conditions and features of this reception process of medical and pharmaceutical writings.

Evil Things : Materiality and Fetishism in Paulus Hochgatterer's Prose ¤ The work of Paulus Hochgatterer is characterized by a fine-grained realism, dense riddle- and reference structures, and an innumerable number of material things. These appear as equipment, tools, action drivers, and distorted cult objects - or as fetishes? Bernhard Oberreither analyzes in the context of historical and contemporary fetish discourses, how seemingly innocent things often prove to be the key to the riddle structure of Hochgatterer's texts.

Crime and Expression Crime: The Civil Liability Structure from Act, Illegality, and Fault ¤ The work deals with the question of the importance and legitimacy of the traditional structure of the crime law from act, illegality, and fault, using the expression crime law. This highly important and practically significant fundamental question of expression law is examined for the first time fundamentally and comprehensively. The work provides answers based on the foundations and three individual aspects of the three-part structure and advocates for the use of the dogmatic and practical advantages of the traditional structure of the crime law in the expression crime law, using a comprehensive expression law concept derived from the results. The script is reflected and critical, both case-related and dogmatically abstract, and illuminates historical developments of law as well as crime and fundamental rights connections. Before the possible harmonization of the law of obligations in the EU, the benefit of the structure of German crime law is thus made clear.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061688-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053460-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130534-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4470590-6>
The Significance of European Criminal Law and Its Influence in Georgia ¤ After the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the European Union has gained further influence on the criminal justice systems of its member states. This has created an interesting tension between two legal fields. The author deals with the influence possibilities on the entire national law of the member states, whereupon the future influence of Georgian criminal law is also analyzed. Although Georgia is not a member of the European Union, it maintains intensive cooperation with it. In the process of harmonizing Georgian legislation with the European, it is indispensable to explore the most important problems in the field of European criminal law and accordingly to prepare the way for the Europeanization of national criminal law.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057795-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048849-4>
How We Behave at University: On the Performative Interaction between University and Society ¤ Alles, what happens between people, is performatively effective and can be checked and (re-)designed thereafter. The interactions between the performativity of academic and societal realities, however, are often under-reflected. Anna Suchard shows that especially between the implicit normativities of the increasingly linearizing acting university operation and the socially formulated goals enormous contradictions arise. Her dramaturgical analysis, how the concrete production of these realities takes place, makes the contradictions visible and negotiable - a boost for all those who advocate for a genuinely meant inter- and transdisciplinarity	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072560-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066611-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122926-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7651115-7>
Counter-Publicity in the Media Society : Analysis of a Medial Tension Relationship ¤ The concept of counter-publicity originates from social movements and contains a strong politically-normative claim, which does not per se make it a concept with heuristic content. The relevant research on counter-publicity and the associated contrast word public is therefore analyzed for the first time from a communication science perspective. In a first step, this volume works on basic public theory and dimensions and the approaches embedded in it. In a second step, the various concepts of counter-publicity literature are presented synoptically, their strengths and weaknesses are worked out, and indicators are named that can serve as a basis for an empirical analysis of non-established actors in the modern media society. - Publicity conceptsCounter-publicity conceptsAnalysis of empirical research on counter-publicityConclusion	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7578669-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037877-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043183-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4204973-8>

Evaluation Units under HGB: Critical Assessment of Section 254 HGB ¤ Astrid Schüler analyzes the effects of the, in the context of the BilMoG reformulated, Section 254 HGB on the purposes of financial accounting. In doing so, the author shows that the legislator's goal of a more economically sound representation of security relationships while increasing the information level can only be achieved to a limited extent with the codified regulation. The traditionally principle-oriented design of Section 254 HGB makes the new regulation interpretively demanding, enables accounting policy design options, and leads, due to the complexity of this field, to a multitude of questions regarding the application and interpretation of the new legal norm.

Negotiating Colonial Heritage : Memory and Power in the Processing of Colonial Past in Hamburg ¤ In the summer of 2014, the Hamburg Senate decided that the Hanseatic city should begin to process its colonial past as the first city in Germany. The book examines the negotiations on the reorientation of urban memory policy within the framework of the round table 'Colonial Heritage' and sheds light on the social conditions of collective remembering of European colonial rule. With its power-theoretical perspective, the case study provides in-depth insights into the conflicts and compromises regarding the competences of the different memory policy actors and the interpretations of the city's colonial past and its consequences.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061672-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073624-6>
Multinuclear Titanocene Complexes with N-Heterocyclic Bridging Ligands ¤ A series of novel multinuclear titanocene complexes were synthesized from low-valent titanium compounds and aromatic N-heterocycles. Spectroscopic investigations and single crystal X-ray analyses revealed the structures of the highly air- and moisture-sensitive compounds and yielded the following results: the conversion of low-valent titanocene units with linear bridging ligands leads to tetranuclear titanium(II) complexes, which exhibit structures of 'molecular squares'. Analogous 'molecular rectangles' are available by stepwise coordination of two bridging ligands of different lengths. In contrast, other N-heterocyclic ligands are reduced by the low-valent titanium units and polynuclear complexes of higher oxidation states are formed by reductive C-C coupling reactions and C-H activation. In these complexes the newly formed and no longer aromatic ligands associate the titanium centres to binuclear, trinuclear and octanuclear units. <engl.> END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4244545-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043813-2>
Emotional Brand Attachment in Social Networks: The Effect of Interactions between Customer and Brand on Facebook ¤ Stephen K.

Investigations on the Influence of Intestinal Factors on the Colonization of Campylobacter spp. in Pigs ¤ Campylobacteriosis is one of the most significant foodborne zoonoses. Infections primarily occur in humans, although the pathogen is widespread in food-producing animals. The majority of human infections are caused by C. jejuni (~ 73 %) and C. coli (~ 10 %). Infection with C. jejuni occurs mainly through contaminated poultry meat, while transmission of C. coli through pork is suspected due to the high prevalence of the pathogen in pig herds. Both species can be isolated from poultry and pigs. The aim of the study was to determine the growth requirements of two MLST-typed Campylobacter strains of different species based on substrate utilization (in vitro). Building on this, a connection between colonization and available substrates in various intestinal sections of pigs was investigated using a animal model. At the same time, the effects of infection on trans-epithelial transport processes in the jejunum and caecum, as well as on pathohistological changes in the intestinal mucosa, were examined. To exclude infection of pigs with Campylobacter field strains for the development of the animal model, the collection of piglets had to be carried out by cesarean section, as the infection of piglets through the contaminated birth canal of the sow was to be expected due to the high prevalence of C. coli in the pig herds. The rearing was carried out under strict hygiene standards. Infection with C. coli ST5777 and C. jejuni ST122 occurred at the age of 7-8 weeks as mono- and co-infection. Four weeks later, both strains could be isolated from the jejunum, ileum, caecum, and colon. A proof of the infection strains from further organs (liver, spleen, and lymph nodes) was not possible. This suggests that the strains have not overcome the intestinal barrier, although the integrity of the caecum was impaired due to infection with C. jejuni, which could be demonstrated by a change in the trans-epithelial ion transport processes of the caecum using the Ussing chamber method. Histopathologically, no changes in the intestinal epithelium could be demonstrated. The microbiome analysis of the contents of the various intestinal sections showed a very low proportion of Campylobacterales in the total microbiome (on average less than 0.5 %), so that the influence of the infection strains on the metabolome through their metabolism was also considered to be relatively low. The comparison of the results of the metabolome study with those of the in vitro study...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113937-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012494-0>
Customer-oriented Target Costing and Supplier Integration for Complex Products: Development of a Concept for the Automotive Industry ¤ Subject and structure of the work -- Fundamentals of Target Costing in the automotive industry -- Development of a multi-stage Target-Costing concept for automobiles -- Integration of automotive suppliers into the multi-stage Target-Costing concept -- Conclusion. Target Costing supports the development of market-oriented and cost-effective products and contributes to the long-term survival of industrial enterprises. Existing Target-Costing approaches, however, are largely limited to the development of simple products with few product components. Claus Schulte-Henke examines how customer-oriented Target Costing can be implemented for all components of complex products and how suppliers can be integrated into the Target-Costing process. He develops a multi-stage Target-Costing concept based on a consistently illustrated practical example from the automotive industry, which enables the application of customer-oriented Target Costing for products of any complexity. Finally, the author defines three types of integration of automotive suppliers and shows possible approaches and behaviors within the supplier-integrating Target Costing for the automotive manufacturer and its individual supplier types.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4310399-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032690-1>

Horizons of Democratic Education : Evangelical Religious Education in Political Perspective ¤ The book examines how evangelical religious education dealt with questions of political and democratic education up to the 1990s. On this basis, it then develops a theory of evangelical religious education in a political perspective. For this purpose, approaches of current political education and religious education are discussed. The goal is to unfold evangelical education as democratic education.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4149063-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046526-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153261-2>
The Successful Reintegration of Expatriates: Motivational and Organizational Influencing Factors ¤ In order to remain competitive in the international market, companies send employees abroad. These expatriates can secure crucial competitive advantages for the company after their foreign assignment – but only if they are successfully reintegrated into the company and efficiently deployed after their return. This often does not happen, so that many expatriates leave their company shortly after their return. The consequence: significant losses and disadvantages for the company. How this can be prevented in the future is the subject of this study.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1268456152> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002623-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4247490-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003789-7>
Dividend Payments of Municipal Savings Banks: An Examination of the Significance and Binding Effect of the Interests of the Sponsors for the Annual Financial Statements ¤ This work aims to contribute to the clarification of the relationship between municipal savings banks and their sponsors. The central question is what significance the dividend payments of annual surpluses to the sponsors have. In the past, such dividend payments were not widespread. On the other hand, it is now being observed that in many places, municipal politics is pushing for dividend payments of annual surpluses in favor of the municipal budget. This trend falls into a time when the savings banks must assert themselves in a business environment that is made more difficult by the ongoing low-interest phase. In particular, they are dependent on the steadily increasing supervisory requirements to deposit their annual surpluses in a capital-effective manner in reserves. Against this background, the legitimacy of the sponsor's dividend demand is examined. As an example, the decision on the funding of the special fund for general bank risks in accordance with § 340g (1) HGB serves. It is checked which bindings this funding decision is subject to and to what extent a sponsor's dividend demand is to be taken into account. The author studied law from 2011 to 2016 at the Faculty of Law of the Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf. He is currently a trainee lawyer at the Düsseldorf District Court.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162679-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056030-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020908-8>
The Governance of Multistakeholder Initiatives: An Investigation of the Example of the 'Forum Sustainable Cocoa e.V.' as MSI in the Cocoa and Chocolate Sector ¤ This book provides detailed insights into the activities of a German multistakeholder initiative (MSI) in the cocoa and chocolate sector. In such initiatives, private, public and civil society organisations come together to solve sustainability issues on a global scale. Networked action requires common goals, but they must be negotiated with respect to the inherent heterogeneity of the participating organisations. This is where this case study comes in as it explores the bargaining practices and outcomes achieved by an MSI by elaborating and empirically implementing the concept of network governance.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4400061-3>
Ship and Wreck Recovery at Sea: A Comparative Investigation of German, French, English, and US Law ¤ The work deals with the still largely unexplored legal questions of the recovery of ships and wrecks at sea, including four legal systems. The first part deals with the recovery of ships outside contractual agreements. Existing regulations of national and international law are examined and regulatory gaps are worked out. The handling of the selected legal systems with open questions and their approaches to determining the applicable law are at the center. Against the background of increasing treasure hunter activities on the oceans, the second part deals with the recovery of wrecks, particularly objects of both archaeological and commercial value. Here too, national and international legal regulations and their regulatory gaps are examined, and a solution proposal for the harmonization of cultural heritage protection and commercial interests is presented.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127575-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031772-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4051148-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066981-6>
Intersex Operations : the criminal law assessment of sex-determining operations on intersex minors under special consideration of proxy parental consent ¤ The question of whether sex-determining operations on intersex minors should be allowed is of the utmost sociopolitical relevance. At the same time, there is a lack of intensive legal research on this interdisciplinary issue. This publication seeks to remedy this failing and, for the first time, provide the reader with a profound and practicable solution model that takes equal account of subjective weighting powers and objective consideration parameters. In addition to addressing the conceptual–structural and medical–biological foundations in this respect, this study comprehensively examines whether intersex minors have the option to consent to such an operation themselves and, in particular, considers the scope and limits of parents’ consent in this regard. Finally, the author submits a legislative proposal which aims to ensure an appropriate balance between the legal positions and interests concerned.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039417-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003157-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075664-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113402-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131795-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027484-6>
Teaching Robots With Interactive Reinforcement Learning ¤ ...Learning autonomous action regarding a specific task by a robot is still an unsolved problem today. A possible supportive learning strategy for autonomous robots is providing a so-called “teacher” or “trainer”, whose role is to guide the robot in the execution of a task, similar to how parents help their children learn skills. In the present dissertation, we therefore focus on exactly such learning scenarios, particularly on interactive, reinforcing learning (“interactive reinforcement learning”, IRL) for executing household tasks. We use the aforementioned teacher principle to investigate two case studies: agent-agent interaction and human-agent interaction...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4825546-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4396128-9>
Diakonie in the School : Theoretical Classification and Practical Consequences Based on an Evaluation Study ¤ The study is based on a learning-theoretical understanding of diaconal learning, which is based on the US-derived theory of situated learning. The design and implementation of the investigation also take into account the approach of competency-based learning. The results emphasize the unique value of diaconal instruction for experiential learning that leads students to encounter people who are often on the periphery of society and at the same time to encounter themselves. It also becomes clear that girls and boys bring different prerequisites for access to diaconal projects and that these should be taken into account in the sense of a differentiated didactics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077606-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114402-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055760-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012046-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4721684-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153261-2>

Intention and Reality of Integrative Education: A Network-Analytical Contribution to Neo-Institutionalism ¤ In his book, Mathias Mejeh analyzes school integration in an organizational sociological context. He succeeds in clarifying crucial questions related to this problem on a novel network-theoretical basis. Through the statutory anchoring of school integration, the school is confronted with various changes as an institution. With the associated development of corresponding concepts, the question also arises as to how and to what extent actors involved in implementing them respect the corresponding new regulations. Can teachers adhere to legal guidelines when implementing school integration, or can laws be designed to be consistent enough to be implementable in educational practice at all?

Performance Gain through Unitarization: Developmental Lines of German Federalism in the Policy Field of Internal Security ¤ The German policy field of internal security has been subject to increased pressure for adaptation and optimization since the 1990s. Existing studies primarily note a trend towards strengthening the federal level and limiting state autonomy. At first glance, this suggests that the originally state-autonomous organized policy field of internal security is on a path towards unitarization, which is often seen as an inherent developmental logic of German federalism. The political science contribution to the topic has thus far been deficient. In order to make a contribution to a better understanding of federal systems in general and German security federalism in particular, the developmental lines of German federalism since the 1990s are analyzed using selected case studies from the fields of police, constitutional protection, and criminal policy. The following questions are at the center: To what extent can a trend towards unitarization be spoken of for the policy field of internal security? What are the causes of this trend? What effects do these have on the performance capability of German federalism in the field of internal security? The author Luis Illan worked at the Chair of Comparative Political Science (Focus on Western Europe) at the University of Regensburg. Since 2022, he has been working as a specialist consultant for a public law corporation.

Coordination of School and Municipal Political Decision-Makers: A Qualitative Study on the School Structural Pilot Project 'Community School in Development' in Thuringia ¤ This qualitative study deals with the coordination of decision-makers that leads to participation in school structural pilot projects. The introduction of the community school in Thuringia is taken into account. The question is asked how it comes about that an existing school is converted into a community school. The decision to participate in the pilot project is based on voluntary participation and is made through the coordination of several (school and municipal political) decision-makers whose relationship is characterized by interdependencies. The decision must be negotiated and, among other things, increased tension fields are to be expected. In order to make the specific experiential knowledge of the decision-makers accessible, a qualitative and reconstructive research procedure is required. For this reason, the method of expert interviews with narrative parts is resorted to. The data basis of the work is based on the reconstruction of two cases, which are composed of the perspective of a municipal political decision-maker and a school decision-maker. The evaluation was carried out on the basis of the documentary method (cf. Bohnsack 2010). The goal of the study is to investigate the coordination of decision-makers that leads to participation in a school structural pilot project. Thus, knowledge about guiding orientations, interactions, actor constellations, and success conditions is generated. The study closes a gap in educational development research, particularly in organizational research. A key finding of the dissertation is that congruences between municipal political and school decision-makers as well as between these decision-makers and situational structures are decisive for the coordination that leads to participation in school structural pilot projects. Thus, congruences between municipal political and school decision-makers are documented in the presence of forms of trust and a shared vision. Similarly, congruences between the protagonists and the framework of the pilot project 'Community School in Development' are evident. The latter are characterized by recontextualizations. The decision to restructure into a community school is made through a cross-level coordination of several decision-makers whose relationship is characterized by interdependencies. For this reason, the results are discussed against the background of the analysis categories of Educational Governance and the paradoxes in school reform processes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130285-0>

C-Arylglycosides and Chalcones: New Paths to Heterocyclic Drugs through Ru- and Pd-Catalyzed Reactions ¤ In the ongoing era of scientific medicine, a broad spectrum of drugs for the treatment of various diseases has been compiled to date. Nevertheless, organic synthesis chemistry has made it its task to expand this spectrum on new or known ways and for various reasons. On the one hand, the occurrence of certain compounds in nature is often limited, so that synthetic methods increasingly take the place of a less sustainable degradation. On the other hand, the physiological effect or bioavailability of a drug can be increased through derivatization and drug adaptation. In this work, some representatives of the known drug classes C-Arylglycosides and Chalcones could be synthesized through the key step of the palladium-catalyzed MATSUDA-HECK reaction. For the case of C-Arylglycosides, unsaturated carbohydrates (glycals) were first represented through a ruthenium-catalyzed cyclization reaction. These were then brought into reaction with differently substituted diazonium salts in the aforementioned palladium-catalyzed coupling reaction.

The Reconstruction of Teacher Education in North Rhine-Westphalia 1945 to 1954 ¤ Cliffnotes: After the collapse in 1945, a comprehensive reconstruction of teacher education was urgently needed. The quality of teacher education for elementary school teachers had to be improved, while at the same time the teacher shortage caused by war losses and denazification had to be remedied. The present work deals with the decision for the re-establishment of pedagogical academies and the influential interventions of the British occupying authorities. It further explains the controversial discussions about the anchoring of teacher education in the state constitution by the new state government in NRW and the efforts to approach the	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035093-9>

Sport in Rhythm : Functional Music in Sports for Older Adults ¤ Music in sports motivates. Not surprisingly, activating music is played on repeat in fitness studios around the world, which has brought this unique combination into focus in sports and music science. Yves Cloos provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of research. In doing so, he focuses his attention on music in sports with older adults – and supplements this previously rather neglected area of research with his own comprehensive studies. His exciting results: Yes, older adults are also open to the use of music in sports, but they describe their experiences in a completely different way than expected. Particularly subjective impressions push objective measurable factors into the background. Cloos has also developed the Dortmund Music Assessment for Sports (DoMuS) as a measuring instrument that can identify particularly motivating music for sports. Initial field tests show: Targeted music selection in sports can lead to higher endurance performance at the same perceived exertion and influences both well-being and	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001477-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155671-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040802-4>
The new market infrastructure in OTC derivatives trading: an investigation in the light of institutional interaction between law and finance with references to German, English, and U.S. law ¤ As a reaction to the global financial crisis, the G20 agreed in 2009 to introduce a requirement for central counterparty (CCP) clearing in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trading by the end of 2012. The author investigates this new market infrastructure for its crisis resilience. In doing so, he focuses on the relationship between law and financial stability and incorporates central findings from the crisis review in science. It shows that, especially in times of crisis, the rigid enforcement of (financial) contracts can have destabilizing effects. Consequently, the binding effect of mechanisms such as margin calls – contrary to their conception – may need to be relaxed. Furthermore, CCPs bundle the risks of OTC derivatives trading and thus reveal themselves as system-relevant nodes. In addition, the author identifies conflicting interests within the clearing system to the detriment of financial stability. As a result, he comes to the inclusion of the CCP system in a public-private partnership.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121590-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4381572-8>
Transformation in Transport : Success Conditions for Key Transport Policy Measures ¤ Lisa Ruhrort examines the acceptance of measures that take away space and privileges from car traffic. From a technical-sociological perspective, she identifies these measures as key measures of a transport turnaround and develops the thesis that the emergence of a „multimodal“ mobility culture in urban centers will lead to increasing acceptance of these measures. In order to achieve climate protection goals in transport, the existing privileges of car traffic must also be dismantled when using public spaces. So far, measures that make the car less attractive have been considered politically hardly enforceable. But could the social discourse around the role of the car change? Lisa Ruhrort predicts that an increasingly multimodal population, especially in cities, will demand a „multimodal“ transport policy.

In the dissertation, own research on the modulation of emotional episodic long-term memory, especially on recognition memory performance and encoding- and retrieval-related event-related potentials (ERPs), is presented. Three ERP studies were conducted. The first study investigated spontaneous remembering of emotional events. In the second experiment, a crossover design for memory recognition studies was tested. The third study explored the noradrenergic influences on emotional memory. Next to discussing the results in the light existing findings and concepts (natural selective attention by Bradley & Lang and neuromodulation hypothesis by McGaugh), the obtained results are put in a broader context of emotional episodic long-term memory and the possible implications for clinical research are indicated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189830-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015272-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019614-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4202962-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152719-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152537-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019702-5>
Siloah - Source of Life : A Cultural History of the Jerusalem City Fountain ¤ The Jerusalem city fountain is known in tradition and present under the name Siloam, even though its water comes from the Gihon spring. An underground pipeline, the so-called Hezekiah's Tunnel, leads the water of the spring through the southeastern hill to the present day. For almost two millennia, this western outlet of the tunnel was considered the Siloam spring or the Siloam of Jerusalem. The actual spring, the Gihon, on the other hand, fell into oblivion for over a thousand years. Today, the water systems of the southeastern hill are among the archaeological sites that have been most intensively researched worldwide. The present work deals with the cultural memories of Siloam. It develops a cultural history of the Jerusalem city fountain from its beginnings to the present day on the basis of a diverse selection of different text and image media. Special attention is paid to the plurality and variability of memory cultures on the one hand, and the connection to material structures and architectures on the other. The work combines a historically critical source study with a memory cultural approach in a sociological perspective of space.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176696-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200793-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049396-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064811-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125698-0>
Development and Validation of an Instrument for Assessing the Professional Teaching Perception of Pre-Service Physics Teachers ¤ The professional teaching perception is a central and situational ability that enables (pre-service) teachers to recognize learning processes in the classroom, interpret them using their professional knowledge, and subsequently derive learning-promoting action plans. The underlying research question of this work is whether this ability can be validly assessed with a physics-specific focus using an instrument consisting of staged teaching videos and a partially closed questionnaire. Such an instrument could be used to determine whether the professional teaching perception is domain-specific (Hypothesis 1) and whether this situational ability experiences a progression along the university education (Hypothesis 2). The results of the work yield 19 items (EAP reliability is 0.698) with which a physics-specific professional teaching perception can be measured. Further analyses (correlation with physics didactics knowledge and dependence on study-related data) support the construct validity of the test. In relation to Hypothesis 1, it has been shown as expected that the physics-specific professional teaching perception is significantly dependent on the studied subject and the course of study. In contrast to expectations, the results for Hypothesis 2 show that the professional teaching perception is not significantly dependent on the progress of study	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1077028245> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4387450-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174612-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045977-9>
Participatory governance in the Europe of cross-border regions : cooperation - boundaries - civil society ¤ This policy analysis examines geopolitical and sociocultural bordering practices in Europe’s cross-border regions and their impact on civil society participation and governance in state peripheries. The normative hope of democratisation and the legitimisation of European politics in European Union border regions are connected with a greater degree of cross-border citizen engagement in Euroregional institutions and politics.

The Impact of a Defect-Based Revocation of the Sales Contract on the Financing Lease Agreement ¤ The defect-based revocation of a lessee leads to the sales contract being revoked due to the third-party referral clause, leaving the financing lease agreement unaffected and only leading to the revocation of the sales contract in accordance with §§ 346 ff. BGB. -- Stephanie Sittmann-Haury rejects the subsequent 'business foundation case law' and the counter-proposals from the literature, which nonetheless attempt to justify an impact on the lease agreement, and develops her own solution, which consistently takes into account the previously worked out risk allocation in the ratio of lessor/lessee: The lessor is made impossible to hand over the thing to the lessee by the return to the supplier, although the lessee is still liable for lease payments under § 326 Abs. 2 S. 1 Var. 1 BGB. However, he can demand the return of the purchase price paid back by the supplier to the lessor under § 285 Abs. 1 BGB and, in addition to the supplier, claim further burdens (higher interest and profit shares in the lease payments) as damage under §§ 398, 437 Nr. 3, 280 Abs. 1, 3, 281 BGB.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154415-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178840-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178627-0>
Colonia Dignidad between Remembering and Forgetting : On the Culture of Remembrance in the Former Settlement Community ¤ Colonia Dignidad gained international notoriety due to numerous human rights abuses that remain uninvestigated to this day. The fact that former members of the German group have gradually transformed the historical settlement site in Chile into a tourist resort under the name 'Villa Baviera' (German: Bavarian village), amidst the lack of reconciliation, has sparked ongoing criticism. Meike Dreckmann-Nielen examines how former members of the group remember their own past today.

Planning Statistical Investigations: Difficulties and Errors of Students when Dealing with Statistical Planning Tasks ¤ The planning and implementation of statistical surveys are two significant phases in the overall process of a statistical investigation and are compulsory teaching contents of secondary stages I and II according to national education standards. Candy Walter provides, using a qualitative interview study, indications of the difficulties and errors that can occur among students of grades 9 and 10 of various real schools and grammar schools when dealing with tasks related to statistical planning. Furthermore, the author develops, based on theoretical phase models that illustrate the procedure for planning statistical investigations in the context of business economics and transportation development planning, using established methods of didactic reduction, a personal phase model that can be used as a guide for mathematics instruction. The content A phase model for statistical planning in mathematics instruction Difficulties and errors in the context of statistical planning and data collection Target groups Lecturers and students of mathematics didactics Teachers and trainees of secondary stages I and II for the subjects mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology The author Candy Walter is a research assistant at the Institute for Mathematics and Applied Computer Science in the Department of Mathematics Education at the University of Hildesheim	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037949-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056995-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077347-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155272-6>
Schwarz-grüne Koalitionen in Deutschland : Experience Values from Municipalities and States and Perspectives for the Federation ¤ This comparative study analyses formation and conflict management in local and regional coalition governments between Christian Democrats and Greens in Germany. Based on the results of its analysis, the study evaluates the prospects of success for a conservative-green coalition at national level and indicates possible problems which might arise in that future government’s cabinet.The analysis is based on the comparison of seven local and two regional case studies of coalition governments between the Christian Democrats and the Green Party. Underpinned by reflections on strategic, programmatic and voter-related issues connected to a conservative-green coalition at national level, the study shows that such a government constitutes a considerable risk for both parties.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4520453-6>
Service Engineering in Technical Services: An Economic Analysis of Modularization, Depth of Service Design, and System Bundling ¤ Wolfgang Burr shows that an efficient production of services can be realized if they are organized with the help of methods and concepts that have proven themselves in industrial production (Service Engineering). Through the industrialization of technical services, more efficient internal or cross-company coordination of service production, multiple use of resource potentials, and generation of new services in a short time are enabled. The analysis is carried out with economic approaches of strategy and organization theory as well as on the basis of the results of five empirical case studies. For the second edition, the text has been restructured and updated in terms of content, a new chapter on the state of Service Engineering in science and practice has been written, and a new case study has been presented.

Paths of School Development : Towards the Theory and Practice of Learning Schools ¤ The learning ability of a school can be considered a critical factor for its success and the quality of its educational offerings. School development is the intentional design of organizational learning processes and can support individual schools on the way to becoming learning schools. The research of successful paths and strategies of school development presents a methodological challenge, for which solutions are offered in the present work. How can different forms of changes be classified and thus distinguished from one another? Can regularities be identified in the course of time? Based on a thorough theoretical discussion and systematization of the development logic of organizations, school development types are constructed on an empirical basis. Subsequently, a detailed description and reflection of different courses of school development processes are carried out using a specific analysis grid. The comparative analysis of the development courses reveals commonalities regarding the problem-solving tasks to be addressed in the development process.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126892-1>
Influencing Factors in Financial Instrument Accounting under IFRS 9 ¤ The accounting for financial instruments in the annual financial statements of companies, in particular credit institutions, has been fundamentally changed by IFRS 9. The beginning of the great financial crisis of the years 2007/2008 confirmed the need for revision of the then IAS 39, as this – in addition to its complexity and subjectivity – was particularly criticized due to its procyclical effect in the context of the recognition of impairments on assets (in particular on financial instruments) as a 'fire accelerator' of the financial market crisis. The book provides a comprehensive overview of the accounting for financial instruments under IFRS 9 and illustrates numerous of the political instruments contained therein.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006566-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4461672-7>
The Legal Protection of the Human Corpse: A Comparative Study on the Legal Evaluation of Actions on the Human Corpse in the Federal Republic of Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Austria ¤ After an intensive discussion about a transplantation law in the 1970s, it had been quiet for a long time about the discussion of the relationship between law and human corpse. However, at the beginning of the 1990s, the public was shocked by different press reports about actions on the human corpse that were felt to be immoral or at least ethically problematic. In this context, one should remember the so-called crash tests on corpses, the unauthorized removal of organs and body parts for sale to pharmaceutical companies, or the artificial maintenance of a dead woman's pregnancy ("Erlanger Baby"). The work examines the legal protection of the human corpse in the Federal Republic of Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Austria. It examines the applicability of both existing penal protection norms and statutory and supra-statutory justifications with regard to actions on the human corpse. The discussion of individual questions illustrates the results achieved. A possibility for improving the aforementioned penal protection is shown.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057795-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167214-8>
Attribution of Omission in Third-Party Rescue Events: With Special Consideration of Compliance Systems ¤ Timo Schrott examines in this publication a problem of attribution that played a decisive role in the criminal prosecution of the collapse of the Bad Reichenhaller ice rink on January 2, 2006: Can a person who has failed to act as required invoke their own exoneration by arguing that, had they acted as required, another person might have caused the outcome? -- In work-sharing structures, this problem brings the criminal attribution system to the limits of its performance capability. While the BGH acquits under the principle of doubt, influential authors find exoneration unbearable and attribute the outcome. -- In a philosophical introduction to law, the author sets the currently prevailing causal determination based on natural laws against hermeneutic approaches. -- In the core part of the legal doctrine, he develops his own solution after processing the discussion in case law and literature. The decisive challenge he sees in enabling a predictable, fact-based attribution. He develops attribution criteria that maintain the necessary reference to the concrete event and avoid excessive hypothetical considerations. -- In a concluding study, the author examines the problem of attribution in the context of compliance systems and thus expands the discussion, which has so far been very focused on the guarantor position of the compliance officer.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4233771-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013019-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068129-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4442497-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140842-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026899-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019255-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125635-9>
Configurations of the Past: German Historical Dramas in the Age of Restoration ¤ In the most popular literary genre of German-language literature in the 'Century of History', the historical drama, the attractiveness of a 'history culture' is reflected, in which the knowledge and representational performances of historical research, historiography, historical museums, archaeology, art, and literature converge. It forms the starting and endpoint for a series of readings dedicated to dramas from the early 19th century, dramas of many authors who are now unknown and some who are still known - including Christian Dietrich Grabbe, Heinrich von Kleist, and Karl Immermann - who find their theme 'in history' and their individual stories. Centered around the two strands of the construction of a German nation after the Napoleonic Wars and the entanglement of modern subjectivity in history, these texts provide materials for an archaeology of the ensemble of symbolic techniques of self-modeling and self-interpretation of the cultural system between Enlightenment and Historicism, in which the shimmering ambiguity, attractiveness, and burdensome legacy of a programmatic turn into the past become apparent.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025133-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0>
Resource Provision as a Strategic Success Factor of Regional Development: An Analysis at the Example of the European Metropolitan Region Rhine-Neckar ¤ In times of megatrends „Globalization“ and „Demographic Change“, regions are competing with companies to achieve their growth targets for valuable resources. To increase the attractiveness of the location and thus create incentives for companies, highly qualified employees, and self-employed individuals, the strengths and weaknesses of one's own region must be known. In this work, critical success factors of entrepreneurial location choice are identified for the European Metropolitan Region Rhine-Neckar and compared with prevailing conditions. Furthermore, factors are determined that influence the share of highly qualified individuals and self-employed individuals at the workplace and place of residence. This enables recommendations for action to increase regional attractiveness and thus competitiveness of the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region to be derived. The work is aimed at regional planners and company representatives from the metropolitan region as well as interested students who deal with regional policy and regional economic issues 1 Introduction -- 2 Theoretical foundations for determining regional competitive advantages -- 3 Development of strategically valuable resources in the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region - Descriptive analysis of the labor market -- 4 The attractiveness of the region for companies - Critical location factors and future branches of the MRN -- 5 Attractiveness of the region for highly qualified individuals and self-employed individuals - Econometric analysis of influencing factors -- 6 Implications for increasing the regional attractiveness of the MRN -- 7 Conclusion -- Appendix -- Bibliography	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160783-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4223616-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4219652-8>
Analyzing self-healing operations in mechatronic systems ¤ Self-healing may be used to reduce occurrence probabilities of hazards in mechatronic systems, which are applied in safety-critical environments. Self-healing mechatronic systems react to failures by a reconfiguration of the architecture during runtime. This means, the exchange of components or the modification of the components' connections, in order to avoid that a failure results in a hazard. This reaction is subject to hard real-time constraints, because reacting too late does not yield the intended self-healing effects. In order to judge whether a self-healing operation reduces the probability of the hazard successfully, we must consider the failure propagation times and the effect of the self-healing operation on the propagation of failures. In this thesis, we present an analysis of self-healing operations that particularly considers the problems mentioned above. This analysis operates on failure propagation models that contain information about propagation times. The failure propagation models are generated automatically from the behavior models of system components.In the domain of reconfigurable mechatronic systems, not all architectural configurations of a system that are constructed at runtime may be known at design time. This applies in particular to systems of systems. These systems only meet at runtime and establish connections in order to cooperate. These connections may lead to configurations that were unknown at design time. However, the analysis of self-healing operations requires concrete architectural configurations. We consequently present a framework that allows for executing our analysis of self-healing operations at runtime. Reconfigurations are locked if they construct configurations whose hazard occurrence probabilities exceed the valid hazard occurrence probability of the system.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126276-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076370-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4238812-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054433-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027145-6>
One-dimensional stochastic differential equations with generalized drift w.r.t. continuous local martingales ¤ In this work, stochastic differential equations with generalized drift are considered, which are driven by a continuous local martingale. Conditions for the weak existence and uniqueness in distribution of solutions to such equations are formulated and proven. For this, the characterization of the distribution of continuous local martingales by means of Markov kernels plays a central role. Furthermore, the existence of strong solutions and the pathwise uniqueness of solutions are considered. Finally, the found results are applied to equations with ordinary drift.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057621-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128328-4>
The detection of fraudulent financial statements using textual and financial data ¤ The trust in the correctness of published annual reports forms a foundation for functioning capital markets. Prominent accounting scandals repeatedly shake the trust of market participants in the credibility of the published information and lead to an inefficient allocation of resources. Reliable, automated fraud detection systems based on publicly available data can contribute to more efficient allocation of examination resources and strengthen the resilience of capital markets by protecting market participants more strongly against accounting fraud. In this study, the development of a fraud detection model is in the foreground, which extracts typical patterns for fraudulent manipulations from textual and numerical components of annual reports and combines them in a comprehensive disclosure model. The investigation relies on a comprehensive methodological approach, which addresses important problems and questions in the process of creating, expanding, and testing the models. The analysis of the textual components of the annual reports is carried out on the basis of multi-word phrases, including a comprehensive language standardization, in order to better process narrative characteristics and context. Furthermore, the pattern extraction is enriched by successful financial predictors from the works such as balance sheet or income and expense statement, and thus the annual report is captured in its breadth and as many possible indications are identified. The results indicate a reliable and robust detection performance over a period of 15 years. In addition, the results imply that text-based predictors are superior to financial indicators and that a combination of both is required to achieve the best possible results. Furthermore, text-based predictors show a strong variation over time, which underlines the importance of regular updating of the models. The overall detection performance was able to outperform comparable approaches on average.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162679-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4198491-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145377-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112701-8>
The Use of Youth Violence Prevention: Subjectification Forms of a Problem Discourse ¤ Since ever, youth discourses take the form of problem discourses. What specific meaning does youth violence prevention have in this context? Verena Kuglstatter links discourse analysis by Michel Foucault with interpretive procedures and shows for Switzerland how the orientation of social work professionals to criminal policy programs leads to youth violence being discursively produced as a problematic and permanently manageable issue. As a result, professions and generational power relations are legitimized on the one hand – on the other hand, social work is restricted in its autonomy and young people are denied opportunities for participation	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157237-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055676-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028859-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076308-0>
Systemic Issues of Insolvency Avoidance - A German-Italian Comparative Law Study in the Context of European International Insolvency Law ¤ The work compares German and Italian insolvency avoidance law and places the results in the context of European insolvency law under the EU Insolvency Regulation. In doing so, practical conclusions are drawn for contract design in international trade. The author first provides a detailed historical overview of avoidance law from Roman law to the InsO. Subsequently, based on the insights gained, the current systematics of German avoidance law are questioned. In particular, the relationship between creditor and insolvency avoidance, the concept of creditor disadvantage, and the avoidance of performed services are discussed. The author argues that the intentional avoidance under § 133 InsO should not be understood as part of insolvency avoidance in accordance with the convincing systematics of Italian law and that insolvency avoidance should be strictly distinguished from creditor avoidance. The work provides a brief overview of Italian insolvency law and is based on the new Italian Insolvency Code. The effects of the new restructuring directive on the insolvency avoidance law of both legal systems are also examined. The Italian avoidance provisions with German translation are printed in the appendix.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4414630-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115712-6>
Development of Elementary School: From the Lower Level (East) to the Current Elementary Education Discussion ¤ Claptext: The current elementary education discussion is accompanied by a comprehensive reform process of this school level, in the center of which stands the search for future German ways. Against this background, the school policy development in the former GDR since 1945 up to the peaceful revolution in the year 1989 is retraced, in order to show impulses from there for the solution of the problematics regarding a possible design of the institutions, teacher education, and instruction.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075624-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022349-8>
A Contribution to the Development of Cooperating Mobile Robots - Constructive Design and Control Design ¤ In this work, the essential results for the construction of the RoboCup-Small-Size-Robot LUKAS and the assembly of the coordinating master software XBase are presented. The achieved compactness and the necessary mass-power ratio of the robot are based essentially on the orthogonal axis configuration. Special material and structural solutions for lightweight construction and space utilization are found in the polyamide chassis, the motor-integrated dribbler, and the energy-efficient shot mechanism. Omnidirectional wheels with solid round-trip, traction, and stability properties are in use. The three-wheeled robot implements a hierarchical construction concept, which realizes high reliability, flexibility, and robustness to a greater extent through technical functional integration of a minimal number of components. After analyzing the kinematic and dynamic relationships, a controller architecture was developed for the robot that, taking into account wheel slip and center of gravity shift, allows omnidirectional maneuverability and motion precision. The further developed master software XBase combines a modified image processing for robot detection and a user-friendly human-machine interface with the instrument for robot coordination. Stable image rates and reduced computational effort are ensured by the use of a look-up table for maximum likelihood color classification, line coincidence-based image segmentation, and resource-saving operations. An appropriate training entry was found with various formation variants for coordinated control of a robot group. The model allows an transition from rigid to flexible bonding through individual release of degrees of freedom. The flexibility and transformability are represented by the example formations block, row, and column. The XBase system can function both as a multi-robot system under the control of a behavior control and as a distributed multi-agent system with several parallel behavior systems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018968-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4261462-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4304075-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042803-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4734038-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129594-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4389058-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4211191-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193754-5>
VR Information System for Determining User-Oriented Requirements for VR Systems in the Context of Virtual Product Development ¤ New technological software systems must be user-oriented, profitable, flexible, and simultaneously performant. The rapid progress of innovative technologies often leads to a deficit in the information or communication flow between involved stakeholders. In the context of Virtual Reality (VR) applications, it is further complicated that this innovative technology and its scope are still insufficiently described. This leads on the one hand to the fact that VR customers cannot align their wishes and visions regarding a VR system according to the current technical possibilities. On the other hand, VR developers face the challenge of designing and communicating customer-oriented and exploiting the full potential that can be achieved with VR technologies. There is a lack of a structured tool that assists VR customers in configuring a desired VR system for the first time and provides relevant information, as well as providing VR developers with an overview for optimal initial conversation preparation and an immediate decision-making basis for accepting an order. The goal of this work is to support the early information exchange between VR customers and VR developers. For this purpose, a VR information system is developed, the use of which is predated by the realization of the VR system and specifies the desired VR system. By providing all VR specifications and associated metadata, it should be possible for VR customers to acquire knowledge about VR, configure a desired VR system, and prioritize focal points. VR developers should be able to exploit the full potential of VR in the sense of customer-oriented VR system development and be supported throughout the entire software development process. The framework of the VR information system is limited to the use of VR in product development.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7632675-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4399931-1>
Modeling, Simulation, and Design of Prototypes for Mechanically Compliant, Mobile Robots ¤ In robotics, mechanically compliant systems are increasingly being used to, among other things, ensure safe interaction between humans and machines for humans. Additionally, the proportion of mechanically compliant systems in mobile robotics is growing due to advantageous properties such as form variability, simpler construction, and the possibility of shock absorption. The goal of this work is to make a contribution to the application of compliant structures in mobile robots. In this context, structural and drivetrain aspects form the focus of research. The investigations are intended to provide an impulse for the development of such compliant locomotion systems, in which movement is realized using only a few actuators, utilizing special structural or material characteristics. In this way, versatile mobile robots can be developed that are characterized by a simple construction, moderate control effort, and thus low fault susceptibility. The considerations in this work have a foundational character. In the foreground is not the further development of known classical locomotion systems, but the exemplary implementation of alternative realization possibilities of such mobile robots compared to known systems. In this context, scientific questions regarding structural, material, and drivetrain aspects are formulated and answered using theoretical and experimental investigations. Special emphasis is placed on the consideration of mechanically prestressed systems based on Tensegrity structures. The application of such structures enables the realization of systems whose mechanical compliance and, as a result, also dynamic properties can be reversibly changed without shape change. This enables these systems to adapt to changed environmental conditions during movement.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191911-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7619504-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125909-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017975-8>
Identity-Oriented Brand Management in Tourism: Development of an Internal Brand Management Model for Destinations ¤ Based on theoretical and empirical analyses, Isabelle Thilo develops an internal brand management model for destinations. In the context of her investigation, she analyzes the influencing factors of the relevant target groups as well as the question of how the demand for identification of internal target groups, e.g. from the hotel and gastronomy industry, can be implemented with the brand and the implementation in brand-conform behavior in practice. To this end, she highlights the relevance of cooperation with stakeholders and shows approaches to implementing the premises of identity-oriented brand management in destination management. Because increasing competition pressure as well as the goal of profiling oneself through a strong brand also determine the tourism industry and the actions of its actors. The content • Internal brand management models • Identity-oriented brand management in destinations • Approaches for destination management The target groups • Students and lecturers of tourism management and marketing • Professionals and executives in destination marketing organizations and in the tourism industry The author Isabelle Thilo is a long-time lecturer and consultant in marketing and tourism.

Time Structures of Law: On the Possibility of a Critical Theory of Justice ¤ In the foreground stands the question of whether 'justice' is a suitable fundamental concept for a critical theory of society. The author analyzes the concept in question in the context of critical theory and determines its relationship to individual rights and positive law. From this, she systematizes different varieties of skepticism about the emancipatory power of the concept of justice and emphasizes the criticism that a libertarian justice concept has exploitation effects, while an egalitarian one has normalization effects. Rainer Forst's procedural justice concept is examined to see if it can avoid the effects of control. For this, a complete reconstruction of his theory is presented. At two decisive points, it is supplemented and modified: first, with regard to the justification of the 'right to justification', which the author reinterprets with the help of Fichte's recognition concept, and second, by discussing the relationship between Forst's justice concept and modern law. The main thesis of the book is that this critically procedural justice concept avoids the control effects of exploitation and normalization, but develops the potential for a new two-stage control effect: 'acceleration', understood as a steady reduction in the validity period of social institutions, especially legal norms, and the accompanying subjectification form of 'flexibilization'. A reflection of the critically procedural justice concept on this control effect inherent in it raises the question of the desired mode of development of the law (as a realization of justice) in time. The initial question of the possibility of a critical theory of justice is thus decided with a view to the time structures of law.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020310-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073840-1>
Forms of Decision in Land Register Procedural Law de lege lata and ferenda ¤ Steht einer beantragten Eintragung ein Hindernis entgegen, hat das Grundbuchamt den Antrag entweder zurückzuweisen oder eine Zwischenverfügung zu erlassen. Dass die Wahl zwischen diesen Optionen zunehmend Probleme bereitet, legt die umfangreiche Judikatur der letzten Jahre nahe. Stefan Bohlsen untersucht die Entscheidungsmöglichkeiten des Grundbuchverfahrensrechts auf einen nicht unmittelbar vollzugsfähigen Eintragungsantrag, strukturiert ihre Anwendungsbereiche und beleuchtet ihre Verzahnung mit dem Immobiliarsachen- und Zwangsvollstreckungsrecht. Er geht auch der Frage nach, ob Vorbescheide und informelle Entscheidungsformen de lege lata zulässig sind. Der Autor widmet sich sodann einer rechtstatsächlichen Untersuchung und kommt zu dem Ergebnis, dass die geltende Rechtslage in der praktischen Übung der Grundbuchämter gegenwärtig nur unzureichend Beachtung findet. Ausgehend von diesem Spannungsverhältnis zwischen Theorie und Praxis erwägt er, wie das Interesse an einem konzentrierten Grundbuchverfahren, die Richtigkeitsgewähr des Grundbuchs und die formalistischen Zwänge des Liegenschaftsrechts de lege ferenda schonender austariert werden könnten.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4158374-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048845-7>
Moving Events ¤ The fundamental problem of motor learning is to react to signals from the environment with increasingly appropriate movement responses. As the author shows in the work awarded with the Carl-Diem-Plaque 2001/02, the solution to this fundamental problem requires a cognitive architecture that targets modularly structured internal models that are related to the effects of one's own behavior: "It is not the commands to the musculature, but the behavioral effects that control movements. Movement results from the intended event: Moving Events." This thesis is derived, differentiated, and subjected to some tests in the book in twelve short chapters, in order to arrive at a proposal that could prove to be viable for the new theoretical foundation of sport motorics after the end of the motor-action controversy	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145160-0>
Rise to Energy Supremacy: The Soviet Path to the Age of Oil, 1930s to 1950s ¤ Russia has been one of the leading producers, consumers, and exporters of oil and other fossil energy carriers for decades. Especially for the fuel-scarce European economies, the eastern neighbor is therefore of essential importance. Although the Tsarist Empire already appeared as a significant oil exporter and the Bolsheviks took over this legacy willingly, the energy carrier in the Soviet Union long lived a niche existence. It was only the developments of the late 1940s that gave the decisive impulses to finally embark on the path to the age of oil. This book deals with the little illuminated but decisive phase of Soviet energy policy from the perspective of the Moscow power centers between 1938 and 1953. In the context of internal and international developments, it asks about the background of the Soviet rise to global energy supremacy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014715-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134749-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4203043-2>
Elemental Analysis and Multivariate Statistics for the Investigation and Evaluation of the Loading State of Flowing Waters ¤ With the aim of describing and evaluating the distribution of elements in sediments, suspended matter, and filtrates of the Elbe and the development of the burden with inorganic substances in the 1990s, the Elbe was sampled in several campaigns throughout its entire longitudinal profile and analyzed for over 60 elements of the periodic table. By evaluating the data material with two- and multi-way principal component analyses, the elements relevant for anthropogenic and geogenic characterization of the river were selected, as well as typical longitudinal profiles of the relevant elements were summarized. Sampling points with similar element distribution were combined into characteristic Elbe sections using hierarchical cluster analyses. By comparing the average section concentrations, the temporal development of the element burden could be quantified. Using two- and three-way PLS regression models, element contents in one compartment could be predicted from measured concentrations in one or two other compartments.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040708-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179311-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056593-2>
The Polygraph as Exculpatory Evidence: Limits, Problems, and Solutions in the Assessment of Statements in Criminal Proceedings ¤ Steht Aussage gegen Aussage, ist das Gericht mit der oft folgenschweren Frage konfrontiert, wem es Glauben schenken soll. Normalerweise verlassen sich die Richter dann auf ihre vermeintlich durch Erfahrung gewonnene Fähigkeit, Lügen zu erkennen. Nur ausnahmsweise beauftragen Gerichte Sachverständige mit einer aussagepsychologischen Begutachtung. Doch auch diese hat Schwächen und stößt schnell an ihre Grenzen. Johannes Makepeace zeigt diese Probleme auf und wendet sich zur Problemlösung einem Hilfsmittel zur Ermittlung der Glaubhaftigkeit einer Aussage zu, das von den Strafgerichten bislang kategorisch abgelehnt wurde: dem Polygrafen. Dabei untersucht er, was die aussagepsychologische Begutachtung einerseits und die polygrafengestützte Aussageanalyse andererseits zu leisten vermögen.

Functional renormalisation group Equations for supersymmetric field theories ¤ The dissertation deals with the application of the functional renormalization group (FRG) to supersymmetric field theories. Scalar field theories in various dimensions are investigated and a formulation of the flow equation is demonstrated, which is manifestly supersymmetric. This leads to a close intertwining of bosonic and fermionic regulators at the level of components and enforces a regulator structure that differs from the one used in theories with Yukawa interactions without supersymmetry. With this method, supersymmetric quantum mechanics, the N=1 Wess-Zumino model in two and three dimensions, as well as the N=2 Wess-Zumino model in two dimensions are investigated. Using supersymmetric quantum mechanics, it is demonstrated that the supersymmetric formulation of the flow equation is able to correctly reproduce known results. Furthermore, the limitations of the considered approximations are shown and discussed. In the framework of the N=1 Wess-Zumino model in two and three dimensions, which shows spontaneous supersymmetry breaking, the phase diagram for supersymmetry breaking is calculated, as well as the fixed point structure of the renormalization group flow is investigated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4181618-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128574-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177773-6>
A Probabilistic Population Projection Model: Development and Application for Germany ¤ Population forecasts have a far-reaching significance for the future shaping of various social spheres of life, so that the continuous improvement of their methodology is indispensable. Furthermore, the review of past population forecasts shows that their accuracy could not be significantly increased by either better data quality or the hitherto improved methodology. For this reason, Christina Bohk develops the Probabilistic Population Projection Model (PPPM) theoretically for the performance of probabilistic population forecasts, implements it, and applies it exemplarily in a forecast for the population of Germany from 2007 to 2050.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006292-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057633-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6>
Job 28 from an Aesthetic-Theological Perspective: Perception of God and Wisdom as a Challenge to Life ¤ Back cover: In the wisdom poem Job 28 - as a central chapter of the book of Job originating from the mouth of the suffering Job - the perception (of wisdom) of God plays a fundamental role. The present study seeks to track this down with approaches of an aesthetic theology of the Old Testament and thus to open up a new understanding horizon. In doing so, the result holds the potential to lift up and make aware the structures of life, and to challenge their renewal in the horizon of the fear of God	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015950-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059758-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049716-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000626-8>

Ein Fahrerassistenzsystem zur prädiktiven Planung energie- und zeitoptimaler Geschwindigkeitsprofile mittels Mehrzieloptimierung ¤ The work presented in this thesis describes the development of a driver assistance system for anticipatory driving. The objective is an autonomous as well as an energy- and fuel-optimal longitudinal vehicle control on a preallocated track. This is realized and algorithmically implemented by a novel method for predictive planning of vehicle-velocity-profiles.Based on Dynamic Programming and under consideration of information about the vehicle and its environment, a velocity setting is calculated according to the drivers objective value preferences. Distinguishing features are the realtime-capability of the multi-criteria-optimization and the possibility to adapt it independently of the vehicle type and power unit. The design of the external interfaces allows easy embedment into existing information technology infrastructures of vehicles with little adjustment effort. No constructional modifications or additional components are required. The inclusion of dynamic information is carried out by a reduction of solution space. Replanning can be executed quickly at any time. Besides positive effects on the quality of optimization results, this enhances robustness against unpredictable occurrences. The efficiency and benefit of the implemented algorithm is shown by simulation results of several practical scenarios. The innovative values of the presented thesis are the realtime-capability and reliability in global convergence of the multi-criteria-optimization, the independency of the vehicles characteristics and the potentials for collective-optimization and cooperative behavior of the developed method.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132165-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4622983-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016278-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076594-5>

From Æthelred to the Man in the Moon: Research Works from English Medieval Studies ¤ In this volume of the Göttingen Studies in English Philology, a medievalist's state examination and a master's thesis are published, which have recently emerged from the seminar for English Philology. They take the reader on a journey that begins in the turbulent last decades of Anglo-Saxon rule under King Æthelred II and ends with the Middle English poem of the Man in the Moon. Did King Æthelred II really deserve his nickname 'the ill-advised'? Under this question, Andreas Lemke examines the crisis-ridden late Anglo-Saxon period and investigates, among other things, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, legal texts, coins, and some literary works of the time (texts by Aelfric and Wulfstan, the Battle of Maldon). Andre Mertens, on the other hand, publishes the previously little-estimated Middle English poem (Mon in Þe mone stond and strit) in a commented edition and shows important approaches to its interpretation against the background of the cultural-historical context. Both works published in this volume span the broad thematic spectrum of Göttingen medieval studies temporally, content-wise, and methodically and are intended to serve as an incentive for new final theses.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112501-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039676-9>
Certifiable Development Process for Complex Information Processing Systems in Weighing Technology ¤ The dissertation deals with principles, methods, and techniques of systematic development of complex embedded systems. The considered domain has application areas with demanding and special requirements for information processing. In dynamic weighing technology, for example, solutions with very high resolutions and small measurement uncertainty at fast measurements in a mechanically disturbed environment are necessary. The requirements for calibration capability and metrological safety are special features. Complex and high-performance functions are required for generating measurement results. In the work, primarily FPGA-based embedded systems are used. The designed certifiable process (ZEfIRA) offers a procedure for the development of embedded systems. Metrological safety, calibration capability, validation, and verifiability are considered as criteria throughout the design process. ZEfIRA is based on a 3W model and is evolutionary in design. Within the process, the analysis of a potential predecessor system as well as model-based prototypical development up to a producible solution (product) is carried out. The work highlights the great influence of the specific requirements on the measurement system. It is shown how these are already considered at the design time on the model level and further at the implementation in an FPGA-based target platform. Various steps of the functional and technical system design are examined and the realization partitions "FPGA-Logic" and "FPGA-Softcore-Solutions" are considered in detail. As an example to demonstrate the applicability of the process ZEfIRA, the prototypical development of the information processing system of an electromagnetic force compensation balance (EMKW) serves. Decisive are the signal processing, control, and safety algorithms optimally adapted to the overall system and their technical implementation. This was realized with various performance parameters, such as latency, processing complexity, and accuracy. In addition, the prototype enables comprehensive analysis options for the measurement system. The final evaluation is an assessment of the performance capability of ZEfIRA based on this prototypical development.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4396978-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4347749-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114575-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188815-7>
The Information Content of Gross Value Added for Business Practice: Value Added as a Link between Business and National Economic Performance Measurement ¤ This volume highlights the information content of the gross value added as a business management indicator of company size and performance. The information content of the gross value added is examined empirically for the first time and the superiority of the indicator compared to traditional accounting figures like sales is documented.The analysis reveals that the gross value added is a superior cross-sectional indicator of company size, characterized by a close connection to the earning power and the perception of the company by the capital market. Furthermore value added-based ratios provide new aspects for the characterization of companies and thus innovative possibilities for internal management and control.The findings of the empirical analysis lead to the clear recommendation of the integration of the gross value added in the company controlling and the financial reporting.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4353519-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4199312-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4249656-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123429-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061963-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047390-9>
Analysis of the Relationships between Spray Force Method and Optical and Hydraulic Diagnostic Methods of Diesel Injectors ¤ Setup of the used measurement systems -- Conditions for the comparability of the presented measurement techniques -- Spray force as an extension to hydraulic and optical analysis Hans Römisch analyzes the transferability of spray force measurements to recordings in the Mie-scattering and schlieren method as well as to hydraulic volume and rate measurements for the first time. He defines conditions for the hydraulic connection of the injector and its actuation. In addition to the establishment of new evaluation routines, the author can show that the use of conventional impact elements leads to a greater measurement error than previously assumed. This is avoided by a new geometry of the impact elements.

We are against - because you are for it : on the tradition of literary youth movements in the German-speaking area ¤ Note International Hölderlin Bibliography: Pages 81-90: Individual vs. Society (on Hölderlin see pages 81-86) The term „youth movement“ initially evokes associations with social youth movements, such as the Wandervogel or the 68er movement. Few are aware that there were independent currents in literature that, independent of these social youth movements, can also be considered as youth movements, as they were largely shaped by young authors. Literary youth movements can be considered a peculiarity in literary history, as they each linked the poetic avant-garde of a new literary current with the provocation will and the generational consciousness of youth.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060560-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035964-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028871-7>
Robust peer prediction mechanisms ¤ Zusammenfassung: This thesis addresses the challenge of peer prediction, which seeks to elicit private information from rational agents without the requirement that ground truth is eventually revealed. The classical peer prediction method provides a solution to the peer prediction challenge. It compares the reported information of an agent with the reported information of another agent, and computes a payment rule that implements truth revelation in a strategic equilibrium. However, the algorithm computing the payments critically depends on the method's assumption that all agents share the same prior beliefs and that the algorithm ("mechanism") knows these beliefs.In this thesis, I relax this common knowledge assumption. I first design the "Robust Bayesian Truth Serum" (RBTS), which asks agents for two types of reports, the report of the private information it is interested in and a prediction report corresponding to an agent's belief about the private information of other agents. RBTS dispenses with the assumption that the agents' prior beliefs need to be known to compute the payments. It does, however, still rely on the agents sharing the same prior beliefs. My second contribution is the design of subjective-prior peer prediction mechanisms, which further reduce the assumption of common knowledge. As in RBTS, they do not require knowledge of the agents' prior beliefs. Moreover, they allow the agents' prior beliefs to be subjective, i.e. different from one another. My third contribution is the study of effort-incentivizing peer prediction. In many applications of interest, the information that seeks to be elicited first needs to be acquired. When this information acquisition requires costly effort, agents may have an incentive to avoid it and choose to guess instead. Addressing this problem, I suggest payments, where only agents with good enough information have an incentive to participate in the mechanism. Agents not investing effort and agents with low quality, choose to pass, effectively self-selecting according to quality	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144220-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8>

Lonely Death and Unnoticed Deaths in the City: On a Hidden Social Problem ¤ Cliff Notes: Lonely death and a socially unaccompanied end of life are everyday, yet often hidden social problems. In a multi-faceted social scientific analysis, Susanne Loke links findings from research on loneliness, death, and inequality in urban space to innovative results. She illustrates the ambivalences of a lonely and unnoticed death as the endpoint of a downward spiral of loneliness and social isolation/exclusion. Field research in a dying social space gives marginalized people a voice, who otherwise would not be heard, and leaves the readers partially unsettled.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116546-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056723-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057310-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4300539-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013921-9>
New Approaches for Laser-Based Cell Manipulation Using Plasmon-Induced Effects ¤ Judith Krawinkel demonstrates, using gold nanostructures, that their interaction with laser radiation has the potential to introduce drugs into cells gently and efficiently, to eliminate them selectively or to genetically manipulate them. Spherical gold nanoparticles attached to cell membranes are suitable for introducing molecules into cells. Especially in primary cells, the author recommends the addition of radical scavengers. Furthermore, she uses peptide-conjugated gold nanoparticle agglomerates that support the uptake of extracellular molecules through endocytosis. By irradiating gold-coated surfaces with lasers, nanoparticles and cavitation bubbles are formed that can irreversibly damage eukaryotic cells and manipulate biofilms.

The Legal Status of the Biological Father in the Adoption of His Illegitimate Child ¤ Although fathers of illegitimate children have been granted a consent right in adoption, they are still disadvantaged in the adoption process compared to fathers who are married to the child's mother. After presenting the development of adoption law since the 1969 Illegitimacy Act, the author deals with the current regulations on adoption. In doing so, she examines the relevant international and constitutional legal foundations to determine whether the current regulations are fair. Furthermore, the author addresses the problem that the biological mother refuses to disclose the identity of the child's father in the adoption process.

Pilgrimages today - Experiencing the path to salvation on foot. Towards the spiritual rediscovery of the path of faith ¤ The author provides an overview of pilgrimages in religious history, particularly in the history of Israel. He describes the great migration of nations as a salvation event of God for humanity. A brief explanation of the pilgrim psalms invites the reader to participate in the liturgical prayer of the Church. The pilgrimage as a path to salvation is clarified from the perspective of the New Testament through the example of Jesus' and his disciples' pilgrimage. The origin of Christian pilgrimage sites and the practice of pilgrimage since the beginnings of the Church are discussed. Various types of pilgrimages are explored through examples from the Diocese of Regensburg. The pilgrimage site of Bogenberg, one of the oldest pilgrimage sites in Bavaria, is presented in a welcoming way from the perspective of experienced pilgrims. The anthropological part of the book reveals the human experience of being on the way. The experience of hospitality, the importance of encountering and sharing, as well as spiritual accompaniment are discussed as aids for the life pilgrimage. Christological and soteriological guides lead the way to salvation in the encounter with Jesus Christ. In the final part of the work, the author presents pastoral ways through the example of the Diocese of Regensburg. The book aims to contribute to helping people discover their path of faith again, through the example of the good shepherd, to strengthen themselves on the life path through it, and to walk their own path to salvation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064460-1>
Authenticity as a Political Problem : A Contribution to the Theoretical History of the Legitimation of Political Order ¤ The great revolutions of the 17th and 18th centuries establish a new legitimation of political rule. For the first time in human history, the legitimacy of political orders is tied to the consent of the subjugated subjects. This finds its paradigmatic expression in the philosophy of the social contract. At its center is the freedom of politically socialized individuals, which must not only be protected against the state's monopoly of violence, but also tested for its internal consistency. Thomas Noetzels book is the first German-language investigation into the connection between authenticity and politics. The author shows that with the new legitimacy of political orders, a public discourse on the authenticity of individual freedom begins, in which the question of the true/True Will is at the center. The fiction of a moral core of human beings makes their authenticity a problem of modern criticism of rule and legitimation. Noetzel examines philosophical, political science, and sociological approaches to authenticity research and integrates them into an interdisciplinary framework.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046563-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035043-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193985-2>
Method for the Ecological Efficiency Evaluation of Building Services in Buildings ¤ This work is aimed at engineers and researchers in the field of building services engineering. It addresses the emerging need for change in the environmental and sustainability assessment of buildings and building services. The current non-renewable primary energy demand is not sufficient as the sole assessment criterion, especially in light of future political climate and environmental protection goals. The ecological efficiency evaluation method presented in this work can contribute to solving the problems as a suitable instrument. It enables systematic, holistic evaluations and reproducible comparisons of building services regarding their ecological and economic sustainability. The most significant developments are the specific environmental performance, in extension to the used primary energy factor, and the ecological efficiency indicator UWI.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068598-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014743-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137351-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175694-0>

National Counterpart or Partner? : Studies on the Relations between Czechs and Germans in the Economy of the ČSR (1918 - 1938) ¤ Main description: In the interwar period, the relationship between Czechs and Germans in the First Czechoslovak Republic was tense in many respects. This was particularly true for the economy. The study is based on a comprehensive fund of newly accessed sources from the archives of both countries. Christoph Boyer cuts through the largely unexplored terrain of the relations between Czechs and Germans in the economy of the CSR and aims to contribute to a changed view of the relations as a whole. From the press: " The author has succeeded in presenting the economic policy problems of a multi-ethnic state in a factual and detailed manner." (Journal for Historical Science 6/2000) "While the political aspects of the relations between Czechs and Germans in the First Czechoslovak Republic ... have been extensively dealt with, the economic dimension of the reciprocal relationships has so far been given little importance. In this respect, the comprehensive study ... is to be evaluated as a pioneering achievement." (New Archive for Saxon History, Vol. 70, 1999) Review quote.

Cultural Property Relevant Behavioral Codes: Inventory, Analysis, and Legal Significance ¤ Behavioral codes, such as those existing for museums and art dealers, regulate the handling of cultural property. As a result, they have a significant impact on the practical work of the cultural property industry. Furthermore, they affect the development and application of cultural property law as private regulations, for example, on due diligence in the trade of cultural property or on the handling of claims for return. The work is guided by the fundamental question of the interplay between cultural property relevant codes and the law. To this end, it examines the historical development of German and international codes, before undertaking an inventory of current codes. On this basis, a systematic analysis and typification of cultural property relevant codes is carried out for the first time against the background of cultural property law. This finally allows the legal significance of the codes for the respective parties and their indirect legal effects to be comprehensively worked out.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4208853-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033647-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138550-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139819-1>
Development of New Catalysts of Group 4 for the Hydroamination and Hydroamination Alkylation of Alkenes and Alkynes ¤ Within the scope of this work, new ligands for group 4 metal complexes were synthesized, which are used in hydroamination and hydroamination alkylation of alkenes and alkynes. The metal complexes were used in the alken- and alkin-hydroamination. As a ligand class, ß-enaminones were synthesized. Various crystal structures of these metal complexes could be determined with the help of X-ray structure analysis. After modification of some ß-enaminones, further ligands could be obtained. A catalyst system was developed, which enables the alkin-hydroamination. In this case, the Zr-catalyst was converted with sulfonamides. Furthermore, the catalytic ability of the complex [Cp2Zr(NMe2)2] was further investigated. In cooperation with the Beckhaus working group, further metal complexes were tested for their activity. <dt.>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4217435-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029921-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190943-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140648-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4749938-2>
Ar@chitekturen in Celluloid : The Cinematic View of Space ¤ When it comes to the topic of architecture and film, one initially associates it with sets or set design, thinks of films like »Metropolis« or »Blade Runner«. This book offers a new perspective: It shows how film designs spaces, evokes emotions, and lets the viewer immerse themselves in an illusionary space. This knowledge is also of great interest for architectural space design. Filmic space concepts such as editing or framing are considered from the perspective of architecture and discussed from a perception-theoretical point of view. Theoretical approaches and exemplary case studies create an intermedial interface that generates a new understanding of the emergence of spatial effects.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048561-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017102-4>
The vis attractiva concursus in European Insolvency Law: An Instrument for the Concretization of the Insolvency Statute ¤ BEGIN Knowledge of the scope of the insolvency statute is of elementary importance for the efficiency and effectiveness of cross-border insolvency and restructuring proceedings. With the separation of company and insolvency statutes, normative contradictions and protection gaps can occur. The work solves this problem by using an instrument already held by the EuInsVO, the vis attractiva concursus, to determine the scope of the insolvency statute. The author examines the importance and systematic position of the vis attractiva concursus used for the determination of jurisdiction in annex procedures. With a uniformity under the EuInsVO between insolvency proceedings law and insolvency conflict of laws, a transfer is made in favor of a regulatory autonomous concretization of the EU insolvency law concept. The resulting criteria provide insight into the qualification of disputes arising in the context of corporate insolvency.END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4214276-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1288173679>
Opto-fluidic Microsystems for Particle Analysis ¤ This work deals with the integration of opto-fluidic measurement systems for particle concentration measurement and particle size analysis in flowing suspensions of water and test dust. The investigated polydisperse test dusts according to the ISO 12103-1 standard in the grain sizes fine, medium, and coarse consist of particles with sizes between 0.5 and 150 mym and exhibit different particle size distributions. By determining the mean and standard deviation of the scattered light and transmission, the particle mass concentration and the Sauter diameter as the mean diameter of the particle size distribution are determined. With increasing mean particle sizes, the signal-to-noise ratio decreases at the same particle mass concentration, as the majority of the scattered light overlaps with the excitation light. In order to still utilize the scattered light for particle analysis, the approach of Talbot interferometry is investigated. Based on the model of Fresnel diffraction, an analytical simulation approach is presented, with which the expected signal in the self-image plane of a grid is investigated in dependence on the particle position in the sample volume and the ratio of particle size to grid period. The signal-to-noise ratio of this method shows a different course than the scattered light and transmission measurement, so that this approach leads to better results at particle sizes above 10 mym and short measurement lengths of a few hundred µm. Based on theoretical considerations and various simulation approaches, integrated measurement systems for particle analysis are designed according to the approach of planar integrated free-space optics. A system that measures both transmission and scattered light is demonstrated. It enables the determination of the particle mass concentration and the Sauter diameter of the three test dusts with a detection limit better than 1 mg/l. For optimal integration, planar emitter-receiver modules are used, which contain a VCSEL at 850 nm as a light source and monolithically integrated segmented photodiodes. The integration of the entire system takes place in transparent PMMA substrates. The design of an integrated Talbot interferometer for particle analysis is presented and the tolerances to be maintained are discussed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058671-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121429-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4509483-4>
Childhood Concepts in the Fibels of the SBZ/DDR 1945-1990 ¤ Concepts of childhood are historically and culturally diverse and are shaped, among other things, by societal and political framework conditions. They not only determine the real treatment of children but also find their way into pedagogical discourses and their didactic concretizations, for example in schoolbooks. Within the framework of a historical text-context analysis, this book deals with the question of which concepts of child and childhood were constructed in the first-read fibels of the SBZ and the GDR and how they change over the course of the diachronic analysis period (1945 to 1990). The results are interpreted in the historical context of the fibels using archive documents and educational policy documents to analyze possible educational and social policy factors influencing continuities and discontinuities in childhood concepts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4146827-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180102-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030550-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200624-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017033-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011975-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022349-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7502495-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070935-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053458-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006667-8>
Pseudo-Dionysius Areopagita and Armenian Philosophy (13th-15th Centuries) ¤ The book deals fundamentally with the high- and late medieval Armenian sources (commentaries, treatises, speeches, letters, etc.) on Pseudo-Dionysius with a focus on their philosophical content and their inseparable connection with Western thought. This study could not only interest Dionysius researchers, but also readers in general who are interested in Neoplatonism, Patristics, Orientalism/Armenology, Christian mysticism, liturgy, and church history.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049716-1>
A living archaeology in the Amazonian Rainforest ¤ The tropical forests of the Americas, Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and Oceania belong to the most threatened ecosystems of the 21st century and are the target of multinational efforts to halt the progressive deforestation, mining, uncontrolled exploitation of resources, and the threat to indigenous communities in their ancestral territories. It is essential that we understand the long history of these ecosystems through human beings, to comprehend how humans have influenced the species distribution, the dynamics of ecosystems, and the expansion of forests over hundreds, if not thousands, of years. My work aims to contribute to this understanding from the perspective of some of the most important components of these forests, the trees. While growing, trees take up carbon from the atmosphere, as well as water and nutrients from the soil, which means that they contain elements of the surrounding environment, which are enclosed in their cambium tissue, which forms over time. At the same time, humans have long modified and influenced certain tree species and thus left their own historical traces on these taxa. In this work, I aim to provide an overview of the latest scientific findings and place them in context. This includes genetic studies on the domestication of trees, studies on the variability of stable isotopes in wood, and finally, studies on dendrochronology, which I have further developed in this work. This work highlights the importance of preserving and promoting agroforestry systems that have developed over the last few thousand years in tropical forests, and shows that it is possible to obtain information about the history of humans in tropical forests using dendrochronology, which opens the way for further studies in this direction.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4149072-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4282537-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122388-3>
Short-term behavior of power-electronically coupled consumers with frequency-dependent grid-serving regulation ¤ Electric consumers contribute to the stable operation of electrical power supply grids. However, this does not apply to converter-based loads. In this work, the behavior of power-electronically coupled loads with a grid-frequency-dependent grid-serving additional regulation is investigated in the short-term range from fractions of seconds to a few minutes. The effects on both the grid and the individual consumer are considered. As exemplary load types, the battery charger of an electric vehicle and the circulation pump of a building heating system serve as examples.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4415875-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182084-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121178-9>
Decentralized Leadership: Preconditions, Possibilities, and Limits of Entrepreneurial Leadership Behavior in Subsidiaries of Diversified Companies ¤ Subsidiaries of large diversified companies are far more than just extended workbenches. They are companies that operate in a complex environment and, for example, possess specific knowledge about local markets and customers. Therefore, it is possible for managers in subsidiaries to make a significant contribution to the value enhancement of the overall enterprise through their entrepreneurial engagement. Eva-Maria Hammann theoretically develops the preconditions that must be met so that managers in subsidiaries can take on entrepreneurial responsibility and what opportunities arise from this for companies. The empirical verification takes place on the basis of in-depth interviews with decision-makers at the top of large German companies and a large-scale survey of managers in subsidiaries located worldwide. The consideration from different perspectives offers interesting insights into leadership in and from internationally active, diversified companies and allows the derivation of action recommendations for the decision-makers of these companies. Introduction -- The External and Organizational Environment -- Leadership — Leadership in the Field of Central and Decentralized Units -- Decentralized Leadership — Entrepreneurial Leadership in and from Subsidiaries -- Decentralized Leadership as Intended Behavior — Application of the Theory of Planned Behavior -- Empirical Exploration of Decentralized Leadership -- Conclusion and Implications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124317-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018776-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124261-0>
Mode of Transport Choice in Goods Transport: An Analysis of Regulatory and Price Policy Measures; with 64 Tables ¤ The book explains, based on a broad survey, the decision-making behavior regarding the mode of transport choice in goods transport. Since, due to a strongly increasing transport demand in goods transport, external costs are caused in considerable extent, transport policy must take targeted measures to make this additional demand as environmentally friendly as possible. Therefore, the EU and the federal government strive for the goal of traffic diversion from the road to alternative modes of transport. This work analyzes which determinants the mode of transport choice of shippers depends on, in order to be able to determine the effect of certain regulations subsequently. For example, the impact of the truck toll on the mode of transport choice is examined. In order to determine the determinants, a discrete decision model is econometrically estimated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022492-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187820-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113446-1>
A Macroeconomic Analysis of German Reunification: A Quantified Stochastic Dynamic Equilibrium Approach ¤ In this work, German reunification is closed and empirically verified macroeconomically interpreted. The first data-analytical part deals with the identification of the size of transfers and factor price subsidies. Estimation of a stochastic frontier production function allows an assessment of the quantitative relationship in East Germany between productivity, capital stock, and labor input, and how they have developed. Based on this, a dynamic equilibrium model is formulated, with the help of which an integrated picture is drawn of how low productivity, capital stock, East-West transfers, and migrations have influenced the reunification process. This allows the costs of the reunification process to be estimated. Using a stochastic extension of the model, scenarios of productivity and transfer development in the East are discussed in the third section. Modeling migrations through a dynamic equilibrium calculus allows consideration of waiting option values. In the concluding fourth section, an explanation of the stagnation of the convergence process is proposed within an endogenous growth model based on the initial factor endowments in East Germany. Accordingly, at the beginning of reunification, there was a relative real capital deficit in the East. This caused a relative interest rate increase, which led to specialization of the East economy in real capital investments. The neglected human capital stock in this phase was responsible for the low productivity growth. This work is a contribution to the integrated understanding of economic processes, which is a prerequisite for targeted economic policy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121372-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138957-8>
Success Factors for the Existence Founding and Existence Securing of Freelance Physicians ¤ Sole practitioners work in a field of tension between the physician's oath and entrepreneurial responsibility. The discussion of the framework conditions leads to different conceptions of the success of their activity. The author discusses theoretical foundations and practice-based proposals for effective measures in a research model. She can draw on long-term experience in founding and leading a medical practice. The model is subjected to an empirical verification based on a representative survey of sole practitioners. With the help of regression analytical calculations, the success factors are identified that have a significant impact on the success of sole practitioners. The results of the investigation confirm expected success factors on the one hand. On the other hand, it is found that at least at the time of the survey, no significant effectiveness can be demonstrated for the discussed success factors. For physicians, consultants, investors, and health policymakers, the contribution offers a comprehensive consideration of the company medical practice and its development perspectives.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135142-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4354694-8>
Approaches to Visually Supported Comparison Analysis of Connectome Data ¤ The comparison of connectomes is an essential step to identify changes in nervous systems. The analysis of connectomes and their comparison require various methods. The platform-independent and generic framework neuroVIISAS provides flexible solutions to functional and comparative questions. Within the scope of this work, a methodology is described to compare different connectomes with various analytical and visual methods. The developed comparison systematics is described and applied to two questions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1036568350> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041638-0>
Flexibility in Long-Term Contracts: An Economic Analysis of Contractual Negotiation Design in PPP Projects ¤ In comparison to other procurement methods, long-term contracts with fixed-price character are generally less flexible. In order to be able to react to changes in the environment during the contract period, negotiations are usually necessary. Jirka Gehrt examines contractual regulations in private partnership projects, which aim to obtain an appropriate flexibility from the client's point of view. Based on theoretical considerations and interviews with experts, he evaluates the contract rules used in practice and develops optimization proposals. Foundations -- Essential terms and focus of the investigation -- Basic economic findings on negotiations -- Contractual negotiation design for PPP projects -- Performance adjustments on request of the public authority -- Private financing: negotiation design and impact on the evaluation of individual instruments -- Optimizations of the operator as an example of refinancing -- Conclusion -- Summary of key results -- Recommendations for action and implications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315843-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4337462-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063270-2>
Migration in the Process of Institutional Processing : 'Who likes German Bureaucracy anyway?' ¤ In studies on non-EU citizens' stays in Germany, the life and study reality of foreign students is characterised by financial problems, high dropout rates and residency worries. The latter proves to be the greatest problem area during their studies abroad. However, to date there has been a lack of research into how administrative decisions on residency are made, how they affect the lives of the visiting students and what support non-EU students receive at German universities. In this study, the author demonstrates that such foreign students tend to fail in their studies in Germany due to bureaucracy rather than a lack of motivation or performing poorly in their subjects. Moreover, those responsible for advising international students often receive no backing from their university’s administrative body and therefore refuse to help students who are at risk of losing their residence permits for fear of facing disciplinary action.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003749-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008822-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058216-4>
Virtual-Reality : Acceptance and Effects of Immersive Product Presentations on the Example of Experience Goods ¤ The Virtual-Reality (VR) technology enables companies to present products that go far beyond traditional presentation methods. Although the integration of VR technology opens up many opportunities for companies, its use is also associated with risks. In particular, the lack of empirically secured findings on customer acceptance, the effects of use, and cannibalization effects is a major reason that still hinders the spread of VR in customer communication. The book addresses these research gaps and identifies concrete opportunities and risks associated with the use of VR product presentations through a user-centered, quantitative research design.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4399931-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189110-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7706419-7>
Stability, Variability, and Determinant Factors of the Earnings Structure of the Manufacturing Industry in the Federal Republic of Germany ¤ An investigation of the earnings structure is particularly interesting from the perspective of its impact on the workplace situation in the industries. Dominik Loitz here presents a high stability and low variability of the earnings structure through descriptive analysis. He comes to the result that the different development of the industries has not been reflected in an adequate change of the earnings structure between the industries. This statement is supported by the fact that determinant factors, such as industry-differentiated labor productivity, have no influence on the earnings structure. -- The results thus point in the direction that the earnings changes of the industries have taken place largely independently of the economic framework conditions of the individual industries and have gone at the expense of employment, particularly in the low-skilled sector.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036232-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131996-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127067-8>
Investigations on the Use of Teleteaching in the University Sector ¤ Universities and universities of applied sciences are today striving to provide their students with an ever better education and to further intensify cooperation in the field of research and development. A comprehensive lecture offer, including optional lectures by international scientists is expected. In order to further expand this offer and thus reach a large circle of interested parties, important lectures from other universities should be imported and own lectures exported. The basis for such cooperation is the broadband data networks to which all universities and universities of applied sciences in Germany are connected. Through this communication medium, different data can be transmitted at high speed. The focus of this work was on the development and implementation of a Teleteaching system for the transmission of lectures in high quality over the broadband science network to remote lecture halls. Existing solution approaches were analyzed and examined for their possible use. However, the result showed that there was no system at the time that met the high quality requirements set. Therefore, a concept was developed on the basis of modeling real and remote lecture halls, which enables lecture sharing. As a result of the modeling, the different data types and the necessary transmission technologies were determined. Based on these analyses and the quality criteria set, various investigations were carried out to find a technical solution variant. The new system for Teleteaching developed from the model and the technical investigations offers the possibility of transmitting lectures in high quality and in real-time. The basis is a bidirectional video and audio communication between the two lecture halls and thus between the lecturer and the students in the remote lecture hall. The audio and video data are transmitted in real-time as MPEG-2 compressed data stream in the IP network, specifically the broadband science network. For the transmission of presentation graphics and contents of the blackboard, a digital whiteboard is made available to the lecturer. From here, he can control his presentation independently of any device technology, perform annotations in it and use a simulated blackboard. These data are transmitted with an application-sharing tool to the remote lecture hall and projected onto the media wall using a second projector. Through this technology of two-channel transmission, combined with the associated transmission qualities, it was possible to develop a system that has been in practical study operation for 4 years and has been accepted by students and lecturers. This has been proven by corresponding statistical investigations. This system can be used for different subject areas. No special knowledge is expected from the lecturers and no separate training is necessary. Only the presentation graphics must be available in electronic form.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195321-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117405-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4146534-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032386-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4379615-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072560-1>
Phonons of epitaxially grown graphene on Ir(111) and molecular vibrational excitations studied by angle-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy ¤ This work investigates the dynamic properties of molecules and two-dimensional materials and their change when they are adsorbed on surfaces. The focus of the first part of the investigations is on the properties of phonons of graphene. A graphene monolayer was epitaxially grown on Ir(111) with high structural homogeneity and a single rotational domain. Using angle-resolved inelastic electron scattering, the phonon dispersion relation was determined over the entire surface Brillouin zone. The expected Kohn anomaly at the K-point is weaker than previously known for pure graphene or graphite. Density functional calculations show that this phenomenon arises from a weakened electron-phonon coupling, as electron correlations in graphene are shielded by the presence of the metal substrate. In addition, graphene on Ir(111) exhibits a Moiré superstructure, which arises from the different lattice constants of the materials. For the first time, it was shown that the superstructure leads to copies of the phonon branches, which have not been reported before. In the second part of the work, the vibrational excitations of phthalocyanines adsorbed on Ir(111) and graphene are compared. By combining vibrational spectroscopy and density functional calculations, it was demonstrated that phthalocyanines chemisorb on Ir(111) and are significantly deformed. In contrast, phthalocyanines physisorb on graphene and retain their original vacuum properties in the adsorbed state. Consequently, graphene on Ir(111) acts as a buffer layer, which significantly reduces phthalocyanin-Ir hybridization. The third part of the investigations deals with the detection of electrostatic dipole-dipole interactions using molecules adsorbed on surfaces. In the experiment, carbon monoxide (CO) was deposited on Ir(111) and served as a probe molecule. Upon co-adsorption of phthalocyanines, the C-O stretching frequency decreased and the spectroscopic line profile of CO became asymmetric. Calculations show that the experimental findings can be explained by electrostatic dipole-dipole interactions between the CO and phthalocyanin dipoles.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129373-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152545-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7591667-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162402-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123130-2>
Internet-based Internationalization : Decision-making, Implementation, and Success Measurement ¤ The Internet offers small and medium-sized enterprises a resource-saving form of internationalization. However, barriers to implementation usually lie in subjective factors of the entrepreneur. Based on the theory of cognition, Sebastian Ullrich develops a research model that represents the subjective, decision-relevant factors that ultimately contribute to the implementation of internet-based internationalization. In total, eight subjective factors, three implementation parameters, determinants, and moderators are identified, which affect success in a complex causal network.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162106-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113446-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031031-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197034-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308416-3>
Abweichungsfeste Verfassungsgrundsätze des Unionsrechts als ordre public-Vorbehalt gegenüber dem Völkerrecht ¤ Since the Kadi judgment, the ECJ has repeatedly emphasised that obligations imposed by international agreements cannot have the effect of prejudicing the constitutional principles of Union law. Based on a case law analysis, the study examines these constitutional principles of Union law, which have so far lacked contours. The focus is on the effect of these principles in relation to acts of Union law and international treaties of the Union that are determined by international law. Based on the results, individual constitutional principles are elaborated. A comparison also shows clear similarities of the concept with ordre public exceptions. An outline of the role of constitutional principles in solving current issues rounds off the work.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063693-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187677-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130689-2>
Entrepreneurship as Catalyst : Establishing Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns in Tourism ¤ Sebastian Speer investigates how entrepreneurship can take on a catalytic function in terms of establishing sustainable production and consumption patterns in tourism. To this end, he develops a model that integrates the entrepreneur person as well as supporting actors and specific framework conditions into an effectiveness context, and applies it to the tourism sector. It can help people from science and practice identify and utilize success factors in establishing sustainability-oriented offers. The author Sebastian Speer graduated from the Chair of Tourism/Centre for Entrepreneurship at the Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt. Currently, he works as a representative at a large German transport company.

Comparison of hierarchical and distributed optimization for model predictive control ¤ In this work, the application of hierarchical (Interaction Balance Method (IBM)) and distributed optimization methods (Han-Algorithm) was presented. The goal is to identify which is best suited for controlling water supply systems or other similar systems, and to evaluate the comparison and analysis of the methods. The implementation and simulation were carried out using the MATLAB software. To solve the task, the following approach was chosen. After reviewing the literature in relation to hierarchical and distributed methods, the MPC technique was investigated. Initial investigations were carried out on a simplified water supply system. Then these methods were applied to an aggregated water supply system and the corresponding description was supplemented, which better reflects the processes in a realistic situation. Based on the investigations, the following conclusions can be drawn. For the optimization of systems with a small number of variables and couplings between them, a hierarchical structure should be used, as these procedures lead to more accurate results in a shorter time. For systems with a large number of variables and couplings, the distributed structure is better suited for optimization. The number of variables and couplings affects CPU frequency in the optimization process. This results in different CPU times for optimization. Since MATLAB works interpretively, relatively long CPU times are generated. The distributed Han-Algorithm, its improved and modified version have not been fully investigated, especially in terms of convergence and the parameter θ, i.e. the way of its determination. In this paper, the «Bisection-Interval-Method» was used to determine this parameter. The disturbance vector (consumption) affects the optimization process, which means that under different values of consumption, the distributed algorithms can solve the same optimization problems with different CPU time requirements. The author suggests for further work: - Use of another programming language such as C/C++; - Use of another method to find the parameter θ; - Use of a faster and more powerful computer; - Use of the Parallel Computing Toolbox in MATLAB.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4271836-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043664-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4300608-5>
Inequality and Constitution : Proposal for a Relational Legal Analysis ¤ As foundational documents of democratic societies, constitutions promise freedom, equality, and justice. But how does this normative claim relate to the real social inequalities? Building on economic critical perspectives and feminist legal critiques, the author designs a relational, that is, a social relations-inclusive, legal analysis. The study provides both a methodological framework for legal science and a vocabulary for equality-oriented interpretations of constitutional law. To this end, the author reconstructs in three case studies on redistribution, recognition, and representation how economic and gender inequalities are negotiated in practice under the Basic Law and EU law. It becomes clear that the development of a constitutional language for addressing structural inequality is crucially linked to the methodological approach. While traditional legal individualism leads to systematic hurdles, a relational perspective enables the thematization of social inequality as a constitutional issue.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062787-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042623-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071878-5>
Overcoming Failure: Autobiographical Writings of Former Party Officials from NSDAP and SED ¤ Germany experienced two dictatorships in the 20th century, the Third Reich and the DDR, which still shape the Federal Republic of Germany today. Nevertheless, the post-war perspective of the leading actors of both regimes has been largely neglected in historical research in contrast to that of the victims, generals, writers, or scientists. Hans-Ulrich Danner evaluates all autobiographies of the most important party officials of NSDAP and SED in a comparative study for the first time. In this study, the processing strategies, criticism of the system and ideology, explanations for the failure, and the authors' self-assessment are examined. The summarizing analyses of each memoir writer and the cross-system typology are the main result of the work. Both similarities and differences in the processing of the past by NS and SED authors are shown. Due to the historical and political relevance of the so far unexplored topic, the book is of importance to science. Especially for the interested reader, a new perspective on the German dictatorship experience is offered by focusing on the functionaries of the regimes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125974-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003939-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195461-0>
Marriage Proceedings and Marriage Processes in State and Church: A Comparative Legal Examination ¤ The author deals with marriage procedure law in state and Catholic Church. In doing so, he examines the state procedure in marriage matters (proceedings on divorce, annulment of marriage and on the establishment or non-establishment of a marriage between the parties under § 121 No. 1-3 FamFG) and describes the ecclesiastical marriage procedure law with the two fundamental possibilities of establishing the nullity of a marriage and the dissolution of the marriage bond. In the following comparative legal examination, similarities and differences as well as advantages and disadvantages of the procedures are worked out. The book is suitable as a basis for possible changes and improvements in both legal systems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113383-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190987-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114203-2>
Britain's Departure from Coal Power Generation: The Application of a European Electricity Market Model ¤ Philip Mayer provides a comprehensive insight into the structure of the British electricity system and analyzes the effects of the planned complete abandonment of coal power generation in Great Britain by using a European electricity market model.

The Feature 'unauthorized' in the Penal Provisions of the Special Part of the StGB ¤ The author's objective lies in the creation of a systematic and conceptual order of the indeterminate crime feature 'unauthorized', which should ideally be reflected in a clear definition. At the center are a philological consideration of the linguistic expression 'unauthorized', the dogmatic construction of the crime, and above all the examination of the relevant provisions of the Special Part in the Penal Code. The relevant norms are investigated within the framework of goods-specific delinquent groups, which essentially orient themselves to the systematic order of the StGB. However, the result of the investigation is that a consistent terminology in the Special Part cannot be attested. The sole yardstick is the relevant penal provisions, which do not allow for a conceptual and systematic congruence. The feature represents in the Penal Code rather a relational or functional legal sentence concept, the concrete content of which is determined in each individual case by the telos of the penal provision. The content of the concept thus always results from the purpose of the norm and is dependent on the function of 'authorization', which the perpetrator must invoke in each individual case to achieve impunity.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4333792-2>

And is the time of the original not over after all? In the process, the question of what an original actually is often takes a backseat. Doris Reisinger puts forward the thesis: The concept of the original is not only not obsolete, it also does not necessarily have to do with novelty, authorship, or aesthetic value - the problem of the original concept simply consists in that its complex structure is misunderstood. From this starting point, she develops an explication proposal that allows for the answer to a whole range of questions in this classical philosophical debate.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000626-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172832-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045791-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172836-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032903-3>
Radiochemical Analysis of Long-Lived Cosmogenic Radionuclides in Martian Meteorites and Chondrites: Cross-Sections, Production Rates, and Model Calculations ¤ In the Martian meteorites ALHA 77005, ALH 84001, Chassigny, EETA 79001A, Governador Valadares, Lafayette, Nakhla, Sayh al Uhaymir 005, Shergotty and Zagami, as well as the chondrites Grüneberg, Morávka, Naragh and Neuschwanstein, the concentrations of the long-lived cosmogenic radionuclides Be-10, Al-26 and Mn-53 were measured. The analysis was carried out using ultra-sensitive accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). To this end, the elements Al, Be, Ca, Fe, Mn and Ni had to be separated using a radiochemical separation process. Subsequently, highly pure oxide, hydride and fluoride samples were prepared for the AMS measurement and measured in the accelerator laboratories of the TU Munich and the ETH Zurich. In addition, the concentrations of the cosmogenic components of the noble gases He-3, Ne-21, Ne-22, Ar-36, Ar-38, Kr-80 and Kr-83 were compiled, which were analyzed at the same samples in the framework of a joint research project at MPI Mainz and corrected for their cosmogenic component. As a result, a comprehensive same-sample dataset with partly first-time data for cosmogenic nuclides in the ten investigated Martian meteorites was created, which was not available in this scope so far. For the interpretation of the measured radionuclide concentrations, the physical model developed by Leya et al. [LEY00b] was used, which calculates the production rate of cosmogenic nuclides in meteoroids on the basis of nuclear data. With the help of the analyzed data and model calculations, it was possible to decipher the irradiation histories in detail ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133541-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144868-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038950-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147875-7>
Urban Visibility and Materiality: An Examination of Urban District Discourses at Hamburg-St. Pauli ¤ Hamburg-St. Pauli – heterogeneous district in transition -- City in the context of economization, tourism, and gentrification -- Hamburg-St. Pauli in the mirror of studies and surveys -- Power relations in St. Pauli: research interest and guiding questions -- Discourse-theoretical perspectives on the relationship between discourse, power, and materiality/visibility. As the complexity of current urban development conflicts in quarters like Hamburg-St. Pauli challenges established discourse-theoretical approaches with their focus on linguistic discourses, Katharina Wischmann designs a discourse concept following Michel Foucault, conceptualizing visibility and materiality as dimensions of the discursive. The author shows how specific architectures, high-rise quarters, and old building stocks, demolitions, and new buildings constitute social power relations. With a city-photographic approach, the role of these visibilities and materialities is explored and these are highlighted as crystallization points of urban district political argumentation and positioning.

Projective shapes : Topology and Means ¤ The projective form of an object is the geometric information that is invariant under projective transformations. It naturally occurs in the reconstruction of objects from uncalibrated camera images. If an object is described as a point set or configuration of landmarks in the d-dimensional real projective space RP(d), then the set of projective forms is the quotient space RP(d)^k / PGL(d) and is thus canonically equipped with the quotient topology. However, on this topological space of projective forms, many mathematical tools cannot be applied for topological reasons, a phenomenon that also occurs in a similar form in the spaces of similarity and affine forms. In the present work, the topology of the projective form space is thoroughly investigated with a view to finding a reasonable topological subspace that possesses sufficient properties for the application of statistical methods. An example of such a well-behaved subspace is the space of Tyler regular forms, which has already been considered by Kent and Mardia. Their results are further extended in this work. This subspace is not optimally chosen for some dimensions d and numbers of landmarks k, but the so-called Tyler standardization of these forms provides both embeddings in metric spaces and a Riemannian metric on this subspace. For one of these embeddings, the corresponding Fréchet expectation and mean values are defined. While the consistency of this mean value is easily shown, the computation of the extrinsic mean value is numerically challenging. As an alternative, another expectation and mean value is defined, whose computation circumvents these problems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193842-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156724-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047436-7>

Environmental Certificates as Economic Control Instruments and Their Effects on Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises: A Comparative Investigation of the Controllability of Land Sealing and Water Use in Germany and the USA ¤ The starting point of the treatise is the political requirement of reducing land sealing and water use in Germany. This ecological goal is implemented through the creation of an economic model for controlling land sealing and water use based on environmental certificates. Based on an empirical survey of existing environmental policy controls in the USA and Germany, as well as model-theoretical approaches in the literature, a new economic control model is developed step by step on the basis of tradable environmental certificates. The work is thus internationally and interdisciplinarily located at the interface between ecology, economics, and law. The preventive and follow-up effect of the control model is particularly important for SMEs in the context of land recycling of former business premises and for municipalities in terms of the reduction of commercial land surplus. Against this background, the control model can be seen as a suitable balance between the politically prescribed quantity limitation, the interests of SMEs and municipalities on the one hand, and the preservation of existing assets and preventive behavior on the other hand. It thus represents a contribution to sustainable development for the environmental media soil and water. With the control model for the environmental media soil and water based on environmental certificates, a mature and practical economic control instrument is available for efficient quantity control. A political decision is now necessary regarding its implementation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122086-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138608-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031031-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114030-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4204025-5>
Efficient Shrinking : Incentive Failures and Action Strategies ¤ Besides the demographic development in Germany, general trends on the labor market also lead to the depopulation of many regions. The effects of regional shrinkage processes affect almost all areas of a region, such as economic and population development, housing market, urban planning, waste management in the technical and social sector, transportation infrastructure, ecology, and financial budget. Whether regions develop efficiently over time depends to a large extent on state and municipal action strategies. Regional shrinkage processes in Germany often do not proceed as it would be sensible from demographic and socio-economic efficiency perspectives. In this context, Markus Oberndörfer provides empirical results to give a new quality to the debate on action strategies and (incentive failure) systems in shrinking regions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049043-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058136-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133767-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180019-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129069-0>
The Foreign Witness in the Criminal Procedure ¤ Worldwide networking and foreign connections in all areas of life can pose difficult legal and practical questions for the parties involved in the proceedings in connection with foreign witnesses: When is the witness (un-)reachable and in what form - perhaps temporarily or audiovisually - is his statement to be obtained? How does cooperation with the foreign country work? Under what conditions is the right to confrontation under Art. 6 (3) d) ECHR guaranteed? How is the application for evidence of the interrogation of foreign witnesses to be treated with regard to § 244 (5) 2 StPO? The investigation addresses such current and practice-relevant questions in the conviction that the clarification of a crime with a foreign connection may not be less reliable than in the case of a purely domestic connection, that effective defense rights must be available to the accused in any case, but also that justice relief, acceleration of proceedings, and prevention of abuse represent legitimate interests.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145175-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116634-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067701-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068999-2>
Category Analysis with POS-Scanning Data: Key-Indicator-Based Analysis Procedures for the Consumer Goods Industry ¤ Scanning data have been an important information basis for trade management and industrial distribution management for a considerable time. However, in corporate practice, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises, the procedures for analyzing scanning data and the associated problems of scanning data research are largely unknown. Consequently, the information potential of scanning data is not used sufficiently in German corporate practice, and practically not at all in the medium-sized sector. From the perspective of small and medium-sized enterprises, a competitive disadvantage often arises against large companies, which in part have their own evaluation methods or can purchase expensive data evaluations from market research institutes. As an indicator of this state, the hardly articulated demand of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Federal Republic of Germany for scanning data is mentioned. In the USA, on the other hand, the evaluation of scanning data is one of the usual procedures for obtaining market data. This scenario highlights the lag in the use of scanning data in the Federal Republic of Germany. In the present writing, the current state of the use of scanning data in the German consumer goods industry is sketched. Furthermore, the problem areas of the use of scanning data in German corporate practice are opened up and corresponding solution approaches are worked out. Using a concrete case example from the chain retail food trade, procedures for analyzing product groups are presented.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4258109-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4203516-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4500887-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123037-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121606-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197140-1>
Practical Evaluation Model of Environmental and Climate Protection Aspects for the Use of Biogas in a German-Chinese Comparison ¤ Climate protection is the greatest environmental policy challenge. Climate researchers see numerous indicators that the climate change has already begun. One of them is the fact that seven of the ten hottest years since the beginning of global temperature recordings in the mid-19th century fell in the last decade. According to the assessment of many scientists, this development is likely to be attributed to human influence (IPCC-WG1 2007). Therefore, the emissions of greenhouse gases caused by humans - especially the carbon dioxide (CO2) produced in combustion processes - must be drastically reduced worldwide. The interplay of climate protection and increasingly scarce fossil resources has led to a boom in renewable energies since the recent past. From this, biogas use in Germany has become one of the most important components of renewable energies, alongside wind and solar energy projects. In China, the situation of biogas use is complicated but also becoming increasingly important...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006796-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061644-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547705-1>
Change of Top Leadership and Corporate Success ¤ Top leaders are generally attributed a significant importance for the well-being and woe of their companies. Just with the change at the leadership summit, expectations of certain typical success developments are connected. To what extent these are fulfilled and whether typical success patterns actually show up with different types of changes of top leaders, is subject to the work besides other aspects. In particular, the following questions are subjected to a closer analysis: - Do typical changes of the success situation show up in the course of a change of the top leadership? - Is the corporate success before and after the change dependent on the reason for the change? - Do top leaders influence the corporate success through accounting policy in this turbulent change situation? - In which situations is which type of successor elected at the corporate summit and what consequences does this election have for the corporate success? In the framework of an empirical analysis of the changes at the board of directors of all German listed stock corporations for the period from 1989 to 1997, Sören Salomo deals with these questions. In total, two types of changes at the corporate summit are characterized by the change of top leadership: In the extraordinary case, the top leader leaves unwillingly. In this case, the strongest success variance is shown in the course of the change process, which is also influenced by significant accounting policy activities of the respective top leader. The succession is usually taken over by an outsider. The normal case (pension, voluntary change) is carried out in all areas very unobtrusively. Low success variance without extraordinary accounting policy is observed. The successor is usually already active in the board of directors before the change (insider). Just the extraordinary case of the change at the corporate summit is surprisingly often found at over 30% of the identified departures of top leaders of German stock corporations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124319-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000937-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4223768-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4225195-3>
Reinvention of an Industry : Evolution of Organizations and Markets through Business Model Innovation ¤ Business model innovation from an evolutionary perspective -- Industrial evolution through business model innovation -- Micro- and macro-dimension of business model innovation. Clemens Mast analyzes the connection between the size of companies and the success of business model innovation, the new innovation type that works independently and complementarily to product, process, and service innovation. Based on empirical studies, the author highlights that, in particular, the technologically dominant German middle class can quickly fall behind in business model innovation. While large corporations use their scaling advantages and start-ups use their business model-changing initiation qualities, medium-sized companies often lack focus and competence for this differently acting innovation type. Finally, Clemens Mast shows possibilities for promoting the development, implementation, and scaling of business model innovation.

Organization of Financial Management: Empirical Inventory and Time Comparison ¤ The core task of financial management is to secure solvency. Insolvency is existentially threatening, and the problem is therefore well illuminated from a financial theoretical perspective. -- Liquidity security is a permanent task but also organizationally required. It is precisely this organizational requirement that moves our emotions after the regular headlines about liquidity crises. Such crises raise questions such as: -- - Has management lost sight of liquidity in times of prolonged surpluses? -- - Are highly specialized financial managers still manageable? -- - Have internal financial planning and communication systems failed? -- The list of questions could be continued indefinitely, but answers are rare. This study begins here. It formulates and tests hypotheses about the current state and development process of financial organizations in non-financial sector companies. The data basis consists of semi-structured in-depth interviews with representatives of 29 of the 33 German industrial and commercial corporations that participated in a study by Hauschildt in 1968. -- The findings confirm the conservative-looking assumption that the company's money matters require a bureaucratically structured order and power. Financial experts who have become independent from the management level, monitoring deficits, unbinding responsibility allocations, planning and control deficiencies, incomplete financial communication within the group, and conflict-averse "financial conscience" are found in many financial organizations. The strictness of the solvency requirement is no longer the highest design maxim for financial organization. Financial management has lost power over time. This loss of power is largely a consequence of increased concentration on the company's economic success. However, the cost-effectiveness postulate only replaces the liquidity postulate as a guiding principle of organizational design in some financial management. In many cases, the "principle of least resistance" takes its place	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139075-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043774-7>
Personal Policy in Medium-Sized Enterprises: Personal Policy Configurations and Organizational Dissonance ¤ The development of personnel policy in companies usually takes place in the confrontation of various interest groups. As the starting point of the investigation serves the question, how companies react to change impulses that are suitable to change the foundations of the respective personnel policy. Based on the theory of action relief, the concept of 'Organizational Dissonance' is developed as another analytical instrument. In the development of 'Organizational Dissonance', the classical works of Festinger are referred to and his considerations are supplemented by insights from recent theoretical and empirical literature. In approaches, a reference is made to the theory of cognitive dissonance from the subjective level to a collective level and thus a first step towards the further development of organizational theory is made. The micro-macro connection is made essentially through constructs such as organizational identity. Through several case studies, the specific logic of the various personnel systems and the effectiveness of dissonance reduction mechanisms within these systems are illustrated. The assignment of the investigated companies to various personnel policy configurations is made using indicators that derive from the theory of action relief.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002617-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164464-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031031-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045269-4>
Considerations on the Operation of [Sigma]-[Delta] Modulators ¤ In this work, the operation of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) based on the [Sigma]-[Delta] principle is investigated. Due to good integration in monolithic ICs and the requirements of process signal processing, well-suited conversion procedures have become established. This pulse-coded modulation can be understood as a discrete-time feedback loop, where the system state is queried at predetermined times. This pulse-coded modulation consists of two elements, where the encoding of the input signal by the [Sigma]-[Delta] converter corresponds to a 1-bit quantization. The subsequent decoding is performed using digital filters through suitable averaging. The output is a staircase function, which can now be manipulated, stored, or transported more easily. In general, such models are investigated directly in the time domain or after linearization and subsequent transformation into the frequency domain. This work is limited to the time domain. In it, analytical (functional analysis), algebraic (number theory), stochastic, numerical (simulation), and geometric methods are used. Two directions are particularly highlighted. If no linearization is performed by adding an external source (quantization error), the converters are described by nonlinear nonautonomous difference initial value problems (DAVP). In the case of first or second order, an exact or approximate solution and derived filter proposals with error estimates were given. Through this approach, the local (pointwise) behavior of the [Sigma]-[Delta] converters is reproduced. The second direction is based on the investigation of a sequence of converters of the same order with decreasing clock time to zero. Through this, linear(!) differential equations are obtained through weak limit transitions, which describe the behavior of the converters in the	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170332-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070477-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4670553-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113314-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127859-8>

Ad-hoc-Publicity, Knowledge Allocation and the Statutory Duty of Confidentiality under Corporate Law : A Contribution to the Tension between Capital Markets Law and Corporate Law ¤ The work deals with the relationship between European market abuse law and the hitherto only slightly harmonized corporate law. In this context, the effects of the duty of ad-hoc publicity on knowledge allocation on the one hand and the statutory duty of confidentiality under corporate law on the other hand are illuminated. A focus of the investigation is therefore also the multiple membership of organs, which inevitably leads to a transfer of knowledge between companies. Through membership in the organs of various issuers, potentially publicity-bound insider information can also be introduced into other corporate spheres. At the same time, such information is regularly subject to the obligation of silence.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1281969265> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122119-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4525278-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032356-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180447-8>
Liability Law Questions of the Use of Private Information and Communication Technology in the Employment Relationship ¤ The internal company damage compensation is based on the separation of the company's and private spheres. The digitalization of the working world, especially the company use of private information technology, questions the traditional boundary rules. The present work examines where the liability rules need to be supplemented and modified in order to ensure a fair liability regime in the future. Central is the recognition that the company risk can be determined by the criteria of external determinability and external utility if subtle forms of actual external control are taken into account. Furthermore, the specific damage risks of the company use of private ICT are examined in terms of the question of how far the legal position of the employee, associated with the property, overlaps the organizational responsibility of the employer. In addition, the work deals with the liability of colleagues to each other, in particular the complex enforcement of the claim for exemption against the employer, especially when using private ICT.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022898-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002769-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026926-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002623-1>
Viagra in Everyday Life : Practices of Masculinity, Body, and Sexuality ¤ In contrast to frequently clichéd media representations of Viagra, the study by Claudia Sontowski provides the first differentiated empirical analysis of the hitherto largely unknown everyday handling of the drug. The author shows that the various usage practices cannot be explained by a specific narrative such as the medicalization of sexuality or a mechanistic body image. Rather, Viagra is integrated into the everyday practices of users on the basis of body and gender knowledge. The results form an innovative contribution to the analysis of new possibilities of body modification within the body and gender research.

Methods for in-situ Visualization of Dry Friction Pair Dynamics under Supplemental Physical and Chemical Characterization of Friction Partners ¤ The tribological behavior of dry friction pairs is still not fully describable. The need to know what happens during braking in the friction zone is enormous. The objective of the present work is therefore to overcome the existing limits of in-situ consideration of friction zone processes on a multiscalar level (Nano, Micro, Macro) to characterize the mechanisms of the friction layer. For this purpose, new in-situ visualization studies were carried out using specially developed brake discs and original complete friction linings of passenger cars. For the latter, consideration was given to various recipes (ECE, NAO, and copper-free ECE mixtures). As a result, the comparability of the findings of the in-situ test concept can be demonstrated on conventional friction pairs (gray cast iron brake disc - organic friction lining), which highlights the suitability and statement capability of the new method. The emerging patch behavior shows direct analogies with regard to the number, size, and shape of the plateaus. With the help of visualization and supplementary analysis methods, the dynamics of patch life cycles as patch area over braking time are characterized for the first time. Also, the friction force-transmitting friction zone fractions between braking are determined and thus allow conclusions to be drawn on the development of residual braking moments. In addition to patch analyses, the movement speeds and paths as well as the residence times of wear particles in the friction zone are characterized for the first time. It shows not only that they move slower compared to the rotor speed, but also that the lining recipe has a significant influence on the development of particle paths and the mutual influence of particle movement behavior. The characterization approach, which also includes locally resolved lining topography, compressibility, and porosity analyses (using three-dimensional computed tomography) as well as chemical analyses using EDX, reveals connections between patch dynamics and friction layer physics and chemistry with regard to tribological (dry and wet friction) and thermal (thermoelastic instability) behavior. This allows the description of heat spots in the friction zone for the first time, by dynamically determining their number and area. With the presented method, it is now possible to characterize the dynamics and mechanisms of individual patches, various patch zones, and the entire friction zone (including brake ring displacements).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4209037-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060847-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4227668-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177464-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076001-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022005-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4217870-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4395749-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4475741-4>
Modelling of Agents and Multiagent Systems: Foundations and Applications ¤ The subject of this text is the modelling of individual agents and agent systems using the formalism of reference networks. Reference networks are a higher Petri net formalism that allows networks to be treated as active marks. The modelling is based on fundamental principles such as encapsulation and autonomy, which each agent should implement. On the basis of the basic models obtained in this way, further development and refinement are carried out, resulting in increasingly complex agent models that, while maintaining the basic structure, also implement the postulated principles. Elementary considerations on the relationship between agents and their environment lead to the modelling of agent systems. This is done in a similar way to individual agents, through step-by-step refinement. This part of the work leads to a executable and FIPA-compliant agent system in accordance with the standardization proposals. The work concludes with the presentation of three case studies in which the agent models are used for agent-oriented software development.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4455835-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170297-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120906-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4389058-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045388-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116522-6>
Affect and Police: An Ethnography of Anger in Executive Violence Work ¤ Debates about police action often focus on questions of the 'appropriateness' of violence application and potential boundary transgressions. The legitimacy of police violence is closely tied to an affective neutrality of action. Stephanie Schmidt examines these affective components of violence work in her ethnography. She analyzes performative representations of anger, which acquire meaning as a work object and tool in everyday police work. Based on the concept of order, her emotionally theory-based perspective enables understanding violence as a body technique and thus also as an expression of police work.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157237-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046595-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4498129-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135470-9>
Die Rechtspraxis von Beiräten in Familienunternehmen : eine quantitative und qualitative Untersuchung von 34 Familienunternehmen zu Statuten ihres Beirats oder Aufsichtsrats ¤ The implementation of a board (‘Beirat’) can be freely modeled by the shareholders of a family enterprise. As they define all rules concerning the structure of the board, a large variety of constructs exists. This study delineates the regulatory structure of 34 family enterprises with regard to their rules of the boards’ implementation. Based on more than 40 individual criteria, the results of the analysis are shown and discussed. The main conclusions are then reviewed with four professionals via expert interviews to gain an even deeper understanding of the practical principles of optional supervisory or advisory boards in family enterprises. Due to this approach, the study is relevant for both academic scholars and practitioners.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003550-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4503339-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005347-7>
The Abandoned Settlements of the Island of Rügen ¤ From the foreword: The basis of this investigation of the abandoned settlements of the island of Rügen is their detailed recording, which is included in a shorter version in the register of this work. In the text part, after three introductory sections, the periods determined from the times of origin of the abandoned settlements are treated separately. In this, an attempt is made to reconstruct the settlement image of the island of Rügen for each period and to show the causes of the transformation. A summary of the periods characterizes the position of the area under investigation in comparison to other regions of Germany. Finally, conclusions are presented on the settlement history on Rügen and the main causes of the negative transformation of the settlement image.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139906-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139907-9>
Occurrence of Antisperma Antibodies and Leukocytes in the Semen of Warmblood Stallions and their Impact on Semen Quality ¤ The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of antisperma antibodies (ASA) in the semen of 20 healthy stallions, taking into account possible seasonal fluctuations by sampling in January and May. Furthermore, the impact of ASA on semen quality and possible correlations with the presence of seminal leukocytes should be evaluated. Each ejaculate was subjected to a standard spermatological examination and subsequently investigated for the presence of ASA. For the investigation of ASA, the established measurement method of flow cytometry after staining the samples with antibodies against equine IgG and IgA was used. The previously established threshold of 20% ASA-positive sperm could not be achieved in any case after subtraction of the isotype control, so that none of the investigated stallions could be rated as ASA-positive. Nevertheless, individually positive results below the threshold could be generated, which showed significant (p < 0.05), seasonally dependent fluctuations. The results of the standard spermatology showed physiological, seasonal, and seasonal fluctuations, but could not be meaningfully compared with the results of the ASA sampling. For the same reason, it was not meaningful to search for correlations with possible seminal leukocytes. Nevertheless, the possibility of identifying and differentiating leukocytes present in the ejaculate by measuring the native semen of twelve healthy stallions as a standardized examination method was validated. For this investigation, flow cytometry was also used, after leukocyte subpopulations had been marked with CD4-, CD8-, CD21-, and CD172a-specific monoclonal antibodies. By mixing isolated leukocytes with sperm, control samples could be measured, in which a rapid disappearance of lymphoid cells was observed. This probably ROS-induced apoptosis of lymphoid cells could be prevented by adding the antioxidants ascorbic acid and butyliert hydroxytoluol. Furthermore, eight Hengste samples with different amounts of added leukocytes in the hematological system Advia 2120 were investigated and compared with each other as well as with the results of the flow cytometric measurement. The results of the control sample for each stallion were significantly higher (p < 0.05) for the vital leukocyte and lymphocyte populations identified by morphology and after staining with PI as well as after staining with specific surface markers of leukocyte subpopulations. The comparison of the control samples with different sperm-leukocyte ratios of the different stallions measured in Advia 2120 showed comparable leukocyte values per sperm-leukocyte ratio. Since the hematological system Advia 2120 identifies leukocytes by their peroxidase activity, but also all other large peroxidase-negative cells as leukocytes, significantly higher amounts of leukocytes were reported in Advia 2120 than after flow cytometric detection. Accordingly, the measurement in Advia 2120 can only be recommended as a quick screening for suspicious ejaculates, which should be flow cytometrically validated at a value of 0.2 G/L leukocytes after measurement in Advia 2120. In summary, no occurrence of ASA could be described in the investigated population of healthy stallions, making it impossible to establish reference values with seasonal fluctuations. A standardized, reproducible flow cytometric assay for the identification of leukocyte subpopulations could be established. In a population of healthy stallions, no significant amounts of leukocytes in the semen could be detected.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012494-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113937-9>
Synthesis of Functionalizable and Degradable Polymer Systems with Disulfides ¤ The present work deals with the synthesis of disulfides, the thiol-disulfide metathesis reaction as a possibility to functionalize polymers, and the synthesis of polydisulfides. In the first part of the work, the aminolysis of RAFT polymers and the dependence of polymer-polymer disulfide formation on molecular mass are investigated. By incorporating reaction kinetics using gel-permeation chromatography (GPC), it was found that the longer the polymer chains are, the less disulfide polymer coupling occurs. RAFT polymers are often used to modify the RAFT polymer end group after polymerization or to functionalize it in a chemical reaction. Here, aminolysis can be performed in the presence of short-chain disulfides, such as cystine, to completely suppress the formation of polymer-polymer disulfides and obtain a end-group-functionalized polymer.

Application of Cryogenic Calorimeters for High-Resolution Precision X-Ray Spectroscopy ¤ Within the scope of this work, the technology of metallic magnetic microcalorimeters, which has been continuously developed over the past few years, was prepared for use as a high-precision spectrometer in atomic physics. These detectors combine the advantages of various conventional energy-dispersive photon detection technologies due to their unique functional principle. They combine the broad spectral acceptance of semiconductor detectors with the high resolution of crystal spectrometers and thus represent an ideal tool for measuring atomic physical interactions with a broad range of photon energies. In order to fully exploit the potential of the detectors, however, the transition from an analog signal analysis established for conventional procedures to a digital signal analysis is required. Therefore, a powerful and comprehensive software package was developed in the course of the work to be able to evaluate the data of several experiments performed. On the one hand, X-ray transitions of barium and iron were observed and identified at the S-EBIT-I. On the other hand, the 1s-Lamb shift of Xe53+ and the 2s-Lamb shift of Xe89+ were successfully measured with microcalorimeter detectors at the internal gas jet target of the ESR storage ring of the GSI. Significant improvements could be achieved both technically and conceptually for the operation and measurement procedure, so that metallic magnetic microcalorimeters are ready for future high-precision experiments in atomic physics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050331-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003423-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4181260-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4226529-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166502-8>

The Dynamics of Laser-Induced Metal-Semiconductor Phase Transition of Samarium Sulfide (SmS) ¤ This work is dedicated to the experimental investigation of the metal-semiconductor phase transition of Samarium sulfide (SmS). Temperature- and time-resolved experiments for the characterization of the phase transition in mixed-valent SmS samples (M-SmS) are presented. The measurement of the dynamics of the laser-induced phase transition is performed by time-resolved ultrafast microscopy and by X-ray diffraction with sub-picosecond time resolution. The electronic and structural processes that follow the excitation of M-SmS with infrared femtosecond laser pulses are physically interpreted on the basis of the results and model concepts obtained in this work.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022993-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038860-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179015-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4273256-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4476754-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180942-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178306-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132140-6>
Knowledge Transfer of German Universities: An Empirical Analysis of University Patents ¤ Germany is one of the world's largest producers of knowledge, but ranks only 18th out of 27 EU countries in transferring this knowledge into practice. Marcel Hülsbeck examines the determinants of the implementation of university research results into technological innovations. It shows that regulatory policy incentives, regional industrial structures, and the transfer experience of individual universities have an impact on the transfer practice. The incentives and practices differ significantly in different natural sciences disciplines.

Islam, Gender, Intersectionality: Educational Paths of Young Women in Switzerland ¤ How does the current Islam discourse affect the educational biographies of young second-generation immigrants? How do different categories of difference, such as gender and religion, influence educational biographies? And do these categories intersect? Nathalie Gasser shows how young second-generation immigrants in Switzerland deal with the challenge of being Muslim women in a predominantly Islam-critical environment. She highlights the existing educational barriers and the different tactics used to overcome them.

Rücktrittsrecht und AGB-Kontrolle nach der Schuldrechtsreform ¤ Jan Peter Teubel untersucht am Beispiel der Änderungen des Rücktrittsrechts durch die Schuldrechtsreform die Auswirkungen von Gesetzesänderungen auf die Inhaltskontrolle Allgemeiner Geschäftsbedingungen. Nach einer Darstellung der maßgeblichen Kontrollvorschriften und ihrer Dogmatik behandelt er die Wiedereinführung eines Verschuldenserfordernisses und der Ablehnungsandrohung, wobei er Ersteres im Gegensatz zu Letzterem in AGB für grundsätzlich möglich hält. Sodann stellt er Möglichkeiten dar, dem Schwebezustand nach Ablauf der Nachfrist zu begegnen, und diskutiert, ob beim Eigentumsvorbehalt wie im alten Recht ein Rücktrittsrecht ohne Fristsetzung oder ein einstweiliges Rücknahmerecht formularmäßig ausbedungen werden kann. Die Arbeit kommt dabei zu differenzierten Lösungen und präsentiert Klauselvorschläge.

Testimonies from a Child's Perspective: Communication Culture at School and Professionalization of Performance Evaluation ¤ The quality of performance evaluation and the quality of learning in school are interdependent factors. Teachers must link performance evaluation with the question of how judgments are received, whether they are understandable and comprehensible for the evaluators. The present study illuminates this interplay from two perspectives. Firstly, performance evaluation is viewed from the perspective of 'childhood research'. It shows that children have knowledge of the experiences, phenomena, and world segments that concern them, which can be accessed under special methodological premises. Then, the knowledge of children about certificates is accessed through two interview studies. Through a precise content-analytical evaluation of these conversations, themes, problems, and ways of dealing with certificates from a child's perspective are reconstructed. From this, balancing conditions for quality standards in performance evaluation on the level of teacher action are named. It becomes apparent that the professionalization of the evaluation competence of teachers must be supplemented by a culture of communication in the faculty, especially by communication forms with learners. Writing standards can guarantee the interplay of transparency and quality criteria for performance evaluation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013943-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077220-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139370-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022350-4>

Lean Management in Hospitals : Concept and Practice-Oriented Recommendations ¤ Thomas Kraft investigates the extent to which the principles of Lean Management, which have proven to be a well-established concept for process-oriented quality assurance with simultaneous efficiency improvement in industry, can be applied to the control, support, and core processes in hospitals. He tests his theoretical model in selected practice projects to derive three relevant recommendations for the introduction of Lean projects in hospitals: a hospital-oriented change management, a strategy for process-oriented organizational development, and an approach to operationalizing the first Lean projects. The content includes: Introduction and necessity for reorientation for hospitals From the care mandate to hospital management Application of Lean Management principles to hospital processes Introduction of Lean projects in hospitals The target groups Lecturers and students with a focus on business management and (Lean) management Hospital managers, leading physicians, and leading nursing staff The author Dipl.-Ökonom Thomas Kraft, PhD. has been working since 2002 at internationally renowned hospital suppliers for surgical materials and implants.

Enzyme evolution : exploring substrate scope and catalytic promiscuity ¤ Enzyme evolution and the corresponding relationship to substrate scope and catalytic promiscuity were targeted in this thesis. As enzyme examples, pig liver esterase (PLE), oleate hydratases and linoleate isomerases, as well as epoxide hydrolases (EH) and haloalkane dehalogenases (HLD) were used. The substrate scope and the enantiopreference of PLE was analyzed by molecular modeling and substrate docking, since different enantiomeric excesses were detected for the conversion of malonate diethyl esters, depending on the PLE isoenzyme. Additionally, fatty acid converting enzymes with high identity were found and analyzed to comprehend the switch of both activities. Furthermore, the evolutionary connection between EH and HLD was investigated by interconversion studies to implement an HLD acitivity in an EH. By directed evolution and rational design, both possibilities of protein engineering were realized. Finally, a new methodology for targeted, continuous in vivo evolution was established by a temperature-dependent mutagenesis frequency.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4226773-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160916-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029921-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152561-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4346801-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014988-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147328-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175920-5>

Intergenerational Transmission of Cultural Capital in Migrant Families: A Qualitative Empirical Study of Students in the Bremen Support Project "Mercator"; [Dissertation] ¤ One of the most important educational policy goals of democratic societies is to provide all young people with equal educational opportunities, to promote them individually and to balance social, ethnic and cultural disparities in education and educational success, as stated in the PISA study (2001, p. 323). However, the results of this study show that socio-economic status, cultural capital and the ethnic origin of the family have a significant impact on the educational participation and success of students. Especially in Germany, children of immigrants have particularly poor chances: they mostly attend the Hauptschule and often leave school without a corresponding certificate. In addition, children of immigrants often do not pursue vocational training. The results of the PISA study make it clear that one can hardly speak of a fair education system in Germany anymore. Many scientists are concerned with the question of how social and ethnic origin affects the educational success of students. However, studies on the effects of family and school conditions as well as the social networks of young people on academic success provide only a few differentiated results. Works on intergenerational transfer relationships in migrant families and longitudinal studies on this topic are rare. This work aims to represent the intergenerational transmission of cultural capital in migrant families through a qualitative empirical study of students in the Bremen Support Project "Mercator". Chapter 1 presents the different forms of immigration in Germany to identify the origin-related disparities. Based on this, Chapter 2 shows the conditions and effects associated with the migration process, and Chapter 3 provides an explanation of the school situation of children with a migration background in German educational institutions. Chapter 4 deals with the reasons for the educational deficits of these students. These explanatory approaches are illuminated using the categories of cultural capital, 'social capital, economic capital and habitus' created by Pierre Bourdieu. The theoretical reference to Bourdieu serves to understand the resources of children and young people with a migration background.

The Literary Tableau between Art and Science ¤ The tableau is an interdisciplinary project that emerges in the mutual supplementation and penetration of early natural science, encyclopedic knowledge preparation, and painting in the course of the collecting-inventorizing endeavors since the Early Modern period. In the course of the 18th century, the perspectives nuance and dynamize themselves. Foucault has investigated the epistemological problems associated with this; this book continues his approach and transfers it to literary science. While the literary society tableau in France already fails at the urban diversity and mobility at the end of the 18th century, tableaus of natural and cultural history emerge in Germany with Goethe and under his influence also in scientific prose. With A. von Humboldt's Cosmos, this approach is presented with great effort once again, but fails due to the now achieved complexity of knowledge. Nevertheless, the literary tableau continues to work both as a limited, scenic condensation and as a more comprehensive program of realism and naturalism in the 19th century.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066562-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038935-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167006-1>
Temporal Development of Network Relationships: Theoretical Foundation and Empirical Analysis at the Example of Franchise Networks ¤ Network relationships are not static in nature, but develop over time. Building on the conceptual and theoretical processing of the development phenomenon in network relationships, Tobias Heußler shows how this development looks like in franchise networks. In an investigation at more than 50 franchise networks, the author identifies typical development courses for the relationship constellation between franchisors and franchisees. The investigation results provide franchisors with valuable information for partner management. Based on a multi-level analysis, concrete implications for network management are derived.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078604-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4245322-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3>
Zwischenwelten: Neither War nor Peace: On Constructive Dealing with Violence Phenomena in the Process of Conflict Transformation ¤ Peace processes are often crisis-prone and marked by violent setbacks. The old, war, was ended by an agreement, but the new, lasting peace, has not yet been achieved. These in-between worlds are characterized by different forms of success in bringing about peace consolidation processes. The author identifies measures and intervention approaches that overcome these crisis situations and enable peace consolidation processes, using the examples of South Africa, Northern Ireland, and Macedonia. Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. (Tom Hanks as 'Forrest Gump') Scientific works are in their own unique way like boxes of chocolates, as described by the film figure 'Forrest Gump' in my favorite quote.

Poverty and Environmental Protection : Potentials and Barriers in West Africa's Urban Space ¤ Elisabeth Huber examines in her study the possibilities of environmentally sound action of the poorer urban population groups in the urban space of West Africa. To this end, she analyzes the practices of waste and wastewater disposal in Bamako (Mali) and Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) under the relevant economic, social, and cultural conditions. In addition to discussing poverty in terms of monetary aspects, unfulfilled opportunities, as well as family and neighborhood solidarity strategies, she asks about the connection between environmental awareness, environmental pollution, environmental protection, living and housing conditions, infrastructure, and the 'right to the city'.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062860-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078517-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061644-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000100-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002963-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001307-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000306-1>
Thingness and Disposal of Files ¤ In the light of the increasing digitalisation of the trade in literature, music and film products, the thesis deals with the property law dimension of online trade in electronic media. The legal nature of media in file form and the disposal of files via download is dogmatically examined. Relevant aspects of copyright law, the law of succession, the law of credit securities and foreclosure law are also taken into consideration.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4592128-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4675352-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4202369-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178829-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7658708-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195060-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132512-6>
Procedure shopping through hybrid arbitration agreements : considerations on party autonomy in institutional international arbitration ¤ Are contract parties, who choose an arbitration institution, free in the choice of the procedure? The work deals with this question on party autonomy in institutional international arbitration proceedings by the example of hybrid arbitration clauses. Such clauses name an arbitration institution, but see the arbitration rules of another institution. The author examines the questions arising from such an agreement from the perspective of arbitration, contract, copyright, and trademark law as well as a transnational perspective under consideration of various legal systems. In addition, she compares the rules and organs of important arbitration institutions in Europe, Asia, and America. The work serves as a guide for practice and science in dealing with the peculiarities of institutional arbitration jurisdiction	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4489424-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162055-0>
Capital Preservation through Solvency Tests: An Economic and Experimental Analysis ¤ Alexandra Scholz investigates to what extent the dividend regimes of Germany, England, and the USA prevent opportunistic dividend payments that harm creditors. From the results, the author derives design recommendations for a liquidity-oriented solvency test and discusses accompanying instruments. Dr. Alexandra Scholz was promoted by Prof. Dr. Christoph Watrin at the Institute for Corporate Accounting and Taxation of the University of Münster. The liability privilege of German capital companies is traditionally intertwined with special capital procurement and preservation regulations. In particular, capital preservation, which determines the amount available for dividend payments, has been under pressure in recent years both in terms of accounting and company law. A possible liquidity-oriented solvency test is increasingly at the center of the discussion. Alexandra Scholz investigates to what extent the dividend regimes of Germany, England, and the USA prevent opportunistic dividend payments that harm creditors. From the results, the author derives design recommendations for a liquidity-oriented solvency test and discusses accompanying instruments. In a laboratory experiment, she asks whether the solvency test and an accompanying liability instrument in the form of a professional ban represent an effective form of creditor protection. She shows that only the liability instrument can effectively curb opportunistic dividend payments, but the solvency test alone does not lead to a significant change in behavior.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020908-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022898-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4367264-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029567-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035908-6>

In recent times, there has been talk of a resurgence of religion, and the situation in East-Central and Eastern Europe has been repeatedly referred to. To what extent does such a claim stand up to empirical facts? Olaf Müller examines the following questions in his work: How did the situation regarding the churchliness and religiosity of people in post-communist countries appear immediately after the political turnaround, and how has the religious field developed since then? Which specific patterns and connections can be identified in this context? And through which factors could the observed religious change be conditioned? The investigations are based on a wealth of empirical material, particularly on the basis of international population surveys.

The role and relevance of higher education policy in EU external relations : an analysis of the transmissive, transformative and transactional qualities of university institutions and programmes ¤ Education policy measures with foreign policy goals, which are initiated by the EU, not by national states, have been largely neglected in scientific research so far, although their number and financial framework are constantly growing. These measures, like those from other areas, are part of every EU trade agreement and serve the purpose of exerting influence on third countries. The inherent dynamics of the education sector, however, differ fundamentally from those in other areas. By overriding the mechanisms of unilateral norm transfer, such cooperation enables, contrary to its original purpose of expanding the EU's sphere of influence, the long-term creation of transnational spaces in the long term.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113936-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120503-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069027-1>
Illegitimate Transactions and State Action: An Institutional Economic Analysis of Corrupt Exchange Relationships ¤ Starting from the economic perspective of human behavior, this paper conducts an institutional economic analysis of the relationship between corruption and state action. In a theoretical consideration, various factors are discussed that influence the individual decision to engage in illicit transactions. In this context, the common assumption in economics that people behave rationally in their decisions is transferred to the field of illegal activities. In comparison to legal market transactions, the calculations involved in illegal exchange processes are significantly more complex, and the amount of bribery money does not occupy the central position as the market price does in legal transactions. The statements show that criminal exchange relationships are always exposed to the danger of opportunistic behavior. Therefore, the protection against such behavior in illegal interactions is of significantly greater importance than in legal interactions. This work represents the strategic decision-making calculations of the involved actors using decision-theoretic models and shows how transaction partners can overcome the various problems that arise in illegal exchange relationships. Based on the detailed depiction of the individual economic calculations of the parties involved, theoretically sound recommendations for better institutional arrangements against corruption are derived. It is shown that, when searching for suitable instruments to limit the extent of corrupt activities, possible network effects of criminal actions should also be taken into account. Because, through their integration into social structures and shared value systems, the illegal behavior of individual persons also radiates to the behavior of other persons in the social community. Furthermore, using the economic theory of law, it is explained that stronger controls and higher penalties do not appear to be suitable in every case to prevent corruption. While both are generally useful instruments to reduce criminal activities, their implementation in the case of corruption is burdened with problems due to the specific characteristics and is also associated with a significant consumption of resources.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032524-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027208-4>
On the Method Development for the Design of Automotive Structure Concepts in FVK-Metal Hybrid Construction under Crash Loading ¤ BEGIN<br>Abstract: Hybrid material systems consisting of FVKs and metals are a promising approach to meet the steadily increasing demands on passive safety and energetic efficiency in the operation of future vehicle generations through effective lightweight measures in the body-in-white. For the successful technical implementation of new material systems, a profound understanding of the mechanisms under load and failure through experimental investigations, methods for targeted material selection for a specific structural application, and predictive design methods using numerical simulation are necessary. Previous scientific studies usually only investigate metal-intensive hybrid systems and are characterized by a lack of comparability due to the generally large parameter space and their often very specific research questions. Furthermore, the integrative approach to the three necessary disciplines is lacking, in order to make the benefits of a consistent data basis and synergies usable.<br>The multidisciplinary overall method presented in this work follows this integrative approach for the first time and deals with scientific research questions in the individual disciplines at the same time. The extensive experimental investigations open up new parameter spaces for FVK-intensive hybrid systems under quasistatic and dynamic loading with a consistent material spectrum over several levels of structural complexity. This data basis uses a new, objective method for evaluating and selecting hybrid material systems for a specific structural application based on their overlaid load profile from the relevant crash load cases. Furthermore, these data serve as a basis for the analysis and evaluation of simplified, efficient modeling methods for the simulation of the crash behavior of hybrid structures in the concept phase using complexity and sensitivity studies. A new phenomenon of non-local damage behavior in the adhesive interface of FVK-metal hybrid systems under tensile loading is described, experimentally investigated, and transferred into a predictive, analytical model. The results of the numerical studies indicate that the extension of a strongly simplified, rigid interface model by the developed model of non-local damage leads to a target-oriented ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128805-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136338-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170297-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121153-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134341-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055072-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062670-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035165-8>
Language Consideration in Literature Education? : Integration of Linguistic and Literary Learning in Secondary Education II : A Critical-Systematic Investigation ¤ Can knowledge of grammatical and linguistic connections promote literary understanding? Or more fundamentally: How is the unity of German instruction ordered in the face of divergent Germanistic differentiations in linguistics and literary science? The study subjects the relationship between linguistic and literary learning to a thoroughly critical examination and tests popular theses for hidden premises and implications. Thomas Landgraf's investigations culminate in the consequence of understanding diversity as a central property of German instruction and seeking the commonalities of language and literature instruction in the targeted reception competencies. As a result, the ability to plan the deautomatization of the reading process proves to be a common basic element. Furthermore, Landgraf succeeds in challenging the idea of a unified, 'integrative' German instruction at crucial points.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036032-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056505-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011975-0>

The European Project in the Dialectics of Free Market and Social Justice: Legal Prolegomena to a European Social Model ¤ The author addresses the question of a social dimension of Europe and describes the challenges facing the member states and the European Union in coordinating economic and social objectives at the beginning of the 21st century. The existing tension between the practical idea of a free market Europe and that of a social Europe is examined in the context of the conflict between freedom and equality, which is not only European but also state-immanent. In confrontation with common European knowledge, elements of a 'European Social Model' are gained, which is conceived as an open process directed towards the future.

Optical and Tactile Nanosensors Based on the Focus Method for Application in Nanopositioning and Nanomeasuring Machines ¤ A nanosensor system based on a non-contact optical probing sensor (basic sensor), which is characterized by high resolution and low measurement uncertainty, is the subject of the present dissertation. This nanosensor system is primarily adapted to measurement applications in the nanopositioning and nanomeasuring machine. A new type of focus sensor was developed as the basic sensor for the nanosensor system. The functional principle of this sensor is based on the focus measurement method, which was developed for DVD/CD player technology. The connection of both mechanical probing principles to the nanosensor system is achieved via the developed focus sensor (basic sensor). In this process, the deflection of the probing tip (cantilever or stylus) is directly captured non-contact with the focused laser beam of the focus sensor. The great advantage of the developed nanosensor system lies in its modularity and versatility. Based on a basic sensor, optical and mechanical probing methods and thus different interactions between the measurement object and the sensor are combined. The dissertation presents the development and comprehensive investigations of the nanosensor system in combination with a digital camera microscope. The focus is on detailed explanations of the construction and consideration of important metrological properties of the focus sensor as a basic sensor. The tactile sensors of the established nanosensor system are presented: the focus stylus sensor and the focus AFM sensor. In this context, the constructive and metrological properties of these sensors are treated and compared in detail. Numerous practical applications and measurement results are presented.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075677-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169527-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184370-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172249-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4307964-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4327473-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4561097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175566-2>

Customizable feature-based design pattern recognition integrating multiple techniques ¤ The analysis and recovery of architectural information from existing legacy systems is a complex, costly, and time-consuming task, which is due to the continuously increasing complexity of software and the emergence of modern technologies. The maintenance of legacy systems is increasingly in demand and must be able to cope with the latest technologies and new customer requirements. The reuse of artifacts from legacy systems for new developments is very significant and vital for the software industry. The architectures of legacy systems are subject to constant changes, whose project documentation is often incomplete, inconsistent, and outdated. These documents contain insufficient information about the internal structure of the systems. Often, only the source code provides reliable information about the structure of legacy systems. Extracting artifacts from source code of legacy systems supports program understanding, maintenance, refactoring, reverse engineering, post-documentation, and reengineering methods. The goal of this dissertation is to extract design information from legacy systems, with a focus on the recovery of architectural patterns. Architectural patterns are key elements to extract architectural decisions from source code of legacy systems. The use of patterns in application development is generally considered quality-enhancing and reduces development time and costs. In the past, different methods have been developed to recognize patterns in legacy systems. These techniques recognize patterns with varying accuracy, as the same pattern is specified and implemented differently. The solution approach of this dissertation is based on customizable and reusable feature types that use static and dynamic parameters to define variable patterns. Each feature type uses a selectable search technique (SQL queries, regular expressions, or source code parser) to identify a specific feature of a pattern in the source code. In particular, for the recognition of different variants of a pattern, static, dynamic, and semantic analyses are used in the developed procedure. The use of different search techniques increases the accuracy of pattern recognition in various software systems. In addition, a new semantics for annotations in the source code of existing software systems was developed, which increases the efficiency of pattern recognition. A prototypical implementation of the approach, called UDDPRT, was used to recognize different patterns in software systems of different programming languages (JAVA, C/C++, C#). UDDPRT allows the user to adapt the pattern recognition. All queries and their interaction are configurable and enable the recognition of new and modified patterns. Extensive experiments were conducted with various open-source software systems, and the results obtained were compared with those of other approaches. It was possible to show a significant increase in accuracy in the developed procedure compared to existing approaches.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116522-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4488209-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4546895-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4560829-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4225989-7>
War and the Fall of Language ¤ Despite a long tradition of intellectual history of the limitation and control of violence, war is obviously a 'successful concept' that repeatedly prevails as an interaction against other options of action. In contrast to conventional approaches of war cause research, conflict theories, and also philosophical positions, the thesis is represented that war uses itself as the 'Urschrift' of a betrayal, an abuse, and an extinction of language. With its own semantics and syntax, it crosses forms of law and peace. Its dynamics unfold in various pendulum movements, its matrix inaugurates a martial order as a culture of war, and its diabolism causes war as the 'Urschrift' to leave its traces in the victim and destroy the social conditional of peace	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033114-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056449-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4196468-8>
Social Power in the Science Game: Social Scientists and Women Researchers at the University ¤ How do aspiring female researchers establish themselves in the university world? How do they interpret their environment? With a special focus on the social costs of women from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds, it is shown how the female researchers equipped with different economic, cultural, and social capital pursue various "career strategies." Through "doing gender," "doing class," and their participation in the competition game, they reproduce and change the power relations in the scientific field. - Table of Contents: 1.

Diplomatic Asylum : Admissibility and Limits ¤ The question of the admissibility of diplomatic asylum, that is, the question of whether an embassy is allowed to grant asylum, is in a state of tension between the protection of persecuted individuals and the principles of international law of respect for the territorial sovereignty of the receiving state and the prohibition of intervention. After a thorough elaboration of customary and treaty law, a justification of diplomatic asylum is examined within the framework of general justification institutes. Subsequently, the author deals with the question of whether the assumption of a human rights obligation leads to permission to grant diplomatic asylum.

Cooperative and Consensual Structures in Standardization ¤ The "cooperative state" attempts to cope with its expansively grown tasks by integrating private individuals into state functions. In this context, individuals and associations are also and particularly involved in various forms of standardization. Thus, the state transfers entire regulatory areas partially or entirely to private hands and retains responsibility to varying degrees. This observation prompts Florian Becker to conduct a comprehensive constitutional law investigation of such cooperative and consensual structures in standardization, thereby linking from a constitutional law perspective to the discussion of the phenomenon of cooperative statehood. Florian Becker was born in 1971; studied law in Bonn; 1997 promotion; 1997 Master of Laws, University of Cambridge; 2004 habilitation, currently Professor at the Aberdeen University Law School.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006092-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134791-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055896-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062801-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020682-8>
Simulation of Diurnal and Seasonal Plankton Dynamics in Coastal Waters ¤ The objective of this work was the development of a new ecosystem model to test and further develop the biogeochemical process description in the pelagic part of the European Reagional Seas Ecosystem Models (ERSEM) based on a comprehensive dataset from several mesocosm experiments. In particular, the description of primary production with regard to photosynthesis, chlorophyll and nutrient dynamics as well as the destructive dynamics considering free and suspended particle-associated bacteria and a dynamically varying substrate quality was reformulated. The comparison between the mesocosm measurement data and the simulation results shows that the new model is able to accurately depict the observed dynamics of chlorophyll and the particulate fractions of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus as well as the dissolved inorganic nutrients under different light, temperature and nutrient regimes in most cases both qualitatively and quantitatively.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046229-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073860-7>
The Patenting of Embryonic Stem Cells ¤ The work deals with the issue of the patentability of embryonic stem cells, in particular in the context of the 2011 Brüstle judgment of the ECJ. In addition to a detailed analysis of the relevant legal regulations, the problem is examined primarily from the aspect of the interactions between public-law use prohibitions and patent prohibitions. It is highlighted that patent prohibitions are necessarily bound to the requirements of public law and that setting up one's own evaluation criteria for the patented technology outside the requirements of public law, as done by the European Patent Office, the Biotechnology Directive, and the ECJ, is not permissible. Solution approaches present the patent prohibitions in the light of the examined interactions and bring them closer to the requirements of public law. In view of the patentability of embryonic stem cells, the work comes to differentiated results	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017894-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4699648-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115712-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044884-8>
The Author's and Personality Rights Assessment of the First Publication of Personal Records ¤ The crux of the first publication of personal records lies in the diverse interests that shape them. These are primarily personal, but also of scientific-historical and public nature. They move on a narrow tightrope between two different legal protection mechanisms, copyright and general personality rights. The question of whether and under what circumstances the author's first publication right of personal records can be restricted is of high practical relevance and has already been the subject of various court decisions. Besides private individuals, libraries, archives, and publishers are particularly affected. The work illuminates the underlying problem areas and proposes a differentiated justified balancing solution in the result, which also takes into account the latest case law of the ECHR. It is not only of interest to copyright lawyers, but due to the interdisciplinary approach, of interest to legally interested individuals of all disciplines. The author is the managing director of the Institute for Intellectual Property, Competition and Media Law (IGEWeM) at the Technical University of Dresden, which deals with questions of copyright and personality rights in the framework of numerous research projects.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187925-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274918-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062127-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134791-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045245-1>
Advanced real-time manipulation of video streams ¤ Diminished Reality is a new fascinating technology that enables the removal of real content from live camera images. Live video manipulation removes real objects and generates a coherent video stream in real-time. The viewers cannot detect any manipulation. Existing approaches are limited to moving objects and static or largely static cameras and do not allow real-time manipulation of video content. In this work, an innovative approach is presented that enables the removal of objects at any camera movements. It is primarily necessary to solve two challenges. On the one hand, a picture inpainting method is needed that can be applied to each camera image within a few milliseconds and delivers high-quality results. On the other hand, a picture-to-picture coherence must be created without using past or future camera images. In this work, a new and powerful selection strategy is presented that is based on so-called fingerprints, so that unwanted content can be determined on heterogeneous backgrounds. The inpainting approach was developed from existing randomized approaches and procedures with multiple image layers. High-quality results can be generated in real-time by applying a unique initialization strategy and a new cost function that minimizes coherence deviation. The cost function combines spatial and appearance-based costs. The approach based on homography generates a picture-to-picture coherence when removing objects, mainly in front of flat backgrounds, and supports camera rotations around the object to be removed. Although the approach is about two orders of magnitude faster than current comparable inpainting approaches, it shows that it generates qualitatively equivalent or better results for known test images. A first test with users shows that video manipulations performed with this approach are hardly recognizable for test persons, even if they are aware of the manipulation possibilities. Based on these results, the approach presented in this work opens up a wealth of new possibilities for interactive and real-time manipulations that can be used in TV and film production as well as in advertising.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1063387248> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4150999-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4614855-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145435-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4715802-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151002-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037348-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4401858-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4536854-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078895-7>
School after Parsons: On the Way to a Normative-Functionalistic Theory of Education ¤ Although Talcott Parsons' theory of education is frequently referred to, its systematic treatment has been lacking so far. This gap is filled by the present monograph. It combines Parsons' general sociological theory and his sociology of education, formulates the subject and claim of educational theory, and places Parsons in the context of functionalistic theories of education (Fend, Dreeben, hidden curriculum). Finally, it sketches a normative-functionalistic theory of education based on Parsons and developed with a view to the current school and current educational research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180212-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075806-0>
Strategy-oriented Personnel Development in Cooperative Banks: An Empirical Investigation into Vocational Training ¤ Successful banks require clear personnel strategies that also understand personnel development (PE) as a comprehensive model – although there is no PE concept or PE strategy. Each cooperative bank is called upon to develop its own strategy and concept. Elke Schax first presents a model of strategy-oriented PE, taking into account vocational training in particular. Based on this theoretical framework, she examines the practice in cooperative banks using over 1300 VR banks – with a return rate of 31.20%. The causes and effects analyses of PE and the question of whether personnel development is carried out systematically, conceptually, and future-oriented are at the center of the work. The author concludes that the focus of personnel development is on vocational training, with this being clearly stronger for smaller institutions. Only a few VR banks have a PE strategy; although nearly a third shows development readiness. Structural changes and mergers favor a strategy-oriented personnel development.

Development and Verification of a Model for Long-term Use of Smart Meters: A Three-Wave Panel Study ¤ The goal of this dissertation is the exploration of determinants of short-term and long-term use of smart meters and related products. This is based on the Rubikon model, as well as results from technology acceptance research and environmental psychological research on energy use and lifestyles. On this basis, the own research model LIMA (Longterm Intelligent Metering Adoption) is developed. Within the RESIDENS project, the required data is recorded with the help of a panel design with three waves. During data collection, a method mix is used to capture objective and subjective data. The verification of the measurement models and the LIMA model is carried out with the help of structural equation models and path analyses. With small adjustments, the models describe the empirical data relatively well. Overall, the study results show that smart metering and related products are accepted by a part of the population both at the current state of the art and in a future scenario with automated control of household appliances. This part of the population are the innovators, who use new technologies first.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136749-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062644-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000996-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014733-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7703133-7>
Functional Damage Assessment ¤ Disputes over company values are increasing. Although the IDW S 1 valuation has become the sole approach used by German courts for decision-making, numerous objections have been raised against it. Furthermore, the terminology used by the judiciary in this context mixes various valuation procedures in an unsuitable way. As a lawyer, Jörg Wasmuth examines the shortcomings of the judiciary using the civil procedural knowledge procedure. As an economist, he shows that the functional valuation theory is capable of providing well-founded company values that are needed for the parties' procedural involvement and should also serve as a basis for the courts' decisions. The content: Field of tension between case law and company valuation Foundations of civil procedural law and functional company valuation Damage assessment according to case law and from a functional perspective Adaptation of the main functions of valuation to the civil procedure The target groups: Students and lecturers of economics and law with a focus on M&A and company valuation Company valuers, auditors, lawyers, and judges, board members and supervisory board members The author Dr. Jörg Wasmuth (full lawyer, diploma in business administration) is a research assistant at the chair of business administration, particularly auditing, under the direction of Prof. Dr. Gerrit Brösel at the FernUniversität in Hagen and was promoted there.

A Direct Calculation Method for Docking Processes ¤ BEGIN Abstract: The shift from standard ships to technologically highly complex special ships poses great challenges for many European shipyards. This work deals with the fundamental challenge of docking, which decides whether to enter the competition for a new project. A numerical calculation method is presented, which calculates docking processes quickly and efficiently. Within the calculations, the ship and dock are modeled as beams, which are coupled by nonlinear interaction forces. The resulting beam lines and the lifting levers due to the load distribution within the nonlinear panel elements are taken into account in the hydrostatic calculations. Subsequently, applications from practice are presented. Extensive measurements were taken at the Marine Arsenal in Wilhelmshaven and compared with the results of the calculation method. In addition, docking processes were carried out at the Pella Sietas shipyard, which had previously been calculated with the presented method. Furthermore, a capsizing accident during docking was recalculated. The applications demonstrate that the developed method is a reliable and effective tool for successful docking.

Alternative Dispute Resolution after a Positive Pattern Injunction Judgment: An Investigation with Special Consideration of Mass Damages ¤ The pattern injunction lawsuit introduced in response to the VW emissions scandal ends with a judgment that does not set any concrete performance claims. Consumers must then file a further lawsuit for performance. The author deals with the question of whether the phase structured as a performance lawsuit cannot be replaced by methods of alternative dispute resolution. In the investigation, he devotes himself to typical obstacles to agreement before and after the pattern injunction judgment, typical comparison contents in mass damage cases, and orders the instruments of alternative dispute resolution as an action option. Finally, the author deals with the design of a concrete AS procedure for comparative settlement of mass damage cases.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139832-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4284136-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1194111912> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1258722844>
Studies on the Use of Polyelectrolytes and Polymer Mediators in Organic Electrochemical Synthesis ¤ In connection with the separation problem arising from the use of electrolytes and mediators, the applicability of soluble polyelectrolytes and polymer mediators was investigated. By means of the TEMPO-mediated conversion of alcohols to carbonyl compounds as a model reaction, it was demonstrated that polymethacrylates can efficiently fulfill their purpose. The alcohol oxidation is also highly efficient on a preparative scale, where the polymer-based approach enables the separation of mediator and electrolyte in a single membrane filtration step.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151767-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175165-6>
Power without Rifles: The Development Dynamics of Social Institutions in China ¤ Mengyue Liu examines the relationship between cultural, political, and social institutions in China over the past 30 years. He shows that Guanxi as a social institution embodies a „power without rifles“, which, in interaction with the cultural tradition of familism and Confucianism on the one hand and the changing state-political framework conditions on the other hand, has made and continues to make a significant contribution to the political and economic changes in China.

Time to turn : Wind energy installations from a monument conservation perspective ¤ Approximately 30,000 wind energy installations between the North Sea and the Alps unmistakably show that our energy system is undergoing a comprehensive transformation. Everywhere, this development is met with a broad and controversial reception, and in monument conservation, wind energy installations are still predominantly perceived as a disturbance due to their sometimes significant impact on the landscape. This work, on the other hand, takes a historical development into account and advocates for wind energy installations to be understood as significant cultural heritage. In view of the progress of the energy transition, it is assumed that older models, as physical witnesses of extensive energy policy changes since the 1970s, can be assigned a high importance. Therefore, the goal is to identify wind energy installations that can be evaluated as outstanding witnesses to the development of wind energy use in Germany. To approach this, these are first typologically distinguished as a subject of investigation. A significant peculiarity of wind energy installations is that they have significant visual effects on the landscape in relation to the actual land use through their vertical structure. Subsequently, the development of wind energy use since the 1970s is examined in more detail, which as a whole did not proceed linearly and was characterized by many conflicts. This must be understood in the context of growing environmental awareness, which had far-reaching energy policy changes as a consequence. On this basis, wind energy installations are finally identified in a monument conservation series investigation, which in an outstanding way testify to the development. The selection, however, remains relatively limited with six objects in relation to the total stock of approximately 30,000 installations, because the established monument understanding, which is aimed at the demarcation of peculiarities, comes up against a limit when dealing with a temporally dense stock of identical buildings. Finally, possible preservation perspectives as well as monument theoretical and practical conclusions are discussed. It is undoubtedly necessary to preserve the original location, where in each individual case it must be decided whether the interests of functional or material preservation are to be given greater weight. The outlined selection problems also prompt a discussion of additional conceivable evaluation categories, where in particular social perception and ecological values are pressing. Furthermore, it can be pleaded for a stronger consideration of functional relationships when examining technical infrastructure in monument conservation. In total, the monument conservation engagement with wind energy installations goes far beyond the identification of individual objects and impressively draws attention to current challenges in monument conservation and beyond.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033560-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034343-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127665-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011455-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079329-1>
The United Nations in the Framework of International Organizations: A Juridical Examination ¤ The work analyzes the significance of the organization of the United Nations and the underlying Charter in the law of international organizations. It examines the legal status of the United Nations in relation to other international organizations and shows whether and to what extent other international organizations are bound by the law of the United Nations. For this purpose, the author identifies the essential characteristics of international organizations that determine their relationship with each other. He explains that international organizations are generally equal and autonomous entities that stand side by side. Finally, he thoroughly justifies that the United Nations should be attributed a legally effective priority over other international organizations. In doing so, he shows that other international organizations are obliged to take at least the law of the United Nations into account when exercising their powers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027366-0>

Deficits of Resumption of Proceedings in Criminal Matters. Stocktaking and Proposals for Reforms Based on an Empirical Investigation ¤ The correction of a criminal law error judgment is incumbent upon the resumption of proceedings law, as per sections 359 ff. StPO, which is intended to be the instrument for correcting final decisions and bringing about material justice. The peace resulting from the finality of the judgment should only be broken if, in the case of the maintenance of an erroneous decision, justice would be significantly impaired in the individual case. -- The thesis analyses the law of resumption of proceedings from the standpoint of legal dogma and submits – also based on the author’s own empirical investigation – proposals for reforms to eliminate deficits found. Besides that, the remedy is presented and classified in the context of the legal remedies. In addition, the constitutional reference to resumption is examined. Based on the investigation carried out, it is shown that applicable law is ineffective in its practical handling. / »Deficits of Resumption of Proceedings in Criminal Matters.

The Art of Criticism : The Genre History of the Review from the Late Enlightenment to Romanticism ¤ Reviews have so far been mainly tools, hardly a subject of literary research. There is general consensus that the reviews of the late 18th century go far beyond the status of secondary that is usually attributed to the genre. The present investigation therefore consistently puts the genre aspect in the foreground and at the same time considers the embedding of the reviews in the medium of the journal. The genre history of the review, which the author thus outlines, enables a new understanding of the canonical reviews of the late 18th century (Schiller's Citizen Review, A. W. Schlegel's reviews in the ALZ, the reviews in the Athenaeum), it also contributes to the expansion of this canon and opens up new perspectives on the development of critical prose in German language	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035949-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003524-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049712-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050491-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035964-5>
Fuzzy-Logic Filter for the Global Atmosphere Watch Programme: Development of Database-Supported Filter Functions for the Identification of Air Mass Influences in the Measurement Series of the Global Station Zugspitze ¤ The Global Atmosphere Watch programme of the World Meteorological Organisation aims at the continuous observation of the atmospheric background and its changes. For the European region, this observation is carried out at the Global Station Zugspitze, which, despite its location, occasionally experiences disturbances due to local effects. In this work, filter rules are developed for the Zugspitze measurement series, which are a prerequisite for a representative description of the atmospheric background. The filters are based on a series analysis and take into account air mass influences due to vertical transports from the ground layer and through stratospheric intrusions. As filter parameters, atmospheric and meteorological measurement data, 3D backward trajectories, and emission inventories are used. The methodical implementation of the filter functions is carried out with the Fuzzy-Logic model representation. In addition, the associated database-supported software tool is described.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169536-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4341284-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169543-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4212391-4>
Role of non-neuronal cells in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) : transgenic neuron-glia-co-cultures as in vitro model for the evaluation of novel therapeutic strategies ¤ Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, motor neurons, therapy. - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe neurodegenerative disease that leads to rapid progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the primary motor cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. Patients develop progressive paresis and muscle atrophy and usually die 3 to 5 years after onset of the disease due to respiratory failure. An effective neuroprotective treatment does not exist so far. In a part of the patients suffering from familial ALS, mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) can be identified; overexpression of the mutated SOD1 led to the development of the currently most widely used and best characterized ALS mouse model. The loss of motor neurons in ALS is non-cell-autonomous, i.e., dependent on the interaction with surrounding glial cells. In the framework of the presented work, a cell culture system consisting of non-transgenic or G93ASOD1 transgenic motor neurons, each co-cultivated with either non-transgenic or G93ASOD1 transgenic astrocytes, was established as an ALS in vitro model. In this model, the neuroprotective potential of N-ac-GLP-1, an analog of the endogenous insulinotropic peptide glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), was tested. The observed protective effects could be attributed to a reduction of intracellular calcium transients. Not only due to this in vitro measured anti-excitotoxic effect, but also in view of the growing knowledge about metabolic deficits in ALS, which could be positively influenced by N-ac-GLP-1, this substance represents an interesting ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184118-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132340-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135747-4>

Subtrees search, cycle spectra and edge-connectivity structures ¤ In the first part of this dissertation, we investigate subtrees of a tree $T$ with given vertex weights $c: V(T) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$. We introduce an overload-discharge method, and show that there is always a subtree $S$ whose weight $c(S) := \\sum_ {v \\in V (S)} c(v)$ is close to $\\frac{c(T)}{2}$. The smaller the weight $c(T)$ of $T$ is, the smaller the difference between $c(S)$ and $\\frac{c(T)}{2}$ is, which we can ensure. We also show that such a subtree can be computed efficiently, namely in linear time. Using this method, we prove that every planar Hamiltonian graph $G = (V(G), E(G))$ with minimum degree $\\delta \\geq 4$ contains a cycle of length $k$ for every $k \\in \\{\\lfloor \\frac{|V(G)|}{2} \\rfloor, \\dots, \\lceil \\frac{|V(G)|}{2} \\rceil + 3\\}$ with $3 \\leq k \\leq |V (G)|$. This can be computed in linear time, provided a Hamiltonian cycle of the graph is known. In the second part of the dissertation, we present three cut-trees of a graph, each of which provides insight into the edge connectivity structure of the graph. All three cut-trees have in common that they cover a certain binary symmetric irreflexive relation on the vertex set of the graph; the trees can be viewed as generalizations of Gomory-Hu trees. The cut-trees imply the following statements: (i) Every simple graph $G$ that satisfies $\\delta \\geq 5$ or edge connectivity $\\lambda \\geq 4$ or vertex connectivity $\\kappa \\geq 3$ contains at least $\\frac{1}{24} \\delta |V(G)|$ connected pairs, where a pair of vertices $\\{v, w \\}$ is connected if $\\lambda_G (v, w) = \\min \\{d_G(v), d_G(w)\\}$. (ii) Every simple graph $G$ with $\\delta > 0$ has $O(|V (G)| / \\delta)$ $\\delta$-edge-connected components, and only $O(|V (G)|)$ edges remain when these components are contracted. (iii) For every simple graph $G$ with $\\delta > 0$, vertex sets can be computed efficiently such that all non-trivial minimal cuts are preserved, and $O(|V(G)| / \\delta)$ vertices and $O(|V(G)|)$ edges remain when these vertex sets are contracted.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4747042-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4504638-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4705154-1>
Data-based market power in European merger control: Harm theories, relief measures, safeguard mechanisms ¤ Data is the core of Internet-based business models. Ever since Facebook took over WhatsApp, European antitrust law has been faced with the question of how to deal with mergers, especially those involving the well-known Internet giants ("FANG"). Under what circumstances can market power be based as a prohibition criterion on the possession of and access to data? What competitive effects of data-based market power are to be feared in horizontal, vertical and conglomerate mergers? How can any commitments remedy this form of market power?

The use of the alpha2-agonist xylazine (Rompun®) in a multimodal analgesic protocol for orthopaedic intervention in lateral recumbency on a surgical tipping table in dairy cows ¤ Xylazine, lateral recumbency, orthopedic treatment. - Recently, members of the European College of Veterinary Anaesthesiology have demanded a preventive administration of sedatives when fixing dairy cows for orthopedic hoof treatment in lateral recumbency (SL) on the hoof tipping table to avoid or at least reduce stress in the animals. The aim of this work was to investigate whether the alpha2-agonist xylazine, a sedative and analgesic, enhances the cardio-respiratory depression when bringing cows into lateral recumbency for orthopedic treatment (Study 1) and whether xylazine reduces the hormonally-metabolic (Study 1 and 2) and stress response in behavior (Study 2) of cows when brought into lateral recumbency, as well as improves the analgesia of a local anesthetic for orthopedic treatment (Study 2). Study 1 An experimental blind study was conducted with six healthy, non-pregnant, non-lactating dairy cows of the Holstein Friesian breed (610±87.9 kg; 4.3±3.3 years) in a cross-over design with two weeks between the experiments. The animals were assigned to three groups. A) Xylazine (Rompun®) at a dose of 0.05 mg kg-1 or B) an equivalent amount of sterile, isotonic saline solution (Placebo) intramuscularly 15 minutes before bringing the animals into lateral recumbency (30 min.) on the hoof tipping table or C) xylazine at the same dose without further manipulation of the animal. A catheter was placed in the A. auricularis caudalis for invasive measurement of arterial blood pressure and withdrawal of arterial blood, as well as a venous infusion catheter in the ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169916-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180607-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075710-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140478-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4601321-0>
Contribution to the Improvement of Electrical and Thermal Utilization [of Power Semiconductor Switches] ¤ System integration is a driving factor in the development of power electronic systems. In addition to increasing power density and reliability, the protection of power semiconductors is an important criterion in the technical implementation of circuit topologies. The reverse recovery temperature is a crucial operating parameter in addition to maintaining voltage limits and dynamic limits. The current state of the art in the industrial implementation of thermal protection concepts in inverters is that the utilization of the temperature dependence of component parameters or the measurement of average heat sink temperatures is not yet a direct, delay-free measurement of the temporal reverse recovery temperature curves in standard modules. Starting from the approach of model implementation in microcontrollers, the topic of online determination of the time-varying reverse recovery temperature of power semiconductor components in inverter operation is presented in the submitted work. The electrical and thermal modeling was technically implemented for single- and multi-chip arrangements, and the accuracy was investigated for different load forms and cycles. The protection of power semiconductors by the online-simulated parameter reverse recovery temperature was implemented for regulation and control in inverters. Starting from the approach of improving electrical utilization, the second goal of this work was the theoretical and experimental investigation of methods and variants of protection of power semiconductor switches against periodic and non-periodic overvoltages. The focus was on the exploration of the possibilities and limitations of the Active Voltage Clamping procedure for switches with high-voltage IGBTs. In the work, solution variants and basic procedures for IGBT switches up to a rated blocking voltage of 3.5 kV were developed, analyzed, and applied in individual switches and various inverter topologies. In experimental investigations, aspects of realizability, derating, and snubber requirements of Active Clamping for series and parallel cascading of IGBTs were developed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167286-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059427-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4500754-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186778-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035235-3>
The Performance of German Government Bonds: Construction of a Historical Yield Index from 1870 to 1959 ¤ In this book, the long-term historical development of German long-term government bonds from 1870 to 1959 is investigated. By linking the determined performance with the existing time series of the same conception, as well as the subsequent development up to 2017, the results - especially in the context of company valuation - can be used for the determination of the historical excess return of the stock market. The historical peculiarities in the investigation period, especially the stock exchange closure during World War I, as well as the periods of partial value destruction, are taken into account in such a way that it can be assumed from the perspective of an investor of the time that the determined index performance can be replicated.

Transfer and Extension of the Concept of the Virtual Coordinate Measuring Device to New Metrological Applications at the Example of the Planck Balance ¤ The determination of the measurement uncertainty is a central aspect of every metrological task. With advancing digitalization and increasingly complex measurements, measurement uncertainties are increasingly determined in a simulation. The corresponding simulation software is developed over years or even decades together with the experiment. In order to design this process as efficiently and sustainably as possible, a systematic approach is required for the implementation of physical relationships in a simulation software. For this purpose, the concepts of an established simulation software for determining measurement uncertainties are generalized and transferred to new metrological tasks in this work. As a starting point, the VCMM – the Virtual Coordinate Measuring Device – is used. In order to understand how the VCMM is structured and what its concept is based on, it is implemented from scratch. In this process, the approaches of model building of the VCMMs are recognized and generalized. Accordingly, the entire measurement process is simulated. Furthermore, a software structure is developed, with which comparable simulation software can be built. In order to finally implement the physical models of a measurement into software, a supporting software library is developed. It contains the recurring components of a Monte-Carlo-based simulation software and helps with the implementation of the software structure. To illustrate the developed approach, the Planck balance is considered as the first application example. A simulation software for determining the measurement uncertainties at the Planck balance is created. The software is modularly structured and offers versatile analysis options that provide insight into the physical relationships of the measurement. The creation of simulation software for further metrological applications is carried out equivalently.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4584230-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210374-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4192228-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4240945-7>
The Protection of Especially Sensitive Witnesses through the Use of Video Technology under Special Consideration of the Rights of the Accused and Trial Principles ¤ Main description: The witness is a procedural subject, not just a piece of evidence. Nevertheless, the protection of the witness in the criminal procedure has only been in the focus of legislative reforms in the last two decades. The introduction of the use of video technology in the criminal procedure, namely the recording of the interrogation according to § 58a StPO and its presentation in the main hearing according to § 255a StPO as well as the simultaneous transmission according to §§ 168e and 247a StPO, is intended to reduce the burdens to which the witness is exposed in the criminal procedure. Kirstin Maaß works out the burden experience of so-called especially sensitive witnesses and presents existing legal measures for witness protection. Furthermore, she deals with the concrete benefit of the use of video technology in the criminal procedure. A focus of the work is her detailed examination of the application conditions of the use of video technology (§§ 58a, 168e StPO) and its use in the main hearing (§ 255a StPO). In this context, Kirstin Maaß fundamentally illuminates the rights of the accused and the consequences that arise for them from the use of video technology. Furthermore, she examines the prerequisites for simultaneous transmission according to § 247a StPO. Finally, the author raises the fundamental question of whether the regulations on the use of video technology are compatible with the rights of the accused, in particular the right to confrontation, and with the principles of the criminal procedure, and subjects them to a comprehensive content clarification.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176071-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188222-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4456298-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116634-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048737-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144883-2>
Fight for Free Speech : On the Semantics of Press Freedom and Censorship in German and French Charlie Debates (2015-2017) ¤ After the attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo on January 7, 2015, to which two self-proclaimed Islamist attackers claimed responsibility, debates on press freedom and censorship emerged in French and German media. These debates were linked to complexes of themes in which solidarity and belonging debates were conducted on a national and European level. This research work examines German and French press products from 2015 to 2017 and asks about the two terms press freedom and censorship in public debates. The author follows the cognitive maps constructed using the terms and investigates how they are instrumentalized as political action derivations. Current debates on European self- and foreign groups are thus made readable in the context of the attacks.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067601-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049716-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047160-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043152-6>
Postcolonial Perspectives on "weltwärts" : a Volunteer Service with a Cosmopolitan Intent ¤ Through the weltwärts volunteer service, it should be made possible to make a „personal contribution to a just world“. But what conceptions are associated with this service, which moves in a political context shaped by unequal power relations? Using postcolonial and feminist theories, the author examines the representations and program structures. She asks about their colonial legacy and benefits for the participants. In the focus of the discourse analysis stands the critical confrontation with concepts of development in connection with those of a cosmopolitanism, which is considered as a pedagogical answer to globalization questions. The study shows the entanglement of colonial history and the present of development policy engagement. It highlights how necessary it is to throw a power-critical perspective on programs of this kind, in order to not reproduce but change global societal power relations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4198756-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014948-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013673-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4566658-1>
Combined Imaging FT-IR and MALDI-TOF-MS : high-resolution analysis of plant surfaces ¤ Leaf waxes cover the outermost surface of all above-ground plants and have been described in terms of their morphology and composition for many species. These waxes control the water balance of the plant, act as a reaction barrier against pollutants, and influence the adhesion of parasites and pathogens, thereby making a significant contribution to plant fitness. The goal of this work was the development of a surface analysis using combined imaging infrared spectroscopy (IR) and imaging MALDI mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) for high-resolution examination of leaf surfaces. The combination of both analysis methods allows for the examination of individual structures as well as complete substance classes, even in unknown sample compositions. For this, a selective method for isolating epicuticular waxes while preserving their distribution and structure on the leaf surface, as well as a suitable sample carrier, had to be developed. Using the developed surface analysis, previously unknown, high-molecular esters in the epicuticular wax of the cherry laurel could be identified and characterized, and their distribution and dynamic development during leaf growth could be investigated. The comparison of untreated leaf surfaces with samples after simple mechanical injury or fungal infection showed the occurrence of surface foreign compounds due to defense or wound healing processes of the plant. The use of the developed surface analysis enables the observation of local differences in the qualitative and quantitative composition of the leaf surface in response to various external influences and thus provides more insight into plant regulatory processes, interactions with the environment, and possible defense reactions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178462-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135411-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172243-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4586449-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210448-8>
Paradigm Shift as a Field of Structural Learning : Consequences for the Development of Learning Cultures in the Transformation Society ¤ The analysis of the structural differences between reproductive and reflexive teaching and learning is enlightening and generates new perspectives.

The Preventive Restructuring Framework: European Requirements and Implementation Options for EU Member States ¤ The preventive restructuring framework will have significant impacts on existing German insolvency and restructuring law, depending on its design. The work comprehensively analyzes the mandatory requirements of Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of 20 June 2019, which the German legislator must implement by 17 July 2022 at the latest, presents the remaining implementation options, highlights inconsistencies, and provides incentives for implementation in German law. The work thus provides an orientation aid for further discussion of the implementation of this framework and is also highly enlightening for a later directive-compliant interpretation of German law based on the EU directive.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4451062-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170174-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072844-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078612-2>
Soft skills, hard skills, individual innovativeness, and migration : evidence from Indonesia ¤ The human being has different roles in the social and economic context. In the social context, individuals exist in a family, in society, and in a nation. They have social capital here. From an economic point of view, individuals also have human capital in a family, in a company, and in a broader organization or institution at the local, regional, or international level. Furthermore, human capital plays a role on the macroeconomic level for the comparative advantage among the nations of the world (Benhabib and Spiegel 1994). Better human capital can contribute to social and economic development in an appropriate manner. Employees can drive innovation and fixed performance. They use their knowledge, skills, experience, and network for their daily tasks. Their knowledge and skills can be developed through education, training, and interactions (Blundell et al., 1999). Individuals learn from each other through knowledge transfer (knowledge transfer), but always depending on their individual absorptive capacity. Innovation is the process of creating a new product or a new service, either with new methods or new technologies, which are eventually accepted by some customers in the market. The novelty of the products or services can be incremental or radical. In general, innovations affect the entire management function in an organization. It is connected with research and development activities, production and business processes, financial management, human capital, and management as well as marketing management. Each function should provide and propose new methods to support the innovation process.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7588126-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027089-0>
Time-dependent transport through quantum dots coupled to normal and superconducting leads ¤ This work investigates properties of quantum dots coupled to normal and superconducting leads. Depending on the situation, either single particle wave functions are propagated in time or the large time behaviour of the nonequilibrium Green’s functions is calculated. Our actual study starts with analysing simulations of the Josephson effects and the subharmonic gap structure. The investigation of the spectral function yields a time-resolved picture of the density of states illustrating the processes inside the quantum dot. Next, our basic model is expanded by coupling a vibration in the Ehrenfest approximation to the quantum dot. The stability as well as resonances are studied. Finally, optimization algorithms are employed to tailor the bias such that an objective function depending on observables is minimized.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185932-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4263396-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184140-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022993-2>
Reconstruction of Paleoproductivity using Sr/Ca Ratios and Organic-Geochemical Biomarkers ¤ This thesis summarizes the results of inorganic and organic geochemical investigations of Late Quaternary deep sea sediments from the Western Equatorial Pacific. The samples with a maximum geological age of about 360 000 years were taken during The International Marine Past Global Change Study (IMAGES). The sedimentation in the Caroline Basin is strongly influenced by the oceanographic conditions of the Western Pacific Warm Pool. The investigation area is the largest warm water body in the global ocean with an average sea surface temperature of 29°C. Furthermore, the region is characterized by a low primary productivity dominated by carbonate producing microalgae. Element parameters as well as the amount of organic biomarkers and inorganic proxies like Sr/Ca ratios are used to reconstruct paleoclimatic and paleoproductivity conditions in this area.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4425928-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4261539-2>
Social Group Work as an Alternative to Closed Accommodation of Juvenile Offenders: The Example of the Hanseatic City of Hamburg ¤ The starting point of this book was a social policy decision in Hamburg, which can be described as disheartening. On July 2, 2002, the Hamburg Senator for Social Affairs and Family announces the reintroduction of closed accommodation for children. Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony, and Bavaria are also considering similar measures. This book reflects the socio-political and social work relevance of the topics of closed accommodation and social group work. A differentiated engagement with the public discussion on closed accommodation and the presentation of different concepts of restrictive measures round off the topic. The central concern of the work, however, is the question of whether social group work can be an alternative form of closed accommodation for juvenile offenders. In this way, a positive effect of social group work is highlighted, which is supported by corresponding studies and makes closed accommodation seem unnecessary.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033178-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4237936-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125344-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4181929-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148952-4>
Experimental and Numerical Investigation of Flow in Pumps with Small Specific Speed Considering the Roughness Influence ¤ In industrial pumps with small specific speed, significant deviations from reality occur in flow simulations. As essential reasons, the faulty modeling of wall boundary layers with the logarithmic wall law and the neglect of the effect of hydraulically rough walls are identified in this work. An improved method is developed and validated using measurements (including wall shear stress). The flow field of a test pump is analyzed and essential phenomena as well as loss sources are worked out.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4690080-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047843-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128988-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053363-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058076-3>

It provides a 'toolbox' that delivers relevant information for various decision-making and evaluation purposes. The presented optimization model builds on existing information structures in companies and enables companies to precisely assess the consequences of their decisions. The model includes the integration of environmental levies, emissions trading, the possibility of recycling and the reuse of resources, emissions limits, and limiting environmental damage, which covers almost all relevant aspects for production planning that include corporate environmental impacts. The work provides a comprehensive overview of environmental cost management issues and is therefore of equal interest to both scientists and practitioners.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4361327-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201709-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4323274-7>
Authentication in ad-hoc and sensor networks ¤ In the near future, ad-hoc and sensor networks will become an increasingly integral part of our daily lives. However, they could become a danger if security aspects are not taken into account from the beginning. Authentication is a key aspect for secure protocols and secure applications. Therefore, authentication in ad-hoc networks is treated as a cross-cutting theme in this work. The security problems of ad-hoc and sensor networks differ significantly from those of conventional networks. Therefore, corresponding protocols must be designed. This work first provides an overview of various authentication methods and analyzes their suitability for ad-hoc networks. Subsequently, an analysis of the suitability of digital signatures follows. In addition, two new extremely efficient protocols for mutual authentication in such networks are presented, and finally, an application of authentication, component identification, is described.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4674811-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4330656-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4789222-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269037-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4830502-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4709127-7>
Pflichterfüllung : Memories of the Soviet Afghan War in Russia ¤ As the last NATO troops withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021, they left the country to its fate. Similar was achieved by the USSR several decades earlier. Between 1979 and 1989, it intervened with over 600,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, but could not permanently pacify it, which ultimately led to the withdrawal and the fall of the then government. Approximately 15,000 USSR citizens paid the price for the longest war in Soviet history with their lives. Based on this, the study examines on the basis of self-collected life story interviews, how former Soviet war participants in Russia remember the war today, what importance they attribute to it, and as a group, they try to obtain recognition for their efforts from the Russian government and society.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141580-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126218-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1041864515> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188196-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200793-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4204164-8>
The Permitted Trust in Criminal Law : Study on the Dogmatic Function and Foundation of the Trust Principle in Criminal Law ¤ Unlawful behavior is determined by the trust principle when the acting party is responsible for compensating for the other party's misconduct. The application of the principle is therefore of major importance in areas of life where the actor is in constant contact with others, such as in road traffic, medicine, or business. The work deals with the dogmatic function of this criterion in criminal law theory and fundamentally with the question of its foundation in the liberal legal order. This analysis is developed in particular under consideration of the principles of the normative attribution theory assumed in this context. Thus, the application of the trust principle requires the justification of the guarantor position of the trusting party for the compensation of the other party's misconduct. Trust protection must also already be given in the liberal legal order. The question of the trust principle is therefore a fundamental question of criminal law science.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4331643-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7706198-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057795-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4336721-5>

Integrated Order Quantity and Re-processing Planning of Limited Shelf-Life Medical Devices in Hospitals ¤ Steffen Rickers presents an optimization model for the integrated order quantity and re-processing planning of limited shelf-life medical devices in hospitals. The goal of the optimization is to determine a cost-minimal order quantity and re-processing plan that supplies the operating area in a timely manner with sterile medical devices and thus ensures compliance with the operating plan. The optimization includes, in addition to the limited shelf life of sterile medical devices, the capacity constraints of the re-processing and sterilization resources. For the new problem statement, heuristic methods for the efficient solution of the problem are presented and evaluated in the framework of an extensive numerical study. The author Steffen Rickers graduated as a research assistant under Prof. Dr. Stefan Helber at the Institute for Production Economics at the Leibniz University of Hanover. He deals with combinatorial optimization problems and, in particular, problem statements from the field of production and lot size planning with re-processing of returned products.

Homoclinic Bifurcations in Reversible Systems ¤ This work investigates bifurcations of homoclinic solutions in ordinary differential equations. Homoclinic solutions are asymptotic to an equilibrium state in positive and negative time, i.e., to a constant solution of the differential equation. The work considers such homoclinic bifurcations that arise from a change of the type of this associated equilibrium state. Various scenarios are analyzed in the class of reversible differential equations. - The main part of the work deals with homoclines at equilibrium states that branch themselves in a local bifurcation. In this process, the type of the equilibrium state changes from a real saddle (with leading real eigenvalues) to a saddle-center (with a pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues). The interaction of local and global bifurcation effects requires a new treatment: By combining analytical and geometric techniques, a description of branching homoclines is obtained. Both purely reversible systems and systems with additional symmetry and Hamiltonian structure are considered. - In the second part of the work, homoclinic bifurcation phenomena are investigated that arise from a change of the type of the equilibrium state from a real saddle to a complex saddle-focus (with complex leading eigenvalues). It is assumed that there exist two initial homoclines in a so-called bellows configuration (homoclinic bellows configuration). Using an analytical method based on Lin, bifurcation results for branching N-homoclines are obtained. - The general bifurcation results are applied to physical problems in nonlinear optics and water wave theory, as well as to two mathematical model equations and are confirmed in numerical investigations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4327106-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078889-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132783-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020929-5>
Administrative Scope of Assessment in Nature Conservation Law. At the Same Time a Contribution to how Courts and Authorities Handle External Expertise ¤ Administrative Scope of Assessment in Nature Conservation Law. At the Same Time a Contribution to how Courts and Authorities Handle External Expertise -- When dealing with uncertainties that come with the complexity and dynamics of the natural sciences, nature conservation law often relies on the legal concept of the scope of assessment. The public authorities have the right to make the final decision, which reduces judicial control accordingly. The dogmatic principles of the scope of assessment and its importance for nature conservation jurisprudence reveal both conflicts and possible solutions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152817-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120790-7>

The Path of Phenomenology: Husserl, Heidegger, Rombach ¤ This work is intended to show how Descartes' distinction between res cogitans and res extensa, i.e. between 'consciousness' and 'outer world', is to be circumvented and reversed by phenomenology. This distinction, known as the subject-object split, has decisively shaped modern thought. The path of phenomenology continues to strip away further layers and ultimately leads from Descartes to Derrida, who with the neologism différance designates the unity of all distinctions, and not just the one between subject and object. In passing, it can be tested here whether phenomenology is a method that can be applied in an empirical science such as religious studies, whether, therefore, something like 'religious phenomenology' is at all possible.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045660-2>
Strain field and strain engineering in semiconductor nanostructures: coherent X-ray diffraction imaging and analytical studies ¤ Abstract: In specific magneto-optical, electronic materials, such as Ga1-xMnxAs, the electronic and magnetic properties are set by the concentration of the charge carrier determining component, here by Mn. However, changes in the chemical composition also lead to a change in the order of the system. A good way to approach this problem is the use of external electrostatic fields to obtain a doping effect without changing the composition. This approach not only allows the development of new components but can also be used to investigate quantum phenomena, as the ground state in such systems can be controlled. Epitaxial nanostructures are suitable candidates, as they allow the required quantum confinement. An elastic lattice strain due to a lattice mismatch can be used to influence the observed quantum effects. Ga1-xMnxAs is currently of great interest for spintronic components. Due to its strong magnetic anisotropy, the spin polarization can be reversed by a magnetic field or by electrical triggers. However, the anisotropy also causes an asymmetric charge carrier distribution. Ga1-xMnxAs therefore has a complex, anisotropic representation surface for the magnetic energy and thus a variety of easily magnetizable axes	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178309-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4316421-3>
From the 'Turkish Yoke' to 'Germany's Friendship for Turkey': The Transformation of Knowledge about the Ottoman Empire in German History Schoolbooks 1839–1918 ¤ The transformation of the term 'From the Turkish Yoke' to 'Germany's Friendship for Turkey' shows the changed perception of the Ottoman Empire in German history schoolbooks of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The present book provides comprehensive insights into historical schoolbook texts and their representations of 'Turks' and 'Turkey', which have hardly been considered in educational historical research so far. It documents the interplay of self- and foreign images within the pedagogical discourse of the time from a transnational and postcolonial perspective.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4566658-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053458-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006681-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186406-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057329-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020533-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071769-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1209785226> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194747-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033569-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7595654-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006667-8>
Religious Informal Justice ¤ Unlängst häuften sich Meldungen über eine sogenannte »islamische Paralleljustiz« in Deutschland. Die Arbeit untersucht das damit angesprochene Phänomen der Generierung von Subkulturen unter Migranten, die sich auch in Deutschland an ihrem traditionellen oder religiösen Recht orientieren und vor allem familien- und strafrechtliche Streitigkeiten eigenständig bzw. durch milieunahe Personen schlichten oder entscheiden lassen, während die staatliche Justiz nicht einbezogen wird. Die Autorin analysiert die bisher vorliegenden Befunde und prüft systematisch Zulässigkeit und Grenzen religiöser bzw. traditionell motivierter Streitschlichtung- und entscheidung. Nach einer Abgrenzung zu Erscheinungen religiöser Gerichtsbarkeiten in Großbritannien und Kanada und der Einordnung des Phänomens in das Konzept des Rechtspluralismus, wird der verfassungsrechtliche Schutz genuin religiös motivierter Streitschlichtung aufgezeigt. Anhand einer Analyse potentieller Gegenrechte – wie zum Beispiel dem Rechtsprechungsmonopol des Staates, der funktionstüchtigen Strafrechtspflege, des Gleichheitssatzes, der öffentlichen Ordnung, aber auch etwa dem Rechtsdienstleistungsgesetz – werden präventive und repressive Handlungsmöglichkeiten des Staates dargelegt. / »Religious Informal Justice« -- The book focuses on the current debate on inofficial mediation and settlement of conflicts between muslim immigrants in Germany.

Values and Crime: Conceptualization of a General Theory of Crime ¤ On the science market, there is a variety of different crime theories. But no crime theory provides comprehensive answers to the questions about the causes of criminal behavior, the conditions of criminalization, the determinants of criminal careers, the explanation of different crime rates and their change, and also considers the connection with penal theories. In the present study, a general crime theory is conceptualized by referring to general sociological theories, in which the mentioned questions are taken into account. The empirical examinations of essential parts of the conceptualized theory lead to a clear confirmation of the hypotheses, so that the pursued approach can be seen as a sustainable basis for formulating a theoretically consistent and comprehensive crime theory. - Conceptual foundations of a general crime theory - The explanation of criminal behavior: Research status and secondary analyses - The explanation of criminal behavior: a hypothesis-testing investigation - Processes of criminalization - Recidivism and criminal career - The explanation of differences as well as changes in crime rates - The integration of penal theories into the general crime theory	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165737-8>
The Burning Reason ¤ The book investigates the meaning of the concept of ~rationalitas~ in Hildegard of Bingen. Firstly, the origin of the concept is illuminated from Greek logos doctrine through early Christian trinitarian speculation to the reception of ~ratio~ in the early Middle Ages. On this background, the second part then deals with the anthropological-theological significance of ~rationalitas~ for Hildegard's world view.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268579-5>
The Significance of the Type I Interferon Signaling Pathway in Dogs, with Special Consideration of Canine Distemper Virus Infection ¤ Type I Interferons (IFN-I) possess antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory properties. Notably, IFNα and IFNβ are attributed with antiviral effects. In veterinary medicine, IFN-I is used with the licensed recombinant feline IFNω (Virbagen® Omega, Virbac S.A., France) for the treatment of canine parvovirus infection. Furthermore, the significance of IFN-I in the pathogenesis and therapy of canine diseases has been hardly investigated. In this study, the role of selected, interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) in the course of canine distemper virus (CDV) encephalitis was investigated. For this purpose, paraffin-embedded brain tissue from 15 dogs with spontaneous distemper encephalitis and from 6 control animals was classified by histology. Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)3, IRF7, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1, STAT2, ISG15, 2‘5‘-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), protein kinase R (PKR), and myxovirus resistance protein (MX) were immunohistochemically depicted and quantified, as well as immunofluorescence double labeling of selected ISGs with various cellular markers and CDV antigens was performed. The IFN-I signaling pathway is activated in early stages of canine distemper encephalitis and probably inhibits viral replication. In particular, the expression of ISG- and STAT-proteins in oligodendrocytes probably leads to the restriction of CDV in these cells. Canine astrocytes express – neither in activated nor inactivated form – STAT2 proteins. Since the classical IFN-I signaling pathway cannot occur in astrocytes, only a limited inhibition of viral replication takes place. The STAT2 defect in astrocytes could have a great significance in the initial phase of demyelination, which is described as directly virus-dependent. The exact role of IFN-I and ISGs in the immunopathological mechanisms of the second phase of demyelination requires further investigation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130836-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026181-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4318717-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4349365-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012494-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113937-9>
Nation and Representation : Theory, History and Presence of a Contested Relationship ¤ What is a nation? Instead of starting from original identity, Michel Dormal starts from recent theories of political representation. Just the successful representation and configuration of conflict on the political stage can thus create the idea of a shared fate. In dialogue with authors such as Claude Lefort, Ernesto Laclau, Benedict Anderson or Pierre Rosanvallon, the author thus sheds new light on the problem of political community. He combines democratic theoretical, historical and ideological approaches. In the final part, he addresses recent debates on the possibility of global democracy and argues for a third way beyond nostalgic nationalism and naive enthusiasm for dissolution of boundaries.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4398345-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041279-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046563-9>

Artificial Intelligence as Invention and Inventor: Patent Law Implications of the Progress in the Field of Artificial Intelligence ¤ Is artificial intelligence the last invention of man? So far, humans have made inventions, but AI now promises inventions at the push of a button. This development affects patent law at its core and raises the question of its future significance. AI is not only relevant as an invention, but rather dealing with the status of an inventor of artificial intelligence and the quality of inventions generated by AI and their legal assignment is required. Jean-Marcel Krausen examines the patent law implications of this development and shows how patent law can promote and accompany technical progress in the future. To this end, he proposes adjustments to the patent grant procedure and develops a new regulation for the assignment of inventions in patent law for AI-supported invention processes	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044884-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015223-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033447-8>
Domain-Specific Conceptions of Financial Literacy by Swiss Vocational School Teachers: Theoretical and Empirical Foundations ¤ In this cumulative dissertation, domain-specific conceptions of Financial Literacy by teachers in vocational education are investigated. The significance of these conceptions stems from cognitive psychological argumentation lines on the influence of mental structures on perception, thinking, and acting by teachers in the classroom, as well as from the relevance of comprehensive financial education for individual and societal well-being in today's time. In the first study, the empirical foundation of a comprehensive understanding of Financial Literacy is at the center. It is an interview study with 40 financial experts and experts as well as actors in vocational education from six Western European countries. With the second study, the goal is to gain an overview of various facets of domain-specific conceptions of Financial Literacy by vocational school teachers. It is investigated to what extent teachers with different goals differ in terms of their content- and learning-related domain-specific conceptions. The data are based mainly on an online survey with 172 teachers of vocational education in Switzerland. With the third study, the development and testing of a methodological instrument is intended to describe and analyze the content-related facet of domain-specific conceptions of Financial Literacy in its deep structure. The instrument is tested with 16 teachers of vocational education in vocational training. Finally, the findings of the three studies are discussed in summary, the limitations of the work are shown, and implications for follow-up work and for pedagogical practice, especially the training and further education of teachers of vocational education, are derived.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035088-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154425-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005935-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195141-4>
Design of Mirrors for High-Precision Measuring and Positioning Machines: Contribution to the Development of a Nanopositioning and Nanomeasuring Machine ¤ The work aims to contribute to the development of high-precision measuring and positioning machines by developing foundations for optimization and constructive implementation of existing and new mirror concepts. To this end, the state of the art of high-precision measuring and positioning machines is examined in terms of application fields, design, and measurement systems. Based on the investigations, it can be recognized that mirrors have a significant impact on mechanical and metrological properties of these machines. Based on this knowledge, a systematic analysis of the mirrors is carried out. In this, the design, materials, manufacturing technology, coupling points, and the influence of the mirror on the measurement accuracy are considered. The investigations show: Known mirrors limit the accuracy and dynamics of high-precision measuring and positioning machines due to asymmetry around the high axis, large mass, and deformations under self-weight, and due to the overhanging side vertical mirror surfaces, the size of the object and the touch system. From the results of the analysis, the problem statement of the work is derived. From this, a discussion of the constructive development process and its application in the design of mirrors follows. This is followed by the development of solution approaches by applying the methods of variation and combination. A concretization of the solution approaches leads to five different shape variants of mirrors. Notably, the new and patented shape variant Tetraeder-Mirror is highlighted, as it avoids known disadvantages such as asymmetry around the high axis and restriction of object size under observance of the Abbe comparator principle. Based on two known and already used solution variants in high-precision measuring and positioning machines, their design and optimization are shown. For the Tetraeder-Mirror, calculation bases for dimensioning and coordinate transformation are developed. In addition, a proof of its function in high-precision measuring and positioning machines is provided through integration into a test setup. Finally, generalizable conclusions for the design of mirrors are summarized in a construction guideline.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4327470-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169536-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4221617-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175566-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4208883-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056203-7>
The Criminality of Non-Consensual Sexual Acts between Adult Persons ¤ Should all violations of the right to sexual self-determination be criminally prosecuted? When can a sexual act be regarded as non-consensual? Is criminal law the appropriate regulatory mechanism in cases of violations of sexual autonomy? Even after the reform of the German sexual assault law in 2016, these questions are still being debated, both among members of the public and in academic circles.This work systematically analyses whether and how the sexual autonomy of adults can and should be protected under German criminal law. The analysis focuses on the question of whether all non-consensual sexual acts should be classified as criminal offences and whether there are important overriding factors that, at least in some cases, such as in cases of sexual deception, argue against the imposition of criminal punishment. The analysis draws on interdisciplinary findings, and the author critically questions the reform of the German sexual assault law in 2016.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113399-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126862-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015431-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033181-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042696-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132802-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126268-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4238118-6>
Observations on the Development of the French Vocabulary: Petit Larousse 1968 - Petit Larousse 1981 ¤ Blurb: The Petit Larousse is one of the French dictionaries that attempt to adapt their inventory in annual reprints to the lexical changes of the language. The comparison of two fundamentally revised editions (1968 and 1981) made here allows for conclusions to be drawn about developments and trends in the French vocabulary. The work focuses primarily on the grammatical categories of nouns, adjectives, and verbs and examines the role and function of suffix formations, word compositions, abbreviations, and loanwords in order to evaluate the results against the background of previous lexicological-lexicographical research. From the content: French suffix system, types of composition and abbreviation formations, importance of loanwords, neutrality of the adjective in terms of gender, levelling and differentiation of verbal suffix variants.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056508-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113615-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126555-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134704-3>
Estimation and Specification of Econometric Neural Networks ¤ Artificial neural networks are a conceptually often described and in practice frequently used tool in economics, computer science, and natural and engineering sciences for conducting data analysis. However, representations of neural networks often originate from non-statistical publications. This leads to a tendency to neglect important findings from the field of statistics. Furthermore, neural networks are often applied uncritically to existing data and the implicit assumptions contained in the neural models are not checked for their validity. In the application of neural networks, too little attention is paid to the important point of model specification. In contrast to the usual representation of neural networks, these are examined and further developed in the present work from a purely statistically shaped perspective. By consistently and consequentially integrating neural models into classical statistics, various synergy effects arise in the areas of parameter estimation, modeling, and model diagnosis. The focus of the work is the investigation and development of statistical test procedures for neural model specification. These procedures allow, in contrast to the usual heuristic approach, an optimal model construction according to statistical criteria. Procedures for estimating model parameters are also presented and compared. In the framework of extensive simulation studies, the presented test procedures are analyzed in terms of their goodness. These studies illustrate the strong relevance and necessity of using statistical test procedures for the specification of neural networks.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044614-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043212-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4226127-2>
Childhood Time Practices in Kindergarten and Elementary School: A Qualitative Case Study ¤ How do children experience and organise the time they devote to their education, upbringing and supervision? Within this context, what importance is attached to educational staff and institutional time structures?

Assessment and maintenance of bridges – requirements, objectives, and strategies ¤ From an ideal point of view, bridges should be designed, constructed and operated in such a way that they fulfil requirements from the fields of function, economy, environment, society, and culture. The present thesis wants to contribute to this matter by illuminating the manifold requirements and by developing a practicable approach to multi-objective maintenance planning for bridges. Starting with a literature review and a survey on practical maintenance planning by bridge owning agencies in Hamburg (Germany) and Chennai (India), the investigation reveals that until today practical approaches for the identification of bridge specific requirements as well as for strategy assessment and evaluation are not at hand. Instead of accounting for the whole range of performance aspects, the current investigations of maintenance strategies are commonly confined to functional and economic aspects. In exceptional cases where societal, cultural and also environmental issues are considered, these aspects are usually treated in monetary terms. A common monetary evaluation of the different aspects, however, inevitably causes a distorted perception of reality. As a solution to this problem, the present thesis develops a practical approach to multi-objective maintenance planning. The aim of this approach is to develop customed strategies in order to fulfil the bridge specific requirements. At its core is the newly invented SAMS program, which allows for simulation based assessment of maintenance strategies. The program uses Monte Carlo simulation technique and thoroughly takes into account the interdependen-cies between structure, deterioration, and maintenance effects, which occur in the bridge specific context. As a result, it provides value distributions of indicators, which give a description of the strategy-depended bridge performance relating to condition, structural safety, economy, society, and culture. The SAMS program is effectively combined with a specifically developed method for true and undistortive multi-objective strategy evaluation. In addition to this, a questionnaire for identifying bridge specific requirements is applied—a tool newly developed for the survey in Hamburg and Chennai. The experimental application of the approach on two case study bridges shows that suitable strategies for fulfilling the bridge specific requirements can be identified. It is also found that the bridge specific context decisively influences the extent, to which strategies can play out their specific strengths.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008408-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200074-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059237-6>
Ecumenism in Lower Saxony 1945-1975 : the relationship between Evangelical-Lutheran state churches and Roman Catholic dioceses ¤ How did the following factors influence the relationships between the churches of Lower Saxony between 1945 and 1975? Anja Peycke examines the size and organizational status of the state churches and dioceses, the socio-political context, the state-church relationship, controversial theological questions, psychological and linguistic barriers, communities and parishes, as well as the attitude of bishops and state bishops. In doing so, she creates an 'ecumenical portrait' of the decisive structures, persons, influences, and attitudes to questions of ecumenism and interconfessional coexistence for each state church and diocese. For the regional perspective, both the national and international connections of Christianity and the socio-political background in the Federal Republic of Germany are taken into account.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197572-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125794-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138445-3>
Influence of Microbiological Treatments on the Phytoremediation Potential of Various Tree Species on Metal-Contaminated Soils of a Former Mining Site ¤ The remediation of former mining areas is associated with challenges such as metal contamination of the soil and acidic mine waters. Conventional remediation methods are expensive and destroy the soil structure. The cost-effective remediation by plants (phytoremediation) was investigated. The study evaluates the influence of soil treatments and microbiological inoculations on the growth and phytoremediation potential of various tree species in a former uranium mining area in Thuringia, Germany. On the test field Gessenwiese, birches, alders, and willows were planted with various rendzina and inoculation combinations. Rendzina affected the metal content and growth, with alders showing the best growth. Furthermore, the alder showed the best extraction potential for the investigated metals (except cadmium and copper). On the test fields EPH and EPP, the microbiological inoculations had little influence, except for the alder on EPH. Spruces showed the greatest biomass increase on both fields, but were unsuitable for short-rotation plantations. Alders and birches had the highest biomass increases on EPH and EPP, respectively, with alders taking up the most metals on both fields. Alders are considered a recommended planting for the remediation of the mining site due to their growth and phytoremediation potential on two test plots. Microbiological inoculations had little influence, except for the alder. In summary, the alders are the ideal trees for the investigated sites.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4316357-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4723845-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4611954-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144628-8>
Real Acts in the EU's Legal Protection System ¤ The EU's procedural law seems to offer no means of redress against real administrative action by the EU. If subjective rights are violated, for example, by information acts, police action, soft law, or informal agreements, then there is a lack of judicial protection. This cannot continue. The complex intertwined guarantees of protection of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the ECHR, and general principles of law require a revision of the status quo in order to do justice to the growing sensitivity to fundamental rights.

Swiss German and Language Awareness: Consolidation of Swiss German Diglossia in the 19th Century ¤ The German-speaking Switzerland is considered a typical case of a diglossic situation, in which the dialects represent the exclusive everyday variety of all population groups. The historical conditions that led to this language-historical development have, however, been little investigated to date. The study analyzes the public debates on Swiss German and the relationship between dialect and standard language in German-speaking Switzerland in the 19th century. On this basis, it reconstructs contemporary language attitudes and dominant forms of collective language awareness. It shows how, against the background of socio-historical developments, a national language awareness is formed, from which the diglossia consolidates as a specific element of a (German) Swiss language culture that persists to the present day. The findings on the language awareness historical processes of the 19th century, to which the investigation of a comprehensive corpus of sources has led, lead to lasting insights into the history of Swiss German diglossia and make a significant contribution to the understanding of the Swiss German language situation	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056448-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116442-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4550267-5>

Facial animation using muscles to control the mimic articulation of phonemes ¤ This master thesis describes an approach to facial animation using the muscle feature of Autodesk Maya. The skeletal, muscular and skin anatomy of the human head is abstracted from nature. The muscular structure is modelled to act as a highly reusable interface between any skull and skin model. The muscle actions are based on the Facial Action Coding System and are implemented using weights painted on the skin mesh. By combining several muscle actions it is possible to animate facial expressions, e.g. emotions or phonemes. By animating the mimic articulation of several visemes, the accuracy, usability and performance of the developed approach is determined.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5>
Space to Take: Single Women Between Work, Social Relationships, and the Culture of the Self ¤ Blurb: With solo living, women try to solve contradictions that arise mainly from the gender relationship and the organization of social work: the conflict between reproductive work and gainful employment, the paradox between autonomy and symbiosis, the tension between intense social contacts and an extraordinary partnership. Women create their own space in solo living, which is inextricably linked to their own person like a mirror image or a third skin. As a result, their own bodily experience changes as well as the organization of social relationships. The author, Martina Löw, examines the life course of single women between individualization and emancipation through qualitative interviews.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176265-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120658-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001237-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066749-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136795-9>
Communication in Crisis Breakout: Effect of Crisis PR and Co-orientation on Journalistic Perception ¤ How do journalists evaluate an organizational crisis? Simon Herrmann experimentally investigates whether PR announcements from an affected organization have an impact on how journalists perceive this crisis. Furthermore, the self-referentiality of the media system is checked by examining whether journalists assess this crisis as a more attractive topic for their reporting if other media also report on it. He experimentally examines cause-and-effect relationships to create a more reliable data basis than the widely disseminated, but only limitedly informative PR case studies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078605-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028779-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031883-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043188-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005709-4>
Critique of the Game - Game as Critique: Adorno's Social Philosophy Today ¤ What holds capitalist societies together: moral norms or rules of behaviour? Is social totality a normative order or is it a purposeless game? These alternatives divide critical theory and also prevent fruitful dialogue between French and German social philosophy.Critical social theory is impossible if it does not trust in the social practices it criticises. Without maintaining that such practices produce normative ideals, through which it can then criticise those practices, social theory cannot justify its claim of being able to immanently criticise everything that exists. Since Habermas, many have suspected Adorno’s social philosophy of being unable to justify this claim. If one wants to present Adorno as a significant philosopher today, one has to be able to demonstrate that his philosophy, i.e. the truth in everything, can be found in constitutive social practices. The author of this study first reconstructs Adorno’s social theory and then shows how it can still be used to criticise our society.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055876-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056218-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073840-1>
The Chancellor in the Tension Field between Chancellor Democracy and Party Democracy: A Comparison of the Government Styles of Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl ¤ Both Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl were dominant chancellor personalities, whose chancellorships decisively shaped the Federal Republic. Adenauer's government style was associated with the term Chancellor Democracy. Kohl's government style was less clearly describable in a conceptual denominator, as he appeared in much higher degree than Adenauer as a party politician. The author examines in her comparison of these two chancellorships the question of how the government styles of Adenauer and Kohl correlated with the development of party democracy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177415-2>
Spin-off Companies between Science and Economy: Company Foundings in Knowledge- and Technology-Intensive Sectors ¤ Academic spin-offs (spin-offs) are companies founded on the basis of scientific research results. They provide the organizational framework for the exploitation and generation of scientific knowledge, but are exposed to a contradictory field of tension at the interface of two different system logics. These contradictions must be caught both by establishing corresponding structures and on an individual level by the respective founders and employees. Based on case studies, Melanie Roski observes the establishment of a hybrid research culture in the spin-offs and shows a mixture of values and structures from the science system and the economic system. Melanie B. Roski is a research assistant at the Institute for Research on Founding and Innovation at the Bergische University of Wuppertal.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017894-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133178-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125522-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072560-1>

Payment Willingness for Value-Added-Services in Freight Transport: Illustrated by Road Freight Transport in Germany ¤ Within the scope of this work, the demand for Value-Added-Services for transport services in road freight transport within Germany is modelled on the basis of a cost minimization calculation by companies and a method is developed to quantify a construct derived from the modelled demand similar to the payment willingness. The author develops a complex traffic demand model based on discrete choice analysis that allows for explicit consideration of qualitative variables such as Value-Added-Services. The model is then tested by means of an internet-based survey of German shippers and forwarders who are potential demanders of Value-Added-Services and first empirical results on the payment willingness for Value-Added-Services are determined.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183580-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190481-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012178-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4258813-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4377258-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308413-8>
Empirical Determination of Evidence-Based Patient Benefit in Primary Care (PC) ¤ The work investigates the health benefits that patients derive from primary care and compares the results of conventional routine care. The investigation focuses on the patient as the beneficiary of the benefits and models his outpatient care. To operationalize the model, only indicators are used whose importance for patient benefits is medically well established. The empirical analysis is carried out using routine data from the statutory health insurance. The results show that primary care is particularly beneficial for type 2 diabetics and patients over 70 years of age. In both patient groups, the hospitalization rate is partly significantly lower through participation in primary care than in routine care. The findings justify recommendations for patients to participate in primary care and support the demand for the expansion of the offer of alternative care models	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044903-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4393693-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172187-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038270-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142176-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153470-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071796-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003167-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224953-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4543414-1>
Democratization of the EU through National European Discourses? : Structures and Processes of European Identity Formation in a German-French Comparison ¤ Can national European discourses generate European identity and thus contribute to the democratization of the EU? Building on an in-depth comparative examination of national European discourses as well as the political systems and cultures of Germany and France, the volume provides numerous results as well as further hypotheses and models for this question.In the first part, the role of European identity for the democratization of the EU and various theories of European identity are discussed; based on this, the comparative discursive-analytical research design is developed.Then, the core of the work forms the comparative examination a) of the discourses on the ratification of the EU Constitution Treaty, which took place in both states in the spring of 2005, and b) their respective national contexts, namely the political systems, political parties, citizens' attitudes, national identity concepts, and previous European discourses	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194747-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071013-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153201-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129611-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012475-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046540-8>
Influence of the interface structure on the electronic transport in planar tunnel junctions : a first-principles investigation ¤ Previous theoretical investigations of the tunnel magnetoresistance effect in planar tunnel contacts have shown that the electronic transport properties are significantly dependent on the properties of the interfaces. In this work, this problem is investigated in more detail. The ab initio calculations performed are based on the Landauer-Büttiker approach, as formulated in the multiple scattering theory (layer Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method). The investigated projects can be divided into two focus topics: substitutional disorder and the influence of magnetic interlayers in Fe/MgO/Fe tunnel contacts. Experimentally, partially oxidized interfaces in Fe/MgO/Fe contacts were found. The resulting substitutionally disordered FeO_{c} interface layers were investigated using a supercell approach. The main result shows a strong reduction of the tunnel magnetoresistance ratio (TMR) by 80% for an oxygen concentration of 4% compared to the ideal contact (c=0). The second focus of the work was to answer the question of whether embedded magnetic interlayers (Mn, Cr, Co) allow for an increase or tuning of the TMR ratio.

The "Right to be Forgotten" on the Internet after the CJEU's "Google Spain"-Ruling ¤ Mit seinem »Google-Urteil« sorgte der EuGH im Mai 2014 für einen Paukenschlag im Internet-Datenschutzrecht. Der Gerichtshof sprach Betroffenen einen Anspruch gegen Suchmaschinenbetreiber auf Löschung namensbezogener Sucheinträge zu und etablierte insoweit ein »Recht auf Vergessenwerden«. Die Möglichkeit, Inhalte zwar nicht zu entfernen, sie auf diesem Wege aber wirksam zu isolieren, führt zu einer erheblichen Aufwertung des Persönlichkeitsrechts im Internet, dessen effektive Durchsetzung im virtuellen Raum bislang als zentrales, aber kaum mehr umsetzbares Anliegen identifiziert worden ist. Die Hintergründe und Entwicklungsschritte, inhaltliche Aufarbeitung und Einordnung dieses wegweisenden Urteils in die Rechtsprechung des EuGH sind ebenso Gegenstand dieser Arbeit wie insbesondere auch die damit verbundenen vielfältigen praktischen, rechtlichen und rechtspolitischen Probleme, Auswirkungen und Fragestellungen in der unmittelbaren Folgezeit.

Stability and Breakdown Dynamics of Highly Charged Liquid Droplets ¤ Charged microdroplets are important components of thunderclouds and play a significant role in a variety of technical processes and in research. Lord Rayleigh investigated the behavior of charged liquid volumes as early as 1882. In a theoretical work, he showed that the shape of a charged droplet of an electrically conductive, incompressible liquid is determined by the surface tension and the Coulomb force. With the definition of a stability parameter, the fissility X, which represents the ratio of Coulomb energy to twice the surface energy, he was able to show that a droplet with X < 1 is dominated by the surface tension. This is in a stable state and its shape is that of a sphere. If the fissility of a droplet reaches the value of one, the dominance of the surface tension disappears, and the droplet shape becomes unstable. In this process, it deforms and takes on a spindle-shaped form. From the conical ends, the discharge of charge and mass occurs, after which the droplet returns to its equilibrium form. This work presents the investigations of droplets made of pure water as well as droplets made of sodium chloride and sulfuric acid solutions with regard to their stability and their charge-dependent breakdown. The influence of the charge carrier type, temperature, and droplet size is shown. A special emphasis is placed on the loss of charge and mass as well as the fissility of the droplets during the unstable phase and on the temporal course of droplet deformation. The mentioned quantities allow statements about the effect of the conductivity of different charge carriers and the intrinsic substance properties on the stability and the charge-dependent breakdown of the droplets.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056693-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151721-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130676-4>

Global and First-Mover Advantages of Internet-Based Business Models ¤ The question of pioneer advantages in the Internet has been insufficiently researched to date. Jantje Halberstadt empirically investigates this question and shows that first-mover advantages exist in national markets, which is essentially based on the argument that national first movers can combine the advantages of the first in the national market with the advantages of the follower from a global perspective. The first-mover advantages are more pronounced, the more intense network effects come into play. In conjunction with the first-mover hypothesis, it is often assumed that winner-take-all markets exist, in which a single provider ultimately prevails in the long term. However, the study shows that sustainable monopoly gains cannot be assumed in general - especially as weaker network effects take effect.

Restoring Childhood: Discourse, Power, and Social Inequality in Care and Everyday Life ¤ The study by Alex Knoll focuses on the shaping of everyday life of children in early childhood. From an inequality- and discourse-theoretical perspective, as well as with a multi-method design, he examines how parents organize the care of their children and in which activities they involve them. The author shows that differences in the everyday life of children are not only related to social origin, but also refer to contested societal and media-mediated conceptions of childhood and the stubborn engagement with them.

Characterization of a new infectious cDNA full-length clone of the virus of Bovine Viral Diarrhea Type 2 and Generation of Virus Mutants ¤ Virusdiarrhoe-Mucosal-Disease-Virus, cDNS, Deletionsmutante, Replikon, Komplementierung, RNS-Viren, Pestivirus, Volllängenklon, full lenght clone Based on their genomic sequences, two genotypes of Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) can be differentiated, BVDV type 1 (BVDV-1) and BVDV type 2 (BVDV-2). The complete genomic sequence of the highly virulent BVDV-2 strain 890 was cloned as cDNA to establish the infectious cDNA clone p890FL. In vitro-synthesised full-length RNA of p890FL was transfected into bovine cells and infectious virus could be recovered (v890FL). In vitro, recombinant v890FL showed similar growth characteristics as wild type virus 890WT. However, infection experiments in calves revealed an attenuation of recombinant v890FL in comparison to the parental isolate. Both leukocytopenia and fever were less pronounced in v890FL-infected calves. Nevertheless, viremia and virus shedding were comparable between recombinant and parental BVDV 890. Furthermore, mutants with partial Npro) deletions of the genomic region encoding for the autoprotease Npro (p890d dC) were constructed and characterised.

Bifurcations from homoclinic orbits to a saddle-centre in reversible systems ¤ In the dissertation, bifurcations of homoclinic orbits to a saddle-centre in reversible systems are considered. The saddle-centre is generated by a pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues, the rest of the spectrum consists of eigenvalues with a non-zero real part. Thus, the two-dimensional centre manifold is filled with a family of symmetric, periodic orbits. In the dissertation, Lin's method was extended to the case of non-hyperbolic equilibrium states. Originally, this method was developed for investigations of the bifurcation behaviour of orbits connecting hyperbolic equilibrium states. First, in the dissertation, 1-homoclinic orbits to the centre manifold are considered. There, 1-homoclinic orbits to the equilibrium state, 1-homoclinic orbits to periodic orbits of the centre manifold, and heteroclinic orbits connecting different orbits of the centre manifold are distinguished. A second aspect of the dissertation is the detection of branching symmetric, 1-periodic orbits. There, the branching 1-homoclines to the centre manifold serve as a basis for the discussion of the associated branching equations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020929-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078889-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4327106-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132783-4>
Surface characterisation with nonlinear methods based on scale analysis ¤ In this thesis we develop methods for the analysis of surfaces whose formation processes are not exactly describable. We demonstrate the methods for two examples. The first is a metal surface generated by the processing with a laser device, the second is the electron microscopy image of a cross section through a tidal flat sediment. Both surfaces are created by a complicated interplay of processes for which no closed mathematical model is available. The processes are acting on different time and spatial scales. We make use of this property and use a nonlinear methodology which emphasises these features, respectively. <engl.>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127859-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130418-4>
The Este and the Holy Roman Empire in the Long 16th Century: Contacts - Conflicts - Cultural Transfer ¤ Elena Taddei investigates the hitherto little-explored, partly conflict-ridden relationships between the Dukes of Ferrara, Modena, and Reggio from the upper Italian princely family of the Este and the Empire, i.e. the Emperors and selected Imperial Princes of the 16th century in a political, social, and cultural historical context. As one of the oldest Italian noble families, the Este ruled the papal fief of Ferrara from 1240 to 1597 and the imperial fiefs of Modena and Reggio from 1288 to 1796. As 'Servants of two Lords', they pursued a policy of balance between Pope, Emperor, and other powers of the Early Modern Period. The rich cultural transfer to and from the Empire points to their capillary network of diplomatic representation, kinship, friendship, and patronage and is also a yardstick for the importance and perception of Emperor, Empire, and Imperial institutions in Italy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165964-8>

Abuse of Official Power : A Comparative Legal Investigation into Article 323 of the Italian Penal Code ¤ BEGIN The phenomenon of abuse of official powers is widespread in all societies. In contrast to Germany, the Italian legislator has made abuse of official powers punishable under Article 323 of the penal code. The offense has gained notoriety in Germany through the indictment of high-ranking politicians in Italy. The provision has a chequered history and was the subject of intense scientific debates in Italy. This treatise examines the characteristics of the offense. Furthermore, the reasons for the lack of a corresponding provision in German law are investigated, and to what extent the criminalization of the misuse of official powers would be considered in Germany under the aspects of culpability and penal necessity.

Anwaltliche Berufsausübung im Dienste des Rechtsstaats : a comparative study of German and French constitutional law ¤ Lawyers have a crucial function in the rule of law. Unlike judicial independence, which is explicitly mentioned in European and national constitutional texts, this is not the case for lawyers and the legal profession as an institution. The constitutional protection of the legal profession in Germany has no equivalent in France, where it has been entrusted to professional self-regulation so far. The author misses the legal profession's freedom in German constitutional law anew. This presents itself as a serving guarantee of freedom. At the same time, the first constitutional standards for the regulation of the legal profession in France are shown. The comparative constitutional law reveals the foreign usefulness and normative shaping of the legal profession's fundamental rights as common elements.

The Hope for a "Safe Haven" : biographical research among migrants in Münsterland ¤ This dissertation presents 26 biographies and the stories of migrants from 11 different countries who came to Germany between 2011 and 2015. Based on a one-year period of research conducted in Münsterland (NRW) in 2015/2016, the work approaches its subject matter from an individual perspective in order to highlight the multidimensionality of migration and thus liberate migrants from the image of a passive mass of people, which is often propagated in politics and the media, and introduce them as autonomous actors. The biographies are outlined in detail by means of narrative interviews in order to investigate the reasons why the people interviewed decided to migrate. Therefore, this work shows that in addition to the obvious reasons for a person leaving their home country, such as war, persecution and discrimination, even complex biographical events and experiences can influence their decision to migrate.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132300-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126219-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151434-8>
Aeroacoustic Investigations of Stationary Staves and an Oscillating Wing using Synchronous Particle-Image Velocimetry and Microphone Measurements ¤ The combined, experimental capture of structures in a flow and the resulting sound radiation is the subject of the present work. As measurement methods, particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used, with the help of which fluctuations in the flow field within a light sheet plane are recorded, and microphones, which capture pressure fluctuations in the acoustic far field. Through synchronous measurement, the cross-correlation between these two quantities can be calculated, which provides insights into the mechanism of sound generation and propagation as well as the relationship with the occurring flow structures. The focus of the present work lies in the expansion of the knowledge space of this experimental procedure with regard to two aspects. On the one hand, it is investigated to what extent the correlation results and derived quantities can be used to draw conclusions about the region of the sound sources, to track the propagation behavior of the sound speed from the source region to the far field, and to quantify the distribution of acoustic intensity. For this purpose, experiments were carried out on surrounded staves in an aeroacoustic wind tunnel, where the observation window of the PIV measurements could be traversed sequentially from the near field of the staves to the acoustic far field. In order to compare the achieved cross-correlation results and to validate the scaled cross-correlation function as a substitute quantity for the sound speed, analytical models were used. It could be shown that in those flow regions where fluid-dynamic processes play a subordinate role, the scaled cross-correlation function actually reflects the propagation behavior of the sound speed. In regions with strong turbulent particle movements, however, fluid-dynamic fluctuations dominate by several orders of magnitude, so that a clear separation of the purely acoustic processes is not possible. However, a clear link between the coherent, periodically shedding flow structures in the wake of the staves and the sound emission and transport/convection of acoustic information could be demonstrated both experimentally and in comparison with the analytical models. Using a generalized intensity analysis based on the scaled cross-correlation function, the source region of the acoustic emissions could be identified. On the other hand, the influence of the additional degree of freedom of the periodic movement of an oscillating wing in a flow on the cross-correlation results is investigated. With this experiment, it should be clarified whether it is possible with synchronous measurement technology to identify coherent flow structures that are related to sound generation and propagation, despite permanently changing flow conditions. In this context, it was shown that characteristic flow structures occur at different wing positions/phase angles, which can be assigned to different sound source mechanisms. During the cycle of the dynamic flow break-down, both periodic vortex shedding at the wing trailing edge and large-scale shedding along the entire profile line of the wing occur, which are each associated with characteristic self-noise mechanisms. Furthermore, through variation of the configuration parameters, noticeable changes in the noise emission could be identified and quantified.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4333165-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4341305-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116645-0>
State Order and Violence Research: On the Role of Violence in Stationary Care for People with Dementia ¤ Care science and a large part of sociological violence research aim to identify significant shortcomings by referring to the concept of violence. Such violence research ultimately boils down to a moral evaluation of social phenomena. The first goal of the study presented by Jonas Barth is to demonstrate the social necessity of moralizing violence research. Because violence research reproduces templates for the social significance of violence and thus becomes part of a state-ordered order-related action context. Evaluative statements in such research are then recognizable as symbolic markings of order conflicts. This reconstruction enables the explanation of a yardstick with the help of which social theoretical means can be developed that, in addition to the reconstruction already carried out, can essentially also capture other, i.e. not only state-related, order-related relationships of violence. In the above reconstructed order conflicts, it is marked that there are violence determinations and legitimations in care that are considered illegitimate. Against this background, the study analyzes on the basis of a qualitative-ethnographic study the understanding of and the handling of violence that characterize the normative order in stationary care for people with dementia. The empirical findings obtained along with the ethnographically achieved and theoretically condensed empirical findings are finally re-referenced to the reconstruction of state-related violence research carried out at the beginning, so that the findings represent a contribution both to care-related and to societally theoretical violence research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174087-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011404-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157237-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4277507-3>
Euroscepticism: Origins and Expressions in the Course of the European Integration Process ¤ BEGIN The phenomenon of euroscepticism did not exist only since the Maastricht Treaty, which has often served as a starting point for scientific considerations so far. Rather, the European integration process has always been exposed to criticism and hostility. The author presents this fact in a unique way and re-reads the history of the EU. He analyzes the relevant eurosceptical argumentation lines of their time, sketches the course of public opinion and shows how and with what effects political actors have repeatedly turned against 'Brussels' - from the communists of the 50s to the right-wing populists of the present day. In doing so, he shows that the increased occurrence of EU criticism in recent years is mainly due to the fact that the current EU is a distinctly more political institution than the old EC ever was.

The Beautiful Jewess : Jewish Female Figures in German-Language Narrative Literature from the 17th Century to World War I ¤ Cliff Notes: Beautiful Jewish female figures have been part of the arsenal of German-language literature for centuries. This book presents for the first time in context the literary type of the 'Beautiful Jewess' in seventy novels and short stories from four centuries. The linguistic topos 'The Beautiful Jewess' is an expression of an (non-Jewish and non-female) outside view; the corresponding stereotypical features of the literary image of the Jewess can be traced from Grimmelshausen to Heinrich Mann. In the history of motifs, the problematic course of Jewish emancipation and assimilation history is reflected at the same time. Glimpses of the public discourse on Jewish women and their role in state and society enable the reconstruction of the contemporary understanding requirements and collective judgment mechanisms that determine the literary shaping of Jewish female figures and their reception.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4324518-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015025-2>
Structured Tarif Agreements for the Organization of Industrial Co-Determination: Application Possibilities and Reform Needs of Section 3 of the German Works Council Act, with Special Consideration of Modern Corporate Structures ¤ By means of the sensible use of structured tariff agreements, the growing conflict between modern corporate structures and industrial co-determination can be resolved in many cases. Essential for this is that, in the formation of works councils, the business constitutionally relevant peculiarities of modern organizations are always taken into account. This analysis of the options from Section 3 of the German Works Council Act in relation to modern corporate structures shows a variety of practical measures for the respective organizational forms. The analysis also shows that a clear reform of Section 3 of the German Works Council Act is still to be demanded and how it should look so that the standard is sufficient and future-proof for all modern structures.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006231-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172761-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117170-6>
The Cooperation of the Hegemon USA with Saudi Arabia and Pakistan: Strangers or Friends? ¤ So strange and yet so friendly? This question arises when dealing with the cooperation of the hegemon USA and its long-standing autocratic allies Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. While both alliance policy towards democracies and relations with opponents have been extensively researched, the relationships with autocratic partners of the hegemon have been both empirically and theoretically underresearched. This work combined the state of research on hegemony theory and cooperation policy to ideal types and linked them with the findings from the empirical analysis of the two cases to an inductively developed 'Grounded Theory' for the hegemon's cooperation policy towards autocratic partners. At the end of the investigation, a new theory for the hegemon's cooperation with autocratic partners is developed on the basis of the theoretical state of research and the two empirical cases.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4206090-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065449-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128860-9>
Friction Stir Welding with an Industrial Robot considering the application criteria for automotive mass production ¤ The friction stir welding process enables the production of reproducibly high-quality weld connections. Due to the very high process forces, special and machine tools are preferably used in production. However, in automotive mass production, the use of standard industrial robots for friction stir welding is favored as a cost-effective and more flexible alternative. Within the scope of the work, the performance characteristics of the industrial robot are first analyzed without processing forces. In this context, the pose and path repetition accuracy of the industrial robot is quantified at different reference paths in the plane. It can be determined that the robot meets the accuracy requirements of the welding process. However, it becomes clear in the analysis of the interactions between process and robot structure that the working accuracy of the industrial robot is significantly influenced by the resulting process forces during friction stir welding; without a "retouching" or an offline correction of the programmed target path, the mechanical properties of the weld connection are negatively affected by the insufficient working accuracy of the industrial robot. It can be proven in the analysis that the tool displacement not only depends on the resulting process forces, but is also significantly influenced by the direction of the vector of the path speed during path welding. In the analysis of the static and dynamic system properties of the robot, it is shown that the nonlinear stiffness of the robot structure is largely dependent on the joint positions and the loading direction. From the findings of the system analysis, a model-based offline path correction is developed, which takes into account flexibility and interactions between process and robot.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165423-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001586-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7554620-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026861-5>
What is a Healthy School? : Influences of School Climate on Student and Teacher Health ¤ Through targeted health promotion in school, various preventive approaches are attempted to teach children and adolescents a repertoire of behaviors that help prevent health development disorders. In addition to behavioral prevention, theoretical models of health promotion also include elements of relational prevention, which demand the change of circumstances that favor or cause the occurrence of health complaints. At this point, the study presented in this book begins.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053369-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035088-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176253-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4294611-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180169-6>
Characterization of New Herbicidal Targets -Phylloquinone Synthesis and Splicing- ¤ In conventional agriculture, herbicides play a key role. However, their efficacy decreases due to the increasing appearance of tolerant weeds. The work in hand contributes to the search for novel targets for herbicides. The topics addressed are, on the one hand, phylloquionon synthesis and its enzyme DHNS, and, on the other, the whole process of splicing. Through the results of in-vivo and in-vitro studies it was possible to showcase the compound-target relationship as well as the consequences for the whole organism. In sum, those results promote the aptitude for this target to serve the immediate search for novel herbicide chemistry. The inhibition of splicing could also be achieved, but this approach contains an immense potential for toxicologic problems. Therefore, further fundamental research is needed to be able to avoid these. Herbicides are a key pillar of industrial agriculture.

Success and failure of innovative firms : the role of cooperation and innovator networks ¤ This work contributes to a better understanding of the importance of cooperation and knowledge exchange for the success of innovative companies. It is essentially based on Josef Alois Schumpeter's 'Theory of Economic Development' from 1912. More recent theories, such as the 'resource-based view of the firm' (Penrose 1959) or the 'knowledge-based theory of the firm' (Grant 1996) see a collective process of learning and implementing new knowledge in innovations as essential drivers of economic development (Cantner and Meder 2007, Lundvall 1992, Kogut et al. 1992). Reasons for this are that, on the one hand, innovation activities are associated with a high degree of uncertainty in terms of costs, results, and time dimension (Bayona et al. 2001) and, on the other hand, the knowledge of today has reached a complexity that no single actor can generate new combinations of existing knowledge without external influences (Cowan et al. 2006, Haagedorn 2002, Freeman 1991). Therefore, it is of great importance for companies that want to compete in the innovative competition to cooperate in their R&D efforts and thus integrate external resources. Such research collaborations are not always successful and are subject to certain dynamics. Both phenomena have been insufficiently investigated to this day, not least due to the complexity of the question. Leaving the level of bilateral cooperation relationships and considering the totality of the existing cooperations, one comes to the level of innovation networks. Innovations are usually the result of a complex process and the recombination of new and old knowledge, which is hardly possible without collective, social processes (Lundvall 1992, Doloreux and Parto 2005, Jaffe 1986, Bagchi-Sen 2002). These interactive contacts between employees of companies, research institutes or universities form a complex network of actors that generate innovations and bring them either to market with an existing company or through the founding of a new company. This social network is the so-defined innovator network according to Cantner and Graf (2007).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017897-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032386-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027089-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063290-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171529-9>
The Legal Relationships between Bank and Bidder in Public Takeovers under the WpÜG ¤ The question of the involvement of banks in public takeovers and the underlying legal relationships, which fall to be classified under banking and capital markets law, plays an economically essential role. From the bidder's perspective, banks perform important advisory activities, prepare the necessary documents for the implementation of the takeover, or structure the financing. In addition, the technical processing of the public takeover offer is carried out with the involvement of banks, with the exchange of performance and counter-performance being the most important step. This work presents the involvement of banks in the course of a public takeover from the bidder's perspective and, in particular, deals with the legal relationships between bank and bidder.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004436-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078600-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017182-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186613-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048851-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162993-0>
Ritual and Text : Forms of Symbolic Communication in the Historiography and Literature of the Late Middle Ages ¤ Anhand signifikanter Beispiele aus dem Südosten des spätmittelalterlichen Reiches untersucht Christiane Witthöft, welche Bedeutung den Formen ritueller Kommunikation in Dichtung und Historiographie zukam. It is also an astonishing result of this investigation for experts, how differentiated these forms of communication were reflected in the fictional texts. Christiane Witthöft inquires about tradition and innovation in the handling of rituals from the perspective of medieval historical and literary science. She focuses her attention on the southeast of the empire since the end of the Babenberg rule in the middle of the 13th century - a time of political and social upheavals, which seems to need the stabilizing framework of ritual actions particularly. As sources, in addition to the historical works of Jans Enikels and Ottokar of Styria, also serve Ulrich of Liechtenstein's 'Service for Women' and the small poems of the Stricker. The anecdotes and loosely narrative inserts of the chronicles are a treasure trove for a research approach that asks about the conditions of the construction of rituals.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175051-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046514-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050164-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035964-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124854-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039687-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4024596-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4608313-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020531-9>
Regulatory Principle of Efficiency: Standards and Limits of an Efficiency-Oriented Regulation in the Telecommunications and Energy Sector ¤ Telecommunications and energy networks are the lifeblood of modern societies and forward-looking economies. Since these networks are natural monopolies, they must be regulated by the state. Although this regulation is now legally detailed, it still faces fundamental questions: How are the interests of network operators and network users to be weighed? How far can a regulatory authority intervene in the rights of the network operator? How much must the network expansion be promoted and enabled? How independent can a regulatory authority be? This work shows how the guiding principle of efficiency from economics can be transferred to law and how it provides clear answers to these current regulatory questions, especially by referring back to constitutional law.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133586-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013585-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4631982-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062801-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201190-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130688-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4332349-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123202-1>
Innovative Methods for Optical System and Function Integration ¤ In particular, for sensor or imaging applications, in addition to micro-electronic, mechanical, and fluidic components, smaller and more powerful optical components and systems are always required. Optical system and function integration provides the necessary tools in the form of concept and optics design approaches as well as manufacturing processes. The focus of this work lies on the research of innovative methods for the realization of highly integrated, miniaturized, and robust optical free-space systems. By folding the beam path, an interesting compromise between system size and functionality can be achieved for many applications. As one of the central challenges in optics design of such systems, this work goes into detail on both established and innovative methods for start system finding. From theoretical considerations, it becomes clear that optimal performance of folded optical systems can often only be achieved with complex surfaces that deviate from rotational symmetry. By also thoroughly investigating the integration of additional optical functionalities, surface complexity is further increased. In order to meet the increasing technological requirements that come with this, a new integrated manufacturing process is available. By successively applying different manufacturing processes within a processing, measurement, and positioning system, high flexibility and precision are achieved in the manufacture of individual surfaces and complete optical systems. Based on the theoretical and technological foundations, the integration of optical functions is presented as an example of two complex optical beam shaping components and the optical system integration of a gas detector. The possibilities and limitations of optical system and function integration are discussed based on profilometric and optical characterization results.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126186-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7745887-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4561097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4362762-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4464875-3>
Knowledge Communication in Sports: On the Communicative Construction of Body Knowledge in Youth Training ¤ Body-, Knowledge- and Interaction Sociology -- Body Knowledge and Visuality -- Sports Training and Knowledge Communication -- Videography of Training Situations Ajit Singh investigates in the context of performance-oriented youth training in trampolining, how the transmission of body and movement knowledge is coordinated by coaches and athletes. The starting point is the thesis that bodies act and communicate in a way that can be observed, interpreted, and understood methodically. The videographic study highlights that the communicative transmission of body knowledge in sports is subject to a complex orchestration of different modalities. The embodied forms of knowledge range from basic movement sequences to body tension, time feeling, or concentration ability. Through fine-grained interaction analyses, it is shown that the joint adjustments through showing, imagining, re-enacting, and pre-enacting and other forms of knowledge communication are not ancillary, but are essential in a social sense for what is realized in training situations as a communicative construction of body knowledge.

Miniatur-Fixpoint Cells as Basis for Self-Calibrating Electrical Contact Thermometers ¤ Miniatur-Fixpoint cells can be used to utilize phase transition temperatures of pure substances as temperature fix points. Electrical contact thermometers, in which miniatur cells are integrated in a suitable manner, are relatively simple, almost infinitely often and under operating conditions (in situ) recalibratable at the known fix point temperature. This principle has been practically realized so far only under laboratory conditions. Within the scope of the work, essential results of investigations are presented, which aim to design thermally optimized miniatur-Fixpoint cells with improved measurement technical properties. The goal is to integrate miniatur-Fixpoint cells into industrially conventional and suitable electrical contact thermometers with outer diameters of [greater than or equal to] 6 mm and to enable their periodic in-situ self-calibration in this way. Based on fundamental considerations of the thermodynamics of phase transitions in pure metals and alloys, selection criteria for fix point and crucible materials are derived. The essential focus is on the question of realizing a thermal equilibrium between a temperature sensor and the phase transition material within the miniatur cell, even at relatively rapidly changing external temperatures and inhomogeneous temperature fields. Known designs of miniatur fixpoint thermometers and common methods for calibrations in standard fix point cells are analyzed in this regard. A sufficient thermal equilibrium between temperature sensor and fix point material can be established by homogenizing the local temperature field in the area of the miniatur cell. This can be done temporarily by utilizing the high temperature constancy of the phase transition material during a melting or solidification process. Based on modeling and numerical simulations of thermoelements with integrated miniatur-Fixpoint cells, the changes in temperature distributions within the thermometer and the resulting expansions of the solid/liquid phase boundaries during a phase transition are investigated in dependence on various influencing factors. The detailed model calculations enable the derivation of guidelines and criteria for the constructive design of miniatur-Fixpoint cells and their integration into thermometers. They also serve to verify a simple evaluation procedure for determining the phase transition temperatures from the measured plateaus. Experimental investigations confirmed the results of the simulations. Long-term measurements in the laboratory and under industrial operating conditions provided evidence of the sufficient thermal and mechanical stability of the miniatur fixpoint thermometers. With some binary eutectic and monotectic alloys, investigations were carried out regarding their suitability as phase transition materials in miniatur-Fixpoint cells. In particular, the equilibrium temperatures of their melting processes proved to be sufficiently reproducible and usable as temperature fix points. Thermometers with integrated miniatur-Fixpoint cells can be used as before in calibration laboratories for comparative calibrations. The achieved improvements in their measurement technical properties, as well as the high long-term stabilities of the miniatur-Fixpoint cells, make it possible to equip industrial temperature measurement points with miniatur fixpoint thermometers. The example of temperature measurement in the hot steam lines of power plants shows that, using self-calibrating miniatur fixpoint thermoelements, noticeable reductions in temperature measurement uncertainties from currently about 3...5 K to under 1 K can be achieved.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185149-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151929-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121723-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154195-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132140-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4211849-9>
Digital Desoeconomy : Unproductivity, Sluggishness and Excess in the Digital Environment ¤ The warning from parents to be careful about what they share online is ubiquitous. This is followed by data protectors who advocate for a conscious and frugal use of services and data. However, a digital desoeconomy resists these warnings and seeks a critical approach to digital contemporary culture not in asceticism, but in excess. Artworks, images, and data are 'too much', pile up, and repeat themselves constantly. With reference to approaches to governmentality, queer theory, and the theories of George Bataille and Roger Caillois, Sebastian Althoff analyzes this unproductive mode of production of the digital and shows a practice that creates sluggishness instead of flow	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1079427864> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114333-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7628620-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4196910-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123065-6>
Computer-Supported Analyses in Toxicology: Application of In-Silico Models and Utility in Risk Assessment ¤ Within the framework of the EU-wide REACH regulation, alternative methods to animal testing in toxicology have gained importance. The alternative methods are divided into in vitro and in silico methods. In this dissertation, various concepts of in silico toxicology were treated. The topics dealt with range from quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) to a new approach to the common concept of setting limits to computer-based modeling of alcohol and bisphenol A metabolism. The chapter on QSAR deals essentially with the creation and analysis of a database with 878 substances, which consists of animal testing studies from the archive of the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. The design was adapted to an existing database in order to generate a database as large as possible. In the analysis, it could be shown, inter alia, that substances with lower molecular weight had an increased potential for toxicological damage than...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4192067-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4205429-1>

Investigations on Microperfusion and Oxygenation of Gastrointestinal Organs during General Anesthesia in Horses ¤ The aim of our investigations was to use the O2C, a combined laser-Doppler-flowmetry and Weislichtoxymetry, to investigate the influence of general anesthesia, different anesthetic protocols and medications on microperfusion and tissue oxygenation of the gastrointestinal tract in horses. In various study series, healthy horses were brought into general anesthesia and perfusion and oxygenation of the stomach, small and large intestine were measured. Central circulatory and oxygenation parameters were also measured and compared with peripheral perfusion and oxygenation. After evaluation of the O2C on the horse intestine, the influence of anesthetic duration and depth, different ventilation pressures and systemic hypoxia and hypotension on intestinal perfusion and oxygenation was investigated. Furthermore, the effects of alpha-2 agonists such as xylazine and dexmedetomidine and different catecholamines (dobutamine, dopamine, phenylephrine and norepinephrine) on intestinal perfusion and oxygenation during general anesthesia were investigated. It could be shown that during a seven-hour isoflurane anesthesia, both global circulatory parameters (heart rate, arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure and cardiac output) and peripheral perfusion parameters (tissue blood flow in the intestine) and tissue oxygenation were stable. However, an increase in isoflurane concentration led to a continuous and linear decrease in blood pressure and cardiac output, but to a non-linear decrease in peripheral perfusion. This remained stable up to a threshold value and then fell rapidly when blood pressure and cardiac output limits were exceeded. In a further study, progressive hypoxia was used to reduce arterial oxygen saturation stepwise. This led initially to an increase in oxygen extraction with stable intestinal oxygenation. As soon as the blood's extraction capacity was exceeded, there was a significant drop in intestinal tissue oxygenation. In a subsequent controlled hypovolemia with continuous decrease in cardiac output and blood pressure, the non-linear relationship between global and intestinal perfusion was confirmed again. Although the sole use of alpha-2 agonists without adjustment of anesthetic depth impaired intestinal perfusion and oxygenation, an increase in perfusion compared to baseline after bolus administration could even be observed when adjusting/reducing anesthetic medication concentration compared to sole application of alpha-2 agonists. The application of the investigated catecholamines brought variable results: Dobutamine was characterized by positive effects on central and peripheral perfusion parameters, while the influence of dopamine despite increased cardiac output on gastrointestinal perfusion was negative. Phenylephrine showed in our studies clearly negative influences on peripheral perfusion, while norepinephrine in the chosen dosages was a suitable vasopressor without adverse effects on gastrointestinal perfusion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074445-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001839-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045503-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171164-6>

Multiplex System for Digital Data Streams in Multimedia Applications ¤ Due to the increasing expansion of digital television, new requirements arise for the deployed distribution infrastructure as well as for measurement and testing technology. Therefore, the present work deals with a new concept for headends as multimedia nodes of the widely distributed cable networks in Germany. The concept includes universal software algorithms for processing data streams as well as a hardware concept based on modern network and bus technologies. Another aspect is the operation of current and future multimedia nodes. The starting point of the work is the introduction to the structure of digital television, headends, and current network technologies. These are considered in conjunction. The aspect of processing data streams under laboratory conditions is taken into account by the presented concept of the DVB-Toolbox. Based on this, a new concept for future digital headends is derived, which is patented. These are considered from the perspective of network technologies as multimedia nodes. With this concept, a fusion of network and television technology takes place. For the new digital headend, a software concept consisting of two parts is developed simultaneously. The first component is responsible for the internal processing and processing of the expected data streams in the headends. It enables easy access to the data stream and is easily adaptable to new requirements. This component is designed to be used on various platforms. Part two of the software concept discusses the possibilities of controllability and automatic structure recognition of the overall system. To provide proof of the performance capability of the presented hardware and software concepts, a scalable transport stream multiplexer and a DVB-S transport stream source were designed and set up. The hardware and software of a modular scalable transport stream multiplexer are described. The heart of the device is a miniaturized C, and LINUX is used as the operating system. Additional components take over the preparation and forwarding of the transport streams, and processing and analysis take place to a large extent in the PC.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4421191-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170730-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4192358-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029109-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7751583-3>

Criminal Procedural Guarantees in European Antitrust Law : Implications and Limits of the Criminal Law Similarity of Cartel Fines ¤ The European Antitrust Law has undergone various reforms in the last few decades. However, according to the author, not all procedural deficiencies have been remedied, which, in themselves, but especially in their entirety, result in a legitimacy deficit: Companies are still obliged to make self-incriminating statements, they have no right to summon or question witnesses, various presumptions of proof apply, and finally, cartel fines, which can amount to up to 10% of the previous year's total turnover, are imposed by an independent and impartial authority in a non-public procedure and are also immediately enforceable upon appeal. -- The author subjects the European Antitrust Procedure Law to a comprehensive analysis and concludes that the current practice is not compatible with the requirements of the ECHR and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Nevertheless, an administrative sanction procedure may be permissible. However, it is decisive that the imposed sanction does not have an existence-destroying effect at a simultaneously higher level of procedural guarantees. Otherwise, cartels would have to be sanctioned immediately in a judicial procedure. / »European Antitrust Law and Criminal Procedural Guarantees« -- Cartel sanctions are an important means to ensure the functioning of the European market. Their purpose may however not justify any rigorosity of cartel proceedings against companies. Above all, the procedural practice needs to be compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is currently subject to some doubts. The author argues therefore, whether cartel sanctions may be imposed by an administrative authority regardless of their height.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4340525-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130280-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176071-2>

Improving attitudes towards geometric proof through a suggested story-based dynamic geometry approach ¤ In this work, an approach is presented and explored, in which students are presented with geometric problems through a daily story using dynamic geometry software. This is intended to enable them to recognize the importance of geometry for everyday life, to experience the process of formulating geometric statements and hypotheses together, and to perceive geometric proofs as something that goes beyond the mere confirmation of the correctness of geometric theorems. They begin with the real situation and are guided through seven steps to geometric proofs. The content of the teaching material is structured in a tiered manner, with each unit being a prerequisite for the next, either geometric-structurally or embedded in the story.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7546364-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4727098-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4196910-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037949-8>

Organisation-related Participation in Criminal Law: The Statutory Behavior of Organizational Crimes and the Phenomenon of Terrorism Financing ¤ Main description: In the present work, the provisions of §§ 84, 85 StGB, § 20 Abs. 1 Nr. 1 to 4 VereinsG, and §§ 129, 129a StGB are presented as a uniform complex of organizational crimes. The focus of this consideration is on the specifically organization-related participation. By this view, the organization is reduced to an environment in which the participatory behavior takes place. With this perspective, Natalia Eroshkina turns against the group-dynamic explanatory approach of organizational crimes. In particular, the work presents the organizational criminal law in connection with the constitutional limits of the freedom of association according to Art. 9 Abs. 2 GG and shows the attribution structure of participation in an association and its manifestation in the system of organization-specific participatory roles. Finally, the protection of legal interests by organizational criminal law is critically questioned. This criticism demands a revision of the protective directions of organizational crimes and the development of the delict structure in the background of the question of how organization-related participatory behavior can impair legal interests in a real cumulative attack. To exemplify the elaborated differences of organizational crimes in relation to further forms of punishable joint action and to single perpetrator offenses, the author links to the phenomenon of terrorism financing.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078791-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4330891-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068129-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184327-7>
Divergence and Transformation : Constitutional-Theoretical Examination of Property Protection in the Democratic Property Constitution and the Investment Protection Regime ¤ Based on assumptions from constitutional theory, this book examines the effects of international investment law on domestic constitutions and finds that the democratic compromise on property protection and the protection of legal positions under international investment law are structured differently. Protection of property under international investment law is oriented towards a high standard of protection for investors, while the democratic compromise on property protection strikes a balance between property protection on the one hand and public welfare interests on the other. The constitutions of Germany, South Africa and Australia and investment disputes concerning these countries (including Philip Morris and Vattenfall) serve as case illustrations. In addition, the study shows that the divergence between these two legal principles can also lead to a transformation of the democratic property compromise.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062801-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011413-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013793-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115712-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4238208-7>
Third-order optical nonlinearities of glass-metal nanocomposites ¤ Third-order nonlinearity; Anisotropy; Surface plasmon resonance; Femtosecond Z-scan; Hot electron contribution; Saturable absorption; Optical limiting; Two-photon absorption; Kerr-lensing; Optical diode In this work, third-order optical nonlinearities of metal-glass nanocomposites with various geometric anisotropies are investigated using Z-scan experiments. For uniformly aligned, spherical Ag nanoparticles, polarization-resolved studies provide separate access to longitudinal or transverse plasmon resonances. At suitable wavelengths, a sign change of the nonlinearity is observed upon rotating the polarization by 90°. The increased electron temperature forms the main contribution to the optical nonlinearity of the material at femtosecond pulses; the frequency dependence can be explained by the field enhancement factors in the vicinity of the plasmon resonances. In samples featuring spherical Ag nanoparticles in a thin surface layer, a direction-dependent nonlinear transmission is observed, which can be explained by a numerical model for a two-layer system in the vicinity of thin samples (relative to the Rayleigh length of the laser beam).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038893-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042096-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4768127-5>
Positive Justice Obligations towards Refugees: A Good-Theory Investigation of the Obligations of Collective Actors in the Context of Flight ¤ This book deals with the philosophical question of what justice obligations exist towards refugees, particularly on the part of Western democracies. To this end, the discussion of positive justice obligations in general is first addressed, from which the case of refugees is then investigated. For this purpose, the discussion of the investigation of the responsible collective actors such as national states or the EU is expanded. Finally, this book critically examines the possible limitations of such justice obligations towards refugees in terms of the criteria of objective emergency, responsibility, admissibility, acceptability, and prospect of success.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154680-5>
Development of a traceable atomic force microscope with interferometer and compensation flexure stage ¤ Scanning probe microscopes, including scanning tunneling microscopes (STM) and atomic force microscopes (AFM), are widely used in material and surface research, semiconductor technology, and biotechnology. They are also possible tools for nanotechnology, such as nanolithography. In addition, they can be used for atomic manipulation and nanometrology. Commercial AFMs consist of a laser, photodetector, controller, piezo drive system, and sensor system. The piezoelements of the drive system are of particular importance. The known disadvantages of piezoelements, such as nonlinearity, hysteresis, aging, thermal drift, creep, and crosstalk, can cause up to 20% of the measurement deviations during forward control. Therefore, AFMs should be regularly recalibrated in accordance with metrological standards to reduce measurement uncertainty. The goal of the present work was to develop a traceable atomic force microscope (TAFM) for use as a national standard for traceable measurement of standards in the nanometer range for the Taiwanese industry. The TAFM was designed and built as a combination of a commercial AFM, two laser interferometers, an actively controlled three-axis precision guidance, a metrology frame made of Super-Invar, a vibration damping, and a temperature-controlled housing. To reduce the Abbe offset, the interferometers were arranged in such a way that their virtually extended measurement rays intersect at the cantilever tip and directly on the sample surface at the measurement point. A faultless reference movement of the system was ensured by the precision guidance used, while the direct traceability to the definition of the length unit „Meter“ was achieved by the use of two laser interferometers. The measured expanded measurement uncertainty of the TAFM for lateral measurement of a length of 292 nm was 2.5 nm at a statistical confidence of 95% considering 29 degrees of freedom. Since the measured expanded measurement uncertainty for lateral length measurements is not yet satisfactory and the traceability in the direction of the Z-axis is not guaranteed, the TAFM should be improved to achieve a measurement uncertainty of 0.5 nm in all three measurement axes in the future. This goal can initially be achieved by the installation of an additional laser interferometer for calibration of the Z-axis measurement system. In addition, the housing should be placed on the less vibrating floor instead of a table, which should reduce the noise of the interferometers to less than 5 nm. A strengthened metrology frame, the relocation of the reference mirrors from the AFM to the precision guidance, shortened measurement paths, the construction of all parts from the same material, a symmetrical mechanical design, and the use of an active temperature control with a temperature stability of 20°C ± 0.1 °C are further important steps.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274473-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4198763-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4333578-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140511-0>

Religious Strategies of the 'Achievable' Society: Administered Religion and Islamist Utopia in Turkey ¤ This study places Turkish Islam in the historical context of modern societal relationships and analyzes it through two subject areas. The state-administered religion, represented by the Religious Authority, is tasked with providing the 'moral glue' for the nationally-constituted society. In contrast, the Islamists who strengthened in the 1990s see Islam as the basis for an alternative societal model. Through the example of the Islamist 'utopia', Levent Tezcan shows how intellectual Islamism - contrary to its anti-modern semantics - is embedded in the structures of modern world perception. Of particular importance are the totalitarian features hidden in the Islamist concept of the ideal society. Neither is it the author's concern to simply apply the concept of secularism to Turkish practice, nor to demonstrate the modernity of the Islamists. Rather, he works out the culturally-specific translations of modern discourses, practices, and institutions, in relation to both of the forms of Islamic religiosity dealt with here.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041251-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056618-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137178-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027743-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4259885-0>
Integrated Communication in Multi-Stage Markets: Theoretical and Empirical Analysis at the Example of the Swiss Mobile Communications Industry ¤ Numerous concepts in science and practice aim at a networking and uniform orientation of the communication instruments of companies. In most cases, one-stage markets are taken into account, i.e. the communication activities occur primarily from the provider to the target groups. However, many industries are faced with multi-stage markets, in which an intermediate placement of sales intermediaries poses a threat to the realization of effective and efficient integrated communication. Sales intermediaries exercise influential communication functions that the providers can only influence, steer, and control to a limited extent. Kristina Lasotta examines the emergence and elimination of possible conflicts and deficits of integrated communication in multi-stage markets. Expert interviews in the Swiss mobile communications industry serve as the basis for the empirical investigation. From the gained knowledge, the author derives action recommendations for management to coordinate and control sales intermediaries.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124514-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131075-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4711541-5>
Conceptualising transnational corporate groups for international criminal law ¤ This volume proposes a concept of the transnational corporate group for international criminal law. The analysis of international law, EU competition law, US and English law, as well as economic theories shows the corporate group as an economic unit, when control power and actual exercise of control are present. The book complements the criminal law debate with a hitherto neglected corporate law perspective and creates more clarity regarding the contours and necessary elements of the transnational corporate group. The criteria arise from a thorough analysis of transnational, cross-border characteristics of the corporate group in the examined legal orders. The main focus lies on the actual exercise of control and its various forms. As a result of the synthesis, a detailed and economically secured concept of the transnational corporate group stands, which is considered as a potential addressee of international criminal law norms.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032356-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075092-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188481-4>

The Enemy of the People Ideology: A Critique of Right-Wing Propaganda ¤ Publisher's information: The internal connection of German right-wing radicalism, from the völkisch precursors of Hitler to the NPD, can only be partially derived from the number and importance of former Pg's in neo-Nazi parties or from the literal agreement of programs, which are naturally determined by tactical considerations. Extremely fruitful, however, is the investigation of those identical basic categories and emotions of right-wing radical ideology and propaganda, which remains recognizable through all disguises. The investigation by the political scientist Hermann Bott, which is supported by a wealth of quotes, recognizes the egocentric, compromise- and environmentally hostile nationalism as the actual psychological-propagandistic axis of the right-wing radical groups. Xenophobia in its various forms as the mirror image of German national introversion is the actual content of this political extremism. The most surprising and depressing result of this investigation is that, in addition to	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076374-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048829-9>
Mikroplastik im Niedersächsischen Wattenmeer und in der Unterweser : Quellen, Senken und die Auswirkungen auf benthische Organismen ¤ In dieser Arbeit wurden die Sedimentproben durch Dichtetrennung der leichteren Partikel vom relativ schweren Sediment isoliert, so dass die leichteren Plastikpartikel an der Oberfläche schwimmend erwartet wurden. Die Quantifizierung und Erkennung von Mikroplastik ohne teure technische Hilfsmittel ist jedoch schwierig und hängt folglich im hohen Maße von der individuellen Beurteilung ab. Die Identifikation wurde auf der Grundlage von Merkmalen wie Glanz, helle oder spezifische unnatürliche Farben, Formen und Strukturen, sowie eine ihr eigene elastische Konsistenz oder Härte hergestellt. In den Sedimentproben dominierten überwiegend kugelförmige Partikel, während in fast allen Wasserproben erkennbar Fasern und in geringer Zahl kugelförmige Partikel festzustellen waren, Fragmente von Folien wurden nur selten gefunden. Auch in den Magen-Darm-Inhalten von Fischen sowie Muscheln dominierten Fasern. Dies zeigt eine tiefgreifende Kontamination der marinen Umwelt durch Mikroplastikpartikel im untersuchten Gebiet auf. <dt.> In this research paper, the sediment samples were isolated by a density separation procedure segregating light particles from heavy ones so that the light elements floated on the water surface. However, quantification and detection of micro plastics is very difficult without expensive technical equipment consequently depending eminently on individual evaluation. In that case, the identification was realized by determining features according to luster, light or specifically unnatural colors, formes and structures as well as to consistency, or hardness. For this purpose, a special tweezer was used. In the sediment samples globular particles dominated, whereas in nearly all water samples, fibers made up a larger portion and furthermore a smaller number of globular particles were found. Fragments of plastic film were detected more rarely. But also in digestive tract contents of fish and molluscs fibers dominated. This fact suggests a profound contamination of the marine environment caused by micro plastic particles occurring in the study area. <eng.> END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000098-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064847-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/117071482X>
Differences in traits between co-occurring alien and native plant species of annual riparian plant communities ¤ alien species, annual plant communities, congeneric species, functional traits, invasive species, phenotypic integration, plant abundance, riparian ecosystems, seed heteromorphism, vegetation survey Knowledge about traits driving invasions of alien plants can help to prevent future invasions and inform on interactions between alien and native species. Riparian systems are especially prone to invasions by alien plants due to their high disturbance regime and anthropogenic modifications what makes them valuable study areas. In this thesis I ask: How alien riparian species differ in their traits from co-occurring resident native species? Can alien species invading riparian ecosystems better adapt to environmental heterogeneity in comparison to co-occurring native species? Are abundances of alien and native species co-occurring in riparian plant communities driven by the same traits? To answer these questions, I conducted three studies comparing trait values, trait variances and relations between traits and plant abundances. I found that alien and native species differ in trait values rather than in trait variances. Moreover, abundances of alien and native species depend on different traits. Observed differences in traits and strategies suggest that investigated alien and native species may coexist in natural ecosystems, like riparian habitats.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036045-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045563-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7713286-5>

Investigation on the Optimization of Physical-Technical Parameters for the Evaluation and Annealing of Thermoluminescence Dosimeters of Type TLD-100H ¤ Thermoluminescence dosimeter, TLD-100H, X-ray radiation. - The aim of the present work was the optimization of the selection and annealing procedures of a thermoluminescence dosimetry system for the measurement of X-ray radiation, as it occurs in the context of diagnostic X-ray examinations in animals. Since the radiation exposures for humans are generally only low in this case, the use was aimed at measurements in a possibly lowest dose range. Furthermore, the energy dependence of the used dosimeters was investigated during the measurement of X-ray radiation. In addition to the variation of the annealing and selection parameters, it was investigated to what extent the dosimetry system can be optimized by post-processing of the measurement results. The influence of the different parameter variations was evaluated using the lower detection limit of the TLD according to DIN 6818. The goal was a possibly lowest lower detection limit. The dosimeters investigated were thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLD) of type TLD 100H (Harshaw / Thermo), for reading the TLD an automatic TL-Reader 5500 (Harshaw/Thermo) was used. This was also used for annealing (tempering) the dosimeters, in addition to a temperature oven type 1301 (PTW). For calibrating the TLD, an irradiator (model 2210, Thermo) was used. The measurement results are transmitted from the TL-Reader to a computer and stored there in the form of glow curves. At low radiation exposure, the glow curves are influenced by noise signals. Therefore, the glow curves were smoothed and cut using a mathematical algorithm. This glow curve processing led to ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4331525-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4335462-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178324-4>
Social-Media-Data : Opportunities and Challenges of Using Social-Media-Data in the Context of Scientific Research ¤ Within the scope of the present work, opportunities and challenges of social media data analyses have been shown. In order to utilize the potential of these, an interdisciplinary approach is required. While the present publications could still be realized by an individual, it becomes clear that the inclusion of different disciplines requires intensified cooperation. The extension of agent-based simulation by the „Mean Field Game Theory“ requires, for example, advanced knowledge of physics, sentiment analysis requires cooperation between linguists and computer scientists, cluster analysis requires cooperation between data analysts and sociologists. In order to enhance the potential of the analysis results, economists should be involved or are drivers and value creators. Therefore, intensified cooperation is to be expected in the future, which will lead to complex forms of cooperation. This, in turn, requires concepts and frameworks to make cooperation transparent and understandable.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4401218-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4639271-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135391-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017894-8>

Resistance situation in agricultural livestock – Representative epidemiological studies on extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae in Germany ¤ ESBL, antibiotic resistance, livestock. - Within the research consortium „RESET“, a cross-sectional study was conducted. For this purpose, samples from animals and their environment were taken from agricultural farms with pigs, cattle, dairy cows, or broiler chickens and examined for Cefotaxim-resistant E. coli. In addition, possible risk factors were recorded in a questionnaire. The results of the pig and broiler chicken species are presented here. In total, 48 pig farms and 34 broiler chicken farms were sampled, which are distributed over four different regions in Germany. The regions differ significantly in terms of farm structure and size as well as animal numbers. From each farm, six pooled fecal, two sock drag, and two dust samples were taken, which were examined for the presence of resistant E. coli. Cefotaxim-resistant E. coli were found in 85% of pig farms and 100% of broiler chicken farms. The resistant bacteria were more frequently found in the animal's immediate environment (feces, sock drag). The examined dust samples were less frequently positive, but the number in the broiler chicken farms was unexpectedly high. In total, the results show a high prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli in German pig farming. The analysis of risk factors for the occurrence of ESBL-producing E. coli was difficult, as the high number of positive samples and the limited number of investigated farms resulted in low statistical power. Furthermore, the investigated factors are generally strongly associated with each other. The high level of standardization of agricultural processes (especially in poultry farming) leads to very homogeneous study collectives, which significantly hinders the identification of risk factors. The analyzed factors, however, provide a first overview of possible criteria that favor the occurrence of resistant bacteria in animal husbandry. These include farm management, stall hygiene, and architectural features of the barns. Good management of the entire farm, which deals with the prevention of diseases and has clear structures, especially in terms of cleaning and disinfection of the animal's immediate environment, can contribute to reducing the occurrence of resistances. The ultimate goal of reducing the occurrence of resistance in animal husbandry is the reduction of antibiotic use through general improvement of animal health. This can be achieved through improved living conditions and targeted preventive measures such as vaccinations. In addition, the transfer of resistant bacteria from breeding animals to the fattening animals must be avoided. It is also necessary to further improve hygiene measures in the farms. A further intensive monitoring of the resistance situation should contribute to identifying possible deficits, in order to promote the reduction of resistance.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1048715485> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002257-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070959-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169065-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143180-7>
Compulsory Licenses on Patents ¤ The refusal of a license is one of the fundamental rights of the patent holder. At the same time, it can be suitable in individual cases to completely shut off markets and delay their development by years. In this field of tension, the compulsory license in patent law could form an appropriate alternative to the cartel law solution approach. However, this fails due to its lack of practical significance. Case law and literature therefore follow the cartel law approach, which, however, has to contend with valuation contradictions insofar as a cartel law intervention requires the existence of an abuse of dominance. Such can be particularly not always contradiction-free justified in the case of pure exercise of a patent. The investigation also shows on the basis of the history of the patent law why a solution approach located in the patent law is the correct one from a substantive point of view. By transferring the insights gained in this way to the cartel law approach, a solution is sought that is also practically feasible. The result shows how, from a competition law perspective, necessary interventions can remain possible in individual cases and at the same time grant the patent holder a minimum amount of legal certainty regarding the exercise of his right of protection.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044884-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191193-3>
Heute gucken wir einen Film ¤ Out of the historical didactic discussion on the potential of the medium, an online-based study with nearly 400 history teachers was conducted, in which the teachers were asked about their assessment of the historical didactic potential as well as their previous goals and experiences in analyzing historical feature films in the classroom. As a result, empirical data on the use of historical feature films in history class can be presented for the first time. In addition, the present volume offers some suggestions for methodical implementation in history class, which were compiled based on the results of the study. The volume thus opens up perspectives for the use of historical feature films in the classroom. <dt.>END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020533-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160024-1>
The Mediality of Theater in Frank Wedekind: A Media-Theoretical Investigation of the Influence of the Minstrel and Actor Frank Wedekind on His Work ¤ Frank Wedekind - Light and Shadow of Munich Culture at the Turn of the Century - today a Classic of Modernity. The relatively early death of the author, his provocative and avant-garde themes, and the resulting conflicts with censorship and the public, up to the famous prison sentence for lèse-majesté, are responsible for the fact that early research avoided this author as enfant terribile. Wedekind also transcends, as a director of his own plays, as an actor and cabaret artist, the traditional role assignments to a poet, so that his reputation appears from the beginning in a dubious twilight. This work turns to the analysis of the work with the help of feminist and psychoanalytic models, so that an interesting and productive mixture of philological practice and analytical innovation has arisen, which can open up groundbreaking perspectives. The work is based on extremely comprehensive source studies, which the author conducted in five archives in three countries	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4538159-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012899-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143894-2>
Development of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry methods for the detection of mycotoxins in house dust ¤ Über die Prävalenz von Mykotoxinen im Hausstaub (Altstaub, ≤ 63 mym) aus Wohnungen mit und ohne sichtbaren Schimmelpilzbefall ist bisher nur wenig bekannt. Vor diesem Hintergrund war das Ziel dieser Arbeit die Entwicklung von sensitiven und selektiven LC-MS Methoden zur Quantifizierung und Identifizierung von ausgewählten Mykotoxinen. Die Mykotoxine Citrinin, Deoxynivalenol, Ochratoxin A und Sterigmatocystin wurden im unteren myg/kg Hausstaub Bereich quantifiziert. Ein eindeutiger Zusammenhang zwischen einem Schimmelpilzbefall und den nachgewiesenen Mykotoxinen konnte nicht festgestellt werden. Mittels verschiedener LC-MS-Messverfahren konnten Satratoxin G, H und ihre Isomere von Stachybotrys chartarum auch ohne Bezug auf Referenzsubstanzen anhand des Fragmentierungsmusters und der Bestätigung der Summenformel nachgewiesen werden. Die Untersuchung der Hausstaubproben zeigt trotz weniger positiver Befunde, dass Mykotoxine in gesundheitlich relevanten Konzentrationen vorhanden sind. <dt.> The occurrence of mycotoxins in house dust (unknown age, ≤ 63 mym) from households with and without visible mould is mostly unknown. Because of this, the aim of my work was the development of sensitive and selective trace level monitoring LC-MS methods for quantification and identification of selected mycotoxins. In the analyzed house dust samples citrinin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin A and sterigmatocystin could be quantified in the lower myg/kg house dust range. There was no distinct correlation of a mould infestation in the household and the occurrence of mycotoxins. With different LC-MS approaches the mycotoxins satratoxin G, H and their isomers from the mould Stachybotrys chartarum could be identified without reference substances by fragmentation pattern and the verification of sum formulas. The determination of the selected mycotoxins shows in spite of less-positive findings that these substances can be found in health-relevant concentrations. <engl.>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4329086-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040984-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183131-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4314227-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4539813-6>

Investigations on the Technofunctionality of Egg Yolk Fractions in Fine Baked Goods at the Example of Biscuit and Sand Cake ¤ Egg yolk fractions, cake structure, rheology. - In fine baked goods, such as biscuit and sand cake, the egg is the most important structuring ingredient. It is valued, in addition to taste and nutritional value, primarily due to its three outstanding technofunctional properties: thermal gelation, foam-forming ability, and excellent emulsifying properties, where the egg also plays a decisive role. Egg can now be cost-effectively and on an industrial scale separated into three main fractions: low-density lipoproteins (LDL), granula, and livetine, and freeze-dried using a special process. In this way, the technofunctional properties can be fully retained and utilized. The present work aimed to develop the technofunctional properties of newly developed freeze-dried egg yolk fractions (LDL, granula, livetine) in order to use them specifically in fine baked goods (biscuit/sand cake).

The Churches and the German National State: Confessional Contributions to the System's Existence and System Change ¤ Bastian Scholz presents the first diachronic, confessional comparative analysis of the state-political attitudes of both Christian major churches in Germany. He discusses their influence on the stability of the political systems of the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, as well as their role during state transformations. For Germany's history, the confessional division of the population was just as fateful as the numerous system transformations. The Catholic Church practiced general state distance after 1803, was an opportunistic and risk-averse pioneer of the constitutional state. Only in the Vatican II 1962-65 did it declare itself democratic. The Protestant Church opposed democratization in Germany for a long time and idealized the monarchy until the church split by Hitler. With the Federal Republic, only that system proved stable that had enjoyed the loyalty of both confessions at an early stage.

The Silent Limited Partner in the Public Limited Partnership: The Dogmatics of Qualified Trust, Its Liability Regime and Claims for Information ¤ The thesis examines the qualified trust in public limited partnerships with particular regards to general trust and association law. In doing so, the author comes to the conclusion that this legal figure actually conceals the historically not newly invented figure of the silent limited partner - the beneficiary becomes a genuine internal partner in the external association. Based on this, the practice-relevant areas of liability and claims for information about their identity are examined, whereby the author often arrives at innovative approaches. The work thus makes a valuable contribution to the treatment of qualified trusts in science and practice.

Risk Service Engineering : Information Models for Risk Management ¤ Effective risk management is one of the fundamental prerequisites for successful entrepreneurial action. Michael Schermann presents a modeling method that supports risk managers in the systematic development of measures for risk control. At its core is the concept of Risk Services as specific services to secure the value contribution of information management. As a foundation for method development, a critical examination of common concepts of risk management serves.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121590-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114012-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4776793-5>
Values and Education : Value Orientation in Pluralism as a Problem for Education and Teaching ¤ Although since the early 70s in Germany, values have been discussed in pedagogical contexts, the usage of the term is hardly explained.

Decisions under Uncertainty in Youth Media Protection: An Examination of the Decision-Making Factors of Legislative and Administrative Decisions with Knowledge Deficits ¤ Legal decision makers often encounter gaps in knowledge, yet still have to make a decision despite their uncertainty. Legislators can delegate this uncertainty to decision makers under them, which can lead to regulatory advantages if, for example, more informed decision makers can adapt more flexibly to changing conditions, scientific or technical findings, or social developments. At all decision-making levels, however, the question arises as to how far the form of uncertainty, the strategies used in its legal processing and constitutional guidelines have to be taken into account when it comes to filling in gaps in legal decision-making. This study adopts a perspective focused on the uncertainty in decisions made within the context of protecting of minors against harmful media and examines the specific forms of gaps in knowledge in this area and their interwoven margins of appreciation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4232692-8>
Motivation through Relationship ¤ Relationship competence in school and teaching -- Classroom climate as a determinant of learning success -- Measurement instrument for assessing the relationship competence of teachers -- Collection of materials for designing a school pedagogical seminar. According to neuroscientific findings, our motivation system is significantly influenced by the quality of social relationships. Five aspects are crucial for building relationship competence. The motivating effect and superiority of these aspects over climate-relevant factors are empirically demonstrated by the author for the primary level. A measurement instrument and a concept for promoting the further education of teachers provide suggestions for practical implementation.

The Stabilization of the Ruble and the Transformation of the Russian Monetary System ¤ Contrary to the prevailing opinion, the author came to the conclusion that a sustainable stabilization of the Russian monetary system is not possible in the medium term. To prove this thesis, the author examined, using institutional economics, which unknown obstacles in market economies hindered the establishment of the necessary framework conditions in Russia and what expenses were necessary to overcome these obstacles. Today, the Russian economy presents a contradictory picture. The inflation rate has been kept at an astonishingly low level in recent years. At the same time, however, the institutional deficiencies persist. Above all, the financial discipline of economic subjects remains low. This is evident, for example, in the still high arrears in salary payments or in the business conduct of the banking sector. The value of the work lies in its contribution to understanding this unusual situation. It is precisely the deficiencies in the institutional framework conditions - such as bankruptcy law, banking supervision, but also the understanding of money as a scarce good - that make this contradictory picture possible from a market economic perspective.

Between Biopower and Life Power: Biopolitical Thinking in Michel Foucault and Ernst Jünger ¤ Are there parallels between Michel Foucault's and Ernst Jünger's political thinking? At first glance, this seems absurd. But Nasser Ahmed reveals the same type of biopolitical thinking in Foucault's 'The History of Sexuality, Volume 1' and Jünger's 'The Worker' and shows how close the two approaches are. Between biopower on the one hand and life power on the other, he illuminates a space that has remained invisible in previous political categorizations: Foucault and Jünger stand as biopolitical thinkers on the same side of a fundamental division of political thinking, which understands the political less as a function of communication, but rather as a function of struggle.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036824-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115590-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034831-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137810-6>
Characterisation of a laser wakefield accelerator with ultra-short probe pulses ¤ In this work, aspects of electron acceleration using a high-intensity laser in a underdense plasma were investigated. The underlying acceleration mechanism, where a plasma wave is generated by the laser pulse and propagates through the medium together with the laser pulse, is called laser wakefield acceleration. Due to the common propagation of the laser pulse and the plasma wave, the longitudinal alternating electric field of the plasma wave moves at nearly the speed of light, so that electrons captured in the field of this plasma wave can be accelerated to relativistic energies. While basic principles, such as the formation of the plasma wave, the injection of electrons into the accelerating phase of the wave, and the limits of the acceleration process are already known, the exact course of the nonlinear interaction processes between the laser pulse and the plasma wave is not yet sufficiently explored. The nonlinear interaction leads to strong fluctuations in the electron pulse parameters, which can affect, for example, differences in accelerated charge, end energy, or direction fluctuations. A central role is played by the position in the plasma where electrons are injected into the plasma wave, as this position significantly influences the maximum energy of the electrons. The injection of electrons into the plasma wave at a defined position is therefore a possibility to reduce shot-to-shot fluctuations and to enable the use of accelerated electron pulses, for example, as a stable secondary radiation source for time-resolved and spatially high-resolution imaging procedures. By investigating a method for controlled injection at an electron density jump, a connection between the properties of the density jump and various electron pulse parameters such as electron energy and accelerated charge could be reconstructed, which offers the prospect of application-specific adjustment of the electron pulses through targeted shaping of the density jump. Nevertheless, shot-to-shot fluctuations in the electron parameters could not be completely eliminated and are likely due to the nonlinear evolution of the laser pulse in the plasma. For the stabilization of the interaction processes, knowledge of their courses is indispensable, which requires a method for observing the plasma wave and the laser pulse. Using an ultra-short probe pulse in combination with a high-resolution imaging system, which were developed at the Institute for Optics and Quantum Electronics in Jena, the processes occurring in spatial and temporal scales of micrometers and femtoseconds can be investigated more accurately. With this system, characteristics of the magnet fields inseparably connected with the acceleration process could be investigated in unprecedented detail. The resulting deeper insights enabled the first observation of signatures of the magnet field of the driving laser pulse and pave the way for an indirect observation of the development of the laser pulse during the interaction.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151894-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4601119-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4222149-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174841-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1128828189> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129002-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136065-5>
Digital Culture at a Flat Rate? : Occasion, Content, and Limits of a Vision for Future Copyright Law ¤ Steht das Urheberrecht in der Informationsgesellschaft vor dem Kollaps oder kann eine 'Kulturflatrate' Abhilfe schaffen?

Social Relations and Student Success : The Importance of Social Relations for Student Success in Primary and Secondary School ¤ The present dissertation deals with the role of social relations for educational success in primary and secondary school in the German educational system. Whereas international studies in educational sociology have been considering different aspects of social capital for a long time, in national research in educational sociology comprehensive studies about effects of social relations within and outside the family on educational success are rare. Therefore the purpose of this dissertation thesis is, on the one hand, to test whether the theoretical assumptions referred to in international research can be transferred to the German educational system and thus whether the findings of international research can be replicated. One the other hand, the study takes a closer look at longitudinal aspects, which tend to be neglected in international research. The findings indicate that both parent-child-interaction and social relations outside the family substantially contribute to the explanation of educational success. In primary school it is of special importance to constantly hold strong and close relations and not to start investing in an improvement on the verge of transition. Whereas at this stage both the parental commitment within or outside the family and the children’s social relations within school are equally important, in secondary school the relevance of children’s relations increases.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077347-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022349-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124149-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079583-4>
Isolation of a Biopolymer from Genetically Modified Plants ¤ A crucial aspect in the use of renewable resources for the production of complex molecules is the isolation of the valuable substance from the corresponding matrix. Within the scope of the work, two procedures for the isolation of Cyanophycin from transgenic plant materials were established. With the help of the first procedure, the individual parameters of the isolation were optimized. Subsequently, in a second procedure, the coupling ability of the isolation of Cyanophycin from transgenic potato tubers was tested in connection with the large-scale process of starch production.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4681491-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029804-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016062-2>
Innovation Paths: Evolution and Institutionalization of Complex Technology ¤ The innovation path model presented by Uli Meyer opens up a new perspective on the development of complex technology. It integrates insights from sociological neo-institutionalism and social evolution theories to explain how innovation paths emerge and which mechanisms stabilize and strengthen them. The presented perspective takes into account that technology is increasingly produced in stable networks of many organizations and no longer by individual organizations or inventors. Innovation paths are expressions and drivers of the increasingly routinized and entrenched search for the new. The model is developed using the example of the establishment of electronic systems in the automotive industry, particularly driver assistance systems.

The Criminal Liability for the Submission of an Incorrect Balance Sheet Statement Pursuant to Section 331 No. 3a HGB ¤ In the context of the Implementation Act of the Transparency Directive, the German legislator introduced a new punitive norm in the field of balance sheet criminal law with Section 331 No. 3a HGB in 2007. By this, the submission of an incorrect 'balance sheet statement' for the annual and consolidated financial statements as well as for the position and consolidated position report by the statutory representatives of capital companies was placed under penalty. Since its entry into force, this punitive norm has raised numerous questions. In particular, against the background that incorrect accounting has been under penalty since time immemorial, the application area of Section 331 No. 3a HGB has been intensively discussed in the specialist literature. A clarifying court decision is still pending. -- The work deals with all questions relevant to science and business practice around the balance sheet statement. Among other things, the author researched for several months at the University of California in Berkeley to become familiar with US balance sheet law and balance sheet criminal law, whose modernization by the 'Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002' essentially laid the foundation for domestic legislation. A questionnaire survey conducted among the financial directors of all companies listed in the DAX, MDAX, and SDAX rounds off the presentation. -- Awarded by the Faculty of Law of the University of Cologne with the CBH Promotion Prize 2014.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006566-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186949-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131795-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151150-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129472-5>
Atomic vapor depositions of Metal Insulator Metal capacitors : investigation, development and integration ¤ Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) capacitors belong to the most important passive components in high-frequency circuit elements and switching circuits for analog/mixed signals. Regardless of the application, MIM capacitors claim up to 50% of the chip area. This significantly supports the reduction of the chip area, which strongly determines the costs, functionality, and performance of the chip. An increase in capacitance per area (capacitance density) is therefore the focus in further analog scaling of components. Since the capacitance is a direct function of the dielectric constant of the insulator, replacing the currently used silicon oxide or silicon nitride with alternative dielectrics with higher dielectric constants is a promising approach. The present work is mainly focused on the preparation and characterization of such alternative dielectrics, such as HfO2, Sr-Ta-O, and Ti-Ta-O, as well as the corresponding TiN electrodes. The investigations carried out showed that these dielectrics can represent promising materials for future silicon-based technologies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4249723-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160131-2>
From Transition to Defective Democracy ¤ The study inquires into the forms, conditions, and obstacles of successful transitions to liberal democracy in Asia. The starting point of the considerations is the assumption that democratic transformation processes can achieve three possible outcomes: the failure of democratization, successful democratic consolidation, or the emergence of a defective democracy. This third scenario of democratic transformation is at the center of the investigation. The comparative analysis of the transitions in the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand checks under which conditions different types of defective democracy arise. The investigation is divided into four sections. In the first section, the concept of defective democracy is introduced as a reference point for comparative democracy analysis and a framework for empirical investigation is formulated. In the second step, the authoritarian regimes and transition processes in the three countries are examined with regard to the institutionalization chances of liberal democracy. In the third part of the study, it is analyzed which defects shape democracy in the three countries. It is shown that in the 1990s in the three countries, a form of defective democracy replaced the enclave democracy threatened by the military and other veto powers. With regard to the Philippines, it is referred to as illiberal, for South Korea as delegative, and for Thailand as exclusive democracy. The analysis shows that the chances of enforcing political participation and civil liberties in young democracies are all the worse, the more segmented a society, the lower its socio-economic development level, and the lower the social dispersion of economic and cognitive power resources.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124941-0>
Sense and Relevance: Individual, Interaction, and Shared World as Dimensions of a Social Connection ¤ The Model of Coordination and its Failure -- Sense and Relevance? -- The Meaningful Individual -- The Social Connection and its Three Dimensions -- Relevance: the Two-Sided Dynamics of Sense -- Philosophy as Social Science? Does social coordination, especially in its modern forms, exclude the bodily individual, its fullness, and its immediate relationship to other unique people? Or does it, on the other hand, break down into a multitude of individual perspectives? These questions run through the philosophy and sociology of the 20th century. Both disciplines approach the issue on different levels. The interplay between individual perspectives, interactions in the here and now, and shared worlds that outlast our lives is often explained by language. However, the use of language presupposes an interplay of levels rather than grounding it. This book approaches the issue differently: individual, interaction, and shared world, so the thesis, are three dimensions of the same connection. In a critical development of Alfred Schütz' social theory, the concept pair 'sense' and 'relevance' is used to show how the three dimensions produce, structure, and change each other in open processes. This reveals an inner connection between philosophy and sociology.

Analysis of Telemetry Signals and Radar Return Signals for Reconstruction of Orbital Perturbations of Interplanetary Spacecraft, exemplified by the simulated descent dynamics of the Huygens Probe ¤ The Cassini/Huygens Mission is a joint venture between NASA and ESA, aiming to explore the Saturn system. The present work was carried out within the framework of the Doppler Wind Experiment. The goal of the work was to develop a method for determining the equilibrium position and amplitude of the pendulum movement of the Huygens probe during the descent on the Saturn moon Titan. The available data are the Doppler frequency shift and the reception power of the telemetry signal. In addition, there is the return signal of the radar altimeter. With the information of the telemetry signal, a deterministic approach and a stochastic approach were developed to determine the parameters of the pendulum movement, depending on whether the measurement data provide sufficient information about the movement, or whether a periodicity of the movement is present. With the return signal of the radar altimeter, an interactive procedure was developed in addition to this purpose.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184655-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173653-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4402067-3>
The Development of European Public Sector Accounting Standards (EPSAS) : An Empirical Analysis and Evaluation of Expert Opinions ¤ The term „European Public Sector Accounting Standards“ (EPSAS) is a designation for the idea of developing uniform European accounting standards for the public sector. EPSAS are at the focus of various professional discussions at the federal, state, and local levels as well as at the European level. The current engagement with the topic dates back to 2011. The present book offers a broad insight into the current EPSAS discussion. In particular, the dealing with the different opinions of the selected experts shows both the regularly heterogeneous consideration of the topic and the fundamental consensus on the need for harmonized accounting principles for EU member states. In the current debate, the question of the design of these regulations is controversially discussed. The goal was therefore to verify the purposes and principles derived from theory as well as the peculiarities of public accounting based on expert opinions in order to finally work out concrete design priorities. The author Kevin Lorenz is a representative in the principles department of the Hessian Court of Auditors and prepared the thesis in the framework of the Master's degree in the field of Finance & Accounting at the FOM University.

Municipal Obligatory Tasks of a Constitutional Nature ¤ Prompted by a decision of the Federal Administrative Court, which has shaken the established doctrine of the constitutional guarantee of self-government and has unsettled municipal practice, the work deals with the hitherto hardly noticed question of whether, with the right of municipalities to self-responsible regulation of their affairs, a corresponding obligation also corresponds to taking on certain tasks. -- The investigation, which, in addition to Art. 28(2) GG, also deals with the state law guarantees and further points of reference in federal and state constitutional law, comes to a clearly negative result. The figure of the constitutionally direct obligatory task is problematic from a constitutional point of view in multiple ways, counteracts the financial security mechanisms in favor of the municipalities and breaks through the balanced system of responsibility distribution between lawmakers and self-government bodies without necessity.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140391-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019956-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073644-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062801-2>
Gymnasium and Full-Day School: A Videographic Case Study on the Constitution of Pedagogical Order ¤ Change in school and learning cultural practices -- Videography and reconstruction of gymnasial school and learning culture -- A full-day gymnasium in Rhineland-Palatinate as a case study -- Gymnasialization as a program Isabel Neto Carvalho shows in the case of a gymnasium that and how „gymnasialization of students and students“ through full-day school offers becomes the new pedagogical program of a school that can no longer simply assume the suitability of its clientele, as professionals desire. The author reconstructs from a practice-theoretically-micrological perspective and on the basis of expert interviews and teaching videographies the learning culture of a gymnasium that is under reform pressure due to a pluralized student body and competition with other schools at the location. The gymnasium therefore structures itself as a full-day school and hopes for this modernization option to have more time for the implementation of appropriate pedagogical concepts.

E-Learning at the University of Rostock : an explorative, quantitative online trend survey on the actual use of Stud.IP ¤ In the present dissertation, the use of the learning management system Stud.IP at the University of Rostock was investigated. The introductory chapters are devoted to a reflection of e-learning and provide an overview of the current state of online research. The focus of the work lies on the implementation and reflection of the three-stage online trend survey. The results of the survey (126 teachers and 1164 students) show a reserved use of the many functionalities of the platform. In a concluding chapter, new research perspectives are shown.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4727098-6>
Evaluation and disaggregation of climate model outputs for european drought prediction ¤ Agricultural droughts lead to high social and economic damages. The impacts of these extreme events can be mitigated with the help of a seasonal forecasting system, which predicts droughts several months in advance. The forecasting system, which is developed in this work, is based on meteorological forecasts of the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME), which are used to drive the mesoscale Hydrological Model (mHM). A newly developed stochastic procedure is used to disaggregate the monthly precipitation forecasts of the NMME dataset into daily values. This procedure receives the spatial covariance of precipitation through the newly presented "Anchor"-Sampling on arbitrarily large grids. The obtained forecasts are compared with those of the Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) approach. The evaluation period ranges from 1983 to 2009. The simulation area covers large parts of Continental Europe. The forecasts based on NMME show a 69% higher predictive accuracy at a six-month forecast period than the ESP approach. There is a substantial spatial and temporal variability of up to 40%. A standard approach in drought forecasting is to either evaluate the forecasts of individual models or the ensemble mean. The ensemble mean showed a higher accuracy than any individual model. However, the predictive accuracy of a subensemble (a subgroup of models), which was efficiently found by the newly developed backward elimination algorithm, is only 1% lower. The number of model runs of this subensemble is, however, only 60% of the total ensemble. The methods presented in this work for identifying subensembles and temporally disaggregating precipitation are not limited to the considered application and can also be transferred to other applications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026309-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039798-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031170-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013248-1>
Barrier-Free Healthcare : Legal Guarantee under Special Consideration of Legal Enforcement ¤ The work deals with the right to barrier-free healthcare for people with disabilities. Against the backdrop of inadequate barrier-free provision by service providers (doctors, hospitals, rehabilitation facilities, etc.) and service providers (e.g. health insurance companies), the question is pursued of which normative provisions existed in this area. Considering the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, it becomes clear that a wide range of norms in public infrastructure and service law as well as civil law demand barrier-free access and appropriate arrangements for discrimination-free care. In the focus, the special instruments for enforcing the applicable law are dealt with in more detail. The perspective is here on the action options of people with disabilities affected, interest groups and state authorities. Finally, proposals for the application and further development of the law are shown.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4696474-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4335203-0>
Digital Media in Religious and Ethics Education: Condition Factors for Media Integration at Schools ¤ Bildungsprozesses with, in, and through digital media are increasingly established in school. The individual subject didactics are faced with the challenge of evaluating methods and topics that are inherent to them and integrating meaningful ones by modifying them accordingly for the respective subject. The teacher plays a crucial role in this. The present empirical work analyzes the factors that condition the integration of digital media in ethics or religion lessons, against the background of the respective subject didactics, in order to name possible action options for teacher training.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4196910-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049422-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152104-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015604-7>

The formation of strategic business ventures forms the foundation of strategic planning and is therefore indispensable for medium-sized and large companies. The more surprising it is that hardly any empirically supported assistance for business formation exists. Esther M. Thahabi develops practically-normative recommendations for business formation in the form of basic variants, decision criteria, and a procedure. The foundations of these recommendations are a systematic literature analysis and synthesis as well as an empirical, qualitative investigation in the form of case studies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031031-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124261-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075092-9>
Federal Climate Protection Legislation in Germany in the Light of the Well-Ordered Law ¤ The climate change has also caused activism in Germany. Individual federal states have adopted their own climate protection laws with their own climate protection goals. But what contribution can these state climate protection laws make in the federal multi-level system in Germany? How are they designed? What action spaces exist? And what can they not achieve?In the present work, the state climate protection laws of North Rhine-Westphalia, Baden-Württemberg, and Rhineland-Palatinate are comprehensively presented, compared with each other, and evaluated with a view to a well-ordered law. The investigation also includes approaches of the other federal states, the federal level, as well as selected European countries with their own climate protection laws. Under special consideration of the federalism prevailing in Germany and the concept of a well-ordered law, the advantages and disadvantages are determined, as well as ideas for the further development of the state climate protection laws are worked out	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020682-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547705-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017754-3>
The Flexibility Clause in the European Integration Process: Article 352 TFEU (ex-Art. 308 EC) as an Instrument of Soft Constitutionalization ¤ In the context of the current economic and financial crisis, the question of the future of European integration has gained particular urgency. Verena Schäfer discusses the possibilities of soft constitutionalization and the associated contractual development of the integration process using the flexibility clause, which was first reformed by the Treaty of Lisbon. The author explains the special character of the targeted empowerment and analyzes how it was used by the heads of state and government of the member states as a door opener to explore new areas of action at the European level in the period from 1958 to 2012. It shows that the so-called 'general clause' criticized by the German federal states for a long time has been effective in many policy areas. Using the areas of environmental policy, research and technology policy, regional policy, consumer protection, development cooperation, and energy policy, it can be shown that the flexibility clause has made a decisive contribution to the expansion of the sectoral dimension of the integration process. The example of EU enlargement also shows how necessary such an instrument is to be able to react quickly to unforeseen challenges within the EU. The content The foundations of the dynamic development of European integration The flexibility clause (Article 352 TFEU, ex-Article 308 EC, ex-Article 235 EC) as a special case of the EU competence order The role of the flexibility clause for the development of the sectoral dimension of the integration process from the perspective of the fusion thesis The use of the flexibility clause for the development of the sectoral dimension of the integration process in the period from 1958 to 2012 The target groups Lecturers and students of political science and European law Politicians in the European Union The Author Verena Schäfer is a research assistant at the Institute for Political Science of the Justus-Liebig University Giessen.

More than Rock 'n' Roll : the AFN Radio Station until the Mid-Sixties ¤ The American Forces Network has become a legend in Germany. The American Forces Network should have inspired and 'Americanized' several generations of young Germans with popular music and relaxed moderators after World War II. Anja Schäfers examines the institutional, programmatic, and effectiveness history of the sender until the mid-1960s and comes to differentiated judgments: It becomes clear that AFN was not a pure music sender, but offered a versatile program with information, education, and entertainment. As a sender of US forces, he was embedded in a military system and involved in the Cold War. Only a fraction of German youth tuned in to AFN and mostly perceived it selectively. Nevertheless, the sender played a not insignificant role in the social conflicts in West and East Germany. Anja Schäfers studied history, American studies, and journalism at the universities of Hamburg and Oklahoma. Professional activities as a journalist and historian. Currently, scientific project assistant at the Foundation House of the History of the Federal Republic of Germany.

The Accelerated Procedure of the StPO and its Legal-Practical Implementation in Berlin and Brandenburg ¤ Publisher's information: Regular demands for relief of the judiciary are being made. A significant step in this direction was attempted by the legislator in 1994 with the restructuring of the accelerated procedure. Can the provisions of § 417-420 StPO be described as a success model? Is the legislator's hope of increased application being fulfilled? Or does the sometimes vehement criticism of the literature, which sees dangers to the discovery of truth and the principles of the rule of law in the accelerated procedure, prove to be correct? These questions are examined by Tobias Lubitz, who discusses the legal regulation and checks the various goals, individual problems, and criticism points using empirical research (document analysis). The evaluation shows that the legislator's hopes for increased application and relief remain unfulfilled. However, it becomes apparent that, using § 417-420 StPO, criminal proceedings can be concluded more quickly. Nevertheless, the prerequisites of the procedure are not sufficiently taken into account by practice. In some cases, there is a period of one and a half years between the commission of the offense and the 'accelerated' procedure. According to Lubitz, the decisive innovation for shortening the main hearing (§ 420 StPO) should be abolished. It contains significant dangers, is rarely applied, and appears to be ineffective. Based on the findings, the author can give a legal-political recommendation that hardly affects the acceleration possibilities, but at the same time better protects the rights of the accused. However, according to Lubitz, it remains to be considered whether the legislator's chosen path, which aims to increase efficiency by reducing individual rights, is the right one.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144869-8>
Science and Theology : Theoretical Perspectives in the Context of Religious Educational Considerations ¤ In this volume, the relationship between science and theology is fundamentally reflected from a religious educational perspective. Based on various empirical studies, the question is first addressed of how children, young people, and adults relate science and theology in their everyday theories. Subsequently, theoretical considerations on characteristic relationship models of science and theology (conflict, independence, dialogue, and integration model) are found. The consequences resulting from the empirical and theoretical considerations are deepened in the background of the corresponding pedagogical and subject didactic discussion and developed in view of the training and further education of teachers for religion and adult education.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049412-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041421-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059758-1>

Cross Buying Extended in Multi Partner Bonus Programs: A Critical Analysis ¤ Introduction -- Framework of the Cross Buying construct -- Development of the Cross Buying extended construct -- Multi Partner Bonus programs -- Cross Buying extended in Multi Partner Bonus programs -- Results of the empirical study -- Conclusion and final consideration. An economic success of bonus programs has not been clearly established in the context of customer relationship management at companies so far. However, the additional purchasing behavior of customers receives a higher value: due to the connecting element of the common bonus system, customers concentrate their purchasing behavior on the partners of the program. Heike Papenhoff investigates the effects of the extended additional purchasing behavior, the Cross Buying extended behavior, in Multi Partner Bonus programs. She derives the influencing factors from an economic perspective and develops a comprehensive measurement model within a two-stage study. For the study, longitudinal data of one of the largest German Multi Partner Bonus programs are available. The author confirms the influence of the drivers switching costs and attractiveness of the partners. She shows that the redemption behavior and the feature of customer participation duration within the bonus program play a significant role in evaluating the positive Cross Buying extended effects.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4515875-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4234501-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4236865-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4384508-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4146278-6>
The Natural Law 'Political Metaphysics' of Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi (1717 - 1771) ¤ Dust jacket: With his independent general theory of the state, the 'political metaphysics', Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi (1717 - 1771) shows himself as perhaps the most progressive state thinker in Germany in the middle of the 18th century. Considering his extensive overall work, an attempt is made for the first time to present his state and constitutional thinking comprehensively and to assign it historically in terms of its impact.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041411-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076226-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077784-4>
Plenarvorbehalt and Delegation : on the Transfer of Plenary Competences to Committees ¤ The work deals with the topic of internal parliamentary delegations, i.e. the question of whether and under what conditions the competences of the plenum can be transferred to committees and other parliamentary sub-divisions. Such delegations serve the functionality of Parliament, but impair the democracy and representation principle. Nevertheless, both preparatory and decision-making competences are generally delegable. When evaluating specific delegations, a distinction must then be made between an absolute and a relative limit. At the absolute limit, delegations fail that have essential competences as their subject, at the relative limit, delegations fail that do not withstand the weighing of the affected constitutional principles and goods. For the evaluation of when a competence is essential and when a delegation is proportionate, a catalog of various, general criteria can be referred to.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068155-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173380-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4280463-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122855-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129507-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011362-0>
Special Legal Questions in Connection with a Foundation & Co. KG ¤ Introduction -- The emergence of a foundation & Co. KG, -- The special asset protection of a foundation & Co. KG in its operational phase -- The unitary foundation & Co. KG -- Individual special problems of the governance of a foundation & Co. KG -- Entrepreneurial co-determination in the management foundation of a KG?. A foundation may, in principle, participate in a KG as a complementor pursuant to Sections 80 et seq. of the BGB, in order to manage this KG. However, the permissibility of the extent of this participation is disputed, i.e., how the articles of association of such a management foundation and how the articles of association of the KG must be designed in order for the participation of the foundation as a complementor to be legally compliant. The present book provides answers to these legal questions. The author Alexander Oberdiek was initially active in the justice of the state of Baden-Württemberg as a public prosecutor and was appointed by the Ministry of Justice to represent the state of Baden-Württemberg at the EU in Brussels as a departmental commissioner.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4294831-9>
The Special Court at the Hanseatic Higher Regional Court: An Examination of the NS Special Courts with Special Consideration of the Application of the Ordinance against People Harmful to the State ¤ The special courts for criminal cases established shortly after the National Socialists' seizure of power in the German Reich are considered a typical manifestation of the system of injustice and are often mentioned in the same breath as the People's Court. The work examines the activity of the special court at the Hanseatic Higher Regional Court based on an evaluation of the main proceedings registers, the general files, the personnel files, and a sample of ten percent of the files of all so-called people harmful to the state proceedings. In particular, the question is pursued of how far in practice the procedural objectives formulated by the National Socialist rulers have been fulfilled. In this context, the application of the Ordinance against People Harmful to the State is subjected to a thorough examination. This, as the so-called core piece of war penal law, had the greatest importance of all special laws enacted during the war.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115710-2>
Thrombozytenfunktionsmessung im Schafblut: Optimierung der Aggregationsmessung im Multiplate Analyser und Einfluss der Probenlagerung ¤ Thrombozyten, Aggregation, Sheep, platelets, aggregation, sheep. - The investigation of hemostasis in sheep is primarily of great importance in the background of their role as a model organism, e.g. for general, cardiovascular and traumatic surgical studies as well as sepsis and shock models. Thrombozyten-Aggregometrie is one of the most important in vitro standard techniques for investigating thrombocyte function. The goal of the first part of the present study was to find out whether the new whole blood impedance aggregometer (Multiplate 5.0 Analyzer, Dynabite) represents a suitable method for investigating thrombocyte aggregation in sheep blood, to determine optimal agonist concentrations and to evaluate corresponding reference values for blood from sheep. In the first step of the investigations, different agonists (Adenoindiphosphat [ADP], Collagen, Thrombin receptor-activating peptide [TRAP-6], Ristocetin and Arachidonic acid) were used in various concentrations in Hirudin-anticoagulated blood from six (TRAP, Ristocetin and Arachidonic acid) or ten (ADP and Collagen) healthy sheep to evaluate the optimal agonist concentrations. The following concentrations were used: -ADP: 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 10 and...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4051990-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069555-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4555381-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135958-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140660-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4380725-2>
Speeches after Hitler: Theodor Heuss - Confronting National Socialism ¤ Not only Richard von Weizsäcker has publicly dealt with the legacy of National Socialism in his famous speech on the 40th anniversary of the end of the war. Theodor Heuss had already played an important role in "coming to terms with the past". As head of state, he addressed the responsibility of the Germans in his speeches, for example in Bergen-Belsen. Ulrich Baumgärtner not only highlights the memorial policy achievement of the first federal president, but also discusses the importance of the presidential speech for politics and the public and provides insights into the historical consciousness of the early Federal Republic.

Enclosed Spaces : The Motif of the Box in Film ¤ From Georges Méliès to Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch - the motif of the box appears repeatedly in film history. In doing so, it confronts viewers with a medial paradox: the box is visible and at the same time encloses a space that remains hidden. As a motif, each box contains its own story, which unfolds over the course of the film. This enables a critical perspective on what seems self-explanatory before our eyes. Based on concrete film analyses, Nepomuk Zettl examines spatial inclusions in film in their narrative, aesthetic, and epistemological dimensions and thus presents the first study on this omnipresent, but hitherto overlooked motif.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4485260-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4225698-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017102-4>
Design and adjustment of weighing cells for vacuum mass comparators ¤ Load cells based on flexible mechanisms are of crucial importance in mass metrology. The adjustment of mechanical properties determines the metrological performance of the instruments. The present dissertation makes a specific contribution to further improvement. The design and adjustment of flexible mechanisms for electromagnetically force-compensated load cells in vacuum mass comparators are treated. The most important part of these mechanisms are ultra-thin solid body joints, whose modeling, production, and measurement are considered. The mechanical overall system is modeled and experimentally investigated based on three load cell prototypes with regard to the mechanical properties stiffness, inclination sensitivity, and corner last sensitivity. The developed adjustment method and its implementation in adjustment devices allow for targeted adjustment under vacuum conditions. They are designed to eliminate the mechanical uncertainty contributions of the first order of the load cell and thus enable further reduction of the measurement uncertainty for mass comparators.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4229772-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1143152751> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4286621-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4218077-6>
Tariff Unity and Tarif Competition ¤ The author subjects the legal institutes of tariff unity and tariff competition, including their historical development, to a comprehensive and critical examination. At its center are the expansion of principles for solving tariff competition and the refutation of the doctrine of tariff unity in the enterprise, which the Federal Labor Court understands as a collision rule for tariff pluralism. After a clarification of tariff unity in the employment relationship, Matthias Jacobs develops differentiated solution paths for tariff competition that take into account the characteristics of various case groups and replace the outdated specialty principle with a norm-purpose-oriented evaluation diversity. In the case of tariff unity in the enterprise, whose importance for the determination of tariff competence and the scope of application of the collective agreement is also critically examined, the author first develops the necessary legal reform standards, which the case law of the Federal Labor Court, as will be demonstrated, does not meet. Jacobs finally designs new constitutional-methodological examination standards for the freedom of association, which take the place of the core area doctrine adopted by the Federal Constitutional Court, and shows that tariff unity in the enterprise violates various protective provisions of Art. 9(3) GG.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184465-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4321118-5>
The Arms Trade Treaty and the Control of Dual-use Goods ¤ The international arms trade was until the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) an unregulated matter, which has gained more and more importance in recent years due to the high arms exports of major powers and in view of increasing armed conflicts worldwide. The investigation contributes to the clarification of problems that arise in the context of the trade in conventional weapons and dual-use goods. In this context, the most important export control agreements are first presented in summary. Then, the relationship of the ATT to these agreements is analyzed. Subsequently, the ATT is explained in detail with regard to its regulatory gaps. Special attention is paid to the tension between sovereignty and human rights in this context. Finally, the connection between the ATT and dual-use goods control is established. In this context, proposals for solutions are developed that deal with the control of dual-use goods.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064231-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153391-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4802443-0>
Praxisorientation and Community Concept: Hermann Mosler as a Pioneer of West German International Law Science after 1945 ¤ This book ensures the origins of the international law tradition. The current debate on the role of international law in international relations goes back to the discussions of the Cold War. In West Germany, a international law approach emerged after 1945, which is still known today for its practical relevance and the idea of an international community based on constitutional principles. Based on the work and legacy of Hermann Mosler, who is considered the most important international lawyer of the Federal Republic, the genesis of the practice-oriented community concept is analyzed in the context of the political development of Germany during the Cold War. The connection to the Weimar international law tradition, lessons from the Nazi past, the integration of West Germany under Konrad Adenauer, and Mosler's Catholic universalism are highlighted as factors that produced a specifically West German approach to international law.

The Romantic Idea of the Child and Childhood: In Search of Lost Innocence ¤ In this book, the literary, philosophical, and aesthetic lines of tradition that enter into the concept of "childhood" are shown. The starting point is a structural change in the discourse about the child around 1800, which is located in the context of social change. While children were described as incomplete until then, they now often appear as ideal beings. The educator Fröbel (1782-1852) transfers this romantic idea of the child into his educational program.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030550-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4231385-5>
Physiological and pathological findings in the rabbit uterus considering peripheral total estrogen and progesterone concentrations ¤ Rabbits, ovarian function status, uterine diseases. - The aim of the present study was to show correlations between the endocrine functional status using peripheral total estrogen and progesterone concentrations on the one hand and the appearance of vulva and vestibulum vaginae, cytological findings of vestibulum vaginae and the functional and health status of the uterus on the other hand. In addition, the flora and the occurrence of inflammatory cells in the vaginal and uterine smears in the context with the ovarian function status and uteropathies were investigated. In the context of preoperative diagnostics, the value of various examination procedures for the diagnosis of uteropathies in rabbits was compared. These consisted of cytological and microbiological examination of vestibulum smears, hematological analysis and imaging procedures X-ray and ultrasound. For the study, 31 female rabbits (age: 3 months - 9.3 years, weight: 0.7 - 6.4 kg) from private ownership were available. The animals were grouped according to age (< 1.5 years, n = 10; 1.5 - 4 years, n = 5; > 4 years, n = 15), ovarian function status (follicular phase - progesterone < 1 ng/ml, n = 11; pseudopregnancy - progesterone > 1 ng/ml, n = 19), uterine findings (healthy, n = 10; diseased, n = 21) and type of uteropathy, ordered by severity (adenocarcinoma, n = 10; glandular-cystic endometrial hyperplasia/endometrial hyperplasia (GZEH/EH), n = 8; endometritis, n = 3). The genital organs (ovaries, uterus) removed in the context of ovariectomy were macroscopically examined, measured and prepared for histopathological diagnosis. The ovarian functional status could be characterized using the progesterone concentrations measured in peripheral blood plasma as follicular phase and pseudopregnancy. Additional information was obtained in some cases from the histological endometrial findings (proliferation, secretion). In contrast, no clear, usable characteristics for determining the ovarian functional status were found from the findings of the vulva and vestibulum vaginae and the cytological smears of vestibulum vaginae. In 17 rabbits, two or more...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029486-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141401-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054683-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129530-4>
Coherent structures, instabilities and turbulence in interfacial and magnetohydrodynamic flows ¤ This summary of scientific publications presents several theoretical and numerical investigations of instabilities and complex nonlinear dynamics in flows. The summary primarily describes the motivation for the various works as well as the fundamental physics of the considered flows. Main results are also given. Details on the mathematical models and numerical methods can be found in the publications. The author's own contribution to the various publications is listed in a separate appendix. The considered flows are thermal convection in one- and two-layer systems of immiscible fluids, two-phase shear flows, and channel flows of electrically conducting fluids in an external magnetic field. These configurations are motivated by a range of applications, such as heat and mass transfer at fluid interfaces in process engineering, atomization of liquids for combustion or electromagnetic pumps and brakes for material processing in metallurgy. The complexity of real applications has been significantly reduced to investigate fundamental mechanisms and properties of such flows. The achieved geometric and conceptual simplicity is suitable for numerical investigations, as specialized but very efficient numerical methods can be used. The results of such investigations can improve the physical understanding of the flows and serve to validate more general numerical procedures. Thermal convection has been considered in several arrangements. The first is surface-tension-driven (thermocapillary) convection in a single fluid layer, for which the flow structure and the scaling behavior of the heat flux have been investigated with two- and three-dimensional simulations. The second arrangement is a system of two layers with heating from below or above and various combinations of immiscible fluids. Two different two-layer systems have been investigated with three-dimensional, nonlinear simulations, focusing on the changes in the convection patterns with variation of the strength of the thermal driving. On the field of two-phase shear flows, two linear stability investigations have been performed based on the coupled Rayleigh/Orr-Sommerfeld equations, as well as a verification of the nonlinear SURFER code using the linear stability results from the Orr-Sommerfeld equations. The new aspect of these works is the direct comparison of the results for the inviscid case and the case of finite viscosity at base flows with the same structure, and the identification of a specific, viscosity-dependent instability mechanism in the parameter range of atomization experiments with air and water. On the field of channel flows of electrically conducting fluids, the author was involved in numerical investigations of the transition to turbulence and turbulence. For a magnetic field in spanwise direction, a nonlinear mechanism for the transition to turbulence at subcritical Reynolds number has been analyzed. Furthermore, the properties of turbulence have been determined both for a magnetic field perpendicular to the channel wall and with a magnetic field in spanwise direction using numerical simulations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117265-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7522845-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077970-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4690080-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130803-7>

Work and Environment? : The Environmental and Energy Policy of the SPD between Ecology and Economy 1969-1998 ¤ About the crisis of the SPD, you can read everywhere, and not just since yesterday. Already since the 1970s, new topics and actors have been challenging the social democratic policy model fundamentally. In the field of environmental policy, this was particularly evident: The new ecological awareness questioned the classic social democratic progress model and the self-image of the SPD as a party of labor. In addition, the ideal of grassroots democracy propagated by the environmental movement and the Greens was directed against the traditional organizational principle of the SPD.

The Establishment of Energy Policy for Europe: Policy-Making in the EU from a Constructivist-Discursive Perspective ¤ Kristina Kurze examines the establishment of a binding 'Energy Policy for Europe' in the EU despite diverging interests through a comprehensive discourse analysis. By drawing on constructivist and discursive approaches, she argues that the adaptable storyline of a low-carbon economy opened up new possibilities and integrated diverse positions. The study is based on a broad data corpus, making it an empirically grounded contribution to the debate on the role of narratives in politics. The content includes: Concept of a constructivist-discursive research perspective Functions of storylines in the policy process Diversity and scarcity of energy policy storylines Target groups: academics and students of political science as well as social researchers, particularly from discourse research, European integration research, international relations, and policy analysis Practitioners in energy and climate policy as well as European policy The author Dr. Kristina Kurze is a research associate at the Institute of Political Science at the University of Göttingen. Her research focuses on discourse research, international relations, European integration, and energy, climate, and environmental policy fields.

Phytochrome in Gymnosperms: Gene Families, Evolution, and Expression in Pinus sylvestris L. ¤ Phytochromes are the best-studied photoreceptors in plants. Many data are available on light-dependent morphogeneses as well as on the members of the phytochrome gene family in angiosperms. In contrast, little is known about light-regulated phenomena in gymnosperms and there is hardly any information on their phytochromes. The investigation of some photomorphogeneses in gymnosperms was carried out as an example of Pinus sylvestris L. Notably, dark-grown seedlings of Pinus synthesize chlorophyll and anthocyanins. Biochemical analyses showed that light-grown seedlings contain about 50% more chlorophylls and 20% more anthocyanins compared to dark-grown ones. The difference in phenotype between light- and dark-grown seedlings is less striking than in most angiospermic plants. The hypocotyl of seven-day-old seedlings grown in darkness was on average 25% longer than the light control. The cotyledons were developed and, compared to light-grown plants, were only not unfolded and less pigmented.

Miniaturized and marker-free analysis of individual microfluid segments using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy ¤ Microfluid segment technology enables reactions to be performed under optimized flow conditions and with a minimal amount of substance. This technique is particularly suitable for multidimensional reaction screenings, where the influences of multiple effectors are investigated simultaneously, as the segments are guided through the system in an ordered manner, making the composition of each individual segment known. Therefore, the analysis of the segments and their contents has great importance in this complex and technically demanding procedure. In addition to optical evaluation or fluorescence measurement, where the target substance must be marked with a fluorescent group, marker-free detection methods are currently being developed. However, these detection methods are still very complex and cannot be applied without in-depth knowledge of the respective field. The need for a simple analysis method that can also detect chemical changes in the segments without markers is the basis for the motivation of the work presented here. This describes a new method for the marker-free analysis of individual fluid segments, which enables a widespread use of the analysis technique due to its compact design and simple connection to any processes. The developed analysis method describes the first-time coupling of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with the implementation of the serially generated segments on a parallel array structure of SERS-active measurement points (SERS array). This implementation step decouples the time-critical measurement from the fast processing of the segments and also enables optimal optical access to the measurement points, making the use of compact spectrometer systems possible. To implement the concept, a novel SERS-active hydrogel film and a procedure for applying the film to the measurement points were developed. During the development of the hydrogel film, a method for producing swellable, SERS-active composite sensor particles was further developed, in which the adhesion on a glass substrate, the evaporation of the solvent during application, and the SERS enhancement were investigated and adapted. Furthermore, the performance of the developed analysis method was determined, showing the SERS array excellent values in terms of long-term stability. The overall system was evaluated in comparison with other SERS-based analysis methods. It shows that relatively high frequencies of segments can be analyzed and that the quantification of test substances in a broad concentration range, which is slightly above that of the comparison systems, is possible. Using a deamination reaction, it was shown that a compact and easily adaptable method for SERS measurements has been developed, which can detect chemical changes within microfluid segments.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176916-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176072-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4803438-1>

The Use of Traffic Data from Video Surveillance as a Control Basis for Traffic-Dependent Network Control ¤ Due to the increasing load on the roads due to the growth of urban vehicle traffic and the associated environmental impact, it is in the interest of the traffic planner to optimally utilize the existing road space and road performance capacity. To achieve this, various network control models have been developed, of which the most frequently used in practice are described in more detail in this thesis. In this process, the input data, calculation methods, and algorithms of the various models were examined and compared with each other. The following systems were examined in more detail: TRANSYT, SIGMA, SIGOP, SCOOT, UTOPIA / SPOT, SCATS and OPAC. As an additional point, this thesis examined the suitability of video technology as a supporting technology for network control. In this context, the video detection system CCATS, which is installed in Stuttgart, was examined in more detail. Not only was the operation of the system presented, but also an attempt was made to show the advantages and disadvantages of video detection in general. As a final point, some possible applications were shown, how video technology could be used in the context of network control. However, these are only theoretical possibilities that could not be further investigated in practice due to cost and time constraints.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062954-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078895-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133709-8>
National Socialism in Film: From Triumph of the Will to Inglourious Basterds ¤ In this comprehensive overview of the topic "National Socialism in Film", not only feature films from around the world are extensively analyzed, but also documentaries and series that try to cope with the time of the so-called Third Reich. (Oke Simons) There are numerous ways for filmmakers to approach the horror of National Socialism in Germany both artistically and journalistically. An example of how innovatively and attention-grabbingly this topic can be implemented even 65 years after the Nazi time is, for example, the 2009 film "Inglourious Basterds" (IN 2/10), Quentin Tarantino's wild success film, in which the cinema plays a central role as a powerful propaganda tool. In her comprehensive overview of the topic "National Socialism in Film", the film scientist and art historian, who graduated with the present work at the Humboldt University, focuses in her detailed analysis on the aesthetics of feature and documentary films and investigates the concepts and intentions behind the respective representation form. She therefore complements the title of P. Reichel ("Invented Memory", BA 6/04), which was limited to the interpretation of films on the topics "Jewish murder" and 2nd World War, excellently. Reich illustrates, with extensive appendix. Highly recommended. (2) (Oke Simons)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017102-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133493-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115345-5>
Work first, pleasure later? : a qualitative study on the activity ethics of retirees in the light of action conventions and biographical experiences ¤ In individual life management, the organization of two normatively assigned action dimensions is relevant: work and time. 'Work' is significant both structurally in the sense of the integration of the individual into forms of employment and normatively in the sense of the work ethic norm of meaningfulness and performance orientation. 'Time' becomes relevant in terms of the expectation to avoid leisure in the individually available time in everyday life as well as over the lifespan. This classical duty-ethical activity morality is undermined by the age-group-transcending increasing relevance of post-materialistic attitudes as well as changed structural life conditions. The present work takes up this moral and structural change and, through a qualitative investigation, asks how and whether people in the post-employment phase perceive and integrate described activity norms into their life management. It is discussed to what extent the establishment of a retirement culture is emerging, which develops a different activity ethics from the employment world. Social and (professional-)biographical context and influence factors are taken into account. Part of the investigation is a re-examination of the Busy-Ethic concept by David J. Ekerdt (1986). In the result, the theme 'Recognition' and the concept 'Responsibility' have emerged as relevant categories in different contexts and across life phases. The respondents also report on employment-related burden experiences that function as legitimation of their attitude towards retirement. This underlines the importance of employment as a source of meaning in retirement, where the present work makes a contribution to the dimensioning of the relevant characteristics of employment. Based on the findings, signs of a retirement culture are discussed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049514-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132883-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141766-5>

Message électronique or E-Mail? : Settings of Francophone IT Professionals on Official Replacement Words for Internet Specialist Language and Language Policy : a WWW Survey ¤ France looks back on a long tradition of language policy. In the second half of the 20th century, attention is focused on Anglicisms and possibilities of their replacement by French expressions. This also concerns the Internet terminology since 1999. Not only in France, but also in the French-speaking parts of Belgium and Switzerland, English-language terms are replaced by French ones. In all three countries, corresponding commissions are working on proposals for replacing English-language Internet terms. The present work is based on a WWW survey, to what extent neologisms such as message électronique, page d'accueil, fournisseur d'accès, which come from the official French Internet terminology, are known to IT professionals from France, Belgium, and Switzerland, and what general position the respondents take on language policy measures.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122798-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005227-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041605-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113615-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077732-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139395-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4788337-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308416-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016216-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191506-9>
Materia prima : On the Semantics of the Concept in Natural Science Manuscripts of the 16th Century ¤ Materia prima as physical principle of existence -- Materia prima as pre-physical principle of existence -- Mataria prima as metaphysical principle of existence Katharina Dück devotes this book to the extensive doctrine of the concept „Materia prima“ in the field of tension between theory and repeatable practice in German-language alchemical-natural science manuscripts of the 16th century. She contributes new aspects to the debate on materialism in the Early Modern Period. Texts of so-called master thinkers as well as testimonies of those who have been little considered so far are examined. Special attention is paid to the Corpus Paracelsicum and the Paracelsian current. Three raster-like outlined basic patterns, to which the „Materia prima“-conceptions are assigned, are presented in detail and the continuities and transformations of existing matter concepts are found.

Hydraulic System Analysis for Evaluating the Impacts of Climate Change on Tidally Influenced Tributaries of the Elbe ¤ This work deals with three essential hydraulic questions at the tributaries of the Lower Elbe. Their answer is of great relevance both for the responsible authorities and for the residents of the catchment areas. The questions refer to i) flood protection, ii) morphodynamics and morphological development, and iii) the impacts of climate change on the runoff process and morphodynamics in the tidally influenced lower reaches. For this purpose, a hydraulic system analysis was carried out for two selected tributaries (Este and Krückau), which forms the core of the work and provides the foundations for answering the questions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112646-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154894-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171370-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025290-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132461-4>

Trauma and Attachment in Refugee Children: Processing Experiences of Bosnian Refugee Children in Germany ¤ As a result of the war in former Yugoslavia, approximately 340,000 refugees came to Germany in the 1990s. Many of them were victims of so-called 'ethnic cleansing'. Despite multiple burdens, the affected children often show no obvious psychological consequences or behavioral disorders, but appear well-adjusted. By combining approaches from trauma research, attachment research, and qualitative social research, the often hidden traumas can be detected. Both the attachment patterns of the parents and the socially precarious situation of the refugee families are taken into account. It shows that the development of the children is strongly shaped by the traumas of the parents. Compounding this are social and foreign policy decisions that lead to the social disintegration of refugees. Sequential trauma processes in the sense of Hans Keilson are thus promoted. Psychologist Ilka Lennertz shows how relatively simple support measures that are currently being neglected could be designed. Series of writings of the Sigmund-Freud-Institute.

The Application of the Needle-Arthroscope as a Diagnostic Measure in Canine Knee and Elbow Joint Diseases ¤ For this study, 30 knee and elbow joints of dogs from the patient material of the Veterinary Clinic Ahlen were examined in general anesthesia with the needle arthroscope and with the conventional arthroscope. All dogs showed lameness in the front or hind limbs, so that an indication for arthroscopy was given. The arthroscopies were performed by an experienced surgeon after a standardized examination procedure to avoid relevant structures. The findings were noted on a specially developed examination protocol for the study, so that at the end of the arthroscopic examination an evaluation and a comparison of the two devices could be made. Initially, the dogs were examined with the needle arthroscope and subsequently over the same accesses with the conventional arthroscope. The result showed that the needle arthroscopy delivered largely comparable results with the conventional arthroscopy and thus proved to be a good diagnostic tool. This concerned 100% consistent results both in the examination of the elbow and knee joint in the evaluation of the cartilage and the grading of synovitis. Significant differences were shown, however, in the representability of the lateral Proc. coronoideus in the elbow joint and the menisci in the knee joint. The PCL could be represented with the needle arthroscope in only two of 30 cases (6.6%), in contrast to which the representation with the conventional device was possible in 13 of 30 cases (43%). In the knee joint, a visualization of the medial meniscus with the needle arthroscope was possible in 73% (22 of 30) and in 90% (27 of 30) with the conventional one. The representability of the caudal part of the MM, however, was significantly restricted with the needle arthroscope and amounted to only 27%, in comparison to 74% with the conventional arthroscopy. The lateral meniscus was visualizable with the needle arthroscope in 70% (21 of 30) and with the conventional in 93% (28 of 30). Significant difficulties were also encountered in the representation of the caudal part. With the needle arthroscope, it could be represented in only 19% of the cases and with the conventional arthroscope in at least 46% of the cases. In the evaluation of the other structures, there were small differences, and it could be established overall that the results of the needle arthroscopy were slightly worse than those of the conventional. The image quality of the needle arthroscope was significantly worse, which made a partial evaluation difficult. In the future, the needle arthroscope should be tested in the examination of smaller joints. Further research is needed in terms of the chosen accesses to the joint, the feasibility in sedation, and the possibility of such monitored therapy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026181-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012494-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113937-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121336-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003086-6>

Violence Narrated: Borders and Transgressions in Contemporary Mexican Literature ¤ In Mexico, violence has been increasing over the years, but often without a clear explanation. Literature takes on the important function of making violence and trauma articulable in this context. This is illustrated by a newly compiled corpus that includes novels by eight female and male authors. This volume not only deals with the northern border to the USA, but also the southern and inner-societal borders of Mexico, defining borders in relation to the categories of society, body, and gender. Based on theories of 'border' and 'transgression', the author shows how violence is normalized and overlooked – and how literature can make it visible again.

Modeling of the Wear Behavior in the Pad Polishing Process ¤ Within this dissertation, a model is presented that allows for a prediction of material wear during the pad polishing process of surfaces. It enables the prediction of material wear based on physical parameters. The calculation is designed for any surface geometries and provides location-dependent wear functions. The model includes the workpiece geometry, i.e., the resulting change in the wear function is an integral part of the simulation. This represents a significant improvement over commercially available polishing machines that work with fixed wear functions in some cases. The considered variable parameters include the local course of the workpiece surface, the tool geometry, the spindle speeds of tool and workpiece, as well as the force on the tool. The comparison of real polishing processes with the results of the simulation provides a high agreement with deviations in the range of 10% and below. The strong position dependence of form and size of the wear tracks in the round table polishing shows itself equally in the simulation as well as in the real polishing. The model represents the position dependence of wear when using offset tools. The effectiveness of a theoretically derived feed profile for the elimination of this peculiarity of offset tools is also shown by the simulation. The mentioned in the literature dependence of the Preston coefficient on the relative speed between tool and workpiece is experimentally verified and a procedure for determining the friction coefficient during the polishing process is presented. The measured values agree well with the values given in the literature.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141176-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065604-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175006-8>
On the Numerical Computation of Eddy Current Losses in Construction Elements of Induction Furnaces ¤ The special content of the present dissertation is the eddy current and loss calculation in induction furnace units. For the reduction of eddy current losses in components and the increase of the electrical efficiency of induction furnace, a series of constructive measures are required. In this context, a variety of different parameters and influencing factors on the field course and losses in the respective construction element of the furnace and the effects on other furnace components must be taken into account. Due to the complex furnace geometry, only a three-dimensional numerical calculation is meaningful. The theoretical basis for the field and eddy current calculation is provided by the system of Maxwell's equations, which is applied to the quasi-stationary processes of induction heating. As prerequisites, sinusoidal excitation and temporally constant material values are taken into account. For the description of the electromagnetic field, the A-Phi formulation is applied. The system of field-describing differential equations is solved under consideration of the boundary and symmetry conditions with the finite element method (FEM). The derivation of the FEM solution approach is carried out according to the Galerkin procedure under extension of the local approximation approach in the individual element to the global solution approach for the entire solution domain. The construction of the numerically solvable algebraic equation system is presented in detail under consideration of the boundary and symmetry conditions. Necessary preliminary investigations for the calculation of the induction unit of a double-loop furnace for melting copper include the goal of reducing the numerical effort while maintaining sufficient computational accuracy. The comparison of results from the numerical eddy current loss calculation of the double-loop furnace with measurement results from the executed furnace confirms the applicability of the finite element model for the furnace. The suitability of the A-Phi solution approach for induction heating is further confirmed by the comparison of calculation and measurement values at a heat exchanger model, i.e. an arrangement consisting of an inductor and a slotted tube. Another essential part of this work is the method for reducing the solution domain to a partial section, so that even extensive problem statements can still be mastered with the required accuracy even with limited memory capacity of the computer system.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161587-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4311225-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165100-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190012-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128130-5>
Cost-effective and comparable monitoring components : an interdisciplinary approach based on remote sensing, landscape structure assessment and social research for Bach Ma National Park, Vietnam ¤ Monitoring, Vietnam, Landscape structure, Empirical social research, National park, Protected area, Landsat, Landscape monitoring, Landscape structure analysis, Bach Ma National Park, interdisciplinary, RapidEye, Landscape Monitoring, Landscape Metrics, Social Research, Remote Sensing, Protected Area Management All human activities have transformed one-third to one-half of the Earth's land surface. There is a strong correlation of human well-being with ecosystem function, including poverty alleviation programs as well as enhancements of the health sector. To assess and evaluate the progress and outcome of initiatives stringent periodic observation is necessary. The presented approach combines the strengths of remote sensing and GIS analysis with social research applications. The Bach Ma National Park as an area under investigation was designated as protected area in 1991 and extended in 2008. The national park is uninhabited, but in the surrounding buffer zones approximately 62,000 to 79,000 people live in rural areas and in mostly impoverished conditions. The comprehensive nature conservation efforts of the Vietnamese Government during the last two decades has led to growing forest coverage of both plantation and natural forests. Nevertheless, the decreasing biodiversity and ongoing illegal logging and hunting activities in the national park are seen as major threats to conservation initiatives in the future. The remote sensing component consists of an analysis of a time series of Landsat images with seven steps ranging from 1973 to 2010. The resulting land cover analysis had 13 different classes. The accuracy assessment revealed an overall accuracy ranging from 84 to 90%. The basis for the second monitoring component was the Landsat images.

Events in Practical Theological Theory Formation ¤ Research on Christian events has been a desideratum within theology so far. The present work closes this gap and first defines the concept of a Christian event. Events such as the German Evangelical Church Congress and the Pentecost Youth Meeting Aidlingen have developed from Christian festivals to Christian events. With the sociological considerations of the experience society (Schulze) and the society of singularities (Reckwitz), important steps in church life can be marked, which are increasingly causing an eventification of church life. The International Christian Fellowship (ICF) church is shown to be an "Event Church". Finally, characteristics and problems of Christian events are discussed	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047056-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114204-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121388-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030702-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125453-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015833-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015875-5>
Ground and Freedom: A Phenomenological Investigation of Heidegger's Concept of Freedom ¤ In the present study, the author examines the multifaceted connections between foundation and justification in the world in order to show with Martin Heidegger that all these connections presuppose, arise from, or at least are freedom-conditioned. The analysis of Heidegger's ontological concept of freedom takes the form of a phenomenological destruction of 'ground'. The focus of the book lies on Heidegger's actual use of the concept of 'freedom'. The starting point of the investigation is the dictum 'Freedom is the ground of the ground'. This sentence falls within Heidegger's 'metaphysical period', which is limited to the period from 1928 to 1930 and in which he attempts to design a positive concept of metaphysics, a metaphysics of existence. In order to clarify this dictum, the investigation focuses on this very period. In the first chapter, the concept of ground is systematically and philosophically historically examined in order to reveal our practice of justifying and to show how this practice already presupposes the concept of world. The second chapter deals with Heidegger's positive understanding of freedom and shows how the two concepts 'ground' and 'freedom' are intertwined through the concept of world. The third chapter draws a conclusion and sets the results in a broader phenomenological context that is not limited to Heidegger alone. The fourth and final chapter deals with the ethical implications of Heidegger's ontological concept of freedom.

Writing in the Network: Letters from Women as Practices of Pious Self-Formation in Early Quedlinburg Pietism ¤ The pietist focus on the individual relationship to God resulted in a new weighting of the pious self in relation to societal constructions such as class and gender constellations. A central role is played by the concept of the growth of the New Creature in man, which can be read as a potentially unending, individually to be carried out path of self-formation. In confrontation with current historical-praxeological approaches and under a consistent network perspective, Katja Lissmann examines in her study the letters of two women of the Quedlinburg pietist movement (1691-1703): Sophia Maria von Stammer, born von Selmnitz, and Anna Magdalena Francke, born von Wurm. In their letters, they took the pietist program writing at their word. They worked out for themselves in the execution of their pious practice an independent religious subject status and thus contributed to the dynamization of gender-specific possibility spaces. Embedded is the analysis of the letters, situated at the intersection of historical education and gender-oriented pietism research, in a microhistorical reconstruction of the Quedlinburg local political situation around 1700 and the local pietist network.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046049-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008240-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018202-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055762-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4236528-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112760-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018672-6>
Development of Methods for Abstract Modeling of Automotive Systems-on-Chips ¤ This Open-Access publication provides an initial insight into the fundamentals of model-based system development. The publication analyzes current methodological deficits in Automotive System-on-Chip (SoC) development. Subsequently, the publication describes a new model-based development method that enables the mastering of growing challenges in Automotive System-on-Chip development. In order to fulfill the overarching goal of increasing efficiency, the model-based development method combines five established tools and adapts the overall method to the requirements of Automotive SoC development. In addition, the publication deals with the possibilities of model-driven automation in hardware as well as in software development. The publication provides proof of the positive influence of the model-based development method on the efficiency of Automotive SoC development through an interview evaluation in the form of a guideline-based survey of industry users. The Author The author currently works as a system architect and „Requirements Engineering“ specialist in the field of Automotive IP development at Robert Bosch GmbH. The main focus of his work is on the development and implementation of „Requirements Engineering“-driven development methods, which have been adapted to the domain-specific requirements of IP development.

Interdisciplinary Sciences in Teacher Training: A Didactic Reconstruction ¤ This work presents the didactic development of a training concept that prepares teachers both professionally and didactically for teaching interdisciplinary sciences. The core element of the project is the empirically accompanied content structuring of the training through a professional analysis and subsequent construction of training elements based on selected interdisciplinary contexts. These are surrounded by an interview study and a accompanying evaluation concept and fit into the model of didactic reconstruction. Context orientation, basic concepts, scientific thinking and working methods, as well as experiments were derived as relevant construction criteria. The developed training is characterized by a professional foundation of physical, chemical, and biological basics, which are set in exemplary contexts and are distinguished by a cross-disciplinary focus and an increased research reference in the sense of modern contents. The challenge of training for interdisciplinary sciences lies in the constant interplay between the professional training of teachers and their integration into everyday school life. As a didactic guideline, experiments are suitable as a basis for discussing practical implementations in teaching. Structurally, an offer was created that meets the requirements of professional teacher training and is designed as a school-year-accompanying program. The event structure is methodically designed through lecture, practical work, and reflection. In the framework of this work, the topics of biomimetics, pharmaceuticals, regenerative fuels, water-soil-air, and carbon nanomaterials were reconstructed didactically as topic folders with factual texts, experiment instructions, and learning materials.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117622-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035088-5>
Mentoring Conversations about English Teaching: A Reconstructive Study on the Professionalization Potential of Practice Phases ¤ How do student teachers and their school-based mentors discuss English teaching together? What knowledge do they bring to mentoring conversations and how do they relate it to that of other conversation participants? This reconstructive study, based on 26 audio-recorded pre- and post-conferences on English teaching, addresses these questions. It generates new insights into the foreign language didactic professionalization processes of students in mentoring conversations in the two-phase teacher education in Germany. Four types of mentoring conversations about English teaching are reconstructed, which are used to discuss both professionalization-promoting and -hindering practices. Ultimately, the question proves to be central: whether norms are conceptualized as negotiable or as fixed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014801-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047376-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035093-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1253972168>
Further Recommendations : a competition law consideration under special consideration of Viral Marketing ¤ To expand the awareness of a product, companies use the various communication relationships of private individuals on the internet. Since further recommendations by friends or acquaintances usually achieve a quality due to their authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness, which classical advertising will rarely achieve. The form of traditional customer recommendations through word-of-mouth communication was further developed into the concept of viral marketing here. For companies, it is indispensable to deal with social changes and technological progress in order to ultimately generate added value with their presence in social online networks. At the same time, knowledge of permissible legal design options helps to minimize the risk of liability due to potential competition law violations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126361-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7564917-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7>
Brain monitoring : real-time localization of neuronal activity ¤ Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is suitable with its high temporal resolution as a measurement method for neuronal activity. The combination of an MEG system with software for real-time data analysis would therefore open up a wide range of new possibilities. For example, stimulations could be adjusted in real-time with respect to their temporal synchronization and other parameters to the continuously analyzed brain activity during the experiment. Furthermore, the workflow of data analysis, especially in clinical studies, could be made more efficient. To realize such real-time data analysis, two challenges arise: the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the short time window required for the necessary calculations. This work presents new solution approaches to master these challenges. A low SNR reduces the number of sources that can be reliably distinguished. In this work, a solution approach is presented, which reduces the source space based on a cortical brain atlas and thus allows sources to be distinguished even under higher noise. Each cortical region is represented by a small set of dipoles, which was determined using a clustering algorithm. The presented technique leads to a more focal localization of activations and reduced pseudo-activations compared to standard procedures, which usually assume evenly distributed source distributions. Based on the clustering approach, two inverse procedures, a distributed and a sparse one, were adapted for real-time application. Dynamic Statistical Parametric Mapping (dSPM) was adapted for the purpose of distributed source estimation. The RTC-MUSIC method was developed to obtain inferences on connectivity metrics between cortical regions from sparse localization results using correlation information. In the development of the new procedures, a major focus was placed on computational efficiency to meet the real-time constraints. Together with the open-source framework MNE-CPP, which was also established and developed within this work, the algorithms presented in this work pave the way for non-invasive brain monitoring.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190602-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4254087-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4330145-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4196204-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123037-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151002-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4159930-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4323583-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041897-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4209015-5>
Naturalization and Exclusion: The Nationalization of Citizenship from the German Confederation to the Federal Republic of Germany ¤ In current discussions about late settlers or the integration of foreigners, it always comes down to citizenship and naturalization. Citizenship became an institution of the nation-state in the 19th century, which, through naturalization, set the standards of its self-understanding. Dieter Gosewinkel examines the development of citizenship and naturalization policy in connection with the formation, development, and crisis of the German nation-state. The focus of the book is on access to the nation-state and its demarcation from the outside. How did the institution of citizenship change with the change of political systems? To what extent did it contribute to the unification of the federal basic structure of the German nation-state? How did the practice of naturalization policy change over time? How did the rights and duties of citizens develop? To what extent did the growing homogeneity of civil society go hand in hand with an increasing closure to the outside? Such questions also help to better understand current political and social problems. - With the instrument of citizenship, the nation-state could determine who belonged to the nation and who did not. The book shows how the policy of naturalization and exclusion has changed over the last two hundred years.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020517-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013828-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056630-4>
The Need for Reform of German Sports Arbitration ¤ Doping still plays a major role in sports. This also applies to judicial disputes related to doping. In professional sports, it is common practice to subject athletes to sports arbitration. However, athletes often do not have a real choice to let doping disputes be decided by a regular or private (sports) arbitration court. The author therefore deals with the question of whether the common practice of sports arbitration is still sustainable and to what extent it infringes on the rights of athletes. Subsequently, she deals with the possibilities of reforming (national) sports arbitration while taking into account the fundamental rights of the parties involved.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4818923-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4052348-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132940-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182442-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005940-6>
Chinese foundations and grassroots social organizations : characteristics and interactions ¤ This study explores how Chinese foundations interact with grassroots social organisations (SO) and why Chinese foundations act the way they do. In addition to involving well-documented empirical investigations in China, the study was conducted using anecdotal evidence accumulated over a 10-year period from 2008 to 2019, when Chinese foundations started their interaction with other SOs. The findings show that Chinese foundations interact with grassroots SOs in six different ways, namely special funds, joint fundraising, high-engagement grantmaking, and awarding grants to projects, organisations and individuals. However, Chinese foundations’ grantmaking logic does not overlap with the needs of grassroots SOs, because they do not fully understand each other’s difficulties and because their focus and development paths are not the same, which results in less interaction. This book provides new and inspiring insights for scholars and students of China’s emerging and flourishing third sector. It will not only interest those in academia, but will also appeal to those working in China’s third sector.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057542-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154943-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032386-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1208879111>
Modelling and Simulation of the Dynamics of Deposition and Penetration Processes in Particle-Laden Cooling Fluid Flows ¤ A coolant loss accident is a postulated accident scenario in reactor safety research, where it is assumed that insulation material is released due to a leak from plant components. To minimize the penetration of insulation material into the reactor core, a measure is taken to hold it back with sieves. The resulting retention process corresponds to the process engineering fixed-liquid separation process of cake filtration and has high relevance in various technical applications. The goal of the present work is to model and simulate the deposition processes occurring during this process using knowledge-based methods. Initially, a detailed process analysis was performed. Subsequently, the essential model components and behaviors were identified. During the modeling process, various models with different target settings were developed. This work presents the approach to model development and the completed models in detail. Furthermore, the final deposition model is analyzed in detail. This includes the comparison to a comparable model approach as well as the analysis of sensitive model parameters.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165857-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144208-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165868-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190671-8>
Systematic Consideration of Corrosion Resistance on Ground Surfaces of Metastable Austenites ¤ Due to their resistance to corrosion and good formability, CrNi austenitic steels are found in a wide range of applications. The ability to form a stable passive layer is particularly based on the chromium content in the respective alloy. The influence of further individual factors on the corrosion behavior of CrNi steels is treated in a wide range of scientific works. The present work deals explicitly with the effect of successful cold forming and the generated component surface due to different processing methods on the corrosion behavior. For the consideration of the interaction of these two factors, two metastable austenitic steels were used, which have almost identical corrosion resistance (according to PREN) but different austenite stability (according to Md30). By multi-stage cold rolling, various degrees of deformation were achieved on sheet material. The differentiation in the surface executions was then created by metallographic preparation or by plan- circumferential- longitudinal grinding. Metallographic preparation led to ground, polished or electro-polished surface executions. For the mechanical flat grinding process, surfaces were machined with silicon carbide or with corundum as grinding medium. The determination of the corrosion behavior was carried out using various electrochemical measurement methods. For the characterization of the generated surfaces, different analysis methods were applied, in particular the tactile and optical determination of surface roughness as well as the investigation using REM images. The influence of cold forming on the present microstructure, which led to a pronounced formation of α'-martensite, was recorded by conventional metallography, EBSD measurements and magnet-inductive measurements. In terms of the achieved corrosion behavior, the influence of both factors is clearly visible. The change in mechanical properties due to cold forming can be proven as the dominant influence on the generated surface topography. This results in a counteracting trend of the corrosion behavior with increasing deformation grade for ground surfaces compared to polished or electro-polished surfaces.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4163137-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131028-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179714-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130418-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032518-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131049-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169654-2>
Pollutant Emissions from the Combustion of Straw, Wood and Biogas ¤ Wood combustion of solid fuels in stoves and furnaces is widely used for residential heating in Germany. Approximately 15 million of 40 million households own small-scale furnaces (Struschka M. 2008). Biomass burning as an alternative to fossil fuel heat supply might play an important role in the future to achieve a reduction of greenhouse gases, to counteract a possible shortage of fossil energy sources and, to achieve autonomy from fossil fuels in Germany. The growing contribution of energy from biomass burning can have adverse effects, such as higher emissions of elements and organic sub...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145596-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179312-2>
Historikerstreit ¤ The "Historikerstreit" of the years 1986-1988 is considered a landmark debate about the politically and culturally self-understood identity of the Federal Republic. Why, actually? In his book, Gerrit Dworok follows this question and orders the conflict into the history of the Federal Republic. In doing so, he pursues the West German search for collective identity, the process of locating National Socialism and its crimes, as well as the competition between left-liberal and liberal-conservative forces for the power and cultural-political interpretation authority in West Germany back to the time of the Federal Republic's founding, in order to open up the diverse origins of the conflict.

Oral Medication with Doxycyclin via Feed or Water in Piglet Rearing under Practical Conditions ¤ Within the VASIB project, the effectiveness of individual oral medication in piglet rearing under practical conditions was checked in terms of the clinical health of the animals and the doxycycline concentration in the plasma of the animals as well as in feed and water. In total, doxycycline was used in 13 cases for the treatment of acute respiratory diseases via feed (n=10) or water (n=3) on ten piglet-producing farms. Information on individual medication methods, as well as feed and water supply, was recorded. In the case of an acute respiratory disease, the animal group and ten individual animals were clinically-respiratorically examined before treatment and on the last treatment day, plasma samples were taken, as well as feed and water samples. Doxcyclin was measured from all samples using HPLC. The clinically-respiratory health of the pigs improved in all farms except one during the treatment period. On the last treatment day, high enough doxycycline concentrations of ≥ 0.5 µg/ml (CLSI Breakpoint) were measured in all piglets in only two farms, and in four farms, the active ingredient concentration was below 0.5 µg/ml in all animals. The concentrations in the feed and water samples showed a clear scatter and were in most cases below the expected concentration. The varying results are due to the diversity of individual medication methods. A therapeutically effective active ingredient concentration in the animal can be achieved through oral medication, but a variety of aspects have a negative impact on the effectiveness of oral treatment. Therefore, it is recommended to check the individual influencing factors, such as the actually applied dose, the dosing methods, the water quality, the feed structure, the transport routes, the functionality of the feed and water supply systems, and the feed and water intake of the animals in detail.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139255-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4150506-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4202348-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012494-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113937-9>
Statutory Contract Entry ¤ The work deals with statutory contract entry. In this process, a third party is appointed as a contracting party in place of one of the previously involved parties by law, on the one hand, to fulfill the obligations arising from an existing contract, and on the other hand, to demand contractual counter-performance from the opposing party. In this case, the fundamental right to private autonomy of those affected is infringed, which is why statutory contract entry is subject to constitutional control. The resulting restrictions are precisely the general and common characteristics of the case. This includes, for example, the special continuity interest in the continued fulfillment of the contract and the already frequently mentioned publicity principle in the literature that has been incorporated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315709-9>
Who's Precarious? : The Precarization Discourse as a Field of Social Struggles ¤ Precarization and precariousness have become key terms in politics, science, and media for social change. However, these terms are no longer clearly defined – and they are contested. The core moment of these negotiations for interpretive power is the question of the precarious subjects. Magdalena Freudenschuss reconstructs in her hegemonic-theoretically designed discourse analysis how in the print-mediated, German-speaking context these social struggles take place on the symbolic level. In the result of her investigation of "Der Standard", "Die Presse" "die tageszeitung" and "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" the discursive designs can be located on two argumentative lines of flight: They span between moments of defusing, trivializing, and legitimizing social inequalities on the one hand, and problematizing, scandalizing, and politicizing these inequalities on the other hand. In the German-speaking precarization discourse, which is proven by this inter-sectional analysis of print-mediated negotiations, a insecure social middle ensures its own social position. And fights with it for more than the discourse power.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020645-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055736-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012475-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043183-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7590592-9>
Connected Life Courses : Partner Choice and Division of Labor between New Resource Relations and Traditional Gender Roles ¤ Dynamic social structure analysis has significantly contributed to the understanding of the production and reproduction of social inequalities in the societal field of tension between new resource relations and traditional gender roles over the past few years. In this tradition, Florian Schulz examines partner choice on the internet and the division of household work in the course of a relationship, two dimensions by which these developments and the trends of social change in a society can be observed particularly well. The book is aimed at lecturers and students of the social sciences, particularly sociology and women's and gender research, at social and family policy decision-makers, as well as practitioners in the online dating field. With a foreword by Steffen Hillmert, Florian Schulz is a research assistant at the Institute for Labor Market and Vocational Research of the Federal Agency for Work in Nuremberg.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071776-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308416-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4023699-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121353-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055736-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145482-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044795-9>
Homodyne Interferometer for Non-Contact Vibration Analysis ¤ Laser-based measurement methods have been a widely used tool for non-contact acquisition of mechanical vibrations for a long time. Both speckle and hologram interferometry for the analysis of surface vibrations as well as heterodyne interferometers (laser vibrometers) are established measurement methods in this field. The use of homodyne interferometers (single-frequency interferometers) for vibration analysis has so far required an optical surface of the measurement object. A further developed system based on a single-frequency interferometer, which is characterized by high linearity and low measurement uncertainty, is the subject of this dissertation. In the dissertation, the application areas and requirements for non-contact vibration measurement systems are presented. The focus is on the use of classical single-frequency interferometry for vibration analysis under normal industrial conditions on rough and unprepared surfaces. The construction of a modified Michelson interferometer is discussed. The different requirements for sensor optimization at reflective and rough surfaces are shown. The calculations with Jones matrices represent the mathematical apparatus for these optimizations. The entire system concept, which was developed for highly sensitive and high-resolution measurements, is another focus of the dissertation. The peculiarities of signal evaluation in single-frequency interferometry are considered in connection with the tasks of vibration analysis. Realized fast signal demodulators are presented. An analysis of the measurement uncertainties in comparison to classical interferometry is performed. The decisive error sources and the possibilities of their correction are considered and analyzed. Practical measurement results are presented and the possibilities of surface acquisition of vibrations are discussed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135597-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053999-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140517-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038852-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4236803-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4388729-6>

Whistle-Blowing Systems in German Companies: An Investigation into Perception and Implementation ¤ Whistle Blowing, reporting misconduct by employees, poses the risk that confidential information reaches the public and a reputation damage occurs. The establishment of a Whistle-Blowing System is intended to avoid these disadvantages. In Germany, Whistle Blowing is often translated as Denunciation and the promotion of the behavior is often viewed skeptically. Esther Pittroff investigates the costs and benefits of a Whistle-Blowing System in German companies. She evaluates various systems and gains insights into perception and effectiveness from an empirical investigation.

Challenges in Software Development using the Scrum Procedure: On the Necessity of Atypical Contractual Design of BGB Contract Types in Practice ¤ The BGB contract types in the form prescribed by the BGB do not sufficiently cover the legal requirements of software projects in the Scrum procedure. This work examines the possibilities of how, through contract design, interest-oriented regulations can still be achieved for both contracting parties. Starting with an overview of agile software development, it is then linked to the suitability of the prescribed BGB contract types for software projects in the Scrum procedure. In the main part of the work, practical regulation options through contract design are then presented for those regulatory subjects that are not sufficiently or not at all represented by the BGB contract types prescribed in the BGB.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4806620-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063283-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4809367-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4163515-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7612008-9>
Renewable energy : competition, innovation and economic policy ¤ The energy sector enables us to conduct business, produce products, and enjoy a better quality of life. However, our current energy system is heavily dependent on fossil fuels. Currently, 85% of global energy consumption comes from fossil fuels, which brings two major challenges. The limitation of resources and emissions of greenhouse gases. From an economic perspective, a decline in supply and a non-decreasing consumption should lead to an increase in energy prices. Such an increase should lead to an increase in efficiency and a shift to alternative technologies, such as renewable energies. The first part of this dissertation attempts to explore the energy market mechanism and answer the question of whether energy prices lead to an improvement in efficiency and an increase in innovation activities in renewable energies. Evidence is found that supports the theory that energy markets are shifting towards carbon-free technologies. The second part of the dissertation builds on empirical results and asks about the inhibiting determinants that accelerate the speed of technical and structural change towards a renewable era. In general, the political agenda is predetermined in advance, but can be changed in two events: natural disasters and intense media coverage. The results show that accidents, such as accidents in nuclear reactors, can illustrate the benefits of renewable energies. Furthermore, mass media can influence the determination of the political agenda and contribute to a more supportive policy for renewable energies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068598-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1>

To ensure the long-term financing of the healthcare system, prioritization of medical services is increasingly demanded. It is intended to help avoid implicit rationing and bring about a fairer distribution of services based on democratically developed distribution principles. In the present volume, the experiences made abroad with prioritization of medical services, as well as their often complex effects on the healthcare economic and political framework, are comprehensively presented and analyzed. The various prioritization models are systematized, as are the frameworks and possibilities for their implementation. Under consideration of the constitutional, democratic, and regulatory framework conditions, essential knowledge is derived for the implementation of prioritizing elements also in the German healthcare system.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038270-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020766-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020775-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188696-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115712-6>
Terrorism in Film : A Film Studies Investigation of Conflicts, Genres, and Characters ¤ The Northern Ireland conflict and the IRA in film -- The RAF and left-wing terrorism in German film -- International Palestinian and Islamist terrorism in Hollywood -- Terrorism in popular Indian Hindi cinema -- Terrorism film – genres and characters. Bernd Zywietz shows in his work how terrorism and terrorists are represented in films. Starting from the concept of – social as well as film fictional – storytelling, various terrorism conflicts and their film history are investigated and compared to show patterns of (re-)integrative coping: the Northern Ireland conflict, left-wing terrorism in the FRG, 'Evil Arab' terrorism in Hollywood, political violence in Indian Bollywood cinema. The author develops and describes different genres and terrorist types of international terrorism film and works out the achievements and limitations of cinema as a place of political and moral reconciliation.

Queer Fanfictions - queer Utopias? : Hetero- and Homo-Normativity in Fanfictions to US-Vampire Series ¤ How do fans of vampire series negotiate themes such as gender, sexuality, family, or relationships in their texts? And do they bring up queer utopias in their stories? Denise Labahn examines the negotiations of hetero- and homonormativity by fans through the example of fanfictions to the TV series »The Vampire Diaries«, »Buffy«, and »True Blood« as well as an online group discussion with queer producers. The empirical study combines approaches of Queer Theory and Fan Studies. It shows how fans create alternative worlds in their collective and collaborative designs, as well as queer relationships and family relationships, and thus make a contribution to diverse representations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1125039019> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122204-0>

EPR Spectroscopic Investigation of the Solvation of Amphiphilic Substances in Aqueous Medium ¤ In the present work, the phase separation behavior of responsive poly(phosphoester)s (PPEs) with identical side group structure but different copolymer composition, as well as the solvation process of nitroxide spin probes in aqueous medium was investigated in detail using EPR spectroscopy. From a methodological point of view, this work impressively demonstrates the enormous potential of EPR spectroscopy, which shows remarkably high sensitivity and precision even with comparatively simple CW measurement technique. Moreover, this work also illustrates how much the solvation of amphiphilic substances in an aqueous medium can differ and thus shows in an impressive way the unbelievable adaptability of water with respect to its solvation behavior and emphasizes its unique character. In the present work, the following points were also discussed: electron paramagnetic resonance, EPR spectroscopy, poly(phosphoester)s, nitroxide spin probes, solvation, water, amphiphilicity END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4181763-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151888-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142278-8>

An Economic Analysis of the German Football Bundesliga ¤ The clubs of the 1st and 2nd Bundesliga spend more than 2 billion DM. In connection with the peculiarities in the production and sales sector, a detailed economic investigation of the industry is justified, which this work performs from both a theoretical and an empirical perspective. -- The empirical analysis is based on a survey of the professional clubs, on the other hand, the author has set up a dataset that contains essential economic variables such as player salaries, contract durations, or club revenues for the seasons 1994 to 2000. The decisive peculiarity of the market structure in professional team sports is the supply situation of the industry. Clubs as suppliers are competitors for relative positions, at the same time, the good and the associated properties can only be produced in the community of all teams. From the correlation of financial strength and sporting success of the teams on the one hand, and the divergence of market potentials between the clubs on the other hand, inefficiency potentials (e.g. resource waste, underinvestment in the tension level) arise, which can be intensified by the predominantly non-profit-oriented behavior. The player market in the Bundesliga is also at the center of the analysis. -- The effects of changes in the institutional framework conditions - such as through the 'Bosman ruling' - are discussed theoretically and empirically verified. Furthermore, empirical analyses of the determinants of salaries in Bundesliga football are carried out. The findings on the economic relationships of the industry are summarized in a simple model of a team sports league. It shows that revenue distribution measures - such as a financial equalization through revenue sharing or measures to input rationing (e.g. a salary cap) - are suitable to reduce inefficiencies	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155736-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4207188-4>

Calcined Tones as Puzzolanes of the Future: From Raw Materials to Effect in Concrete ¤ Against the backdrop of a steadily growing demand for concrete as well as ambitious reduction targets for CO2 emissions in cement production, calcined tones are considered the most promising technical innovation in the field of sustainable binder concepts. By exploiting their puzzolanic properties, a significant portion of the clay component in cement can be replaced, with the energy required for activation being relatively low. Essential advantages of the tones are their virtually unlimited global availability and the extremely low CO2 emissions during calcination. However, difficulties in implementation arise from the system's versatility, which is characterized by a high variety of raw tones and the resulting thermal behavior. Consequently, the transferability of experiences with already established calcined tones, such as metakaolin, which is distinguished by high purity, a complex processing process, and correspondingly high reactivity, is also difficult. The goal of the work is therefore to expand the existing knowledge to other economically relevant tones and to work out their suitability for application in concrete. In a multi-stage working program, it was investigated to what extent technologically usable tones can be activated and what properties result from this for cement and concrete. The sequence Kaolinit > Montmorillonit > Illit established in this process describes both the reactivity of the burn products and, conversely, the height of the optimal calcination temperature. Also, the character of the resulting metaphases changes in this sequence from X-ray amorphous and highly reactive to glassy and non-reactive. Despite this classification, a puzzolanicity comparable to that of fly ash was found even with illite. This was confirmed in subsequent parameter studies, in which the influences of raw material quality, calcination, processing, and cement on the reactivity yield were evaluated. The range of achievable qualities is immense and culminates in strongly differing effects on the properties of concrete. Here, the typical pore refinement of puzzolanes was particularly noticeable, so that many transport-dependent damage mechanisms were suppressed. Other damage positions such as frost attack could be mastered by additional measures such as the introduction of air pores. To be criticized are above all the poor processability of kaolinitic metatones as well as the strongly pronounced carbonation tendency of puzzolanes. A significant result of the work is that even tones that were previously considered of low value in terms of activation potential can develop usable puzzolanic properties. So, even a strongly contaminated illite clay can achieve the quality of fly ash. With increasing clay mineral content and in the presence of thermally unstable clay minerals such as montmorillonite and kaolinite, the spectrum of usable puzzolanicities extends to the high-reactive metakaolin quality. This makes it possible to achieve good to very good concrete properties, so that the performance of established composite materials is achieved. Thus, the prerequisites for a comprehensive use of the significant clay quantities in cement and concrete are given. Accordingly, clays can make an effective contribution to increased sustainability in global building material production.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185646-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006111-5>
The Influence of Work Demands on Cockpit Crews on Flight Safety ¤ This contribution advocates a paradigm shift for the scientific discussion of questions and problems related to human performance capabilities in the context of societal mobility and safety. Using a physically and mathematically oriented approach, a concept of load and stress is developed, based on scientific knowledge of self-organization of dissipative systems. This approach provides a comprehensive and synchronous view of the working person in error-tolerant areas. The consistent application of the process concept is at the forefront of research activity. In particular, theoretical analyses focus on the pilot as the central control unit of the transport system in the trilateral field of ergonomic work design, economic efficiency, and guaranteed operational safety. This gives the question of the limits of his regulatory capacity a comprehensive and existence-relevant value. These limits need to be identified and located. To this end, a constructive approach to a hypothetical solution model is presented. In this process of knowledge, the possibility arises to set up a multi-dimensional system of criteria. With a hypothetical character, this can define the framework for desired optimizations of cockpit work in the sense of a human-centered design as well as for an increased flight safety, and provides an outlook for an improvement of long-term-oriented flight operational effectiveness and satisfaction for both airlines and their customers. For the empirical construct verification and practical applicability, a multi-stage methodology is proposed. The approach can be generally transferred to other professional activity areas. From the analyses conducted in the pre-construction phase on the current situation of the safety-relevant position of operational air personnel in a rapidly changing technical, social, and organizational living and working environment, design measures can be derived that could secure the operation of aircraft as attractive transporters in the long term. In view of an intended improvement of the compatibility of existential, social, and economic needs satisfaction, a work-scientificly determined argumentation path and a corresponding proposal for the re-structuring of European flight operation systems are shown.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036597-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4196509-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145063-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4199421-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128666-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4364380-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017678-2>
Anschauen, Anfassen, Auffassen : A History of Mathematical Models ¤ Speaking of Models -- Drawing Models -- Collecting Models -- Creating Models -- Representing Models. The creation, collection, and dissemination of mathematical models was a widespread practice at universities and technical colleges in the 19th and early 20th centuries. By examining selected models in the context of their collections, it can be shown that knowledge about mathematical models was generated in the process of modeling, collecting, selling, and exhibiting. Both artistic practices and reform pedagogical considerations flowed into this knowledge. At the center of the study are mathematics professors who drove the use of models in the context of academic teaching in different ways. Less well known is that women also had a significant share in the production of models. The book makes an important contribution to a praxeologically oriented history of science with the evaluations of numerous sources from different archives as well as an ethnographic observation of a model maker. The author Anja Sattelmacher is a scientific assistant at the Technical Information Library Hanover (TIB) and at the same time an associated scientist at the Institute for Media Studies at the Humboldt University of Berlin. She deals with topics at the interface between media and science history as well as with scientific collections and provenance research of scientific objects.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037944-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7518240-3>
Children of War, Conscience of the Nation: Moral Discourses in the Literature of Group 47 ¤ ›Scandals‹ surrounding secret entanglements with National Socialism have affected central members of Group 47, such as Grass, Andersch, or Walser. The study systematically inquires into the significance of these influences for the literary texts of the group for the first time. Based on the current image of Group 47, on theories of narrative ethics, and historical research on ›NS-morality‹, the study examines the discursive connections between morality and belonging in the most important texts of Group 47. Qualitative and quantitative analyses show the predominance of a particular moral understanding, as well as a connection between these moral conceptions and literary anti-Semitism in several texts. In addition, alternative ethics are found – e.g., in references to Buber's dialogical principle, which conceives of the turning towards the ›radically Other‹ as ethical action – although often in texts of marginalized or considered untypical members such as Bachmann and Celan.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4487901-5>
Customer Retention in Advisory-Intensive Retail: An Empirical Investigation with Special Consideration of Consumer Heterogeneity ¤ Conceptual foundations of customer retention -- Literature review on customer retention research -- Theoretical reference points for the emergence of customer retention -- Conceptualization of a model for explaining and controlling customer retention in advisory-intensive retail -- Empirical verification of the model -- Conclusion. Long-term binding of valuable customers is considered a central goal of successful corporate management. In retail, customer retention measures are the most important investment focus. The particular challenge lies in effectively and efficiently utilizing declining marketing budgets. However, there are currently only a few research approaches to realizing customer retention in retail companies. Isabel Martin develops a model for explaining and controlling customer retention in advisory-intensive retail based on comprehensive empirical surveys. The heterogeneity of consumers is taken into account by applying finite mixture analysis. The results enable the identification of relevant drivers of customer retention, the use of binding instruments segment-specifically, and thus the targeted allocation of marketing resources.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013974-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4384508-3>
Possibilities for Supporting Automatic Speech Recognition in Scientific Videos with the Help of Specialized Terminology ¤ Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems currently cannot correctly recognize all words and therefore cannot produce good transcriptions. The quality of automatic speech recognition is influenced by many factors. One of these is the vocabulary. The more diverse and complex the topics, the larger the number of specialized words that need to be recognized, the more difficult the recognition task and the poorer the transcription results. The language models of ASR systems must be adapted through training so that they can also achieve good results in areas with specialized vocabulary. In this work, it is investigated whether the percentage of correctly recognized words can be effectively increased by training the ASR language model with specialized terminology. Based on the results of the experiments conducted, it is shown which number and type of data are required to reduce the percentage of incorrectly recognized words. The results of domain adaptation form the basis for the subsequent comparison of the specialized vocabulary in lecture videos and scientific publications to show the differences in terms of the used specialized language. The recognition of specialized terminology and its distinction from general language form the basis and starting point for the entire investigation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5>
Ecological variability in coastal oceans : simulating biological-physical interactions with Lagrangian Individual-based models ¤ In this thesis, the effect of biological-physical interactions on two fundamental processes in coastal ecosystems is assessed by means of Individual-based Models. The phytoplankton spring bloom dynamics on an alongshore transect in the German Bight were mainly regulated by either the water column light climate or the current pattern in two consecutive years. Hydrodynamics were also the main factor determining the invasion of a non-native benthic invertebrate into the intertidal Wadden Sea. Despite their limited swimming ability, planktonic larvae of these benthic invertebrate may significantly alter their dispersal by vertical migration in vertically sheared tidal currents. The results of this thesis reveal that the interaction of biological physical processes has a distinct impact on growth and distribution of marine organisms in the coastal ocean. <engl.> END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073860-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4225737-2>
Sol-Gel induced conductivity modulation of carbon nanotube (CNT) networks and their causes ¤ This work deals with a new method for the production of a highly conductive layer from a CNT/Sol-Gel composite. For this, thin CNT networks are first applied to an electrically non-conductive substrate and then penetrated with Sol-Gel in the immersion coating process. In addition to CNT networks with dispersants, this method is also applied to dispersant-free ones. Subsequent thermal processing of the coatings allows for the change of the electrical properties of the composite due to thermally induced compaction mechanisms of the Sol-Gel. Due to the possibility of equivalent processing of Sol-Gel-free CNT networks, it is also possible to study the influence of the Sol-Gel on the CNT networks. In this context, the unexpectedly increased electrical conductivity of thermally specially treated CNT/Sol-Gel composites (in comparison to the Sol-Gel-free equivalent) is considered and the effects of the Sol-Gel on the CNT network are evaluated based on morphological investigations and temperature-dependent electrical properties. By adapting theoretical models to the found experimental data, specific key values of the coatings were determined and compared with each other. It turned out that an optimized electrical CNT-CNT transition of the composite is largely responsible for the improved electrical properties compared to the Sol-Gel-free reference.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139250-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4581365-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4278915-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014200-0>
Foreign Policy as Culture: Discourses and Practices of European Security and Defense Policy ¤ Gabi Schlag shows, through an interpretative reconstruction of the intergovernmental negotiations on the European Defence Community (EDC) between 1950–1954 and the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) between 1998-2001, how Europe and the EU are constituted as a global security actor. The author concludes that the meaning-making of the EDC in the early 1950s is based on a transatlantic discourse and practice community, while the discourses and practices for shaping the ESDP since 1998 have deviated from this understanding. Following discourse- and practice-theoretical approaches in international relations, the author understands foreign policy as a cultural practice that constantly reinvents collective actors through the mobilization of symbolic orders and their practical implementation. A cultural science approach is thus particularly helpful for analyzing the continuous transformation of European foreign policy.

Modelling and Architecture of a Mobile Distributed System for Compensation of Prospective Memory Deficits ¤ This work describes the conception and model of structured interactive memory prompts for compensation of prospective memory deficits and their testing in the mobile memory aid system MEMOS. For this purpose, patients were equipped with a smartphone, the Personal Memory Assistant (PMA), and reminded and guided through tasks using structured interactive memory prompts. MEMOS is the first system worldwide to use structured interactive memory prompts and a decoupled bidirectional communication between patient and caregiver. Context - Memory disorders are one of the most common consequences of brain damage after strokes or head injuries. Deficits in prospective memory, which is responsible for planning and executing future tasks, are particularly hindering for an autonomous life. Compensation of the missing functionality through external memory aids that remind of upcoming tasks is the only way to effectively help affected patients. Method - The realization of this work and the implementation of MEMOS required interdisciplinary processing of three task focal points. - Analysis of neuropsychological requirements. - A patient-friendly memory aid can only be realized in the form of a simple-to-use electronic assistant that guides the patient through complex tasks using situation-dependent memory prompts. - Model of structured interactive memory prompts and system architecture - Situation-dependent memories are realized in MEMOS through structured interactive memory prompts. For this purpose, action sequences are broken down into simple steps, memory prompts are generated and linked together. The implementation in a machine-manageable structure occurs in the MEMOS task model, which ensures the validity and integrity of individual tasks (tasks) and complete daily plans. MEMOS consists of a mobile component, the PMA, for direct patient interaction and a basic system for the administration and coordination of structured interactive memory prompts. The PMA communicates with the basic system via mobile phone and is able to compensate for longer interruptions. The basic system recognizes malfunctions and critical states, which automatically alerts the responsible caregiver. Patient-friendly adaptation - The success of a memory aid depends on the patient's acceptance. In addition to general usability aspects, such as preventing errors, hiding error states, and easy learnability, surveys have shown the central importance of individual adaptation of the memory aid to the needs and abilities of individual patients. Relevance - MEMOS was successfully tested in use with patients. The number of forgotten or failed tasks was significantly reduced. The model of structured interactive memory prompts was validated and the practicability of MEMOS could be shown.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034831-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142230-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038281-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4571046-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4491714-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137544-0>
New Life from the Lab : Biological and Ethical Aspects of Synthetic Biology ¤ Leona Litterst systematically combines the question of whether, using techniques of Synthetic Biology, „new life“ can be produced, with the ethical dimension of whether it should be produced and what rules apply. To this end, she presents five research approaches of Synthetic Biology in detail, illuminates their claim to produce „new life“, and evaluates risk potentials in an ethically-anthroporelational perspective. She examines central ethical and systematic aspects of responsibility, the concepts of the game, of life, of naturalness and artificiality, as well as the moral status of research objects of Synthetic Biology. It becomes clear that the possibility of producing „new life“ is not only a question of technical implementation, but also of how we want to deal with „new life“ and the possible chances and risks of Synthetic Biology in the future.

Synthesis and characterization of semiconductor and semiconductor-metal nanoparticles ¤ This work is a contribution to the development of colloidal synthesis of various nanomaterials, such as lead chalcogenide and indium oxide nanoparticles as well as hybrid nanostructures consisting of copper indium sulfide selenide and gold nanoparticles. In the first part, quasi-monodisperse PbE(E=S, Se, Te)-semiconductor nanoparticles are shown, which are synthesized by a new method with the formation of Pb0-particles. Spherical PbSe-nanoparticles are investigated for application in hybrid solar cells. The second part deals with the new synthesis for the production of colloidal In2O3-nanocrystals. The form of the nanocrystals could be influenced by the addition of Cu-ions. Finally, the selective growth of gold nanocrystals on the CuInSSe-nanoparticles with the formation of hybrid metal-semiconductor nanostructures is shown. During synthesis, gold nanocrystals grow on the tips of the CuInSSe-pyramids. <dt.>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134420-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4342626-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022993-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169590-2>
Political Racism in the Post-Homogeneous Society: A Postcolonial Critique ¤ Racism is political and the political is shaped by racism. In many parts of German society, proponents of homogeneity and advocates of diversity are irreconcilably opposed to each other. Lorenz Narku Laing analyzes the posthomogeneous society and shows that racist policies are at the core business of advocates of homogeneity. His postcolonial critique examines the underlying reasons for this and provides a critical intervention in (policy-)scientific research at the same time. It becomes clear that racism is far more than discrimination and disadvantage: racism is a political ideology	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048829-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012472-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4566658-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0>
Conflict Resolution through Self-Transformation : Mediation as Subjectification ¤ Jakob Tröndle offers a comprehensive representation of the German-speaking mediation field and discourse for the first time. Based on the empirical basis of a discourse analysis, a theoretical understanding of mediation as subjectification is developed. This enables the development of mediation towards a subject-cultural innovation. The work is also a plea to break up the canonized practice knowledge of mediation through scientific reflection and thus to further develop mediation.

Investigation of Defect Reactions in Silicon using Carrier Lifetime Spectroscopy ¤ In this work, the fundamentals of temperature- and injection-dependent lifetime spectroscopy (T-IDLS) are explained, which is an extremely sensitive method of material characterization of semiconductors. Subsequently, these are applied to model materials (silicon wafers) specifically contaminated with iron, copper, and nickel. It is shown that, using T-IDLS, not only can the parameterization of defects generated by contamination (energetic position in the bandgap, ratio of capture cross-sections) be determined. But also chemical reactions of individual defects in the model materials can be proven (through changes in defect concentration) and, in addition, evaluated according to the laws of thermodynamics and kinetics. Finally, the results are applied to the simulation of the influence of different defects on the efficiency of Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell (PERC) solar cells.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4720368-7>
Susceptibility weighted imaging and quantitative susceptibility mapping at 3 Tesla and beyond : new approaches and applications ¤ The non-invasive, detailed anatomical and morphological representation of the human brain is of great importance for the evaluation and differentiation between normal and pathological tissue. The present work investigates the potential and possibilities of new, gradient-echo-based magnetic resonance tomographic (MRT) methods to represent brain structures and cerebral vessels with high spatial resolution at different magnetic field strengths from 3T to 9.4T using the intrinsic magnetic tissue susceptibility qualitatively and quantitatively. The new MRT methods used in this work are susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). After a brief description of the basics of these two methods as well as magnetic resonance tomography, the first part of this work deals with the optimization of SWI for the representation of the venous cerebral vascular system at ultrahigh magnetic field strengths. This is done by using numerical simulations as well as phantom and subject studies. Furthermore, a new double-echo MRT sequence, which was developed and implemented during the work, is presented. This sequence enables the simultaneous acquisition of data for the non-invasive representation of both the arterial and venous cerebral vascular system. The second part of the work deals with the quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) of the brain of subjects at the ultrahigh field strength of 7T, in order to represent (sub-) structures of the deep and cortical gray as well as white brain substance, which are partially not visible on conventional magnitude and phase images or on maps of the effective transverse relaxation rate (R2*). It is shown that QSM is able to identify and characterize different brain structures based on their magnetic susceptibility. The third part of the work explores, based on first studies, the possibilities of using quantitative susceptibility mapping to detect and characterize pathological changes in brain tissue. These preliminary studies were carried out on patients with glioblastoma as well as on a preclinical mouse model of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer's disease. The results are very promising, as it has been shown that QSM offers the unique possibility of distinguishing between blood breakdown products and calcium deposits non-invasively using MRI, and that in the mouse model, the different gradient-echo contrasts are sensitive to cerebral microbleeds, but not to amyloid-[Beta]-deposits. The application of gradient-echo-based MR imaging at ultrahigh magnetic field strengths using new post-processing strategies to exploit or extract the magnetic tissue susceptibility enables the representation and characterization of healthy and pathological tissue in a unique way. Both susceptibility-weighted imaging and quantitative susceptibility mapping open up a great potential for further clinical applications, as they provide not only qualitative but also quantitative information that may serve as biomarkers for the evaluation of brain diseases.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184168-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269638-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019752-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120806-7>
The Church of Our Fathers ¤ For many Germans who emigrated to South America in the 19th and 20th centuries, the concept of 'Deutschtum' held an identity-forming significance. This is reflected in the German-speaking Protestant churches in Chile. The pastors sent from Germany, the lived church traditions, and the sung hymns served as a connection to the German homeland for many people. In the 1930s and 1940s, the discourse on Deutschtum gains intensity. As part of the German-speaking colonies, the church communities are close to the nationalist organizations abroad. Many pastors become members of the NSDAP – in their sermons, speeches, and letters, the connection to homeland and Deutschtum is also theologized. After 1945, a critical examination of National Socialism is largely absent. On the contrary: During Martin Niemöller's visit to South America, open confrontations over the interpretation of the past occur in 1950.

A new dynamic visualization system for online and offline presentation of interactive 3D terrain models ¤ With this dissertation, ways are shown at the example of the newly developed software 3DMapView, to minimize deficits in the field of interactive real-time exploration of 3D terrain models. The work includes a practical part (software 3DMapView) and a scientific-theoretical text part. In the text part, presentation variants of three-dimensional digital terrain models as well as current visualization technologies are analyzed and evaluated, which also allows the motivation for the development of an individual software solution to be differentiated. Furthermore, this work is intended to document the development steps of the software 3DMapView, introduce the user to the operation, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this approach in order to be able to assess in conclusion what potential individually developed software solutions can offer for the interactive 3D visualization of terrain models.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156391-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029823-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188417-6>
Growth and Characterization of InSb-Nanowire Structures ¤ III-V semiconductors; nanowires; Vapor-Liquid-Solid (VLS); Vapor-Solid-Solid (VSS); epitaxial growth; Chemical Beam Epitaxy (CBE); electron microscopy; heterostructures This work is concerned with the growth of InSb nanowires using Chemical Beam Epitaxy (CBE). Utilizing a self-developed growth system, the growth behavior of the InSb nanowires is first determined, followed by the examination of the cultivated structures with respect to their morphology, structural composition, and physical properties. The synthesized nanowires were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). Essential results of the investigations are: i) The planar defect density within the nanowires can be influenced by the growth temperature. ii) The change of the mass flow ratio of the precursor materials suppresses parasitic layer growth, as well as radial growth of the nanowires. iii) By using suitable growth parameters, radial InSb-GaSb-heterostructures were generated and characterized. iv) Both individual nanowires and large-area ordered nanowire fields were contacted and electrically measured using lithographic processes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4707308-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152545-0>
Benchmark-Manipulation : an economic and regulatory analysis of the LIBOR manipulation scandal ¤ LIBOR, ‘the world’s most important number’, is the most widely used interest rate benchmark in connection with financial contracts with an outstanding value of more than 300 trillion US dollars. However, its susceptibility to manipulation, conflicts of interest and weak governance structures led to one of the biggest manipulation scandals in the financial sector. From 1st January 2018 on, the self-regulatory system for benchmarks came to an end in the European Union with the introduction of a new European regulation. Starting with an economic analysis of the conflicting nature of benchmark structures, this thesis shows the ineffectiveness of the ex ante and ex post regulatory framework that existed previously. Its final part examines whether the introduction of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2016 and the Benchmark Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 is an adequate means of closing the existing loopholes.

Regulation of Internet Communication Services: On the Applicability of Telecommunications Law to Voice over IP, Instant Messaging, and E-Mail Services ¤ Internetkommunikationsdienste sind Dienste, die zwischenmenschliche Kontakte über das Internet ermöglichen. Zu diesen zählen etwa die Internettelefonie (Voice over IP, z.B. Skype), Instant Messaging (z.B. WhatsApp) und die E-Mail. Viele dieser Dienste sind bereits seit den 1990er Jahren populär, doch ihre rechtliche Einordnung und die daran anknüpfenden Regulierungsfolgen sind nach wie vor umstritten. In dem Werk wird untersucht, ob sie de lege lata vom Telekommunikationsrecht erfasst sind. Sodann wird erforscht, welche Regelungen dieses Rechtsgebiets sinnvoll auf derartige Angebote anwendbar sind oder künftig sein sollten. Analysiert werden Normen des sektorspezifischen Kartellrechts, des Kundenschutzes, der öffentlichen Sicherheit sowie des Datenschutzrechts. Abschließend wird angesichts des schnellen technischen Wandels in der Telekommunikationsbranche die Reaktionsfähigkeit des hierzulande geltenden Telekommunikationsrechts im Vergleich zum US-amerikanischen Recht untersucht. Internet-based communications services enable interpersonal communication via the Internet. Among them are Internet telephony services (voice over IP, e.g. Skype), instant messaging services (e.g. WhatsApp) and e-mails. Many of these services have been popular since the 1990s, but it is still not clear how they are legally classified and which rules they have to adhere to.This thesis examines whether they fall within the scope of telecommunications law and how they should be regulated. It analyses sector-specific antitrust law, consumer protection law, public safety law and privacy law. Another aspect are problems caused by rapid technological change. Therefore, the work concludes by comparing the German and European legal situation with the legal framework in the United States in terms of each law’s ability to respond.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4768766-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011134-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123202-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4770362-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191427-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201190-5>
The Law of Unjust Enrichment in the Draft Common Frame of Reference (DCFR) from a German Perspective ¤ The work undertakes a first comprehensive analysis of the hitherto little-noticed model rules on the law of unjust enrichment in Book VII of the Draft Common Frame of Reference (DCFR). By means of a comparative law analysis with German law, the norm complex „unjustified enrichment“ is examined for its regulatory quality and value justice. It is thus determined to what extent it can serve as a source of inspiration for a reform of German law of unjust enrichment, or even a suitable component of a future „European Civil Code“.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061728-2>

Rotating Liquid Rings in Newtonian and Einsteinian Gravitational Theory ¤ Using various analytical approximation methods, axisymmetric, stationary, rigidly rotating liquid rings in Newtonian and Einsteinian gravitational theory are calculated and compared with very accurate numerical solutions of the full problem - a free boundary problem of partial differential equations. The starting point for the development of an iterative approximation method is the following circumstance: The smaller the cross-section of a ring at a fixed extension of the ring, the more circular it is. The boundary value problem reduces to ordinary differential equations in this case. These are solved analytically in some cases (constant mass density, polytropic equation of state with polytropic index n equal to one and n approaching infinity) and numerically in others. Some results can be derived without solving the differential equations, partly for any equation of state. With the same method, relativistic, homogeneous rings are calculated in post-Newtonian approximation. The ordinary differential equations arising in this case are solved analytically. In addition, Newtonian rings are considered in the so-called Roche model. In this case, the ring is not treated as a self-gravitating fluid, but in a suitable given potential. This leads to algebraic equations and provides good approximations for polytropic rings with high polytropic index. In the limiting case of thin rings, the equations can be solved analytically, even at the mass-ablation boundary.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4297565-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157516-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155303-2>

Ursula Hermann investigates the questions of how hospice and palliative teams experience their professional requirements and which topics they bring up in supervision. For this purpose, she examines the field of hospice and palliative care using the advisory setting of supervision. The ethnographic method of participant observation provides insights into counseling processes, the participatory research strategy enables participation in the research results for supervisees. The experiences and action practices of the professional groups make clear the diversity of topics in the care and care of dying and severely ill people and the challenges that come with the organizational embedding of palliative care.

Informationspraxen in der Bildungsforschung : ethnographic information research on research environments, apparatuses, and research data in interaction ¤ How are data used in educational research or, put differently, how are data turned into research data with corresponding assertiveness for the relevant research question and thus into relevant information in research practice? To address this question, information practices in five different educational research projects are ethnographically investigated, described, and contrasted. This shows how these research projects are enabled to pursue their respective research questions through the production, use, and re-configuration of apparatuses, materials, and data in interaction with an object of investigation. In this work, therefore, less emphasis is placed – as is often the case in information science – on the end product of scientific work, the scientific publication, as the focus of knowledge interest. Instead, information practices, especially interactions in the production and use of research data in their contexts, are assigned a primary position in research interest, without, however, neglecting publications. Publications are considered here – just like other entities – as part of the interaction context to be investigated, through which educational research takes place.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115646-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1098579690> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122926-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066611-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4395695-6>
Die Neuregelung des Familiennachzugs zu subsidiär Schutzberechtigten : a constitutional and European law examination of Sec. 36a AufenthG ¤ Im Jahr 2018 beschloss der Bundestag die Neuregelung des Familiennachzugs zu subsidiär Schutzberechtigten. Dieser erhält durch § 36a AufenthG eine ›Obergrenze‹, weshalb nur noch maximal 1.000 Visa monatlich verteilt werden. Die Arbeit geht der Frage nach, ob diese Einschränkung des Familiennachzugs mit dem deutschen Grundgesetz, der EMRK und dem Unionsrecht vereinbar ist. Dabei stellt sie auch die grundlegende Struktur sowohl des Familiennachzugs als auch des subsidiären Schutzes dar. Zudem befasst sich die Arbeit in einem Exkurs mit der Frage, ob syrischen Bürgern, die nach Deutschland geflohen sind, der Schutz nach der Genfer Flüchtlingskonvention oder subsidiärer Schutz zu gewähren ist. Insgesamt kommt die Arbeit zu dem Ergebnis, dass die Neuregelung des Familiennachzugs zu subsidiär Schutzberechtigten zwar mit dem Grundgesetz, der EMRK und der EU-Grundrechtecharta vereinbar ist, jedoch gegen die Familienzusammenführungsrichtlinie verstößt und daher unionsrechtswidrig ist. / 'New Regulation of Family Reunification for Persons eligible for Subsidiary Protection. A Constitutional and European Law Examination of Sec. 36a AufenthG': Since the new regulation, only 1,000 family members per month are allowed to enter Germany for family reunification with persons eligible for subsidiary protection. The thesis addresses the question of whether this restriction is in accordance with constitutional and European law. It concludes that this regulation of family reunification to persons eligible for subsidiary protection is compatible with the German Constitution, the ECHR and the CFR, but violates the Family Reunification Directive.

Opto-electronic characterization of polycrystalline CuInS2 and Cu(In,Ga)S2 absorber layers by photoluminescence ¤ Photoluminescence (PL) is an established method to characterize the opto-electronic properties of solar cell absorber layers. With the help of Planck’s generalized law it is in principle possible to determine the quasi-Fermi level splitting and the absorption coefficient of a solar cell before its actual completion. For large-scale measurements (mm/cm regime) this is valid for absorber layers with lateral homogeneous properties, however it is not directly transferable to polycrystalline semiconductors due to laterally fluctuating opto-electronic and structural parameters. In this work the lateral fluctuations in opto-electronic properties of polycrystalline Cu(In,Ga)S2 have been analyzed by measuring laterally and spectrally resolved PL on the mym-scale and providing the transition towards macroscopic PL measurements on the mm-scale. To give a comprehensive characterization, surface roughness and optical properties have been studied and methods for feature extraction have been applied. <engl.> END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000245-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166125-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121476-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174517-6>
Graph-based methods for the design of DNA computations ¤ Die Zuverlässigkeit von DNA-basierten Berechnungen hängt stark ab von den DNA-Sequenzen, die die Informationseinheiten repräsentieren. Eine optimale Zusammensetzung derartiger Sequenzen wird mit konventionellen Rechenverfahren ermittelt. Als Maß für die Sequenzerstellung wird die freie Energie der Hybridizierung zweier DNA-Einzelstränge herangezogen. Die Arbeit befasst sich mit zwei Kernpunkten in diesem Bereich. Erstens, mit dem Auffinden einer Sekundärstruktur eines DNA/DNA-Komplexes mit minimaler freier Energie. Zu diesem Zweck wurde eine neue graphbasierte Darstellung von DNA/DNA-Komplexen erarbeitet. Auf diesem Modell wurden zwei Berechnungsmethoden entwickelt, die auf dem Prinzip der dynamischen Programmierung beruhen. Zweitens, die Validierung der vorgegebenen Menge von DNA-Wörtern, die die Informationseinheiten eines mathematischen Problems kodieren. Die entwickelte Methode beruht auf der Abschätzung der freien Energie. Sie zielt auf DNA-Berechnungsmodelle ab, die zwei voneinander abhängige Arten von Informationseinheiten benutzen. Eine weitere Errungenschaft dieser Arbeit bezieht sich auf die Optimierung des Algorithmus' von Floyd-Warshall, der die kürzesten Wege zwischen je zwei Knoten in einem gewichteten Graphen liefert. Der entwickelte Ansatz führt zu einer Speicherreduktion für den Fall der bipartiten Graphen. The reliability of results in DNA based computations strongly depends on the DNA sequences representing the units of information. The task of finding appropriate sequences is currently handled by means of conventional computing. The most accurate criterium for this purpose is the free energy of hybridization complexes built by two DNA single strands. This thesis addresses two issues in this area. First, finding of a secondary structure of DNA/DNA complexes having minimal free energy. For this, a novel graph-based representation of DNA/DNA complexes is introduced and two advanced methods calculating the free energy based on dynamic programming are proposed. Second, the validation of a given set of DNA words to encode a particular assignment of a mathematical problem. For this, a method is developed based on free energy assessment. It is suitable for DNA computing models that are based on an interdependent encoding of DNA words, which represent two different types of entities in the mathematical problem. Another accomplishment of the thesis is an optimization of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph. A memory reduction method for the particular case of bipartite graphs is established.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070512-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4270224-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113782-6>
Acceptance Communication in the Energy and Raw Materials Economy: Opportunities and Limits for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises to Improve Acceptance Levels in the Example of the Free State of Saxony ¤ Background: Energy and raw materials economy in the field of societal necessity and citizen protest -- Problem statement: Gaps in interdisciplinary research and their consequences for the energy and raw materials industry -- Goal and solution approach: Communicative opportunities for energy and raw materials acceptance in Saxony -- Results: Analysis of (in-)acceptance and derivations for communicative enhancement -- Discussion of results: Project acceptance requires integrative communication -- Bibliography. This open-access publication examines the acceptance of the Saxon population towards energy and raw materials projects as well as the suitability of communication measures to improve the acceptance level. Citizens are surveyed for the first time representatively about their (in-)acceptance towards types of facilities. It is proven that acceptance is always lower for local projects than sociopolitically. For renewable energy conversion plants, acceptance is highest for hydroelectric and solar power plants, lowest for biomass plants. Fossil fuel conversion plants are less accepted and open-cast and underground mining are rated the worst. A comparative survey of corporate representatives in the energy and raw materials sector reveals a dissonance between the assumed and the recorded (in-)acceptance of the population: The acceptance level is lower, regardless of the type of project, than assumed by corporate representatives. The findings are used to develop a web application that enables small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, to select suitable communication measures for acceptance enhancement. The author Stefanie Walter is Assistant Professor for integrated European sustainability communication at the Faculty of Media at the Hochschule Mittweida as well as freelance communication, project, and event manager. Her research focus is on acceptance and sustainability communication as well as communication management.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014743-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031883-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006287-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000996-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005614-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050434-7>
Europe beyond Parliamentarism: Strategies of Informal Influence ¤ The study focuses on informal strategies and practices of Members of the German Bundestag in influencing EU legislation. It sheds light on how, where and with whom German parliamentarians cooperate to informally influence EU decision-making processes and to control the activities of the German Federal Government. By capturing difficult-to-access informal practices of information retrieval and action coordination with policy-makers in EU institutions, the study fills an important research gap with regard to the functioning of EU multi-level parliamentarism. Using a qualitative empirical case study on EU research policy, typologies of informal action strategies of MPs and the categorisation of cooperation formats in influencing the EU level are developed. The study addresses those who analyse the constitution of the parliamentary democracy of the EU from a practical as well as a scientific perspective. It provides insights into the entanglement of federal and European politics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170174-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044685-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032386-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032312-2>
Proof of mesoscopic electrical inhomogeneities in undoped GaAs using point-contact methods ¤ To characterize mesoscopic electrical inhomogeneities in undoped GaAs, which often exhibit a cellular structure with high-resistance cell centers and low-resistance cell walls, the point-contact technique was further developed, making high-resolution and quantitative resistance measurements possible. Investigations of the I-U curve of the point contact showed that the latter can be approximately described by a Schottky contact with high series resistance. Calibration of the point-contact current (IPC) provided an inverse proportionality between IPC and resistance for resistances > 1E6 Ohmcm. Measurements showed that the resistance fluctuations in semi-insulating samples were less than one order of magnitude. In contrast, samples in the high-resistance region (n = 1E10 cm-̂3) showed differences in resistance of up to 3 orders of magnitude.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019155-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014200-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201275-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125030-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176379-8>
Development of a Design Procedure for Ship Rudders Based on Statistical Operational Profiles ¤ Anhand des untersuchten Beispielschiffs wird deutlich, dass die Definition des Entwurfspunktes, auf den sich üblicherweise alle Entwurfs- und Optimierungsstrategien fokussieren, sich im späteren Betriebsalltag im Vergleich zum auftretenden mittleren Betriebszustand nicht bestätigt. Damit weichen auch die aus dem Entwurfszustand abgeleiteten Annahmen in ähnlicher Weise von der Realität ab. Die auf dieser Basis erstellte Entwurfsvariante ist wie belegt im Hinblick auf den späteren Betrieb suboptimal. Die Möglichkeit der Ableitung der Entwurfseingangsgrößen aus der statistischen Betrachtung des später zu erwartenden Schiffsbetriebs ist gegeben. Die Berechnungen für das untersuchte Beispielschiff zeigen, dass dies für den Entwurfsaspekt Ruder gelingt. Voraussetzung dafür ist die Berücksichtigung aller relevanten Einflussgrößen auf Propellerstrahl und Ruderbewegung. Hierzu ist eine konsequente Abbildung des Gesamtsystems im Sinne des manövrierenden Schiffs zweifellos der Ziel führende Weg. A new design procedure for ship rudders based on operational profiles will be presented. Main objective of the procedure is the reduction of rudder cavitation. The procedure mainly consists of the parts evaluation and optimization. The evaluation is carried out by calculating a frequency distribution of possible cavitation on the rudder blade surface. This leads to a quantification of the cavitation hazard and a localization of critical zones based on the complete operational profile. The subsequent rudder shape optimisation is carried out by calculating the distribution of mean pressure values on the rudder surface. Based on the pressure distribution alongside horizontal sections the optimization of the profile sections is shown by use of the Profile Theory. Input parameters for the optimization are determined by a new method of equivalent flow in order to consider the inhomogeneity of the slipstream. The capability of the rudder design procedure is shown on the basis of full scale observations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4551489-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178603-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121208-3>
Analysis of Embryonic and Perinatal Piglet Losses: A Study on Fertility-Focused Sow Lines in Central German Pig Breeding Farms ¤ In the present work, in the first part project on sows of the German Landrace, the height of embryonic and fetal mortality at physiologically significant points of gestation was characterized, as well as the ovary and uterus with regard to their influence were evaluated. By cluster analysis, sows could be identified that significantly more intact fetuses at low loss rates achieve. In the second part project, perinatal losses were documented directly at parturition in connection with the recording and evaluation of possible parameters.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154007-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4372234-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053848-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057312-6>
Dynamics of Business Cooperations ¤ In the present work, the author develops a model for the dynamics of business cooperations. In the theoretical part, existing research strands are ordered and examined for their contribution to a dynamic consideration of cooperations. Anja Schwerk considers both business and sociological research as well as economic research with their industrial economic and game-theoretical models. For the first time, both phases and processes are integrated within a model. It shows that the decisive driving forces for the formation of cooperations are external market- and competition-specific factors and the resulting resource- and behavior interdependencies. The industrial and social network in which the companies are located supports the external driving forces in their effect. External and internal partner-specific factors determine the initial conditions of a cooperation. Time-successive phases with specific contents and permanently running phase-overlapping processes characterize the self-dynamics of the cooperation. The stability variables trust, communication, 'commitment' and learning affect the phase-overlapping processes and the cooperation value. They are able to balance out cooperation-damaging developments of external and internal factors. In the empirical part, the author tests the various aspects of the model with the help of a cross-sectional analysis of legalized German cartels and a case study analysis of the cooperations of Deutsche Lufthansa AG. In addition to its theoretical contribution, the work also provides general and phase-specific guidelines for the successful design of a cooperation for practitioners.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139122-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078604-3>

Asbestos and Environmental Criminal Law ¤ It is astonishing how little today in the population is known about asbestos. In the coming years, this topic will become increasingly relevant due to the increasing number of buildings in need of renovation. When dealing with asbestos, environmental criminal law plays an important role in practice. On the one hand, due to the lack of knowledge in the population, the risk is great that asbestos-containing material is handled or disposed of incorrectly. On the other hand, those who have recognized the material as such are tempted to avoid proper, cost-effective disposal. This work provides a comprehensive first-time examination of the handling of asbestos from an environmental criminal law perspective, taking into account all relevant provisions of the StGB, the Chemicals Act, and other national and European regulations. By means of practice-relevant example cases, the reader is made aware of how the respective behavior is to be legally evaluated	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003178-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071808-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121812-7>
Suhrkamp and GDR: Literary-Historical, Praxeological, and Theoretical Perspectives on a Publishing Archive ¤ The study reconstructs the complex history of the relationship between the Suhrkamp publishing house and authors and literature of the GDR for the first time. Based on unpublished archival materials, it provides new insights into people, practices, and production processes and thus opens up a part of the still largely unwritten literary history of divided Germany. Literary scholar Anke Jaspers experiments with the possibilities of a praxeologically oriented literary history, in which publishing houses are conceptually integrated as central actors. Empirically grounded, she shows how the 'edition' as a category between text and work can be integrated into the theory of the literary work. Furthermore, Jaspers demonstrates how intentionalistic thought figures of hermeneutics can be presented more differentiatedly at the developed genre of 'edition interpretation' and considering the role of publishing houses in literature production. With a view to the participation of authors in the production of their books, a material aesthetics of literary authorship is also unfolded.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035964-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4146827-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187861-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121054-2>

Language Awareness in Multilingual Children ¤ This work deals with the role of multilingualism for further language learning - especially with the important factor of language awareness or Language Awareness. At the beginning, a thorough theoretical discussion of the construct Language Awareness is presented. Initially, various definitions and receptions of the term are presented against each other. Subsequently, possibilities of investigation and previous study results on the genesis of language awareness, the intercorrelation of language awareness and multilingualism, as well as the relevance of language awareness for further language learning are shown. Based on this, the didactic implications that can be derived from the previous research results for foreign language teaching are discussed. In the last part of the work, different investigation methods are discussed first. Some of them are used in the framework of a case study of two multilingual children growing up, whose language awareness is qualitatively and comprehensively analyzed on several levels.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038403-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014801-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030550-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056448-4>

Color in Street Lighting - Laboratory Study on the Determination of Detection Thresholds under Normal and Impaired Visual Conditions due to Rain and Blinding ¤ Current technologies in the field of light source development and lighting control enable a high variety of colors, which can be varied as needed in the operation of a lighting system. Through this development, color becomes an independent parameter that is hardly or not considered at all in street lighting practice and should therefore be evaluated. This work deals with the topic and investigates the influence of color on visual performance with the aim of generating new scientific findings to improve object detection in the application area of street lighting. In a laboratory study, a physiological threshold examination was carried out with a 32-person collective. The research approach used has a strong practical focus. The object detection was determined at three, approximately typical for street lighting practice, luminance levels (0.3; 1.0; 3.0 cd/m^2) and four colors (2500 K; 4000 K; 6000 K; Mint) at a total of six object positions. In addition, impaired visual conditions caused by rain and physiological blinding were also taken into account. The results of the investigations confirm that the detection threshold increases with increasing adaptation luminance and increasing peripheral angle of the visual objects. In particular, color shows a significant reduction in the detection threshold at the highest color temperature for near-foveal visual objects. This effect is reversed for peripheral visual objects. Under impaired visual conditions, it was shown for blinding that the evaluation method used in street lighting practice over- or underestimates the blinding effect depending on the object position. In combination with rain, it tends to be shown that a rain event with a smaller droplet diameter (spray rain) leads to a stronger impairment of visual performance. From the results obtained in this work, it can be concluded that color is a non-negligible parameter in the design and evaluation of fixed street lighting installations and should therefore be taken into account in future practical applications. - Keywords: Color, luminance threshold, detection threshold, physiological blinding, rain, impaired visual conditions, street lighting, Mesopik	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180712-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129991-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135101-0>
Design and cost performance of WDM PONs for multi-wavelength users ¤ The rapid spread of the Internet leads to an increasing demand for higher bitrates in telecommunications networks. This can currently only be met with optical networks, particularly with the wavelength-multiplexing technology (WDM). Many research results indicate that WDM Passive Optical Networks (PON) represent the next generation of optical access networks. The wavelength-multiplexing technology is based on the fact that several optical channels with low bitrates are transmitted over a fiber and thus generate a WDM signal with high bitrate. The goal of this work is the identification of new architectures that provide at least one wavelength to each user and each service. New methods and models for calculating single- and multi-stage WDM PONs are introduced. In order to calculate and analyze all technologically feasible single- and multi-stage WDM PONs, a design tool was developed. For a widespread commercial use, it is not enough to offer functioning technologies; rather, economic considerations must be taken into account. This work enables a comparison of different architectures in terms of their economic efficiency and aims to identify those architectures that are cost-optimal. New cost-optimal network architectures lead to faster market penetration and make Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) a reality.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035624-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4418747-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4528448-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066424-7>
Determination of Therapy Results after Surgical Treatment of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Rupture in Dogs using Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy (TPLO) with Special Consideration of Osteoarthritis Development ¤ Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy, Cruciate Ligament Rupture, Dog, Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy, cranial cruciate ligament rupture, dog. - TPLO is one of the most commonly used surgical procedures for the treatment of cranial cruciate ligament rupture, especially in large dogs. The aim of this study was to determine the long-term clinical therapy results and the development of osteoarthritis after TPLO in a retrospective long-term study, as well as to evaluate potential prognostic influencing factors. In addition, a comparative prospective study was conducted to investigate whether the use of a stable (Synthes TPLO Plate, n=19) compared to a conventional plate system (SECUROS TPLO Plate, n=20) can positively influence postoperative lameness and osteoarthritis development and reduce the complication rate. In the framework of the retrospective study, the patient records of 119 dogs (135 knee joints) were evaluated with the collection of X-ray and operation findings, operation course and complications. The therapy result was evaluated based on the clinical and X-ray findings of a control examination with determination of osteoarthritis grade, osteoarthritis development and current lameness status as well as by a questionnaire filled in by the owner. The owner's satisfaction with the result of the operation was requested. The evaluation was carried out both combined and separately for patients who were only controlled by questionnaire (61 dogs, 69 knee joints) and those who could also be examined in the clinic (58 dogs, 66 knee joints). On average 31 months after TPLO, there was a significant, albeit only moderate, progression of osteoarthritis. Regardless of the osteoarthritis progression, good to very good results were achieved in 90.2% of cases in the long term. A medial prophylactic partial meniscectomy, previous operations on the knee joint or postoperative complications did not affect the long-term lameness result and did not have a negative effect on osteoarthritis development. In the framework of the prospective study, the intra- and postoperative complications were recorded. All patients were subjected to a clinical and X-ray examination both before the operation and three and six months after the operation and the ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044023-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026181-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003085-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4573085-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123547-2>
Ménage à trois in the East-West Conflict: City Partnerships between West German, French, and East German Municipalities from the 1950s to the Fall of the Wall ¤ About 30 French cities maintained city partnerships with a West German and an East German city during the Cold War: triangular constellations that mostly arose after a municipal election victory of the French Communist Party. The new majority closed, often in addition to the existing partnership with a city in the Federal Republic, another with a GDR commune. This involuntary Ménage-à-trois for the West German partner inevitably led to tensions, conflicts, and misunderstandings. Based on the case studies Rendsburg – Vierzon – Bitterfeld, Wangen – Châtillon – Merseburg, Velten – Grand-Couronne – Seelze and Dortmund – Amiens – Görlitz, Jürgen Dierkes systematically and empirically examines such triangular constellations on a municipal level for the first time: The various phases of the East-West conflict and the lived system competition were reflected in city partnerships and shaped the conflicts among the actors, particularly between the mayors.

Bypassing of path-blocking proteins on microtubules in kinesin-mediated cargo transport ¤ Kinesins are microtubule-associated motor proteins that convert the chemical energy of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into movement energy to support intracellular transport processes. It is generally accepted that kinesin movement along a single protofilament is the thermodynamically preferred transport mechanism. Kinesin-mediated transport in the intracellular matrix is subject to complex mechanisms, in which a variety of associated cell components or other proteins can interact with the motor proteins and limit their binding to the microtubule surface. Ultimately, this can lead to the cessation of transport processes. The present dissertation describes the transport of kinesin-complexed gold spheres along immobilized microtubules, whose surface has irreversibly bound blocking proteins that compete with the transporter protein for binding sites. To exactly block the binding site of the transporting kinesin on the microtubule, kinesin constructs of different lengths were chosen as obstacles. In the presence of protein blockades, it was observed that the kinesin did not move continuously like in the corresponding control experiments, but that phases of active transport alternated with rest phases. In general, transport was continued after rest pauses, without the kinesin detaching from the microtubule. This behavior suggests that the transporting kinesin is able to bypass these irreversibly bound obstacles in the presence of protein blockades ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185932-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4236029-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169864-2>

Mindfulness as Cultural Practice: On the Self-World Models of a Popular Phenomenon ¤ Mindfulness has gained an astonishing popularity over the last 50 years - driven by blooming promises and accompanied by blanket criticism. Jacob Schmidt's analysis of various approaches - such as Jon Kabat-Zinn's developed Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) - shows, however, that mindfulness practices model quite different self- and world relations. These do not only go back to Buddhist meditation practices, but can be reconstructed as complex entanglements with the culture of modernity and the acceleration society.

Regulation of Temporary Agency Work in the Light of EU and Constitutional Law ¤ Temporary agency work is one of the most contentious issues in labor market policy and the related scientific debate. This does not only concern the labor law discourse level. Rather, temporary agency work is to a high degree overformed by provisions of higher-ranking law. The author devotes himself to a sustainable analysis of the various EU and constitutional law determinants of this field of issues and examines the problematic regulatory decisions of the AÜG in view of the higher-ranking law. The investigation reveals that only a few regulatory provisions can be derived from the provisions of the Temporary Agency Work Directive or from the protection obligation theme of the Basic Law. The author therefore comes to the result that the regulatory system of the AÜG is essentially EU and constitutionally compliant. At the same time, the study points out existing regulatory gaps and culminates in an appeal to the democratic legislator.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4318364-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005914-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074122-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027285-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031384-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4181995-0>
The Further Development of German Civil Service Law through European Law ¤ The new case law on strike rights for civil servants represents a provisional peak of the influence of European law on the traditional national civil service law. Both the requirements from European labor and anti-discrimination law as well as from the ECHR have led to a far-reaching need for adaptation in national civil service law. The effects of these on the individual rights and obligations in the civil service relationship are analyzed in detail. It is examined whether the limits of permissible further development by European law have already been exceeded. On the other hand, European influences can also be a stimulus for modernization. The work provides a comprehensive overview of the essential changes and legal foundations due to the comprehensive representation. It therefore offers not only an introduction to this topic, but also enables a deeper engagement in science and practice	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048792-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005078-6>
Ecological variability in coastal oceans : simulating biological-physical interactions with Lagrangian Individual-based models ¤ In this dissertation, the effect of biological-physical interactions on two fundamental processes in coastal ecosystems is investigated using individual-based models. The dynamics of the phytoplankton spring bloom were significantly controlled either by the light climate in the water column or the flow pattern in a coastal transect in the German Bight over two consecutive years. Hydrodynamics was also the main factor determining the invasion of a non-native benthic invertebrate. Moreover, planktonic larvae of these benthic invertebrates can significantly influence their dispersal through vertical migration in vertically sheared tidal currents despite their limited swimming abilities. The results of this work show that the interaction of biological and physical processes has a decisive influence on the growth and distribution of marine organisms in the coastal sea.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073860-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4225737-2>

Plasma Equilibria in a Kerr Metric ¤ In this work, a quasineutral, ideal, and weakly dissipative two-fluid plasma is modeled, which is located in the immediate vicinity of a Kerr black hole. It was found that such a plasma can be completely described by four functions. A uniquely defined problem is obtained only for a weakly dissipative plasma. Within the framework of numerical simulations, equilibria in a closed and an open system were simulated. In a closed system, one obtains a vortex topology for not too large perturbations, which transitions to turbulence with increasing perturbation. The simulations of an open system were concerned with the question of modeling the so-called jets, fast outflows of matter along the rotation axis. It was successful in describing an equilibrium in which the matter is collected on the equatorial plane and then released again in the form of jets.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4228852-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053793-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121372-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046249-3>
Model-following control for a class of nonlinear systems ¤ The focus of this work is the so-called model-following control (MFC) control loop architecture. This architecture is a two-degree-of-freedom structure consisting of two control loops. The first control loop is called the model control loop and contains a nominal model of the process. The second control loop is called the process control loop and must compensate for model uncertainties and disturbances. Investigations of the MFC structure for linear systems show good robustness properties against uncertainties and disturbances. The present work investigates the MFC structure for nonlinear minimum-phase SISO systems in Byrnes-Isidori normal form with respect to uncertainties and disturbances in the input channel. Both control loops are designed using (partial) exact linearization. The basis of the model controller design is the nominal dynamics. The basis of the process controller design is the error dynamics between the process and model states. In order to achieve robustness against uncertainties and disturbances for the process controller, the design is combined with a high-gain approach. The gains of the process controller are proportional to powers of the reciprocal of the tuning parameter ε with 0 < ε ≤ 1. Lyapunov methods are used to prove stability and analyze robustness against uncertainties and disturbances. The model uncertainty is assumed to be locally Lipschitz-continuous and its norm satisfies a linear growth condition with the Lipschitz constant γ > 0. The maximum Lipschitz constant, such that stability can still be guaranteed for the closed control loop, is introduced as a quantitative robustness factor. When using the proposed controller design, the robustness factor is proportional to the reciprocal of the tuning parameter ε and the ultimate bound of the external error states is proportional to the tuning parameter ε. The proposed design is compared with a single-loop control loop with (partial) exact linearization. The proposed design allows for the compensation of significantly larger uncertainties at moderate increase of the control effort. At the same time, the desired behavior is achieved. The results are confirmed by simulations and a laboratory experiment. In the experiment, it is a DC motor that drives a flywheel mass.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133165-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132964-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4206985-3>
Currency Board Systems: Theoretical Aspects and Experiences ¤ The idea of the currency board system, which originated in the colonial era, is experiencing a renaissance in the face of currency and financial crises and transformation processes today. Currency board systems guarantee the convertibility of cash against foreign currency at a fixed exchange rate. -- In the framework of a comprehensive systematization of existing currency board systems, it becomes clear, inter alia, that monetary policy or exchange rate appreciation can be permissible in this system. In order to capture the effects associated with the system, the connection between the money supply and the balance of payments is clarified using the money base concept, and payment balance mechanisms are examined. Under credibility aspects, currency board systems can contribute to price level stabilization. A related risk of monetary undersupply can again lead to the recommendation of a monetary policy. For the European systems, integration possibilities into the European Monetary Union are finally examined through comparison of participation in the exchange rate mechanism II with normal bands and the maintenance of currency board principles. With growing probability of a negative convergence test, it is recommended to initially abandon the currency board system.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4522367-1>
The Judge's Precedence in Blood Sample Collection pursuant to § 81a Abs. 2 StPO ¤ Blood sample collection is one of the most frequently performed coercive measures in the Criminal Procedure Code. Despite their regular need for urgency, their order is generally reserved for the judge; the investigative authorities are only responsible in case of danger. From this field of tension, competence disputes arise, which in recent past have occupied numerous courts. This is taken as an opportunity to consider the dogmatic structures of the judge's precedence along with emergency competence and to develop practical solutions. The legislator has recognized the need for action and created a new § 81a Abs. 2 Sentence 2 StPO for the area of traffic offenses in 2017. The interpretation of the norm, however, raises some questions and does not meet the requirement to simplify the procedure for ordering blood sample collection under all aspects.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4146067-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4354778-3>
Autonomy and Defense in Criminal Proceedings between Rule of Law and Social State: The German Model of Necessary Defense in the Light of the Legal Aid Directive (EU) 2016/1919 ¤ The Directive (EU) 2016/1919 on legal aid for suspects and accused persons in criminal proceedings as well as for persons sought in proceedings for the execution of a European arrest warrant has an impact on the institution of necessary defense in the German criminal procedure. While necessary defense is, in the prevailing view, an expression of the rule of law, the institution has already undergone a change in the past, which is further intensified by the legal aid directive. In a Europeanized criminal procedure, it must now be possible from the outset of the police interrogation to exercise the right of access to a legal advisor, which is why state funding of defense must be ensured at this point in time. How state funding of defense in Germany should be shaped in the future is the subject of this fundamental examination.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115415-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129140-2>

Between Volunteering and Professional Politics : Professionalization of Municipal Politics in German Large Cities ¤ Council members in German large cities are in a dilemma: On the one hand, they are formally voluntary evening politicians, on the other hand, the exercise of their mandate is associated with a very high time expenditure. Marion Reiser examines which individual strategies the council members use to reconcile profession and mandate, and whether this high time expenditure leads to a creeping professionalization of municipal politics. Using the example of four German large cities - Frankfurt am Main, Hanover, Nuremberg, and Stuttgart - she shows that such professionalization processes actually take place, but differ surprisingly strongly in degree and pattern from city to city. Conceptual foundations: Municipal politics and professionalization -- Methods -- Professionalization in German large cities -- Council members between volunteering and professional politics -- Development lines and strategic options in the large cities -- Discussion, conclusion, and outlook: Professionalization on the local level?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073648-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047376-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022233-0>
Angle-sensitive MRI for non-invasive analysis of loaded cartilage structure ¤ Osteoarthritis is caused by degenerative changes in the joint cartilage. In late stages of the disease, arthrotic changes are almost always irreversible. Only targeted therapeutic measures against early osteoarthritis can halt this progressive pathological development. However, there are currently no established non-invasive methods for early osteoarthritis diagnosis in joint cartilage. Conventional clinical magnetic resonance tomography (MRI) can represent soft tissue non-invasively, but due to technical limitations, it is hardly suitable for detecting early arthrotic changes. An extended method - angle-sensitive MRI (AS-MRI) - is based on the orientation dependence of T2 relaxation in MR imaging and offers the possibility of obtaining information about the collagen matrix structure of joint cartilage using an analytical model. Since osteoarthritis affects the organized ultrastructure of joint cartilage, its biomechanical properties and the deformation behavior of the collagen matrix also change under continuous physiological loading. If these barely perceptible changes are recognized, early osteoarthritis stages could be detected. Therefore, the studies on pressure-induced deformation of cartilage structure in this work are based on AS-MRI. For this purpose, untreated cartilage samples from sheep knees were taken and examined under pressure loading in a high-resolution 7T MRI. In the experiments, a procedure modification was made, which is characterized by pressure distribution on the entire surface of the sample with the help of quickly hardening acrylic resin. This not only allowed the elastic-mechanical properties of the tissue to be obtained, but also the pressure-induced inclination of collagen fibers to be quantitatively recorded. These data served the detailed observation of matrix deformation, including the phenomenon of wave formation in fiber form under pressure loading. The gained knowledge was used for the AS-MRI analysis of signal intensity with the aim of evaluating the possibilities of this method for clinical practice. This analysis showed a good agreement of the modeled intensities with the experimentally read data. The result offers good prospects for solving an inverse problem: The pressure-induced matrix deformation could be clarified alone by considering the signal intensity in an MRI loading test. However, this requires further studies, especially basic studies on native and loaded cartilage in vivo.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164652-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156450-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120806-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4196812-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171740-5>
Characterization of the binding properties of the avian coronavirus spike protein ¤ BEGIN Avian Coronavirus, Spike Protein, Host Cell Binding. - The avian coronavirus (AvCoV) Infectious Bronchitis Virus is a pathogen that infects the respiratory and urogenital tracts of birds, mainly chickens (gallus gallus) and other galliforms. For all viruses, binding to host cells is the first and an important step in the replication cycle. For the binding ability of coronaviruses, the S1 subunit of the spike protein is responsible. In the case of IBV, binding to host cells depends on the presence of sialic acids on the cell surface. In the present study, chimeric soluble S1 subunits, equipped with a human IgG-Fc marker peptide, were produced and used as tools for a more detailed investigation of the binding properties of the S1 domain of IBV. These chimeric proteins can be expressed in permanent cell lines, concentrated by centrifugation, and easily detected using fluorescently labeled anti-human IgG antibodies. From many different IBV strains, the B1648 strain was selected for this study for the production of soluble proteins. This strain is a field strain isolated in Belgium. This strain does not have any additional binding properties acquired by passage in non-avian cells, such as the Beaudette strain. Furthermore, this strain is pathogenic in vivo. In this work, we addressed two questions regarding the binding properties of the IBV spike protein. On the one hand, the location of the receptor-binding domain on the spike protein was investigated. On the other hand, it was analyzed whether the IBV spike protein has additional binding properties, other than the ability to bind sugar. To determine the location of the sugar-binding domain, some amino acids in the sequence of the S1 subunit were deleted to determine whether these deletions would reduce the binding ability of the protein. The importance of 42 amino acids, located near the N-terminus of the protein, for binding was shown. In a second step, this area was narrowed down to seven particularly important amino acids. The remaining binding, which occurred in all mutants, was not dependent on sialic acids. To investigate whether a protein receptor is involved in the binding of IBV, the soluble spike proteins were used to determine interactions with cell surface proteins. Protease treatment of IBV-permissive cells was used to generally investigate the involvement of cell surface proteins in virus binding. The first approach did not lead to the identification of specific interaction partners. The second approach showed that the binding of the spike proteins to protease-treated cells was not reduced, which speaks against the involvement of a specific protein receptor. Finally, the ability of the soluble proteins to bind to permanent cell lines was also investigated. Since the binding ability of the spike proteins is considered a major factor in determining the host range, it was surprising that the constructs were able to bind to cells that could hardly be infected by the corresponding virus B1648 in our experiments.

The Full-Time Employees of the State Security: Structure and Life World 1950 - 1989/90 ¤ The study focuses on those individuals who were responsible on a full-time basis in the largest secret police apparatus in German history after years of dealing with unofficial employees. The investigation ranges from the establishment of the GDR State Security as a Stalinist secret police to its development into a universal security agency to the creeping legitimacy crisis of the 1980s, which ultimately led to demotion and collapse. The MfS employees became one of the most important interest groups in the socialist service class. The life world of these "comrades of the first category" (Wilhelm Zaisser, 1953) was shaped by the specific mixture of militarized disciplinary control and elitist secret police mentality. In this study, the biographical imprinting of the old communist founding fathers and the young cadres who entered in the 1950s are first considered. This is followed by a systematic evaluation of the data on education, gender ratios, social structure, political and confessional ties, disciplinary offenses, and personnel fluctuations, which are exemplified in case studies. In the statistical appendix, the personnel development of the MfS is documented in detail.Jens Gieseke: Born in 1964, studied history, political science, and law at the universities of Hanover and Potsdam; since 1993, scientific staff member in the Education and Research Department of the Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records; numerous contributions to the history of the GDR State Security, including "In the Service of the Party.

Random Hypergraphs for Hashing-Based Data Structures ¤ This work deals with dictionaries and related data structures that rely on multiple random possibilities for storing each key. Consider that information about a set S of m = |S| keys is to be stored in n storage locations indexed by [n] = {1,…,n}. Each key x [ELEMENT OF] S gets a small set e(x) [SUBSET OF OR EQUAL TO] [n] of storage locations assigned by a random hash function independently of other keys. The information about x may now be placed exclusively in the locations from e(x). It may happen that too many keys compete for the same storage locations, especially at high utilization c = m/n. A successful storage of the total information may then be impossible. For most distributions of e(x), success or failure can be predicted very reliably, as for utilization c below a certain utilization threshold c* the success probability is almost 1 and for c beyond this utilization threshold is almost 0. We will mainly consider two types of data structures: - A cuckoo hash table is a dictionary data structure in which each key x [ELEMENT OF] S is stored together with an associated value f(x) in one of the storage locations with index from e(x). The distribution of e(x) is determined by the hashing schema here. We analyze three known hashing schemas and determine their exact utilization thresholds in the above sense for the first time. The schemas are unordered blocks, double hashing, and a schema for dynamically growing key sets. - Also a retrieval data structure stores a value f(x) for all x [ELEMENT OF] S. This time the values in the storage locations from e(x) should satisfy a linear equation that characterizes the value f(x). The resulting data structure is extremely space-efficient, but unusual: it is unsuitable for answering questions of the form "is y [ELEMENT OF] S?". When a key y is queried, a result z is returned. If y [ELEMENT OF] S is, then z = f(y) is guaranteed, otherwise z may be any value. - We consider two new hashing schemas, where the elements of e(x) lie in one or two adjacent blocks. This achieves good access times on Word-RAMs and high cache efficiency. An important question is whether data structures of this type can be constructed in linear time. The success probability of a nearby greedy algorithm again shows a threshold behavior with respect to the utilization c. We identify a hashing schema that brings a particularly high threshold with it. In mathematical modeling, the storage positions [n] are regarded as nodes and the sets e(x) for x [ELEMENT OF] S as hyperedges. Three properties of the resulting hypergraphs then turn out to be central: planarity, solvability, and orientability. Wide parts of this work deal with the probabilities for the presence of these properties depending on the hashing schema and utilization, as well as with corresponding thresholds. A back-translation of the results then delivers data structures with low query times, high storage efficiency, and low construction times. The theoretical considerations are supplemented and supported by experimental results.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1046573225> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4332175-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4323071-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072803-1>
Time-Flexible Lot Sizing and Sequencing Planning: Models and Algorithms for the Integration of Delivery and Production Time Windows ¤ Flexibility in Supply Chain Management, selected lot sizing and sequencing problems -- MLCLSD-based lot sizing and sequencing planning with time window restrictions: model variants with delivery time windows and production time windows -- heuristic solution approaches using resource-based decomposition -- exemplary analyses of the approaches With the concept of time-flexible lot sizing and sequencing planning, Jonas Ostmeyer shows a way that leads from time-point to time-window-based planning. Delivery time windows enable the representation of long-term volume-based orders in supplier-customer cooperations over several periods. Production time windows enable the consideration of earliest possible points in time before production may not begin. Both concepts help to represent applications that occur in companies in a practical way. In addition, the developed solution procedures ensure that good solutions can be calculated quickly. The concept thus enables decision support in operational production planning.

From Female Engineers and Social Workers: Study Choices in the Context of Social Milieu and Gender ¤ This open-access book theoretically and empirically examines how study choices are formed in the context of social milieu and social gender, using the habitus concept by Pierre Bourdieu and the subsequent method of habitus hermeneutics. The path to a university and a specific field of study is still fundamentally influenced by social origin and social gender. However, the interaction of these two dimensions is often insufficiently considered in studies of education and gender research. It is shown that the decision to take up a study at all is primarily determined by the social milieu – 'women' and 'men' of a social milieu are connected here more than they are separated. Within this milieu-specific framework, social gender shapes the further possibilities of study field choice. The author Lena Loge is a research assistant at the University of Darmstadt and coordinates the statewide career and study orientation project 'Hessen-Technikum'. She also heads the multi-generational house department at the Education Office Weinheim. Her research focuses on social inequality/educational inequality, gender research, education research, and habitus and milieu analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022724-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074798-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138660-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055676-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020548-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124617-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121684-2>
Specification of a Production Function with a Non-Rival Usable Production Factor ¤ The author develops a consistent concept, within the framework of neoclassical equilibrium theory, for the model-based representation of jointly, i.e. non-rival, usable infrastructure services in the production process of private enterprises. Empirical studies have highlighted the importance of public infrastructure such as research and transportation facilities as a growth and location factor. In economic models, infrastructure is captured as a public, non-rival usable intermediate product in the production process of private enterprises. However, many different specifications of production functions are used to describe these production processes. The author systematizes these specifications, clarifies their economic content, and points out inconsistencies for some of them. As a result, a re-evaluation of the economic policy statements of studies with inconsistent specifications is required.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043179-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047354-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026944-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175480-3>
Media Existences - Existential Media? : Digital Media in Contemporary Literature ¤ The digital revolution generates a profound societal change, whose effects also manifest in contemporary literature after the turn of the millennium. Starting from current media-philosophical debates, one can observe in the prose of Elfriede Jelinek, Daniel Kehlmann, Thomas Meinecke, Friedrich von Borries, and Marcel Maas multifaceted diagnoses of late modern identity constructions. In that the literary confrontations determine aesthetic and ethical challenges of the media shift, they also explore a complex field of discourse that integrates early net utopias and cultural critical positions such as those of Adorno, Baudrillard, or Virilio. Especially the game between reality and virtuality brings forth new artistic possibility spaces and puts the question of the relationship between printed and digital media into the foreground. In that the study identifies academic reference fields such as gender and postcolonial studies as well as current discussions about transparency requirements, surveillance, and net economy in the literary tableau, it positions the book as a reflective meta-medium within a hybrid technology landscape.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050479-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1095694537>
Adiós al PRI! : the Mexican transformation process and the 2000 presidential election ¤ Under the democratizations of the Third Wave, Mexico's transition stands out as a special case. The transition process spanned several decades and was initially driven forward mainly through electoral means under strong control of the old elite. A preliminary highlight of this development was the election of Vicente Fox as the first president not presented by the PRI in over 70 years in July 2000.

Influence of a dietary L-carnitine supplementation on performance, health status and energy metabolism in lactating pluriparous German Holstein cows during the transition period and an induced acute phase reaction in mid-lactation ¤ The health of dairy cows is an important factor for economic milk production. Many diseases associated with milk production, such as ketosis or mastitis, are known. There are two challenges in the life of almost every dairy cow: The transition from the bearing, non-lactating to the non-bearing, lactating period and the acute phase reaction induced by endotoxins outside the transition phase. Both of these challenges are energy-consuming processes. Dairy cows are limited in their feed intake capacity and also in their energy intake capacity – due to the sensitive rumen microbiota. Therefore, the improvement of energy metabolism – especially during periods of energy deficits – plays a critical role in the health of dairy cows. L-Carnitine is involved in the transport of activated fatty acids through the mitochondrial membrane, where processes of energy gain, such as β-oxidation, take place. We assumed that a L-Carnitine supplementation could improve the recovery of dairy cows after energy deficits. In this study, the effect of a dietary, rumen-protected L-Carnitine supplementation (25 g per cow and day) in 29 dairy cows (CAR) from day 42 ap to day 126 pp was investigated. Further 30 dairy cows were used as control group (CON). Feed and water intake, body weight and milk performance but also milk components and cell counts in the milk were determined. Blood samples were taken during the entire experimental period and even frequently (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48, 76 h) after calving (Manuscript 1) and after an i.v. injection of 0.5 µg/kg body weight E. Coli LPS on day 111 pp (Manuscript 2). In these, carnitine, its precursors and metabolites, clinical-chemical parameters (NEFA, BHB, TG), lactate, glucose and insulin, blood gases, white blood cells, haptoglobin and cortisol were determined. Furthermore, the cows were clinically examined before each blood sampling and ultrasound examinations of the fatty tissues were performed. The L-Carnitine supplementation in this experiment increased milk performance and milk fat content in early lactation, reduced the NEFA concentration in the blood shortly before, and also after calving and after LPS injection – potentially by increasing the efficiency of β-oxidation. The L-Carnitine supplementation led to higher triacylglycerol concentrations in the blood on day 1 ap (possibly resulting from reduced accumulation in the liver). Furthermore, the L-Carnitine supplementation reduced the number of primary rumen contractions after an intravenous LPS injection, accompanied by increased insulin concentrations at the same glucose concentrations in the blood of CON and CAR. The parameters associated with lipomobilization were more strongly influenced by the challenge of calving than by the challenge of LPS. The effect of LPS injection on blood leukocytes and cortisol was more pronounced and opposite to the effect of calving. The L-Carnitine supplementation reduced the effects of energy deficits after calving and after LPS slightly. These effects could be even more pronounced at the cellular (mitochondrial) level.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012494-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113937-9>
Annihilate and Remember : Traces of National Socialist Memory Politics ¤ In cultural science debates, the assumption can be found again and again that the National Socialists had not only planned the total physical annihilation of European Jews, but also the erasure of their victims from history and memory. However, projects and phenomena that clearly contradict the attempt at total forgetting and rather speak for the attempt at a further, more extensive functionalization have been insufficiently and sporadically noted to date. The continued exhibition of Judaica during the Third Reich and the establishment of a Jewish Central Museum under the supervision of the SD in Prague point in the same direction as the National Socialists' efforts in the field of Jewish research and a variety of photographic and filmic documentation of the victims and the crimes committed against them. Instead of a final solution to the memory, the perpetrators had rather planned an Aryanization of memory. Musealization served to perpetuate the necessary enemy image for the National Socialist ideology. National Socialism and the Holocaust are no longer considered only as the starting point for the memory discourses of the post-war period, but the function of memory and remembrance is investigated in immediate connection with the plundering and extermination policy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200793-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073091-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4281014-0>
QoS-aware mobility management in IP-based communication networks : analysis, design and implementation ¤ The ubiquitous access to information, anytime and anywhere, is an important feature of future All-IP mobile networks, which will connect various systems, be more dynamic and flexible. However, the use of these networks requires overcoming many challenges. One of the most important in this work is the question of how Quality of Service (QoS) properties can be guaranteed in such highly dynamic, mobile environments. It is known that the mobility of mobile nodes (MN) affects the service quality in mobile networks, as QoS parameters are agreed upon for end-to-end communication. Therefore, solutions must be developed that support seamless mobility, with simultaneous QoS guarantees after handovers. This challenge is the main goal of the present dissertation, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing mobility and QoS management solutions in IP-based networks, followed by an insight into methods for coupling mobility management and QoS solutions. After considering the advantages and disadvantages of existing approaches, the dissertation concludes that hybrid strategies are promising and can be developed into practical solutions that efficiently meet both mobility and QoS requirements in all future IP mobile networks. On this basis, the dissertation proposes a new hybrid protocol, called "QoS-aware Mobile IP Fast Authentication Protocol" (QoMIFA). Our proposal integrates MIFA as a mobility management protocol with RSVP as a QoS reservation protocol. MIFA is chosen due to its ability to perform fast, secure, and robust handovers. RSVP, on the other hand, serves as a standard solution for providing QoS in existing IP-based networks. Under the hybrid architecture, RSVP is extended with a new object called "Mobility Object", which encapsulates MIFA control messages. After specifying the new proposal, the dissertation also evaluates its performance in comparison to the known "Simple QoS Signaling Protocol" (Simple QoS) using simulation studies, modeled with the "Network Simulator 2" (NS2). In the evaluation, the influences of network load and mobile node speed are investigated. The performance parameters used include resource reservation latency, the number of lost packets per handover, the number of packets transmitted with best-effort properties before reservation completion per handover, and the probability of connection drops. Our simulation results show that QoMIFA can combine fast and seamless handovers with fast resource reservation after handovers. Considering the influence of network load, it is evident that QoMIFA achieves better performance than Simple QoS in all investigated scenarios with low, medium, and high load. When examining the influence of mobile node speed on performance, ping-pong effects can be observed under both protocols, which lead to higher resource reservation latency, more lost packets, and more best-effort packets per handover at lower speeds. The strongest influence of these ping-pong effects is observed at 3 km/h. However, QoMIFA behaves better under all investigated speeds than Simple QoS and can serve mobile nodes even at high speeds. Following the simulation-based evaluation, the dissertation estimates the signaling costs of both protocols, considering the costs for location determination and packet delivery. In the result, QoMIFA achieves the previously mentioned performance improvements at the cost of larger location determination costs and slightly higher packet delivery costs.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4496068-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4330656-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170280-3>

Investigations on the Occurrence of Microthrix parvicella in SBR Plants ¤ This present study detects the occurrence of Microthrix parvicella in SBR. SBR offer due to their operation mode and the low sludge load a good environment for the growth of Microthrix parvicella. Studies about the effect of the low loads < 0.05 kg BOD5/(kg TSS∙d) on this bacterium are still limited. Therefore, in the course of this work 13 SBR in Germany with simultaneous aerobic sludge stabilization are studied and samples are investigated under microscope to determine Microthrix parvicella.

Zielsicher im Sozialraum : Acting and Evaluating in Social Education ¤ Social space education aids -- Professional concept of social space orientation -- Evaluation in youth welfare -- Goal achievement in the goal angle procedure -- Determination of goal quality In this book, everything revolves around the goals of education aids, their achievement, and their quality, and the question of how both can be empirically determined. Based on a detailed presentation of the professional concept of social space orientation, the importance of goals and their potential for evaluation is described. Social space education aids are particularly characterized by consistent orientation towards the concerns and possibilities of people. Good goals play an important role here, whose achievement can also serve as a yardstick for success. Both concepts, that of action and that of evaluation, are equally in focus of the considerations.

New Template Phases for the Anisotropic Gold Nanoparticle Synthesis by the Use of Structure-Forming Polymers ¤ The aim of the present work was the synthesis and characterization of anisotropic gold nanoparticles in a suitable polyelectrolyte-modified template phase. The focus was on the selection of a suitable template phase for the synthesis of uniform and reproducible anisotropic gold nanoparticles with the resulting special properties. In the synthesis of anisotropic gold nanoparticles, the focus was on the use of vesicles as a template phase, where the influence of different structure-forming polymers (strongly alternating maleimide copolymers PalH, PalPh, PalPhCarb, and PalPhBisCarb with different conformations) and surfactants (SDS, AOT – anionic surfactants) under various synthesis and separation conditions was to be investigated. In the first part of the work, it could be shown that PalPhBisCarb at a pH of 9 meets the conditions of a tube-forming agent for a morphological transformation from a vesicular phase to a tubular network structure and can thus be used as a template phase for the shape-controlled formation of nanoparticles.

The Land Law in "New Germany Overseas" : Acquisition, Allocation, and Use of Land in the Colony of German South West Africa 1884 - 1915 ¤ The author examines the essential aspects of the land law of the colony of German South West Africa, now Namibia, from a historical legal perspective. He first explains the basic principles of colonial law and its relationship to the legal order of the German Empire. Based on the various types of real estate and the dual colonial legal order, which distinguished the law applicable to non-natives from the native law, the author presents the peculiarities of real estate transactions, expropriation and tax law, and legal protection for non-natives, while in native law the original land law is maintained and colonial interventions in the "mixed law" affecting both population groups are presented. Furthermore, the work deals with the exploration of the "ownerless crown land" by concessionary colonial companies and the allocation of land by the protectorate administration within specific contract patterns, whose clauses were intended to ensure compliance with the land policy guidelines by the settlers. Finally, the work sketches the change in land distribution from the end of the colonial era to the present day in the context of decolonization.

The Treachery Risks of Healthcare Providers : An Investigation in the Background of the Case Law on Billing Fraud ¤ The Damocles sword of treachery forces healthcare providers to defend against billing fraud at their own expense. Nevertheless, the engagement to protect the money of insured persons and taxpayers from fraud is very unevenly distributed. The author, who became known through the media coverage of a nationwide billing fraud scandal, points a finger at this wound. Starting from the description of the dual healthcare system and typical billing manipulations, the criminal law risks of healthcare providers in dealing with billing fraud are shown. By incorporating current case law, the complex matters of healthcare law and criminal law are linked in a way that is understandable for practitioners. The target groups of the book are primarily the members of the healthcare providers, but also healthcare service providers and legal practitioners.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120842-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020775-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1174939265> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187126-1>

The Concept of Human Dignity in the European Convention on Human Rights ¤ In particular, after the end of World War II, human dignity emerged as a legal concept and was incorporated into international law. The German Basic Law (GG) was the first constitution to place human dignity at the top of the constitutional order. In the European Convention on Human Rights (EMRK), human dignity is not explicitly mentioned. However, the European Court of Human Rights (EGMR) regularly refers to it. -- The work addresses the question of what legal quality human dignity has in the Convention law. In addition, a positive definition of the concept is made. In particular, the international law content of human dignity as well as the case law of the EGMR are examined in more detail and a comparison is made with human dignity according to the GG and at the level of EU law. The author fundamentally shows that human dignity is the common basis of international human rights protection, a general legal principle, and a universal legal principle. Human dignity has a normative double function as an objective legal principle and as an independent fundamental right. This assumption shapes not only the understanding of human dignity in the GG and EU law, but also the concept of human dignity in the EMRK.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038654-5>
Electrochemical removal of nitrate from waste water ¤ The products of electrochemical reduction of nitrate (ERN) depend significantly on the type of electrode material, pH value, applied potential, and type of electrolyte. Cu-Sn alloys are promising electrode materials that have not been systematically investigated so far. Therefore, in this work, Cu and Cu-Sn cathode materials were electrochemically produced and investigated for their suitability for ERN. With cyclic voltammetric investigations, the specific parameters for the galvanic deposition of individual metals or the alloy were optimized. REM images of Cu-, Sn-, and Cu-Sn-layers showed significant structural changes with variation of the electrochemical parameters. It could be shown that the obtained electrode materials are well suited for nitrate reduction. In this work, two simple and fast electroanalytical methods for determining the electroactive species were used. For the proof of the reduction products, cyclic voltammetry (CV) or square-wave voltammetry (SWV) with high potential sweep rates were combined with hydrodynamic techniques (rotating ring-disk electrode). It could be shown that the electroactive products of ERN (NO2-, NH2-OH or NH4+), can be electrochemically detected with CV or SWV. With CV or SWV, real-time evaluation of the electrocatalytic properties of the used electrode materials is possible. Experimental setup for electrochemical reduction of synthetic nitrate solutionsTo develop a reliable procedure for the treatment of nitrate waste, the role of electrode materials, cell configuration, and operating parameters on ERN in a small flow reactor was investigated. To determine the optimal conditions, different operating conditions such as applied current, initial concentration of nitrate, and flow rate were investigated. Kinetic constants, current yields, and energy consumption were evaluated. To achieve the maximum allowed nitrate concentration of 50 mg / L, the experimental setup with the Cu-Sn cathode required 16 hours, while it required 20 hours with the Cu cathode. The energy consumption determined in this work for ERN is superior to the literature data.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000313-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151765-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014247-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042379-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4561581-0>

Isolation, Structure Elucidation, and Biosynthesis of Phytotoxic Anthraquinone Derivatives Produced by Ramularia collo-cygni and R. uredinicola ¤ From the phytopathogenic fungus Ramularia collo-cygni Sutton & Waller (causal agent of Ramularia leaf spot disease on Hordeum vulgare L.) and the hyperparasitic species R. uredinicola Khodap. & U. Braun, red and yellow pigmented main and side compounds were isolated, structurally characterized, and assigned to the class of anthraquinones. Four of these compounds (Rubellin A-D) have already been described from the phytopathogenic fungus Mycosphaerella rubella Niessl. Rubellin E, F and 14-Dehydrorubellin D, the blue pigmented compounds Caeruleoramularin I and II with an altered anthranoid basic structure, as well as Uredinorubellin I and II were not previously known. Furthermore, the monomeric anthraquinones Helminthosporin and Chrysophanol were detected. By incorporating [1-13C]- and [2-13C]-labeled acetate, the polyketide pathway for the biosynthesis of the Rubellines was demonstrated. The incorporation of [U-13C]-glucose reveals the folding pattern of the polyketide chain as the Folding-F-Mode. The in-vivo detection of the compounds (Rubellin A-D) from infected leaf material reveals the importance of these compounds for the pathogenesis of the Ramularia leaf spot disease. Sucking and inoculation experiments on host plants as well as various in-vitro experiments show that the mechanism of action of the Rubellines is based on photodynamic activity. Mainly singlet oxygen (1O2) is generated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4387386-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115550-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040984-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156898-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006902-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4436379-5>
Insulin Sensitivity and Insulin Response after Long-Term Supplementation of Conjugated Linoleic Acids in Lactating Dairy Cows ¤ Insulin resistance, CLA, cows. - Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA), used in dairy cows as feed supplements, have been suspected to lead to insulin resistance in studies on rodents and humans. It is assumed that a reduction in insulin sensitivity in dairy cows plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders such as increased lipomobilization, ketosis, and liver fat accumulation. The hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp (HEC) is the gold standard for demonstrating insulin resistance. It allows the distinction between reduced insulin sensitivity and reduced insulin response when consecutive, increasing insulin infusion concentrations are used. However, the HEC is only suitable for studies with small sample sizes due to its high cost and labor requirements. Therefore, various alternative indices, such as the Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and the Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) in various modifications, have been developed in human medicine for simple determination of insulin sensitivity. These indices are based on the plasma concentrations of insulin, glucose, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), and glycerol in fasting subjects. Considering the differences between the regulatory mechanisms for maintaining glucose homeostasis in humans and ruminants, the direct transfer of these indices to dairy cows is not possible. Therefore, it is necessary to determine insulin sensitivity in dairy cows with specific methods. This work aims to investigate insulin sensitivity and insulin response after long-term supplementation of conjugated linoleic acids in lactating dairy cows. The results of this work are intended to contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders in dairy cows and the development of strategies to improve insulin sensitivity in dairy cows.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4234712-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4163674-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4829176-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166486-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169916-6>

Structural investigations on semiconducting donor-acceptor block copolymers and related model systems for organic photovoltaics ¤ Block copolymer; Microphase separation; Semi-crystallinity; Liquid-crystalline; Microstructure; Thin films; Crystallization; X-ray scattering; Orientation; Charge carrier mobility Microphase separated donor-acceptor block copolymers have been discussed as ideal systems for morphology control in organic photovoltaics. Nanostructured interfaces (exciton diffusion length ~ 10 nm), crystalline order and percolation pathways are pre-requisites for obtaining high transport and device properties. Fundamental aspects of structure formation processes, phase behavior and microstructural order in a semiconducting donor-acceptor block copolymer poly(3-hexylthiophene)-block-poly(perylene bisimide acrylate) (P3HT-b-PPerAcr) and model homopolymers are studied in bulk and thin films. Investigations on bulk samples reveal microphase separation in the P3HT-b-PPerAcr material in the molten state and at room temperature. Confined crystallization of the individual components occurs within the microphase separated structures without altering the microphase morphology. The observed microphase morphology is found to be preserved in thin films. The study elucidates a direct correlation between the morphology and charge transport properties in the microphase separated donor-acceptor block copolymers. These systems can sustain ambipolar charge transport, but the exact values of electron and hole mobilities in the block copolymer depend strongly on size and orientation of the microdomains as well as the crystallinity within the domains.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4146026-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7617672-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022993-2>

Wireless modular multi-sensor systems for the analysis of mechanical coupling between respiration and locomotion in mammals ¤ The coupling between locomotion and respiration (Locomotion-Respiration-Coupling LRC) is based in mammals on both mechanical and neuromuscular connections between the two processes. So far, there is a lack of simple, modular systems for cross-species analysis of these interactions. As a result, there is a lack of reliable measurement data to answer questions such as how locomotion cycles contribute to breathing flow or how muscle contractions of the respiratory muscles influence locomotion. Most of the previous species-specific studies focused on LRC during running, but some also analyzed other activities such as cycling, flying (birds) or diving. In this work, a new method was developed based on a modular multi-sensor wireless system, which allows the interaction between locomotion and respiration in mammals to be analyzed. The developed system consists of four components for LRC analysis: (1) a thoracic pressure measurement based on an implantable device, (2) a flow volume module to measure the locomotor-driven air volume (LDV - Locomotor driven air volume) during the breathing cycle, (3) a step identification module to calculate the LRC ratio (step/breath) and (4) a muscle activity module to analyze the behavior of the respiratory muscles during coupling. These modules are freely combinable. Wireless communication allows field studies to be performed, where the animal (or human) can move freely with a self-chosen running speed, in contrast to previous studies, in which the subject moved at a constant speed on a treadmill. This possibility could significantly reduce the stress level of animals during experiments, and the analysis results would be closer to the	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003404-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4789222-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4257775-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017975-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161411-2>

Role of JAK-STAT signaling in the pathogenesis of astrogliosis in chronic demyelinating Theilers murine encephalomyelitis ¤ multiple sclerosis, signal transducer and activator of transcription, Theilerś murine encephalomyelitis. - The Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transduction and the activators of the transcription pathway (STAT) are attributed to involvement in the pathogenesis of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and murine Theiler virus encephalomyelitis (TME). The cause of the faulty remyelination and gliosis formation in TME is suspected to be a dysregulation of the differentiation of oligodendroglial precursor cells (OPC). The understanding of the mechanisms underlying remyelination in the CNS is of immediate clinical relevance. Suitable model systems include the analysis of naturally occurring and experimentally induced diseases, genetically generated mouse mutants, and the transplantation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells after experimental demyelination. In the present study, the hypothesis was pursued that the inhibition of OPC differentiation points to a more active, dysregulatory activity than a simple, passive blockade of cellular differentiation as the underlying mechanism. After transplantation of BO-1 cells in adult mice with a demyelination of the caudal cerebellar peduncle induced by ethidium bromide, a highly reduced 2,́3-́cyclic nucleotide 3-́phosphodiesterase (CNPase) expression compared to their in vitro phenotype, a lower concentration of myelin basic protein (MBP) and acidic glial fibrillary protein (GFAP), a prominent upregulation of the nerve/glial antigen 2 (NG2), platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR?), and nuclear p53, as well as an unchanged expression of the STAT3 transmission signal and transcription activation were recognized. The transplanted cells developed into an invasive growing and liquorogen metastasizing tumor, which was classified as a murine, giant glioblastoma. After TME infection, immunohistochemically in ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169148-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4318717-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4214431-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4516953-6>
Microalgae as Source of Innovative Active and Valuable Substances ¤ Mikroalge, Primärtsoffanalytik, Antimikrobielle Aktivität, Biochemie, Chemische Analyse, Glucane <beta-1,3->, Instrumentelle Analytik, Kultivierung, Scenedesmus Eukaryotic microalgae have been extensively studied for several decades for their suitability as drug producers, with only a few potentially useful compounds identified. Nevertheless, the huge biodiversity alone suggests that there must be producers of interesting secondary metabolites. In recent years, it has also been shown that microalgae can be suppliers of valuable substances, for example in the field of renewable energies. Here, above all, the high cultivation costs and the low product yield are still obstacles to be overcome. In this work, 70 eukaryotic microalgae strains were tested for their suitability as producers of novel active and valuable substances. In addition, it was determined by varying the culturing conditions whether the cultivation costs can be lowered and the yields of relevant products from microalgae can be increased. The investigated microalgae were obtained from the strain collection of Pharmaceutical Biology of the University of Greifswald, from commercial strain collections or were isolated from water samples collected near Greifswald. New isolates were identified by molecular genetic methods. All microalgae were first cultured under standard conditions, and the biomass space-time yield was determined and evaluated. Subsequently, the biochemical composition of the biomass was analyzed. For this purpose, six methods for total lipid, total carbohydrate and total protein content determination as well as for the analysis of lipid and carbohydrate ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4222592-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066383-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142688-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4009840-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006777-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308894-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165953-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4453251-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179264-6>
Pugna litterarum : Studies on Competitive Historiography in the Greek-Roman Literary Elite of the Imperial Age ¤ In this book, the central phenomenon of competition between historians in the history of ancient historiography is pursued. Already Herodot wrote in overreaching competition to Hekataios and Thukydides in rivalry with Herodot. However, the early and high imperial age is a particularly well-suited epoch to explore the mechanisms of competitive historiography. This is not only due to the relatively high density of the material, but also because many programmatic statements by historians and information about the literary trade are available. Representatives of the imperial literary trade included readers, attentive listeners in differently occupied auditoriums, booksellers, buyers, and pirates. Within this dense social structure, each author had to assert themselves. This applies equally to historians and biographers, who positioned themselves against competitors through source research, reading, autopsy, and the choice of material and genre, and thereby generated different connotations of >truth<. For the question, in addition to relatively unknown, fragmentarily transmitted historians and biographers, well-known authors such as Dionysios of Halicarnassus, Velleius Paterculus, Plutarch, Sueton, Flavius Josephus, Tacitus, Florus, Appian, and Cassius Dio were evaluated. The competition for literary fame was also eminently political. It is therefore an important factor for the conditions of authorship in the Principate	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020531-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128269-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167882-5>
Prospect Liability : On the Relationship between Codification and Judicial Law ¤ The steadily growing importance of capital market information in the information society era requires a fundamental systematization of the relevant liability norms. In this context, the relationship between codified and judicially developed prospect liability plays a prominent role. The insights gained within this analysis can also be fruitfully applied to liability for capital market information published in other ways, the existence and material-law foundations of which have been disputed so far.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132213-7>

Bortezomib in the Therapy of Pancreatic Cancer ¤ Bortezomib, Pancreatic Cancer, Proteasome Inhibition. - A diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, despite the application of all known therapies, is associated with a dismal prognosis. A new therapeutic approach to combat the rapidly growing tumor is based on the inhibition of the proteasome, ultimately triggering programmed cell death. The substance Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor that has established itself in the therapy of multiple myeloma for several years due to its very good efficacy. Therefore, Bortezomib also appears to be a promising therapeutic option for solid tumors. It has been shown that Bortezomib also induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in various cell lines derived from solid tumors, although the results of numerous in vitro and in vivo studies differed strongly. In the present work, the effects of the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib on pancreatic cancer cells in cell culture and in animal experiments were investigated and related to the results of the standard therapeutic agent Gemcitabine. In the context of in vitro experiments, it was shown that Bortezomib, in addition to the significant reduction of proteasome activity, very efficiently inhibited the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells and induced their apoptosis. The inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis induction could be further increased by the addition of Gemcitabine. In contrast, in an orthotopic mouse model of ductal pancreatic cancer ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004728-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4291096-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315827-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027007-5>
Synthesis, Characterization, and Immobilization of Fluorescent Sensor Dyes for pH and Saccharide Determination ¤ Within the scope of this work, water-soluble pH-sensitive Naphthalimid derivatives and those for selective detection of D-Fructose were presented and spectroskopied. The dyes showed a significant increase in the intensity of emission upon contact with the analyte. The pH-sensitive Naphthalimid chromophore was immobilized covalently to a PEG-based hydrogel via two synthesis routes. By means of fluorescence spectroscopy of planar substrates at various pH values, the reversibility of the sensor reaction was proven using timedrive measurements. The covalent binding of the pH-sensitive dye to the hydrogel matrix was achieved with complete retention of sensor properties.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4209106-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151907-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154826-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147985-3>
Compensation Calculation in Intellectual Property Law: Material and Procedural Aspects in the Context of the Enforcement Directive ¤ The work deals with the material and procedural requirements for compensation calculation in the event of infringement of intellectual property rights. Starting from the calculation methods recognized by German case law for more than 100 years and now codified, their current handling and compatibility with the European requirements of the Enforcement Directive of 2004 are analyzed. This is followed by procedural questions. After determining the subject matter of the dispute, individual effects on the compensation process are discussed. In particular, considerations of the objective limits of material legal force and the scope of judicial damage assessment under § 287 ZPO are in focus.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4051925-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026596-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177276-3>

University Reform and University Revolt: Self-Governance and Co-Determination in the Ordinarien University, the Group University, and the University of the 21st Century ¤ At the beginning of the 21st century, we find ourselves in the midst of a comprehensive restructuring of the German higher education system. It will change the face of our universities more comprehensively than the education reform of the 1970s was able to achieve. In historical perspective, the author examines the development from the culturally state-constituted Ordinarien University to the state-regulated Group University to the new university model. The focus of the analysis is on the relationship between universities and state and society, the internal constitution of universities, the academic self-governance status of students in academic self-governance and in the constituted student body, and the political strategies from the SDS to the latest strike and protest actions.

In vitro characterization of regulatory and sensory RNAs in Prokaryotes ¤ Within the scope of this work, a cis-coded and a trans-coded antisense RNA from Bacillus subtilis as well as an RNA thermometer structure from Salmonella enterica were characterized in vitro structurally and functionally. In vitro analyses on the inhibitory effect of the cis-coded antisense RNA RNAIII have shown that the formation of a complete duplex with its target RNA (RNAII) is not required. A binding intermediate that only requires the simultaneous involvement of the Stem-Loops L3 and L4 of RNAIII is sufficient as an inhibitory complex for the regulation of the replication of the streptococcal plasmid pIP501. SR1 from Bacillus subtilis is a 205 nt long trans-coded antisense RNA that can exert regulatory effects on its target, ahrC-mRNA, through direct base pairing. SR1 induces structural changes downstream of the ribosome binding site of ahrC-mRNA, thereby preventing the initiation of translation of AhrC. The translation control of the agsA transcript in Salmonella enterica occurs through an RNA thermometer structure that does not correspond to any of the previously identified RNA thermometer types.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027007-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020136-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183787-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183655-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4242465-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4332513-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4324981-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4391224-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201051-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511561-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046270-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4276601-1>
Personality-Based Personalization in Mobile Commerce: A Behavioral Science Analysis Using Supermarket Apps as an Example ¤ 1. Introduction -- 2. Conceptual Foundations of Personality-Based Personalization -- 3. Study 1: Personality and App-Interface Preferences -- 4. Study 2: Effects of Personality-Based Personalization -- 5. Conclusion. With the help of intelligent algorithms, increasingly psychographic characteristics – especially personality – can be predicted based on a user's digital footprint. These information provide new approaches for marketing, especially for app personalization. So far, personality information has been mainly used in computer science research to optimize recommender systems. This work, on the other hand, takes a behavioral science perspective and examines how personalization based on user personality is perceived and evaluated. Based on the results of two studies in the context of supermarket apps, the author provides recommendations for the successful implementation of personality-based personalization. The author Stefanie Arz was promoted by Prof. Dr. Andreas Mann at the Marketing Department of the University of Kassel.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073331-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173876-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4384600-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034878-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4215399-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7705206-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7689895-7>
Optimization of Fast-acting Electromagnetic Drives ¤ This dissertation is to be assigned to the analysis and synthesis process for technical systems. Within the framework of a new concept for charge transfer control, the electrohydraulic valve control (EHVS), electromagnetically operated valves with very short switching times are required. In the present work, the control device, the electromagneto-mechanical power converter including the coupled mechanical components are considered as a system, which is to be optimized with regard to the positioning accuracy of the gas exchange valve. Due to the high dynamic requirements, the interactions of the components integrated in the system are decisive for the overall function. A model is described, which enables the simulation of the technical system. In order to be able to consider interfaces specifically, the implementation of the model takes place on a common simulation platform. The simulation model is used for the development and optimization of the technical system. For optimization, selected parameters that influence the dynamics are investigated and quantified. Based on the simulation results, high-dynamic magnetic valves are developed and checked for their dynamics. Finally, a way is shown how technical systems can be optimized in the future.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4267986-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4198914-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151832-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187491-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4456233-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013384-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7537749-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002360-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166403-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176074-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038852-9>
Model difference representation ¤ Software models (e.g., in UML) are the key artifacts in model-driven engineering activities. Like the source code of software systems, software models are constantly evolved and maintained undergoing diverse changes. Models become large and complex raising a need for Collaborative Modeling of several developers on shared models. In collaborative modeling, modeling deltas play essential role in storing and synchronizing model changes. Thus, difference representation in modeling deltas is crucial for collaborative modeling. This thesis introduces Difference Language (DL) to represent model differences in collaborative modeling. DL is meta-model generic, modeling tool generic, applicable and extensible. DL is conceptually a family of domain-specific languages. Specific DLs for specific modeling languages are generated from their meta-models. The approach further provides several supplementary services which allow to reuse modeling DL-based deltas. These services extend the application areas (namely, Concurrent collaborative modeling, sequential collaborative modeling and model history analysis).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055382-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4832365-2>
The nemo-tenetur principle in extracriminal duty fulfillment ¤ Outside of criminal proceedings, there are various duties of disclosure that challenge the principle of nemo tenetur se ipsum accusare, which states that no person may be compelled to incriminate themselves. The question arises as to whether or not a legal subject can refuse such disclosure obligations outside of criminal proceedings invoking the nemo tenetur principle, or how such a (sometimes self-convicting) performance of duty affects criminal proceedings. The author attempts to provide the lawmaker with a systematic concept for answering this question in consideration of the historical, ethical and legal foundation of nemo tenetur, as well as an interpretation of the pertinent jurisdiction.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170266-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4233056-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193611-5>
Singular Riemannian Foliations without horizontally conjugate points ¤ The broad concept of a singular Riemannian foliation is a generalization of the known model of an orbit foliation of an isometric Lie group action on a Riemannian manifold. Although a detailed local description of such a foliation is possible, it seems unattainable without additional assumptions to derive global statements about the structure of the manifold or the leaves. At the beginning of this work, we deal with the theory of actually embedded leaves; we derive the existence of a global tubular neighborhood, and we achieve a global description of the manifold as a stratification by leaf types. Then the additional assumption that the foliation has no horizontally conjugate points is investigated. This corresponds to the variational completeness of the action in the given model and allows for a global geometric description of the foliation: the focal points of the leaves are exactly the singular points. As a topological result, we prove thereby the tautness of the leaves.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195597-3>
3D Reconstruction using Generalized Perspective Photometric Stereo ¤ 3D shape information reconstruction is a fundamental task in the field of computer vision. Among the various techniques, the photometric stereo method (PS) is particularly noteworthy, as it has a higher potential for a highly accurate 3D reconstruction compared to other approaches. This work focuses on generalizing classical PS approaches to further exploit this potential. The developments can be used, for example, to make 3D information accessible to users in various fields in the future, such as in medicine, film and video game industry, autonomous driving, or applications in virtual reality. The first of the new developments concerns the systematic use of bright light reflections in the calculation of 3D reconstruction as well as perspective projection. This removes the limitations of conventional methods, such as the reconstruction of diffusely reflecting materials and relatively distant objects. The applicability of the developed approach is demonstrated using the reconstruction of endoscopic images with many bright light reflections. In a further step, it is shown how a 3D reconstruction can be achieved in real-time even from very fine details using a generalized reflection model. This results in high-resolution reconstructions of details that are invisible to the human eye in images. This leads to many potential application possibilities, such as automatic detection of micro-pressure in the security sector, or in industrial production for the detection of very fine structures such as printed circuits. As another contribution of the work, a procedure for non-calibrated PS is developed, in which neural networks are used to compensate for the missing information of the lighting direction in this case. Finally, it is described for the first time in the literature how a high-quality 3D reconstruction can be obtained solely from images from the internet or natural images without any additional knowledge based on metaheuristics and deep neural networks.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4226127-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129594-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4150634-0>
Works Councils and Technical Change : Cooperation and Conflict in Techno-Organizational Transformation Processes in Private Insurance Industry and Printing Industry Companies ¤ In the work, it is about the behaviors and procedures of works councils in techno-organizational transformations. In addition to the thematization of the position and function of the works council in the corporate power structure, the communication and cooperation structures of the participating actors (works council and management, trade union and workforce) are analyzed. Works council action is determined by a specific constellation, whose main features are the political implications of the procedures of small-scale work of disappointments (Luhmann) according to the BetrVG, as well as the co-optation of works councils by management and trade unions. The investigation is based on expert interviews with works council members from the insurance industry and the printing industry.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006204-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002641-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076356-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063180-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063206-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4021852-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048499-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126014-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059252-2>
Essays on offshoring, wage inequality and innovation ¤ This volume was prepared by Sebastian Benz while he was working at the Ifo Institute. It was completed in December 2013 and accepted as a doctoral thesis by the Department of Economics at the University of Munich. It includes five self-contained chapters. All chapters discuss different implications of the growing importance of trade in intermediate inputs. The first chapter compares the impact of international trade in intermediate inputs (offshoring) on wage inequality in two distinct but similar frameworks. In the first framework the profitability of offshoring is based on increasing returns to scale on the task-level, whereas the second framework relies on differences in relative factor endowments of the two countries involved in offshoring. The second chapter provides a theory of offshoring under imitation risk that explains optimal dynamic adjustments of firms' offshoring decisions and yields two new channels by which offshoring affects wage inequality. Chapter 3 studies the impact of intellectual property rights and of offshoring costs on the rate of innovation and on the offshoring intensity. In chapter 4 I estimate knowledge spillovers through outsourcing relationships between German firms, measured by the number of those firms' successful patent applications. The last chapter describes sector-level input-output relationships in eleven European economies and estimates the importance of international trade in intermediate inputs and internationally mobile capital for the interdependence of output shocks in those countries.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072806-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131996-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7520052-1>
Advanced diagnostics in malignant lymphoma of dogs and cats: Effects on stage migration and prognostic assessment of the disease ¤ canines Lymphom, felines Lymphom, ocular manifestations. - Lymphoma is one of the most common tumor diseases in dogs and cats. Therefore, a detailed examination of this disease is important to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and also treatment approaches. The goal of the work was to evaluate whether a stage migration occurs in dogs and cats through further investigations and whether this has an effect on the prognosis. In the first part, untreated cats with lymphoma were additionally examined ophthalmologically to determine whether and what eye changes are present and to follow these up in the course of any possible chemotherapy. Furthermore, it should be investigated whether a pre-existing ocular involvement leads to a migration of the stages. In the second part of the work, dogs with multicentric lymphoma were evaluated using additional sonographic and cytological examinations of the liver and spleen in comparison to conventional staging and the effect on the staging classification was evaluated. Furthermore, these results ....	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030046-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112627-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036760-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026181-5>
School Social Work as a Stage in Between: An Ethnographic Analysis and Theoretical Determination ¤ BEGIN The 'In-Between' in the Discourse on School Social Work -- Occasions of Action in the Field of School Social Work -- School Social Work in the Structural Framework of School -- Ambivalences of Action in School Social Work Anja Reinecke-Terner examines ethnographically within the framework of Grounded Theory the field of action of school social work. In accordance with concepts by Erving Goffman and Jürgen Zinnecker, she describes how school social workers with their practices establish a 'stage in between' between the front stage (teaching) and the back stage (retreat areas). In doing so, they move between persons, roles, rooms, times, interests, procedures, and forms of communication. Depending on the occasion, they work either on the front stage or become part of it, or they act on the edge of the back stage. These ambivalences are shown by the 'stage in between' and prompt further discussion.

A New Type of Pulsation-Free Linear Tube Pumps ¤ The subject of this work is the development of a model for pulsation-free operating linear tube pumps and the proof of the practical realizability of such pumps. Tube pumps are a special type of pump, whose working space consists of a flexible tube, in which the fluid transport is achieved by a mechanically impressed deformation of the tube cross-section. This mode of operation is biologically inspired by the principle of propulsive peristalsis in hollow organs, which is why tube pumps are colloquially also referred to as peristaltic pumps. The decisive advantage of tube pumps over all other pumps is that the fluid to be pumped comes into contact only with the inside of the tube, so that cross-contamination is practically excluded. Especially for this reason, tube pumps are predominantly used in medical technology and biotechnology. In addition to a multitude of other advantages, all available tube pumps so far, however, have the disadvantage that the volume flow generated by them strongly pulsates. Therefore, tube pumps are only conditionally suitable for precise dosing tasks. Also, the pressure fluctuations caused by the pulsation can disturbingly affect a connected fluidic system. The theoretical approach for the pulsation-free operation of linear tube pumps is provided by a concept presented by Feller & Schimmelpfennig (2010), which describes the cyclic volume changes of five working spaces in series. An analysis carried out in this work shows that for the implementation of this concept, infinitely large accelerations of the mechanical components forming the working spaces and the fluid contained in them would be required. Since such accelerations are neither realizable nor practicable, a new concept in the form of a parametric pump model was developed, with which the time-dependent piston movements required for pulsation-free operation of the pump can be calculated. For the practical proof of the realizability of pulsation-free linear tube pumps, a technical demonstrator was developed. The experiments with the demonstrator showed that due to the viscoelastic material behavior of the pump tube and the finite manufacturing accuracy of the used components, a certain residual pulsation remains. Especially at small drive speeds, this is partly more than an order of magnitude smaller than the pulsation of two tested, commercially available tube roller pumps.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126447-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026312-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4478422-3>
Subjectification of Work: Voluntary Self-Exploitation: A Model of Explanation for the Disposition to Sacrifice of Highly Qualified Professionals ¤ With what inner logic are we dealing when, above all, highly qualified employees display an entirely excessive work commitment and voluntarily and increasingly frequently exceed their physical and mental limits? The author contributes to a debate that, in a specific way, commits to a 'sociology of burnout'. Interested in the stress and strain consequences of flexible work, the author constructs an explanatory model for 'voluntary self-exploitation' on two different theoretical levels. Initially, the subject of investigation is measured and classified with the help of sociological categories of work. However, the disposition to sacrifice of employees appears as a result of interactive cooperation: the adaptive behavior in actor constellations leads to unintended structural effects and social coercion patterns: reconstructible in a game-theoretical way as the 'Prisoner's Dilemma' of collegial working relationships.

The Prohibition of Torture in Art. 3 ECHR: Foundation and Continuation in the Field of Criminal Law ¤ Art. 3 ECHR is a central, unqualified guarantee of the European Convention on Human Rights. The author works as a basis for the unqualified applicability the dignity of man as a protected legal good. He defines it for the scope of application of the ECHR with the help of the object formula of the BVerfG based on Kant's moral philosophy. He shows that on the basis of Kant's thinking a smallest common denominator in the form of a negative definition of human dignity can be found for the member states of the ECHR. Subsequently, the continuation of Art. 3 ECHR is explained both in the field of material and procedural criminal law. The case law of the ECHR is analyzed for the examination of the fairness of the proceedings, Art. 6 ECHR, when using evidence obtained by a violation of Art. 3 ECHR and, in the context of indirect evidence, developed further by applying the object formula and the doctrine of the poisoned tree from US law.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038654-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139469-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017801-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170174-4>
The Development of Friendship Concepts in Childhood and Adolescence ¤ This book presents an empirical longitudinal study (over a period of four years) on socio-cognitive development. Interview data were collected from a comprehensive sample of children at the initial survey and coded using a text analysis system developed empirically, and evaluated and interpreted using multivariate statistical methods as well as methodically critically discussed. The findings obtained, which were presented at the 9th Conference on Developmental Psychology in Munich and received resonance in professional circles, form the basis of the continued research work according to a longitudinal design, whose overall results are dealt with in the book.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018480-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077197-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034036-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4337482-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015434-8>
Implementation and Parameterization of a Physical Simulation Model of a Lithium-Ion Cell for the Analysis of Electrochemical-Mechanical Interactions ¤ The intercalation reaction of Lithium (Li) in Lithium-ion batteries is often associated with significant volume changes of the active materials. In addition, over the lifespan, an irreversible mechanical expansion occurs, which is triggered, inter alia, by the reaction of electrolyte components on the electrode surface. The limitation of the mechanical space in battery cells and systems leads to mechanical stresses due to electrode expansion, which, as proven, affect cell aging and thus the properties of the electrochemical system. For a fundamental description of the mechanical influence, basic electrochemical methods are necessary. To physically describe these effects, this work presents a comprehensive simulation model. The electrochemical equations are based on the Newman model, which has been supplemented by a mechanical and thermal approach. The mechanical extension enables the calculation of the volume change of the components depending on the Li concentration and the mechanical boundary conditions. The electrochemical-mechanical coupling is depicted by the prevailing mechanical pressures affecting the porosity and thus the ionic transport properties of the porous electrodes and separators. The temperature- and concentration-dependent parameterization of the electrochemical-mechanical model is fully carried out in this work. The determination of the properties of the active materials used is carried out by applying special three-electrode cells, whereby the anode and cathode are parameterized separately from each other. Particularly thin electrode layers minimize the influence of the electrolyte. The physical relationship between the mechanical pressure and the ionic conductivity of the components could be measured directly and confirmed by simulation results. The physical model approach highlights that mechanical tension of cells enhances the formation of Li concentration gradients during charging and discharging.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322208-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7681721-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014241-3>

Comparison of Different Planting Methods of Energy Wood Plantations ¤ On three newly established experimental plots in Northwest Germany (Gütersloh district, Uelzen district) forest management methods for the establishment and management of short-rotation plantations on former agricultural land were tested. The experimental plot in Gütersloh (Sudheide) was divided into an arable land area, which was ploughed and manured before cultivation, and a grassland area, where the plant rows were sprayed and ploughed in strips. In the spring of 2007, poplar hybrids Max 4 (P. nigra x P. maximowiczii) and NE 42 (P. maximowiczii x P. trichocarpa) and willow Turbo (Salix viminalis), as well as two-year-old aspen (Populus tremula) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) were planted on the grassland area. On the arable land area, two- to three-year-old plants of the sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), the rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), black alder (Alnus glutinosa) and winter linden (Tilia cordata) were planted in addition. Three variants of companion plant regulation (control, mowing, crop sowing) and four variants with soil additives (control, hydrogel, mycorrhiza, hydrogel/mycorrhiza) were carried out. The experimental plots were regularly observed and documented to analyze the effects of the different planting methods on plant growth and the environment. The results of this study are intended to contribute to the development of efficient and sustainable planting methods for energy wood plantations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4473009-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4507769-1>
A Contribution to the Development of Mobile Robots Based on Multistable Tensegrity Structures ¤ In this work, the application of Tensegrity structures with multiple stable equilibrium configurations for the realization of locomotion systems in mobile robotics is investigated. These structures are modeled under the mechanical aspect and various actuator strategies are derived for the realization of a controlled switch between the different stable equilibrium states. For experimental verification of the theoretical approaches, a prototype of a multistable Tensegrity structure is developed. The experimental results confirm the advantageous properties of multistable Tensegrity structures as well as the possibility of controlled configuration changes. As a result of extensions of the mechanical model considering environmental influences, the motion behavior of Tensegrity structures is simulated. In this work, the movement is realized through the equilibrium state changes of the multistable Tensegrity structure. Depending on the chosen actuation strategy, a walking locomotion, a crawling locomotion, and a jumping locomotion can be realized. Experiments with the developed prototype confirm the previously investigated locomotion forms. Through the combination of the different motion modes, a multimodal locomotion system results. This locomotion system allows the adaptation of the locomotion principle according to the given environmental conditions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4226174-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145164-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358934-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7600993-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1218325364> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121372-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191911-7>
Erskine Caldwells Short Stories : Studies on American Neo-Naturalism ¤ Dust jacket: The genre of the American short story has been extensively and intensively praised by literary critics in its numerous exponents (Poe, Anderson, O. Henry, Hemingway, etc.). However, despite its enormous popularity, the short prose of Erskine Caldwell has been largely overlooked by academic criticism. This work fills a gap by examining the short story work of an author who is one of the most contentious social critics of the American South and at the same time one of the last popular representatives of the Mark Twain tradition.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033842-3>
Silk-Based Inorganic Functional Materials ¤ In the present work, two different hybrid materials (HM) were successfully synthesized by the sol-gel method. The HM are monoliths with a diameter of up to 4.5 cm. The first HM consists of titanium dioxide and Bombyx mori silk and is denoted as TS, while the second contains less silk and in addition polyethylene oxide (PEO) and is therefore abbreviated as TPS. Some of the HM were immersed in a aqueous tetrachloroauric acid solution after synthesis, resulting in the formation of gold nanoparticles on the surface. The materials were characterized by electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray powder diffraction. The results show that both HM are composed of approximately 5 nm large, spherical titanium dioxide nanoparticles, which are primarily composed of anatase and to a small extent of brookite. The gold nanoparticles at TPS_Au were larger and polydisperse than the gold nanoparticles on TS_Au...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4333369-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174509-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4321480-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054289-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185549-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4278915-1>
The SED and the APO: Reception of the Student Movement in the Press of the GDR ¤ When in 1968 the students took to the streets, this did not only make headlines in Western news. The press of the GDR, led by the SED, extensively dealt with the events in Berlin and other West German cities. Finally, it seemed to be realized what the GDR press had been predicting for a long time: In the Federal Republic, a part of the population was rising up against the system and its representatives and demanding a socialist alternative to capitalism. This could be ideally integrated into the ongoing reporting, which depicted the GDR in bright colors, while the Federal Republic was characterized as a fascist and repressive state. However, it was the students who were protesting, and not, as socialist theory had predicted, the workers. It also did not fit the picture that their leader, Rudi Dutschke, had left the GDR a few years earlier to study in the West. As reality did not correspond to the ideology of the SED in these points, this distorted the events or withheld important facts. In the spring of 1968, the situation for the SED became more complicated due to the events in Czechoslovakia. Here too, the youth was protesting, but their reform efforts contradicted the socialist doctrine. So, the reporting of the GDR press oscillated between sympathy for the West German students and at the same time the concern that their own youth could be caught up in the international wave of protests. <dt.> German Democratic Republic, United Socialist Party of Germany, extra-parliamentary opposition. <keywords>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049716-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143638-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047150-0>
Automated User Interface Synthesis for Software Application Creation in Industrial Image Processing - A User-Oriented Concept for Developing Individual User Interfaces ¤ The subject of this dissertation is the creation of a software application for industrial image processing through automated synthesis of an individually created user interface and a state-based workflow. The central goal is to reduce complexity and requirements for the creation process from the user's perspective of development tools, as well as to increase the quality and efficiency of the process. To this end, a new concept for user-friendly software application creation was developed. A distinctive feature of this creation process, designed according to software ergonomic criteria, is the realization of complex workflows for test and measurement tasks in executable, individual software applications without mastering higher programming languages. The state of the art in creating software applications for industrial image processing meets the increasing requirements and the increase in complexity with the increase in functional power while maintaining existing concepts. As a consequence, the increased requirements in the creation process are simply passed on to the user. The concept created in this work allows for a user-friendly creation process under software ergonomic aspects. This is shown by investigations into the structure of workflows, that finite automata are very well suited for the creation of event-driven discrete measurement and test workflows. By means of example implementations, it is shown how the creation process is enhanced in terms of efficiency and quality through state-based modeling. As expected, the potential of this new concept cannot be fully exploited. However, the present work demonstrates the effective simplification of the previously complex approach, which, combined with integrated and structured software development processes, means easier maintainability, variability, and documentation during a software lifecycle.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053059-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116522-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006684-8>

The Customer Integration Community for Innovation Process : Empirical Analyses and Implications ¤ More and more companies are pursuing the strategy of actively integrating customers into their innovation development in order to be able to implement customer needs adequately. Ulrich Bretschneider examines idea communities as a method of customer integration. He first conducts a case study investigation to capture the fundamental circumstances of idea communities. Based on this, he answers various detailed questions. For example, he investigates which motives and personality traits of customers influence the quality of ideas and the customers' willingness to submit ideas. Idea communities -- customer integration in the innovation process -- open innovation -- quality of innovation ideas -- motives of participants in virtual idea communities -- the influence of personality traits on idea submission.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4316837-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161817-8>

Innovations in the service sector are gaining importance as they are relevant to competition. However, they are still often unsatisfactorily organized in practice, and science has so far neglected this topic and only provided partial solution approaches. Marc Opitz develops a universally applicable concept with which organizational structures for service innovation can be designed. The various tasks of service innovation are described through roles and brought into a consistent context. The topics „Service Engineering“ and „Service Quality Improvement“ form the focus. This role-based approach enables a flexible and organization-independent design of service innovation. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161817-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012181-1>
Geochemical Characterization of Gold Deposits in Europe ¤ Archaeometry, gold artefacts, gold deposits, Laser Ablation, prehistoric, provenance analyses, Skydisc of Nebra, trace element analytics. The present work is intended to clarify in principle whether trace element analytics is applicable to the provenance analysis of gold artefacts. It was found that gold is extremely widespread in small deposits. The number of known Seifengold deposits is largely dependent on the processing density (mostly by local gold washers), but it can be observed that the variety of small deposits in ore provinces is also formed and is therefore scientifically accessible. The second important part of the work made the development of the measurement method (Laser Ablation ICP-MS) out. A method was developed that provides a previously unattained precision and accuracy of the analysis. In the third part of the work, the groundwork for the trace element analytics was laid using classical ore deposit knowledge. The morphological properties determined, as well as inclusions and zoning, were important input parameters for the subsequent trace element analytics. This analytics forms the heart of the work. Due to the high spatial resolution at detection limits mostly below one ppm, opportunities were created for the creation of a previously unattained data basis. In addition to the primary question of provenance analysis, questions about the supergene alteration in the rim of the gold grains as well as the change in the composition of the trace elements during the smelting process could be clarified. Using statistical methods and tools, these data were prepared and interpreted. It could be shown that, depending on the trace element contained in the gold, the influence of extrinsic factors on these can be both insignificant and significant. The evaluation of the data showed that the origin of the Skydisc of Nebra could be restricted to a few of the investigated areas. In addition to these findings, an attempt was also made, based on the results of the work, to take a look into the future of provenance analysis. It was shown that, in particular, the patterns of the platinum group elements as well as various isotope signatures could be a possible approach for the future of provenance analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174871-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4521187-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4328326-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188678-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4377611-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4021541-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172906-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4279134-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190888-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071507-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4318315-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4452723-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121377-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120440-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145916-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157819-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130392-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4290341-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4280345-7>
Integration of the Operation Management of an HVDC Overlay Network into the Line Frequency Regulation of a Three-Phase Power Grid ¤ The share of renewable energies in Germany and Europe in general is increasing significantly in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The construction of most of these power plants can only be carried out at a few locations due to climatic conditions, the loads remain further decentralized distributed and conventional power plants are gradually shut down. Therefore, a continuously automated and efficient electricity transmission network for the long-distance transport of large energy quantities is indispensable. A possible solution to this challenge is a pan-European meshed overlay network. This can be based on HVDC technology and connects regions with large feed-in from renewable sources to load centers. Due to its technological properties compared to an AC network, an HVDC overlay network must actively support system services such as power-frequency regulation in order to ensure system stability and supply security, just like the current AC network on all network levels. In this work, a new procedure for the participation of an HVDC overlay network in the regulation of power flow is developed. At the same time, this operation management also takes over a partial share of other power flows, for example through energy trading transactions. Numerical case studies show some advantages of this procedure under different disturbances of the AC-DC transmission network. It is shown that an HVDC overlay network with the developed operation management relieves the AC network by a variable share of power flows and improves the line frequency regulation, for example in terms of speed and frequency deviations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7839944-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165465-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4801279-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171525-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068598-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171506-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4620681-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4150600-5>
British EU Withdrawal and Shell Companies Abroad: Consequences and Options for Design ¤ Currently, there are approximately 10,000 companies in the form of a British limited company with a management office in Germany. The British EU withdrawal will have far-reaching legal consequences for these mostly small and smallest companies. In particular, the Brexit will be accompanied by unlimited personal liability for all new and existing liabilities. These legal consequences are so severe for the affected companies that they seem to be forced to convert to a liability-restricted company form before the Brexit takes effect. The author examines the available conversion options and evaluates their suitability for the affected small and micro-enterprises. He also addresses the current legislative proposal, which was introduced in January 2019 with the adoption of the 4th UmwGÄndG, providing an additional option for design: cross-border merger into a German commercial partnership.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4843101-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020654-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7564057-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1109778066> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126282-7>
The Privileging of Corporations Pursuant to § 1 Abs. 3 Nr. 2 AÜG ¤ The work deals with the examination of the group company privilege contained in section 1, para. 3 number 2 of the German Employee Leasing Act (AÜG). While employee leasing in Germany is subject to strict regulations in principle, the group company privilege includes a comprehensive exemption from these regulations. The author examines the scope of this highly disputed privilege. Initially, the author shows that the provision complies with both European law and German constitutional law. In addition, she describes the requirements and limits of the rather vague privilege. Therefore, the publication not only targets lawyers advising on employee leasing matters, but also representatives of group legal and personnel departments dealing with questions of intragroup and cross-border employee deployment in their daily business. The author has been practicing as attorney since 2011 and has mainly focused on employment-related matters, including employee leasing.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194193-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074122-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032356-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4451062-7>
Study of polymer film formation and their characterization using NMR, XRD and DSC ¤ The formation of thin polymer layers from the environmentally friendly polymers gelatin, starch, and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH) was investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The samples were prepared by casting aqueous polymer solutions and their drying process at room temperature was investigated using a unilateral NMR scanner until complete solidification. One-dimensional depth profiles with microscopic resolution were taken at various stages of the process. Each profile point was formed from the sum of several spin echoes. Furthermore, spin-spin relaxation times (T2) were determined from the decrease in echo intensities for each point and interpreted in relation to the drying process. In addition, spin lattice relaxation times (T1) were measured. Depending on the type and original concentration of the investigated polymer, different molecular dynamic processes were observed in various depths of the layer during the evaporation of the solvent. The results show a spatial inhomogeneity of the molecular dynamic processes during drying. In the advanced stage of the drying process, this inhomogeneity affects the microscopic arrangement of the polymer chains during solidification and thus determines the final structure of the polymer layer. XRD measurements of the completely solidified layers confirm the structural inhomogeneity shown by the NMR measurements.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175236-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156396-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4336833-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4320176-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154356-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075421-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175339-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182793-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124329-8>
The Democratization Potentials of European NGOs: Between Professionalization and Linkage ¤ Based on comparative empirical surveys, Sarah Bastgen examines in a study located at the intersection of EU, NGO, and communication research, to what extent the degree of professionalization affects the relationship with stakeholders of organizational activities of NGOs based in the EU and thus their linkage performance and their democratizing effects.

Audiovisual Rhythms : Film Music, Movement Composition and the Dynamic Affection of the Viewer ¤ The book takes the question as its starting point, to what extent the emotional quality of filmic images can be analytically qualified. Can principles and patterns of audiovisual composition be grasped as fixed points of an aesthetic of film effects? As an approach, music theory is initially used: If visual and auditory design elements of the film merged in common, audiovisual principles of film composition, then emotional theoretical models of music perception should also be applicable to the film image as an audiovisual perception whole. Against this background, a rhythmic dimension of current Hollywood cinema, which virtuosically plays with the supposed boundary between image and sound, is empirically reconstructed and theoretically reflected through a series of exemplary film analyses. Step by step, from theories of film music, through considerations of the phenomenology of audiovisual images, to a model of embodied experience of rhythmic-kinetic perception patterns, a theory of audiovisual rhythms is unfolded – and it is shown how this rhythmic dimension of audiovisual images can be grasped as an access to intersubjective strategies of emotional guidance in the cinema.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049716-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127324-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017129-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132330-0>
Environmental enrichment : strategies to improve the housing conditions of breeding bulls. Impact on time budget, physical activity, rumination, sexual behavior and semen quality ¤ Breeding bull behaviour. - In the context of the present study, the housing conditions of breeding bulls should be investigated and improved. To this end, the behaviour of the bulls in a conventional and an enriched environment was investigated. In order to gain insight into the natural behavioural patterns of breeding bulls, a time budget for young and old bulls in conventional housing was created beforehand. Furthermore, the effects of enrichment on sexual behaviour and semen quality were investigated. In the first part of the study (Chapter 1), four old (4.6 ± 0.8 years) and four young bulls (1.7 ± 0.6 years) of the Holstein-Black and White breed were investigated in three consecutive phases. In Phase 1 (3 weeks) and Phase 3 (9 weeks), the bulls were kept in a conventional box (18 m2 area, vertical, rounded metal bars as front and side partitions, concrete back wall, wood shavings as bedding in the resting area, concrete floor and feeding area, feeding grid and self-drinking trough in the front area). In Phase 2, the bulls were placed in an enriched and larger box (construction as described above, but: 29.6 m2 area, swinging cow brush, wood bars as side partitions, concrete as bedding in the resting area, concrete floor and feeding area, automatic feeder and self-drinking trough in the front area) for 10 weeks. The results of this study show that the enrichment of the bulls' housing conditions leads to a significant improvement in time budget, physical activity, rumination behaviour, and sexual behaviour. Furthermore, a significant improvement in semen quality was observed. The results of this study have important implications for the improvement of the housing conditions of breeding bulls and the optimisation of semen quality.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062860-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116485-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4307597-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117220-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056167-7>

Secularization as a Struggle: Outline of a Field-Theoretical Approach to Secularization Phenomena ¤ Drawing on Bourdieu's social theory, this book outlines a multi-dimensional perspective on secularization phenomena, which conceives of secularization as an optional process. The core thesis is that secularization is closely linked to the struggle for a societal understanding of true religion. Secularization is not seen as simply more or less religion, but is understood in the three dimensions of differentiation, privatization, and marginalization. Special emphasis is placed on operationalizability for empirical research, which is secured by the recourse to habitus analysis.

Complexity Management in Multinational Procurement Cooperations at the Example of the Defense Sector ¤ The willingness to procure complex weapon systems in the future through multinational procurement cooperations requires the development and expansion of the necessary management competence. Therefore, the fundamental relationships and challenges in multinational procurement cooperations are examined from different perspectives. In addition to the complexity in collective action systems, it is necessary to openly address the additional complexity drivers, the resulting complexity costs, and the possible effects on the success of the multinational procurement cooperation. In dealing with complexity, tension fields must be resolved that arise not only from the technical complexity of the procurement object, but also from the task perception in such projects.

Multifunctional Dinitrogen Complexes of Titanium with Pentafulvene Ligands ¤ An efficient one-step synthesis of novel nitrogen bridged binuclear monocyclopentadienyltitaniumpentafulvenecomplexes with the general formula [{(eta5-C5Me5)(eta6-C5H4=CR2)Ti}2(my2,eta1,eta1-N2)] is presented in this work. These air- and moisture sensitive but thermally notable stable compounds exhibit a versatile follow-up chemistry and could extensively be characterised in solution as well as in the solid state. In the reaction with chalcogenes either the bridging N2-molecule was selectively substituted or novel titanium-chalcogen-clusters were built up. In a swift reaction the conversion of nitrogen bridged complexes and molecular hydrogen led to a fulvalene bridged binuclear complex in which the bridging nitrogen ligand was rearranged into a side-on position. One-electron-oxidation with [Cp2Fe][BPh4] or conversion with [HMe2NPh][BPh4] led to metallocene-like cationic titaniumcomplexes with pentafulvene ligands as well as substituted Cp-ligands. These ionic compounds were analysed by ESI mass spectrometry. Conversion of the titelcompound with the borane B(C6F5)3 led to zwitterionic betain structures. <engl.>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4150241-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4381639-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4438863-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137203-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137187-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4820049-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4279323-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183927-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185548-6>
Investigation of Directed Interactions of Multivariate Biomedical Signals Based on the Predictability Principle of Granger ¤ The goal of this work was the development of the Granger Causality Index (GCI) for the detection of directed interactions between components of a multivariate biomedical process. The starting point of the methodological development was the concept of predictability according to Granger. This principle states that a random process X then influences another random process Y if the prediction of Y is improved by adding information from observations of X. Theoretically, all models that result in prediction errors are suitable for implementing the GCI. In this work, a time-varying GCI was realized on the basis of time-varying MVAR models (multivariate autoregressive models) as well as a state-dependent GCI based on MSETAR models (multivariate self-exciting threshold autoregressive models). MVAR and MSETAR models are extensions of the classical linear AR approach. Using time-varying MVAR models, multidimensional processes with dynamic properties can be investigated. In contrast, MSETAR models can be used for the analysis of processes with nonlinear character. A focus of this work was the multivariate development and application of both GCI variants. Confidence intervals for the GCI and significance statements were realized by Bootstrap and Surrogate methods. The time-varying GCI was applied to both EEG and fMRT data. The EEG data were recorded during an attention paradigm (Stroop task) or a laser stimulation, the fMRT data during a motor experiment (self-paced finger tapping). With the help of the time-varying GCI, statements could be made about the temporal development of directed interactions between the investigated areas. Through the multivariate or partial GCI analysis between two signal components, it was possible to exclude the influence of involved but not captured signals in the model in contrast to the bivariate GCI analysis. The joint application of the state-dependent and time-varying GCI could significantly contribute to the gain of knowledge about directed interactions between the BOLD responses of an fMRT signal and can be used in addition for the interpretation of the results.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7618675-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006899-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014254-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030102-3>

Biosynthesis and Function of Natural Products from Mortierella alpina ¤ In this work, it was shown using the model organism Mortierella alpina that basal fungi are likely capable of extensive natural product biosynthesis. Thus, a corresponding non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) could be identified for the biosynthesis of malpinine, malpicycline, malpibaldine, and calpinactam. The underlying biosynthetic genes malA, mpbA, calA, and mpcA are fungal genes of bacterial origin that have been transferred to M. alpina via horizontal gene transfer. In addition, the biological function and possible pharmaceutical application possibilities were investigated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171332-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191365-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046076-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7660409-3>
Environment, Nature, and Morality: A Critique of Hans Jonas, Vittorio Hösle, and Georg Picht ¤ The philosophers Jonas, Hösle and Picht have recognized that the moral questions of the environmental problem affect all areas of human action. They see the environmental problem as a sign that the rule of modern reason violates a metaphysical principle of being and therefore enter for a concept of absolute reason in the tradition of Heidegger's philosophy of being, which can provide orientation in the technological civilization. However, the justification problems of an ontological ethics are answered theologically, and the intrinsic conflicts of collective action cannot be taken into account. The analysis of the evaluation problems shows that ecological, economic-technical, and contemplative relationships of humans to nature are important for determining morally desirable action: 'Nature' is not asked as an ontological principle.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045791-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186806-7>
Hydraulic and thermal dynamics at various permafrost sites on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau ¤ Temperature transfer mechanisms, which dominate the exchange between permafrost and the atmosphere, are of essential importance to understand the current decline of permafrost. The hydraulic and thermal dynamics of various active layers at four different permafrost observation sites on the QTP were investigated using several geophysical methods and soil-atmosphere observation stations. Complex field data were selected and processed using suitable methods. The fundamental physical processes that dominate the thermal regime of the active layer were characterized using the surface energy balance method at Chumaer, Qumahe, and Tianshuihai. Multichannel ground-penetrating radar was used as a geophysical method to characterize soil properties in greater depth. The accuracy of the multichannel ground-penetrating radar method and its suitability for quantifying hydraulic properties and processes on the field scale were validated using a Monte Carlo analysis for error estimation and a test on a non-permanently frozen sandy field. Based on precise soil temperature and soil water content measurements, the temperature transfer in various active layers was characterized using transfer functions. An inverse method for parameterizing the seasonal thermal conductivity was investigated using the given characteristics of the temperature transfer in the underground at the test fields. With the combination of the transfer function and multichannel ground-penetrating radar methods, a parameterization of the thermal conductivity on the field scale was derived.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121893-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148908-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4236526-0>
Validation and Application of Multilevel Measurement Models for Questionnaires in Course Evaluation ¤ Course evaluation (CE) is a proven and often used method for assessing the quality of a course. Primarily, CE questionnaires are used as a feedback instrument for lecturers with the aim of improving teaching. However, the psychometric quality of the used questionnaires is often questioned. The present work deals with various challenges related to the validation of psychometric quality. In the first two chapters of this work, CE is presented in more detail and CE at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena is introduced. The subsequent study deals with the suitability of various conventional confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) for validating model quality and compares them with the multi-level factor analysis (ML-CFA) using a sample of 183,334 student judgments. From the comparison of these CFA procedures, a clear recommendation for the use of ML-CFA can be derived. Another challenge in validating the psychometric quality of CE questionnaires are multiple evaluations. They occur when students evaluate multiple events and thus appear multiple times in the analysis samples. The results of the second study illustrate that multiple evaluations have an impact on the results of CFA and that this differs between the various CFA procedures. The ML-CFA, which is best suited for validating the measurement model according to the results of both studies, is used in the third study to evaluate different reports. This study shows, using an experiment, the effect of different presentation forms in the result report on the quality of the course. The work concludes with a discussion of the results of all three studies and highlights the empirical evidence for the usefulness of CE as a feedback instrument. Furthermore, the importance of the method and the analysis sample used for validating the psychometric quality of CE questionnaires is emphasized.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071034-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128271-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129200-5>
Extraterritorial Application of Antifraud Provisions in US Capital Markets Law ¤ BEGIN\nMain description: The extraterritorial application of US federal securities laws, specifically the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, has been debated for years. It lies in the field of tension between the interests of states, plaintiffs, and defendants. With the decision Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd. in 2010, the US Supreme Court first addressed this issue. Johannes Richter discusses the fundamentals of extraterritorial law application in the US, the development of case law and legislation before and after this decision, as well as related criticism, problems, and proposals for solutions. It shows that the US Supreme Court has succeeded in excluding particularly problematic cases from the scope of the antifraud provisions, but overall, no definitive clarity has been achieved.\nEND	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048765-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057795-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068999-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065682-2>
Companies as Heirs : Inheritance Law and Tax Law Perspectives ¤ When companies are used as heirs, a series of inheritance law, company law, and tax law questions arise. What advantages does the appointment of a company as heir have and under what conditions are companies entitled to inheritance? Who is the tax subject of inheritance tax and what consequences result from this? How can double burdens resulting from inheritance tax and income tax, as far as these result from the establishment of a company, be avoided under applicable law? The work deals with these questions, without preparing and examining the relevant thematic foundations, in particular the tax competition doctrine.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015110-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152581-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116614-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157055-8>

Enforcement of Capital Market Regulations through Private Law ¤ The work examines the contribution of private law to the enforcement of capital market regulations. German capital market law has so far primarily relied on public law supervisory law and criminal law for the enforcement of capital market behavioral obligations. The alternative control and sanction instrument 'private law' has only recently come into the focus of scientific consideration in the EU. The work analyzes whether private law de lege lata already makes a contribution to the enforcement of the behavioral regulations of the secondary market and whether de lege ferenda private law regulations should be considered or even enacted.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177251-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177275-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047304-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022898-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7573652-4>

Microoptical multi aperture imaging systems ¤ The miniaturization of digital single-aperture imaging systems currently reaches physical and technical limits. Miniaturization leads to a reduction in both resolution capability and signal-to-noise ratio. The principles of the smallest known natural vision systems - compound eyes - offer a way out. The parallel arrangement of a large number of optics enables, despite the small component size, a large amount of information to be transferred from an extended field of view. The goal is to analyze the advantages of natural compound eyes and adapt them to overcome current limits of miniaturization of digital cameras. By synergizing optics, opto-electronics, and image processing, miniaturization is pursued under the achievement of practically relevant parameters. For this purpose, a systematic classification of already known and novel principles of multi-aperture imaging systems has been made.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164884-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4782134-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4362762-6>

Identifikationspotenziale in the Psalms : Emotions, Metaphors and Text Dynamics in Psalms 30, 64, 90 and 147 ¤ Awarded with the Kardinal-Innitzer-Förderungspreis 2017. How is it possible for readers to enter literary texts and experience them »up close«? Starting from this question, Sigrid Eder explores the fascinating immediacy of the Psalms, which has not yet been methodically operationalized or systematically analyzed. Immediacy is triggered in this way, as readers can identify with the situations, movements, emotions, and experiences told in the Psalms. The book takes the research desideratum regarding textual identification potential in the Psalms as its starting point and investigates text strategies that enable readers to identify.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129895-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072712-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4207378-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035441-6>
Violence, History, Justice: Transnational Debates on German State Crimes in the 20th Century ¤ With the emergence of modern international humanitarian law in the latter third of the 19th century, the view on various forms of state-organized violence changed. Focusing on political, legal, and scientific debates about German (mass) violence, which are illuminated over a brief century and in various temporal and spatial contexts, Annette Weinke examines the changing character of humanitarian international law and asks about the interconnections between historical experience, historiography, law, and (moral) politics. Her investigation enters new historical terrain by first placing the reality-constituting effects of international criminal law and human rights into a longer temporal perspective. In the focus are German international law violations in World War I, the Nazi mass crimes and the Holocaust, as well as the system injustice of the GDR. “The transnationally conducted debates about German state violence ran through the entire 20th century.

Poverty and Income Poverty in Germany: Multidimensional Analyses with Time-Use Data ¤ Poverty is traditionally measured by a sole consideration of the income dimension, although a broad consensus has been established that poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon. Against this background, a poverty concept is developed that combines the dimensions of time and income. For the first time, corresponding analyses are carried out for the working population of the Federal Republic of Germany. Using the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) 2002, the compensatory relationship between the dimensions is estimated, and on the basis of the time budget surveys 1991/92 and 2001/02 of the Federal Statistical Office, poverty analyses are carried out. In this context, a relatively stable multidimensional poverty situation is shown over a ten-year period. However, it becomes clear that a significant proportion of the non-income-poor working population is unable to compensate for the time deficit through income.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4291378-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4433832-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194476-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002963-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4220824-5>
Economic Crises in Germany: Patterns of Reaction by Veto Players and Agenda Setters ¤ Julia Kiesow analyzes the specific crisis reaction patterns of actors and their appearance as veto players and agenda setters in recessions. To this end, she examines four crisis periods in the Federal Republic of Germany using a comparative longitudinal analysis, in which the involved economic policy actors deviate from their usual action strategies. In addition to the economic downturn in the 1960s, the oil crisis of the 1970s, and the recession of 1982, the real economic crisis of 2009 is also considered. The focus is on the economic policy reactions of the respective government parties, the German Federal Council, the German Federal Bank, the DGB, and the Federal Association of German Employer Associations. In particular, parties play an important role in this context, as the external condition of economic crises makes party differences more apparent. The content includes party difference theory, veto player theory, veto players and agenda setters in the Federal Republic of Germany, economic policy orientation of individual parties, crisis analyses of the years 1967, 1975, 1982, 2009, economic policy reaction patterns. The target groups are lecturers and students of politics and economics, representatives from the economy and associations, and specialists. The author/editor Julia Kiesow is a lecturer for special tasks at the Institute for Political Science of the Justus-Liebig University Giessen.

Regulation of 4-Dihydromethyltrisporat Dehydrogenase during Sexual and Parasitic Interaction of Parasitella parasitica ¤ Parasitella parasitica is a biotrophic fusion parasite that can interact with numerous other biotechnologically relevant genera of Mucoraceae, such as Absidia, Thamnidium or Blakeslea, in parasitic exchange. P. parasitica transports genetic material into its hosts with high efficiency. However, the transformation of host strains by conventional means is difficult, making Parasitella an interesting alternative for the genetic manipulation of Zygomycetes. Since parasitism is characterized by interaction with complementary crossing partners, it is assumed that the sexual communication system of Zygomycetes is involved in the process of host recognition. In the present work, the regulation of 4-Dihydromethyltrisporat Dehydrogenase, an enzyme of the sexual hormone system of Zygomycetes, was investigated during sexual and parasitic interaction. Models for the regulation of 4-Dihydromethyltrisporat Dehydrogenase in P. parasitica are derived from the results, contributing to a better understanding of the sexual and parasitic interaction process.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191365-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4752655-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4316523-0>
An Aggregate of Every Moment Before : American Forms of Rooting and Uprooting in the Films of Sean Penn ¤ Lines of connection between familial origin, creative development, and the American cultural superstructure are deeply inscribed into the life of Sean Penn. The author examines how these mental bridges or their fractures also manifest in Penn's - until now largely overlooked - filmic directorial work. In doing so, he follows three complexes of motives, which he highlights as central in this context: the idea of a collective rooting of US-Americans in myths, traditions, and time images, the idea of a familial rooting, and the idea of a personal rooting, which means Penn's strong relationship to the works of other artists (including films by John Cassavetes, poems by Charles Bukowski, photographs by Dennis Hopper, and songs by Bruce Springsteen). The author moves stylistically between essay and film analysis; his research focuses on author film, film and surrealism, European cinema after 1945, and New Hollywood.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017102-4>

Comparative Investigation of Desflurane and Propofol in Equipotent Doses in Combination with Dexmedetomidine Regarding Central Circulatory Parameters and Peripheral Perfusion and Oxygenation in Horses ¤ The aim of the study was to investigate the global and gastrointestinal perfusion and oxygenation both after sedation with dexmedetomidine and during general anesthesia with desflurane (Group DES) or propofol (Group PRO) in horses. In six clinically owned horses, the microperfusion and oxygenation of the buccal, esophageal, and rectal mucosa were measured using laser Doppler flowmetry and white light spectroscopy before and after sedation with dexmedetomidine (3.5 mg/kg BW). Subsequently, anesthesia was induced with propofol (2 mg/kg BW) and ketamine (1 mg/kg BW). Anesthesia was maintained either with desflurane or propofol in combination with a continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine (7 mg/kg/h BW). After determining the minimal infusion rate (MIR) of propofol and the minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) of desflurane, further microperfusion and oxygenation measurements were performed at the corresponding locations. Additionally, heart rate, respiratory rate, mean arterial blood pressure, cardiac output (lithium dilution), and arterial blood gases were determined. The statistical evaluation was performed using two-factorial variance analysis, t-test, and Dunnett's t-test (p < 0.05). The MAC for desflurane and the MIR for propofol were 2.6 ± 0.9% and 0.04 ± 0.01 mg/kg/min, respectively. The microperfusion and oxygenation of the gastrointestinal tract decreased significantly after dexmedetomidine application. While oxygenation in anesthesia returned to baseline levels, microperfusion increased but remained below baseline. No differences were found between the groups. The cardiac index was statistically higher in Group DES (DES 74 ± 9 vs. PROP 70 ± 9 ml/min/kg) and peripheral vascular resistance (DES 210 ± 36 vs. PROP 229 ± 66 Dynes/s/cm-5) was lower. In the PROP group, PaO2 was significantly higher and dead space and PA-aO2 were significantly lower. Dexmedetomidine reduced microperfusion and oxygenation of the tissue after bolus application. During general anesthesia, perfusion and oxygenation, however, increased significantly. Propofol anesthesia led to an improved gas exchange in this study, likely due to better lung perfusion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045503-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165611-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4779975-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4204012-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4392938-2>
The structural incorporation of iron ions in alkali-alkaline earth silicate and alumino silicate glasses and the characterization of the properties of the glasses ¤ In this work, the influence of higher (up to 9 mol.%) iron oxide contents on the structure and properties of two types of silicate glasses is investigated. The clarification of the structure was carried out by the use of Mössbauer and light spectroscopy. It could be shown that iron, regardless of its valency, is present in tetrahedral coordination in alkali-alkaline earth silicate glasses under oxidizing conditions, while under reducing conditions octahedral coordination is preferred. In alumino silicate glasses, Fe2+ is always present in 6-fold coordination, while Fe3+ changes the coordination from 4 to 6. Due to their importance for the melting and processing of the glasses, the viscosity in two regions, the transformation and sink point temperature, the thermal expansion, the microhardness, the density, the crystallization, and the electrical conductivity of the melt were investigated in more detail.

Self-Propelled Civil Wars: On the Persistence and Finiteness of Domestic Violence Conflicts ¤ Even in the 21st century, the world is shaken by long-lasting civil wars - the most recent example is the never-ending civil war in Syria. Until the beginning of the 1990s, these domestic wars were mostly seen as politically motivated violence conflicts or proxy wars. After that, with the end of the Cold War and under the impact of the genocide in Rwanda as well as the Bosnian War, new explanatory approaches emerged, which primarily attribute the widespread violence to motives of greed or traditional ethnic enmities. Against these stereotypical interpretation patterns, Stefan Deißler develops a perspective that comes closer to the multifaceted complexity of the phenomenon of civil war. Without neglecting the supporting role of ethnic, economic, or political social groups, the author shifts the focus to the warring organizations themselves and subjects the relationships between combatants and civilians to a critical examination	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008784-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4760356-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4503952-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020832-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164961-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073678-7>
Trust as Input/Output Variable in Electronic Negotiations: An Empirical Investigation of Trust-Promoting Measures ¤ Numerous management activities are carried out with the support of media, but this hinders the necessary trust-building. Katrin Stiglbauer develops possibilities for trust promotion, which she derives empirically using realistic negotiation simulation and systematic input/output consideration. The author shows that trust barriers can be overcome by early perception control as well as by concrete trust-promoting measures.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063290-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062875-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061963-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151918-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7732144-3>
Text Processing : A Media History of the Computer as Typewriter ¤ Word and Co. determine worldwide what writing means today. So self-evident text processing on the personal computer is now, but their history has been so circuitous that it has remained a "blind spot" in media science to date. Although the PC appears in its coupling of keyboard and screen as a "better typewriter," computers are not per se tools of writing. They had to become such. This book traces the development of writing with computers and provides an important contribution to the cultural history of our time.

The Royal Women of the III. Dynasty of Ur ¤ The kings of the III. Dynasty of Ur (2112-2004 BC) were always married with several women at a time, of which only one woman took the position of a queen. Among the large number of economic documents of that period, which give a detailed insight into the state economy and administration, more than 1,000 articles relating to transactions of the royal consorts can be assigned. All women of the rulers of Ur were active in business and administration, they were involved in the cult on several occasions and involved in the complex structures of court life. This work investigates in the sources in which functions and activities the royal women were involved and by which degree the posts of a Queen of Ur were different from that of a concubine. In four discurses the situation of the royal women of the Ur III period is compared with the women of the ruling houses in Ebla and the Early Dynastic Akkade (Akkadezeit)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058590-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164379-3>

Word Order Effects in Sentence Comprehension ¤ How are sentences processed that deviate from the basic word order, and how is the integration of the dislocated constituents achieved? From linguistic assumptions for the determination and representation of non-canonical word orders, hypotheses are derived by psycholinguistic research. Sandra Muckel checks the predictions of these hypotheses in psycholinguistic experiments with regard to the effects of syntactic, verb-specific, and prosodic information. She shows that the parser in German reactivates dislocated objects before the final verb in their base position. The author formulates a hypothesis on opportunistic integration on this basis and taking into account evidence from English, according to which the parser uses the integration site (verb or trace) that it can identify first. Subsequently, she investigates which alternative information allows the identification of a base position in German. Her results enable the evaluation of psycholinguistic hypotheses and linguistic assumptions	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135250-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063241-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138320-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141199-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4300621-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0>
Gold nanoparticles : microreactor-based synthesis and toxic substance transport effect ¤ BEGIN The goal of this work was to investigate the suitability of microreactors for handling, generating and investigating nanoparticle systems. The developed laboratory setup should be characterized in terms of its suitability for application in a process chain, which ranges from particle synthesis, modification to analysis and investigation of the binding of pollutants to nanoparticles. Gold nanoparticles (GNP) were selected as a model for a nanoparticle system, as they show very interesting properties that make them suitable for the development of new functional materials in the field of nanotechnology. The potential interactions of GNP with various model substances for pollutants were investigated using conventionally synthesized surface-modified GNP. It became clear that the necessary isolation step, as well as the incubation, were not realizable in any available microsystem. It could be shown that the heavy metal ions lead and copper, as well as the cationic dye malachite green, are very efficiently adsorbed by GNP, while the interaction with 4-chlorophenol, Amidoschwarz B and naphthalene is low. A direct synthesis of GNP from a gold salt and ascorbic acid as a reducing agent in a split-and-recombine microreactor could be realized, which showed that such a direct continuous synthesis in a microreactor is possible. Experimental parameters were optimized to produce narrow particle size distributions. It turned out that the adjustment of the surface properties of the microreactor channels and the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles was crucial to prevent particle deposition, which leads to reactor clogging. Two approaches, namely the hydrophobization of the channel surfaces by silanization and the electrostatic repulsion between nanoparticles and channel surfaces by increasing the pH value. Furthermore, in a modular microsystem, silver and gold nanoparticles could be produced using sodium borohydride as a reducing agent. Additionally, the conversion of these particles with ligands directly in the microsystem was successful, which led to a direct synthesis of modified gold and silver nanoparticles in a continuous process. In summary, it could be shown that nanoparticle systems can be well handled, represented and spectrally analyzed in microsystems. It was also possible to investigate particle growth, ligand binding to the surface and aggregation in the microfluidic system.

The Ottoman Empire in Student Conceptions and in History Lessons of Secondary Education I and II: A Reconstructive-Hermeneutic Analysis of Convergences and Divergences under Consideration of the Conditions of the Migration Society ¤ The migration societal reality of Germany is hardly reflected in the subject didactics of the German school system so far. This leads to an often unreflected individual language use (example: 'Migration background'), inadequate institutional discourses (example: 'Interkulturality') and a continued inequality of chances and participation in the education sector, thus a continued societal creation of 'difference'. Against this background, the question of convergences and divergences between socially and institutionally legitimized contents of subject teaching (concretely: Ottoman Empire in history lessons of secondary education I and II in North Rhine-Westphalia) and individually habituated conceptions and knowledge structures of students (concretely: brought student conceptions of the Ottoman Empire) was illuminated in this study. Through a tripartite three-part investigation, institutional provisions of history teaching could be examined and student conceptions of the Ottoman Empire reconstructed. The methodical access through the interlocking of the sociological and functional-pragmatic approach enabled a micro-analysis of linguistic-mental actions and thus of individual and collective student conceptions. The theoretical and methodological interdisciplinarity of the study enabled consideration of the highly relevant connection between society, institution and individual from a power- and difference-critical perspective in the analysis of convergences and divergences.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035117-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4214151-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077347-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020533-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4010781-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064032-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122926-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053369-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020526-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053458-3>
Synthesis and Functionalization of Fullerenes C 60 and its Derivatives for Application in Biological Systems ¤ The modification of C60 and its derivatives with polar side chains to improve solubility in polar and especially aqueous medium is of crucial importance for biological and medical applications. Although fullerene derivatives have already been found to be used in numerous biological systems, their interaction mechanisms with biological structures are almost unknown. The functionalization of fullerene compounds with fluorescent dyes should therefore be able to contribute to the clarification of these mechanisms. For functionalization, various dyes were selected that either derive from a fluorescein or an aniline basic structure. The dyes functionalized with amino or isothiocyanate groups were reacted with fullerene carboxylic acids and carboxylic acid chlorides as well as fulleropyrrolidines to form the dye-functionalized C60 and C70 compounds. In initial investigations with a model membrane, the different dye-fullerenes showed very different behavior and interesting fluorescence properties. In order to enable the binding of dyes that do not possess amino functions, various synthesis routes for the introduction of amino groups to the fullerene surface were investigated. These range from the reaction with aminofunctionalized diazomethanes to the binding of diamino glycols. With the functionalization with diamino glycols, the hope is connected to be able to synthesize fullerene derivatives that show a significantly improved solubility in polar media or even water and can be additionally functionalized with dyes. Through this synthesis method, a compound class could be synthesized that possesses enormous potential for biological and medical applications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4273707-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4279323-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4494456-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016465-2>
Inequality, State Redistribution, and Economic Growth ¤ Main Description: Traditionally, the economic doctrine assumes an unavoidable conflict of goals between distributional equality and economic growth. However, recent empirical studies suggest that a more equal distribution actually improves the overall economic supply of goods. The work presents alternative explanatory approaches to this finding and evaluates them in terms of their respective analytical robustness and empirical relevance.

Education to Maturity and Kant's Idea of Freedom ¤ Although the concept of maturity has already established its outstanding position in the educational science discussion, it is still present as an educational goal. When talking about maturity, one means - more or less explicitly - the freedom-justifying ability to be responsible for oneself. Assuming modern brain research is correct and freedom is actually only an illusion, the concept of maturity would have to be consequently rejected along with the impossibility of freedom and responsibility.

Investigations of slow dynamic processes in cooled ionic liquids by dielectric spectroscopy ¤ In the present work, slow dynamic processes in imidazolium-based ionic liquids were investigated by dielectric spectroscopy at low temperature. Several relaxation processes were observed in the glass transition region and their temperature dependence was characterized. In addition to the influence of the length of n-alkyl substituents at the imidazolium cation, the influence of the size of the anion as well as intermolecular interactions was systematically investigated by partial deuteration of the imidazolium cation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056138-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4347498-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7548899-1>
Active Service and Gender Order: A Cultural and Everyday History of Military Service in Switzerland 1939 - 1945 ¤ Traditionally, the idea has prevailed that the generation that lived through World War II in Switzerland - the so-called active service generation - was a homogeneous unit: prepared for defense and closed. But was this really the case? The present study shows through an analysis of interviews, memoirs, military theoretical literature, propaganda texts, and archival sources that the traditional image of the active service generation was essentially shaped by the propaganda of spiritual national defense. The increasingly polarized gender order at the end of the 1930s played a central role in this. The image of the soldier, who protects the family left at home with a rifle in hand, as well as the image of the Swiss woman as a housewife and selfless supporter of her conscripted husband, became normative role models. However, behind these propaganda images, a highly contradictory everyday life was hidden. The soldiers in military active service complained about the ongoing drill and suspected their officers, who dreamed of 'true soldierhood' and total obedience, of sympathy with National Socialism. A power struggle broke out in the officer corps during the war, in which competing conceptions of military training were at stake and in which different views on the social positioning of the army were mixed with different masculinity concepts. The army's withdrawal to the Alpine Reduit, which became a symbol of Swiss resistance after the war, turned the existing identity-forming balance between the protective army and the protected civilian population upside down during the war. For the first time, this study reveals how the army leadership made the Reduit strategy meaningful with discursive means, and for the first time, it is shown that the true content of the Reduit strategy was kept secret from the civilian population until the end of the war. As one of the few countries, Switzerland was largely spared from the consequences of war violence between 1939 and 1945. The propaganda images of the war time, especially the polarized gender conceptions, remained effective for decades. This was one of the reasons why women in Switzerland were granted political rights last in Europe. The traditional post-war historical image stabilized the existing social power structures and served as a cover memory for the disparate experiences of the war time.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001307-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117605-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071776-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039305-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020588-5>

German Companies and the US-American Discovery: Questions on Participation Obligation and Cost Reimbursement ¤ The Discovery plays a central role in the US civil procedure and generates high costs for its addressees on a regular basis. Following the principle of the American Rule, each party to the proceedings bears these costs itself. The work examines in a practice-oriented and scientifically demanding manner how a Discovery participant can claim reimbursement of the costs incurred by him due to the presentation of a document certified in Germany as a result of an unjustified Discovery request in a follow-up proceeding conducted in Germany. In this context, after an introductory comparative law, questions of participation obligation and possible objections to document production requests in documents certified in Germany are illuminated. Subsequently, the material-law claim bases of German law are checked, as well as procedural questions of international jurisdiction and the effects of the US first process on possible cost reimbursement.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187226-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165380-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067911-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049068-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170266-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4243381-2>
The European Union and Russia: Multilateral and Bilateral Dimensions in European Foreign Policy ¤ The dialogue between the European Union and Russia has been continuously expanded and increasingly institutionalized over the last decade. With no other third country, the EU maintains such intensive relationships as with the Russian Federation. Russia, which cannot be classified as an EU accession candidate or a partner country of the EU's neighborhood policy, plays a special role in European foreign policy. But what approach does the EU pursue towards Russia and how do the mechanisms of European foreign policy function? What role do the European Council, the Council, the Commission, and the European Parliament play in the coordinated Russia policy from "Brussels"? And how does this multilateral policy reconcile with the national Russia policy of individual EU member states? Katrin Bastian analyzes three patterns of relationships. She compares the multilateral Russia policy of the entire EU with the bilateral German-Russian and Finnish-Russian relationships. In this way, not only is the "gearbox" of European foreign policy revealed, but also a new vocabulary is created to describe the bilateral and multilateral strategies of EU member states Introduction -- Multilateralism, Bilateralism, and European Foreign Policy -- "Strategic Partnership" EU-Russia? -- German Russia policy in a multilateral context -- Finnish Russia policy in a multilateral context -- European Foreign Policy: European Added Value or National Instrument?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003846-4>
The National Environmental Signs: On the Emergence of a Global Tradition ¤ The dissertation provides German research with the currently globally awarded national environmental signs. Here, the political context is not in focus, but rather the design-formal and content-related determination, analysis, and interpretation of the sign family. Part I of the work subjects the subject of investigation to a semiotic analysis after Umberto Eco and discusses the environmental signs in the context of graphic signs, trademarks, pictograms, and emblems. A brief overview of the history of nature and world, i.e. globe representations, exhausts the image inventory, which can be referred to for the representation of 'environment'. The environmental sign design, as it turns out, works with the rhetorical figures of pars pro toto and totum pro parte to graphically capture the cultural unity of /environment/ and /environmental protection/. Part II, the main part of the work, consists of the iconographic analysis and iconological interpretation of all national environmental signs according to the theory and method of Aby Warburg and Erwin Panofsky. In 30 chapters, information on design and designer, year of origin, image specifications, and intentions of the awarding institutions is compiled for each sign, and the pre-images and backgrounds are brought together for an iconographically-iconologically interpretation. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4270637-3>
Ritterliche Taten der Gewalt : Forms and Functions of Physical Violence in the Self-Understanding of German Chivalry in the Late Middle Ages ¤ In Ritterliche Taten der Gewalt befasst sich Florian Doerschel mit der kriegerischen Seite des deutschen Rittertums im Übergang vom Mittelalter zur Frühen Neuzeit. Das Rittertum ist nicht nur von Interesse, um das Selbstverständnis einer mit fortschreitendem Mittelalter zunehmend kleineren Gruppe zum Ritter geschlagener Manner zu untersuchen. ÜBer diese Manner und den Ritterstand hinaus entwickelte es eine ungeheure Strahlkraft: Ritterliche Normen pragten vom Kaiser bis hin zum einfachen Burger die mittelalterlichen Gesellschaften. Diese ritterliche Kultur druckte sich insbesondere durch das Selbstverstandnis aus, Krieger zu sein. Physische Gewalt diente somit nicht am Rand, sondern im Mittelpunkt sozialen, militarischen und politischen Lebens auch der Reprasentation und der Kommunikation. Die Studie stutzt sich in erster Linie auf Quellen biographischer und autobiographischer Natur, sogenannte 'Selbstzeugnisse'.In Ritterliche Taten der Gewalt (Chivalrous Violence) Florian Doerschel deals with the martial side of German chivalry during the transition from the Middle Ages to the Early Modern period. Chivalry is important not only for the self-image of the social group of knighted men, whose numbers declined over the course of the Middle Ages. An extraordinary power radiated from it: chivalrous norms shaped medieval societies as a whole, from Holy Roman Emperor to burgher. This knightly culture was especially expressed in the knight's self-understanding as warrior. Consequently, physical violence stood at the centre, not periphery, of representation and communication in social, military, and political life. The study is primarily based on biographical and autobiographical sources	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000464-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077575-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050152-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020832-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054438-2>
On the Relevance of Digitalization in Kindergartens: Perspectives of Pedagogical Professionals and (Vocational) Teachers in the Context of a Qualitative Interview Study ¤ Table of Contents: With a high development dynamics, digitalization is currently changing the life worlds of many people. Children are also growing up with digital media and devices and see them as self-evident components of their lives due to omnipresence. In this study, the relevance of the topic of digitalization in pedagogical work in kindergartens and in the school education of future educators is explored with a view to growing up in digital life worlds. At the same time, the focus is on where empirical gaps currently exist within this topic. The author Jaqueline Veenker studied teaching at vocational schools with a focus on social pedagogy at the Leuphana University. She was then enrolled as a scholarship holder at the University of Vechta. Currently, she is active as a vocational school teacher and as a lecturer at various universities. Her research and work focuses are in the context of early childhood, especially in the field of digitalization.

Investigations into the Annual Dynamics of a Coal Tit Population ¤ From the introduction: The number of coal tit breeding pairs that occupy certain biotopes annually varies significantly from year to year. The aim of this work is to determine the annual dynamics of a coal tit population in the Schlüchtern-Steinau area (Hesse) from 1972 to 1977. It should be shown, among other things, to what extent migrations (immigration and emigration) take place outside and at the beginning of the breeding season, and how strongly these breeding and winter populations are influenced. In order to achieve this, not only were breeding biological parameters recorded, but through intensive netting at feeding sites and through nocturnal checks of nesting cavities in winter, further important information was compiled. They are intended to show that the time outside the breeding period has been neglected to date and that decisive insights into the annual dynamics can only be achieved through an intensive study of this period.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046803-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164600-9>
Automated Extraction of Rhythmic Features for Application in Music-Information Retrieval Systems ¤ BEGIN The topic of this dissertation is the extraction of features that describe the rhythmic properties of audio signals. These features are selected for application in Music Information Retrieval (MIR) systems. Although extensive work has been done in the past on the extraction of rhythmic features such as tempo and time signature, current methods do not achieve the recognition performance of a trained listener. One of the reasons for this is believed to be the evaluation of information at different abstraction levels by humans, another is the consideration of musical prior knowledge. The approach described here is based on these analysis mechanisms. To identify suitable features and relevant aspects of human processing of sound signals, foundations from music theory, psychoacoustics, and cognitive science are explained. Known procedures for extracting rhythmic features are then explained in a detailed presentation of the state of the art. The main part of the work contains a collection of machine listening procedures that evaluate information at different abstraction levels. A compact representation of the metrical structure is presented to determine the metrical features. Since, on the one hand, the evaluation of low-level features only allows for the application of musical prior knowledge to a limited extent, and, on the other hand, the information at higher abstraction levels can restrict recognition performance in various situations due to their error-proneness, the results of the different procedures are combined into a total result depending on their confidence measures. The extraction of rhythmic features from the information of machine-detected percussive instruments represents a progress compared to known works. A segmentation into characteristic sections of the audio signal, which, for example, represent a verse or a refrain, is presented as a preprocessing step for analysis and the significant improvement in recognition performance achieved thereby is demonstrated. The performance of the procedures is evaluated using a comprehensive test dataset and the suitability of the extracted features in a MIR system is investigated.

The Domnick Residence and Collection House in Nürtingen: In the Context of 1960s Architecture ¤ Without a doubt, the Domnick Residence and Collection House in Nürtingen is one of the milestones of German architecture in the middle of the 20th century. The renowned Stuttgart architect Paul Stohrer leaves behind a distinctive and imposing architectural legacy with his work. It is characterized by the language of béton brut and the École de Paris in the wake of Le Corbusier, as well as the influence of museum and residential architecture. The Domnick Residence and Collection House, which is now publicly accessible and multifunctionally used, is particularly characterized by the preservation of the reputable and internationally recognized art collection of the Domnick couple. The present dissertation also helps to understand the ideological and social basis of an architectural development that made use of the economic breakthrough of those years.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135231-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072819-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>

Game-Based Abstraction of Markov Automata ¤ Abstract: Markov models are a widely used class of models that are applied in various application areas. The latest Markov models include Markov automata. They combine probabilities with nondeterminism, discrete time, continuous time, and cost or reward functions. This combination of properties allows complex real systems to be modeled using Markov automata. The analysis of time-bounded properties on Markov automata is of particular interest, as such properties can formulate security aspects. However, the analysis techniques of the previous Markov models cannot be transferred to Markov automata due to the presence of a mixture of discrete and continuous time. The current approach consists in using discretization for the analysis of time-bounded properties on Markov automata. However, this is time-intensive, which limits the size of the analyzable models. At this point, abstraction comes into play: The goal is to create a smaller model that can be analyzed faster and still has a sufficiently high accuracy. In this dissertation, the first abstraction procedure for this class of Markov models is presented using game-based abstraction of Markov automata.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135577-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026894-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129289-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122795-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4168927-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141162-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4267759-2>

Impact of gamification on individual's motivation and behavior ¤ The overall goal of the dissertation is the empirical evaluation of the effects of specific game elements on motivation and the subsequent behavior of individuals, taking into account individual characteristics. The self-determination theory serves as a theoretical foundation. In the first study in the context of education, the influence of specific game elements (badges, points, and leaderboard) on the learning motivation and learning performance of students is examined. The selected game elements have neither a direct effect on motivation nor an indirect effect on learning performance. In the second study in the context of market research, however, an influence on motivation and subsequent behavior was observed. A market research method (conjoint analysis) was gamified. Based on the results, this gamified method should be preferred to traditional conjoint methods without gamification.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040364-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062860-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1082245879>
Integrated Science : Development, Testing and Evaluation of a Project-Based Course ¤ Integrated scientific instruction, i.e. instruction without disciplinary subject boundaries, has been gaining educational policy significance again since the 1970s. On the one hand, didacticians, educators, and scientists have been dealing with integrated scientific instruction for years, where the topic is often divided into two camps by sometimes unscholarly discussions. On the other hand, the scientific subject combination has apparently played no role in current research work for over a decade. However, the fact is that realpolitik conditions and not educational theoretical findings all too often dictate the sense and establishment of integrated scientific instruction. Against this background, the importance of the didactic task field of integrated scientific instruction and the need for current research work are explained. How must an integrated scientific instruction be designed to do justice to each of the sub-disciplines? Can such a form of instruction sustainably strengthen student interest in science? Are first scientific competences conveyed in the subject combination? What opportunities and risks arise for scientific subject teachers through the introduction of an integrated scientific initial instruction? ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047445-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041425-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4768728-9>
NS-Plundered Goods and Restitution in Libraries - Training Contents for Information Professionals ¤ 60 years after the end of the Second World War and the Nazi regime, there is still NS-plundered goods in the holdings of German libraries. In the present bachelor's thesis, an overview of the topic of NS-plundered goods and restitution in libraries is developed. This is done with the goal of showing in the further course of the work how these contents can be integrated into the training of information professionals. After an introduction to the complex of topics, a status determination of the current handling of the topic within the training of information professionals at German universities is first carried out. Based on this, lecture contents are developed that are suitable for mediation in the training. The consideration of possible forms of mediation is also included.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5>
Crossover : Addressing Multiple Audiences in Text, Market, and Discourse ¤ Harry Potter, Edward Cullen, Katniss Everdeen – so are the literary heroes and heroines of our time. The international book market has been releasing more novels since Rowling's series that aim to appeal to both adults and children and young people. Why are certain texts read by different generations? Is this reception built into the texts or is it controlled by the market? In comparative analyses, procedures are broken down that address texts to a diverse audience by age. In this process, a tradition is traced back – from «The Adventures of Tom Sawyer» (1876) and «Treasure Island» (1883) over «Krabat» (1971) and «The Neverending Story» (1976) to «The Book Thief» (2005) and «Tschick» (2010). At the center of the intersection of discourse, market, and text, a literary phenomenon emerged that depicts and shapes changed concepts of age and that with «Harry Potter» experienced its highest level of success so far.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124854-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035441-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7554819-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200587-5>
Procedural Privileging for Public Reasons: A Comparative, Systematic Examination of German and French Administrative Procedure Regulations using the Example of a Network Booster ¤ Foundations -- Existing selected Privilegations in Germany -- Selected procedural peculiarities of French law and their comparison to German law -- Transferability of the results of systematization and country comparison to the approval situation of network boosters and final consideration. This work illuminates the procedural promotion of climate-friendly projects that can help meet the particularly pressing infrastructure development needs. To this end, the author examines the existing procedural privileges in German and French law for public reasons and draws conclusions for improving legislation. The focus of the consideration is on the procedure for the approval of so-called network boosters, which are large battery storage systems that are intended to balance short-term fluctuations in the power grid. Network boosters are of importance not least in connection with the expansion of wind energy. The book analyzes and systematizes indirect and direct procedural privileges in environmental and planning law and points out areas of action and possibilities for improvement for the legislator. The author focuses on the Commission nationale du débat public (CNDP) and the public debate (débat public) organized by it, as well as the accelerated expropriation procedure for public reasons (L'expropriation pour cause d'utilité publique en extrême urgence) in French law. The comparative law provides a basis for a reform discussion. The author Ilka Dörrfuß studied law at the Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg. During her clerkship, she completed her election station at the IKEM. Her doctorate was completed at the German University of Public Administration in Speyer. At the time of publication of the dissertation, she is active in the state administration of the state of Baden-Württemberg.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014722-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020046-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117369-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014224-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132797-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004687-4>
Automated Opinion Manipulation : Protecting the Communication Process in Social Online Networks ¤ Der Einsatz automatisierter Accounts in sozialen Online-Netzwerken, oftmals als »Social Bots« oder »Political Bots« bezeichnet, erregte im Vorfeld verschiedener politischer Großereignisse internationale Aufmerksamkeit und markiert einen Höhepunkt der voranschreitenden Digitalisierung des Politischen. Die durch die Automatisierung entstehende Möglichkeit zur praktisch unbegrenzten Verbreitung einzelner Meinungen schafft das Risiko einer Manipulation der Meinungsbildung von Rezipienten und folglich einer Verzerrung des Kommunikationsprozesses. Lennart Laude untersucht den Einsatz der neuen Kommunikationsmittel mit Fokus auf die Interpretation des Art. 5 Abs. 1 GG und legt dar, welche rechtliche Bewertung für Versuche automatisierter Meinungsbeeinflussung angezeigt ist. The digitalization of the political is advancing inexorably and is leading to radical changes in communication. Through the automation of accounts in social networks (»social bots«), individual opinions can be disseminated virtually limitlessly.

Bildende Spiele : procedural encoding of educational content in computer games. ¤ Zentrale Annahme dieser Arbeit ist es, dass Computerspiele sich in besonderem Maße durch ihre algorithmische Komponente auszeichnen, und diese Komponente deshalb auch bei der Nutzung als pädagogische Methode in den Vordergrund rücken sollte. Ausgehend von der prozeduralen Rhetorik Ian Bogosts werden dessen Quellen, insbesondere die Serious Games von Clark Abt und die konzeptuellen Metaphern von George Lakoff & Mark Johnson, mit pädagogischem Blick erweitert. Als Ergebnis wird ein Modell vorgestellt, das den Schwerpunkt pädagogischer Handlungsmöglichkeiten in der prozeduralen Ebene verortet. The central assumption of this work is that computer games are particularly characterized by their algorithmic component and that this component should therefore also be focussed on when employing computer games as an educational method. Based on the procedural rhetorics of Ian Bogost, his sources, are traced and expanded with an educational perspective. As a result, a model is presented that locates the focus of educational options on the procedural respective algorithmic level. A collection of procedures is worked out for the concrete encoding of learning objectives.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074167-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074166-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4010457-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075001-2>
The Person with Unknown Residence in Civil Procedure : Procedural Questions in an International Context ¤ The localization of persons, in particular of parties, plays a significant role in German civil proceedings, for example when it comes to formal requirements for pleadings, the determination of the internationally or locally competent court, and the service of pleadings. The non-localizability of a person can therefore hinder the course of a civil proceeding in many ways. Nevertheless, a comprehensive processing of the complex of issues is still lacking. The present investigation is intended to close this gap in part. After examining various terms for the localization of persons and evaluating existing norms that deal with the problem (e.g. § 185 No. 1 and No. 2 ZPO), the focus of the work is on systematically investigating still open questions in relation to the mentioned problem areas. In this, the problematic cases are first worked out and then as generalizable as possible solutions are developed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015288-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067911-1>
Herrschaftspraxis and Fief Relationships of the Landgraves of Thuringia 1382-1440 ¤ BEGIN The late medieval fief system offers great research potential in its abundance of sources. The study shows that the Wettin landgraves of Thuringia used it mainly for the expansion and consolidation of their own territorial rule. The study examines the importance of the fief system with regard to the expansion of rule and the consolidation of territorial rule by the Wettin landgraves of Thuringia between 1382 and 1440. The Wettiners saw themselves in the exercise of their rule confronted with a strong nobility, which like the princes themselves had a well-developed noble self-awareness. In order to assert their territorial rule and integrate the nobility into their own rule of association, the fief system offered a suitable means. The study draws a distinctly defined picture of the late medieval fief system, which also provides a unique insight into the nobility landscape of the Thuringian landgraviate and its expanded regions.

The Fabrication of the City : A Reorientation of Urban Sociology after Bruno Latour ¤ From Bruno Latour's French sociological demand to consider practical disciplines and their objects, a reorientation of urban sociology can be derived. Jessica Wilde shows how such a sociology departs from human society as a vanishing point of theoretical thinking and programmatically repositions itself as a technology-, urban construction-, architecture-, planning-, and design sociology. She tracks the urban artifacts - from the traffic cone to the zoning plan - down to the workshops of planning and designing professionals and makes 'the fabrication of the city' the subject of sociological research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7539965-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077811-3>
Aesthetics, Politics, and Shi'ite Representations in Contemporary Iran ¤ In 'Aesthetics, Politics, and Shi'ite Representations in Contemporary Iran' Christian Funke shows the entanglements of politics, protest, and Shi'ite materiality in the Islamic Republic. The book illustrates in a vivid and multifaceted way how the protests of 2009 and the ?Green Movement? were linked to broader discourses on democracy, identity, history, and presence as well as religion and politics. Funke's argument is based on interviews and intensive field research and encompasses a broad field of topics ranging from colors to banknotes to urban space planning. Funke offers a new approach to the theory and methodology of religious aesthetics and sheds new light on the ?Green Movement? by revealing the Islamic resources through which its protest was articulated	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4052455-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4226404-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046514-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115439-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137492-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049396-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4666193-1>
Robust Active Sound Reduction in Aircraft ¤ Due to the demands on comfort and occupational safety, soundproofing measures are an essential component of every technical system. Active sound reduction technology is increasingly being used for this purpose. It is based on the principle of interference between the noise field and a secondary sound field. An application example is the active system in the loadmaster area of the Airbus A400M. The goal is to achieve a robust sound pressure reduction at the loadmaster's head.--- To solve the problem, parameters in the form of weighting matrices are introduced into the control algorithm. For the design of these weighting matrices, a new procedure is developed, which takes into account the measured uncertainties. For this purpose, quality measures are formulated for control stability and quality. These capture the controller quality. Subsequently, this is optimized using a genetic algorithm.--- The methodology is applied to a mock-up of the loadmaster area of the Airbus A400M. Experiments show that the robust sound pressure reduction is increased by up to 7 dB in this case. The presented design methodology solves the problem alone through controller parameters, expensive repositioning of speakers and microphones is eliminated. This increases sound pressure reduction under operating conditions and reduces development costs.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154784-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4451322-7>

The Hero and His Weather : An Artistic Device and Its Ideological Use in the Novel of Bourgeois Realism ¤ Blurb: "This book deals with the ideological use of an artistic device in Poetic Realism, with the German-language literary counterparts of the phenomenon we all know, that it always rains in Hollywood at the dramatic end. Why, asks Delius, does it also rain in German Realism when the tragedy is inevitable? And why does Homer's sun always laugh at the future-conscious citizens of these bourgeois novels? To track down the ideology in the midst of supposedly realistic literature, to provide evidence with the small indicators - already the Germanist Delius has shown cleverly and keenly how to do it. It has become a kind of Ur-scene in his work."

Protection of Public Procurement Law in the Tension Field between Acceleration Requirement and Granting of Effective Legal Protection ¤ The German Law on public procurement remedies, implementing the EU Remedies Directives into national law, has to engage in a balancing act between effective legal protection of bidders and the necessary acceleration of the award procedure. The book develops solutions for conflicts between the abovementioned opposing interests, which are consistent with the pluralistic paradigm of the European legal area, and the standards of assessment of the EU primary substantive law on public procurement. The Europeanisation of the German Law on public procurement remedies is analysed in detail. The work deals with the establishment and improvement of effective legal protection of bidders on the one hand and, on the other hand, shows that the acceleration of the award procedure within the framework of the procedural system is bounded by the rule of law. The book carves out strengths and deficits of the German Law on public procurement remedies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7574511-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048835-4>
Early Childhood Caries and Associated Risk Factors in Preschool Children in the State of Brandenburg ¤ The aim of the study was to capture the caries incidence in a representative sample of 13-36 month-old children in the state of Brandenburg in relation to the health behavior and social status of the parents. For this purpose, 661 children from 10 districts, who were cared for in day-care centers or by day mothers/fathers, were examined according to the WHO standard (1997) by calibrated dentists of the public health service during the school year 2009/2010. The health behavior and social status of the parents were recorded using questionnaires and anonymized and assigned to the oral health findings of the children. The caries prevalence was 7.4% on the level of enamel caries (d1-4) and 5.3% on the level of dentin caries (d3-4). The caries incidence was 0.3 d1-4mft/ 0.2 d3-4mft. The SiC index was 0.8 (± 2.0) d1-4mft. 2% of the children accounted for 52% of the caries incidence. Only 19.9% of the teeth were restored and 10% were filled. Since no significant differences in the sub-sample with parental survey regarding the age and gender distribution, caries prevalence and distribution of dmft values to the total population existed, the sample represents the oral health of preschool children in the 10 districts of the state of Brandenburg. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that 25-36 month-old children, children with low social status or nocturnal bottle feeding had a significantly higher caries risk (OR 3.84, p=0.005; OR 7.34, p<0.0001; OR 2.4, p=0.022) than younger children, children with high social status and without bottle feeding. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031081-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029669-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050131-0>
Mentalizing in Residential Care: A Qualitative Investigation of Reflective Processes in Educational Professionals ¤ Introduction -- The Mentalization Concept -- Residential Care -- Mentalizing and Residential Care -- State of Research -- Research Gap -- Methodological Approach -- Results -- Conclusion from the Results -- Bibliography. The book is intended as a contribution to mentalization-based pedagogy, which, as a relatively young pedagogical concept, follows the premise that a reflective framework is established through a mentalizing attitude of professionals, contributing to professional action in pedagogical work with burdened children and adolescents. Within the framework of a qualitative research design, mentalization-focused case discussions were conducted in a stationary youth welfare institution and investigated with regard to mentalization processes and their conditioning factors. The results show that successful mentalization processes are initiated both by the professionals themselves and by the researcher's reflective interventions. Failed mentalization processes were mostly seen in conflicts among the professionals or when discussing injuries and boundary transgressions by the cared-for adolescents. From the findings, implications for the design of mentalization-focused case discussions in residential care are derived in the form of guidelines, a guide, and a question collection. The author Noëlle Behringer is a psychologist, state-recognized social pedagogue, and graduated from the Pedagogical University of Ludwigsburg in the field of emotional-social development.

Zarah De Luca-Hellwig closes a crucial research gap in the field of gender rhetoric by proving the heterogeneity of gender classes in terms of the use of performative, argumentative or stylistic means. At the same time, she addresses the question of where the deeply ingrained belief in gender difference in everyday understanding comes from. Through the examination of existing theoretical concepts using empirical investigations, the author concludes that gender stereotypes are primarily addressed and perpetuated from the recipient side.

Nonmetric multidimensional scaling of complex sounds : dimensions of preference ratings and perceived similarity of vehicle noises ¤ The present study aims to determine the number of psychologically significant judgment dimensions of preference and similarity judgments for the same set of vehicle interior noises and to identify the underlying physical parameters as such. From the non-metric MDS of 15 x 15 proximity matrices, 2D representations were determined. Dimensional and non-dimensional analyses of rating judgments have yielded two judgment dimensions - each interpretable as loudness and rhythm. The variance analysis revealed the explanation of 82% of the total variance by 3 dimensions for the preference judgments, 65.7% on PrefDimI, 9.6% on PrefDimII, and 7% on PrefDimIII. The similarity judgments, on the other hand, account for 80% of the total variance. Each 47.8% of the total variance is explained by SimDimI, 23.5% by SimDimII, and 7.9% by SimDimIII. The correlation coefficient of 0.694 between PrefDimI and SimDimI suggests that both are based on the same judgment criterion. Between PrefDimII and SimDimII, a correlation coefficient of 0.289 is obtained, which is not statistically significant. The statistical analysis allows the statement that the maximum peak represents a common cause of preference and similarity judgments. In this case, the maximum peak is solely effective for preference judgments; on the other hand, sharpness is responsible for an additional influence on the similarity mechanism. The correlation coefficient of 0.846 between SimDimI and the maximum peak, the correlation coefficient of 0.661 between SimDimII and sharpness, and the correlation coefficient of 0.919 between PrefDimI and the maximum peak are each significant. Between sharpness - measured in acum - and PrefDimII, no significant correlation was obtained. <dt.>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125741-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075090-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141478-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129296-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165435-3>
Observation of Structural Changes and Restriction Analysis of Individual DNA Molecules in the Fluorescence Microscope ¤ This work describes the direct observation of structural changes and enzyme reactions on individual DNA molecules in a conventional fluorescence microscope. The marked DNA is coupled to a microsphere, which serves as a "grip" to hold the molecule with an optical tweezers and thus allows the selection of an individual DNA molecule. The stretching of a molecule and the observation of the subsequent relaxation enable the investigation of its structural dynamics. The analysis of enzymatic reactions occurs after microinjection of a restriction endonuclease into the environment of a stretched molecule and the distribution characterized by its microfluidity. It is described the sequence-independent binding of restriction endonucleases to DNA, followed by a linear diffusion of the enzyme along the DNA. Furthermore, a distinction of individually selected similar DNA is shown through its characteristic fragment pattern after restriction with a known endonuclease.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183788-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070512-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039972-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4290958-2>

Supply-Chain Coordination in the Run-Out Phase in the Automotive Industry: Coordination Model Based on Progress Numbers for Decentralized Planning with Central Information Provision ¤ In the automotive industry, an increasing number of models are being brought to market in increasingly shorter times. Consequently, both the number of runs in production and the run-outs are constantly increasing. Since the demand for run-out models is highly uncertain, significant disposal costs for over-ordered materials can arise. This problem in the run-out phase has been hardly noticed and examined in research and practice so far. Ralph Ostertag first conducts an in-depth analysis of the problem situation, also taking into account contractual framework conditions.

Trousers, female : Cultural history of women's trousers ¤ Some commotion was caused by G. Wolter in 1988, when she published a cultural history of the male lower garment (BA 12/88) and discovered the zeitgeist in various ways. The topic has continued to occupy her, in 1993 she graduated from FU Berlin with this work on women's trousers. Equally rich and diverse, she follows this garment through social and costume history, in which the sharp and almost still valid distinction between women's and men's clothing was made in the Middle Ages. Particularly curious today are several news reports from the 60s, when working women were asked to dress 'decently' because of their trousers, flight attendants of Lufthansa were denied trousers suits, or Senta Berger was denied entry to a London hotel in a trouser suit. In addition to the cultural historical aspect, also a contribution to the history of emancipation. (2) (Hans-Jürgen Zimmermann) Rich and diverse, the author follows this garment through social and costume history, at the same time also a contribution to the history of emancipation.

So will I escape ¤ Italy was initially the land that united pleasure and education for Freud, later also a place where all longings and fears unfolded. Marina D’Angelo makes the fascinating way of Freud’s travel description the core of this first comprehensive study of his 25 Italian trips from 1895 to 1923. When Freud dreams of escaping the worries of his Viennese homeland to Rome with a 'Punch with Lethe' or reports on the 'libido freed by the loss of Italy', we look impressively into his inner world on travels. D’Angelo reveals Freud's travel impressions and their context from a psychoanalytic and literary perspective. At the same time, she also shows, using previously unpublished Freud texts, how the trips affected the development of psychoanalysis: from the 17 'Italian' dreams of dream interpretation to the discovery of the parapraxis, the importance of Rome and Pompeii as a plastic representation of the unconscious, the essays of applied psychoanalysis on Leonardo and Michelangelo's Moses to the experience of the 'uncanny'.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049275-8>
The Implementation of Corresponding Taxation in German Tax Law: A Systematic Examination of Switch-Over-, Subject-to-Tax-, and Correspondence Clauses ¤ Introduction -- Conceptual Foundation -- Corresponding Taxation Provisions -- Cross-Norm Examination -- Summary. In recent years, an increasing number of regulations have been created that make tax relief for a taxpayer dependent on how the underlying fact pattern is treated abroad. This is intended to correct a cross-border undesired non- or low-taxation. However, a systematic examination of these correspondence rules is still lacking. Upon closer inspection, there is not even a common understanding of the correspondence concept. The work therefore leads to a general and abstract definition of the tax correspondence concept under a fundamental engagement with the literature and subjects the provisions of the German income tax law intended for corresponding taxation to a uniform analytical framework for the first time. In this detailed examination, numerous questions of doubt are compactly discussed and resolved with comprehensible arguments. The uniform structure also shows significant differences in the various provisions. Consequently, general standards for the design of corresponding taxation provisions and possibilities for harmonization and further development of existing correspondence regulations are presented. The author Gary Rüsch is a research assistant at the Institute for Tax Law at the University of Cologne.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113470-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4239913-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012744-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121725-1>
Sex Work as a Transnational Zone of Precarity: Migrating Sex Workers in the Field of Power Experiences and Action Options ¤ Sex work is a multifaceted, complex, and heterogeneous field of action and knowledge, which is at the same time traversed by various ambivalences and moral imperatives in everyday life and in science. The aim of this study is, based on 21 interviews with migrating sex workers from various countries, to reconstruct on the one hand the spectrum of power constellations and violence relationships that condition their living and working situations, and on the other hand to depict their action options and capacities as social actors in the context of transnational mobility.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7729679-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7544915-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140334-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020832-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130642-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7590592-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002641-3>
Integrating local scale drainage measures in meso scale hydrological modelling of backwater affected catchments ¤ Diese Arbeit erläutert die Entwicklung, Implementierung und Evaluierung von Methoden zur Behebung von Mängeln in der hydrologischen numerischen Modellierung von lokalwirkenden Entwässerungsmaßnahmen in rückstaubeeinflussten meso-skaligen Einzugsgebieten. Der Bedarf erwächst unter Anderem aus der Nachfrage zur Analyse der Wirksamkeit von Anpassungsmaßnahmen zur Minderung von Überflutungen auf regionaler Skala. Behobene Mängel in aktuellen numerischen Modellen umfassen (1) eine erforderliche flexible raum-zeitliche Auflösung, (2) eine physikalisch-basierte Parametrisierung, (3) hydrologische Methoden zur Modellierung von Rückstaueffekten und (4) Ansätze zur Generierung hydrologischer Netzpläne. This work presents the development, implementation and evaluation of methods to overcome limitations in the hydrological numerical modelling of local scale drainage measures in backwater affected meso scale catchments. The demand arises, among others, by the need to analyse the performance of local adaptation measures to mitigate the magnitude of flooding on a regional scale. In current hydrological numerical models, resolved limitations include (1) a required flexible spatio-temporal resolution in the methods, (2) a physical-based parametrisation to model processes in local scale measures, (3) hydrological methods to model backwater effects and (4) approaches to generate hydrological networks.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152427-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4382289-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4264174-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121721-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170297-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4236112-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151469-5>
Wilhelm Genazino's Novel Figures: Theoretical and (Literary-)Psychological Approaches to Action Motivation and Impression Control ¤ Wilhelm Genazino's novel figures form the key to understanding his 'figure novels'.

Strangers : on the figure of the migrant woman from (post)socialist countries in contemporary German-language literature ¤ With the fall of the Iron Curtain and the end of communism, extensive migration movements set in within Europe. These 'East-West' migrations have found their way into contemporary German-language literature on multiple occasions. In literary research, the aspect of 'migration' has been studied only sporadically so far. The present study is the first to address the triadic complex of 'gender, migration, and (post)socialism' and examines different migration narratives at the intersection of gender studies, postcolonial studies, and newer cultural theories: Herta Müller's	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4694656-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050479-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1096832496>
Why Climate Protection Anyway? : On the Justification of Climate Policy ¤ Statt die Notwendigkeit von Klimaschutz schlicht festzusetzen widmet sich das Buch zunächst umfassend der Begründung von Klimapolitik mit ethischen Argumenten. Nach einigen Vorüberlegungen werden aus der gängigen liberalen Begründungspraxis Kriterien einer überzeugenden Rechtfertigung gewonnen. Anhand dieser wird exemplarisch die utilitaristische Herangehensweise Bernward Gesangs mit dem diskursethisch fundierten Menschenrechtsansatz Felix Ekardts verglichen und sich schließlich für eine Lesart des Klimaschutzes als Menschenrechtsschutz ausgesprochen. Die zweite Hälfte des Buches behandelt dann ausführlich Abwägungen klimaethisch relevanter Prinzipien und Aspekte, wie sie etwa bei der Konkretisierung des Pariser Abkommens zu berücksichtigen wären. Neben den dabei zentralen Bereichen der intergenerationellen und der globalen Gerechtigkeit werden auch Fragen der Inklusion, der Individual- sowie der Tier- und Naturethik beleuchtet. Instead of simply stating the necessity to tackle climate change this book seeks for an ethic justification of a strong policy of mitigation and adaptation. After some preliminary considerations it gains criteria of a possibly successful justification from common practices of justification in liberal societies. An exemplary comparison of an utilitarian and a discourse ethics-based human-rights-approach leads to the claim that climate change should be addressed as a threat to fundamental human rights. The book´s second half then outlines and discusses important principles, aspects and views of the debate about climate ethics, which might be considered when further developing the Paris Agreement. Not only issues of intergenerational and global justice are covered but also those of inclusion and individual ethics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547705-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020310-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194901-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4290733-0>
Health Management for Consulting Firms: Effect of Sport and Stress on Mental Health and Value Creation ¤ Stress phenomenon in the context of knowledge-based activities -- Sports activity as a resource -- Sports activity and chronic stress -- Business aspects for health management The goal of the work is the development and validation of the value-oriented model for strategic health management in consulting firms (WOGE model), in order to investigate the relationships between the health constitution of consultants and their value creation. Special focus is placed on the evaluation of sports activity as a central health-promoting resource and on the examination of the required sports quota to achieve health-promoting effects.

Teaching in the Field of Global Development: Competence Acquisition and its Conditions ¤ In this qualitative empirical study, teaching in the field of Global Development was investigated with the question of the acquisition and construction processes of students that occur in school lessons on topics of the field of Global Development. What and how do young people learn in different teaching and learning arrangements? Competence areas can be identified with which they are confronted when dealing with global issues in lessons. The handling of non-knowledge, the handling of perspective and with action requests are the three reconstructed competence areas, for which different expressions could be observed. It shows that these expressions emerge in dependence on different conditions in the teaching and learning arrangements. More open, competence-oriented teaching and learning arrangements promote competence acquisition in the sense of competences.

Social Capital Brought to Language: A Meaning-Theoretical Perspective on a Social Science Concept and Theory Problem ¤ The debate on social capital has been in vogue in science, economy, and politics for quite some time. Looking at the studies, social capital seems to be good for almost everything: whether it's the improvement of personal well-being, the revitalization of disadvantaged city quarters, or the strengthening of the economy in the globalized competition for locations - the more social capital, the better! However, it is precisely the claimed broad range of effects that should prompt conceptual and theoretical caution. What is the subject of scientists' knowledge-seeking efforts when social capital is being discussed? This question sounds trivial, but has not been systematically addressed or satisfactorily answered so far, although numerous contributions to the concept debate are available. Although the problem has been named in the social sciences, it has not been resolved within the specific framework of social science reflection. The present book takes up the hitherto neglected meta-linguistic perspective. It thus increases the scientific maturity of the social capital debate and contributes to the establishment of a well-founded system of social science concepts. It brings social capital to language by working out a specification of the object area through a combination of epistemological and ontological analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4510173-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005248-5>

The Conspiratorial Thinking: A Societal Deconstruction of Reality ¤ Conspiratorial thinking deals with conspiracy theories. It is about narratives that address the discrepancy between appearance and reality, between surface and truth. So far, there have been predominantly popular science publications on this topic, which neither approach it impartially nor capture its entire cultural complexity. Therefore, it is the goal of the present study to present a scientifically sound confrontation. Conspiracy theories distrust the appearance of the surface. They suspect a conspiratorial activity behind it. Historically, two cultural currents must be distinguished: demonological and conspiratorial thinking. Demonological conspiracy theories argue – with a view to their own social structure – centrifugally, that is, outwardly: it is the demons and the socially weak, the outsiders and foreigners, the homeless and refugees, the non-believers and those who look different, who are suspected. In contrast, conspiratorial thinking is criticism of the establishment. The suspicion is directed centripetally against one's own institutions: do the institutional representatives actually act in the interest of all? The digitalization of the media landscape has promoted this conspiratorial mood. Even many political election speeches – and not just since Donald Trump – argue with a mixture of conspiratorial accusations and demonological fears. Conspiratorial thinking should, however, neither be prematurely circumscribed politically nor sociologically. For it does not necessarily have to be an expression of extremist worldviews. Such a pathologization is neither sustainable nor fruitful from a cultural-scientific perspective. In the tradition of Georg Simmel's impressionistic sociology, the present book attempts to analyze and deconstruct conspiracy theories in a value-neutral manner, in order to provide further research with a useful heuristic instrument.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133431-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123065-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138784-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4149032-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020588-5>
The Business Plan in Theory and Practice: Considerations on a Central Instrument of German Start-up Promotion ¤ Business plans in scientific discussion and practical application -- Newer approaches in entrepreneurship -- Optimization approaches for start-up promotion. Stefanie Lahn approaches the question from different perspectives, to what extent the goals of start-up promotion can be achieved with the instrument business plan. She finds that only a part of the entrepreneurial process is covered. The heterogeneity of company foundations, their context dependence, and the importance of creativity in the entrepreneurial process and in the development of new business models are largely neglected. All this suggests an overestimation of the business plan instrument in start-up promotion practice. Thus, it is questionable whether start-up promotion achieves its goals or rather potential in this area remains untapped.

Das Indernet : a critical internet ethnography of racism ¤ In the year 2000, three young men founded the internet portal »Indernet« - a German-speaking space of »Indians of the second generation« for »Indians of the second generation«. Based on the material they collected over 17 years, Urmila Goel presents in her ethnography three mosaics of this virtual space: She describes how the different parts of the portal (articles, forum, guestbook, etc.) were used and outlines the development steps of the community portal from its founding to its move to Web 2.0. In doing so, she critically analyzes how the »Indernet« became a space of national-ethnic-cultural (multiple) belonging and which exclusions accompanied this.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026482-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026711-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1071012568> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4431631-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7548364-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4365362-5>
Unfulfilled Child Wishes and Reproductive Medicine: A Socioscientific Analysis of Couples in Fertility Treatment ¤ For a societal debate on the importance and realization of a child wish, current knowledge about individual motivations and decision-making factors, generated in studies like this one, is indispensable. Gen-ethics Information Service 8/2017 It is a high-quality dissertation with a well-made study and interesting research results. Socialnet.de, 26.06.2017 Who are the couples who turn to reproductive medicine? How is fertility treatment embedded in the life courses of the couples? How does the decision-making process for the use of reproductive medicine occur at the couple level? The author addresses these questions. A theoretical explanatory model is presented, by means of which partner-based generative behavior in the presence of infertility can be analyzed from a distinctly socioscientific perspective. This forms the basis for the empirical investigation. The data of a survey conducted specifically with couples in fertility treatment are used as the basis for the analyses.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125352-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124813-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197011-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7526855-3>
The Cultural Property Protective Effect of the Due Diligence Obligations of Art and Cultural Goods Dealers under the Cultural Property Protection Act: An Effect-Oriented Analysis of Selected Trade-Related Instruments of the CPPO ¤ The Cultural Property Protection Act (CPPO) regulates, in addition to the classical matters of cultural property protection – emigration protection and the right of return – also the trade in cultural goods. In particular, the CPPO first establishes a ban on trade in relation to cultural objects as well as so-called due diligence obligations, which are generally to be fulfilled before any cultural goods are put into circulation. -- The work deals with the question of what contribution the due diligence obligations and the associated trade ban can make to cultural property protection. Based on a general analysis of the functions of trade-related measures within the framework of cultural property protection, it is investigated whether the corresponding instruments of the CPPO can find a place within this framework. The work shows that an effective trade-related cultural property protection is conceivable. In doing so, it reveals the special importance and the effectiveness of trade-related measures for the protection of archaeological cultural goods.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165975-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4181859-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033647-5>
AlGaN/GaN Layer Systems for Piezoelectrically Excited Resonators ¤ Due to the increasing demands for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) in terms of stability, miniaturization, and integration, interest in new material systems such as wide-bandgap semiconductors is growing. The present work is divided into two focal points that had to be overcome for the production of GaN-based MEMS: Firstly, the growth on selectively etchable substrates for GaN was investigated. In the present work, three substrates are presented, which allow both the epitaxial growth of GaN and the release of the structure. This includes the use of 4H-SiC as a substrate, which has recently been found to be isotropically etchable. Secondly, the epitaxial growth of GaN on nanocrystalline, sputtered AlN sacrificial layers is shown, which enables MEMS production on sapphire. In the last case, growth on silicon substrates is performed with the help of a 3C-SiC intermediate layer. The piezoelectric properties of (GaN/)AlGaN/GaN heterostructures were in the second focal point. The AlGaN layer and in some cases an additional GaN capping layer serve as a piezoelectrically active layer. The high-conductive 2D electron gas (2DEG) at the lower AlGaN/GaN interface provides the required return electrode for excitation. With the help of electroreflection, the electric field distribution was determined as a function of the applied electric voltage. In combination with piezoforce microscopy, in which the voltage-dependent deflection of the layers was investigated, the piezoelectric module d33 for Al0.31Ga0.69N was reliably determined to be 5 pm/V. Finally, the processing of the first GaN-based MEMS is presented on all three substrates previously introduced, demonstrating the vibration behavior for piezoelectric excitation of transverse vibrations with the help of vibrometer measurements as well as the purely electrical readout of longitudinal vibrations (also for piezoelectric excitation).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4282756-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131574-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174671-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4314628-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4375592-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127559-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4236378-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4824724-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155888-1>
Electromagnetic modeling and optimization of through silicon vias ¤ This thesis presents the simulation and the design of vertical interconnects in silicon substrates known as through silicon vias (TSVs) which are applied as a component of 3D integration of integrated circuits. Numerical methods of comparably high efficiency are developed and applied in order to simulate the electromagnetic properties of large realistic arrays of TSVs. The proposed methods are correlated with alternative methods and parameter variations are carried out to derive design guidelines. Further, several test structures with TSVs are developed and the measurement results are correlated with the results from electromagnetic simulations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154023-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077445-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4624011-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055072-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4150891-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4218841-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019627-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4280299-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4312216-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169321-8>
Characterisation and engineering of plastic-degrading enzymes ¤ Biokatalyse, Proteindesign, High throughput screening, Biosensor, High-throughput assay, PET, PET Hydrolases, Protein Engineering This thesis deals with the characterisation and engineering of new thermophilic PET hydrolases as potential candidates for an eco-friendly biocatalytic recycling approach for the upcycling or downcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) on industrial scale. Furthermore, high-throughput screening methods are described that detect the products of PET hydrolysis. The high demand of PET in the packaging and textile industries with a global production of 82 million metric tons per year has significantly contributed to the global solid waste stream and environmental plastic pollution after its end-of-life. Although PET hydrolases have been identified in various microorganisms, only a handful of benchmark enzymes have been engineered for industrial applications. Therefore, the identification of new PET hydrolases from metagenomes or via protein engineering approaches, especially thermophilic PET hydrolases with optimal operating temperatures (i.e., increased thermostability and activity) near the glass transition temperature of the polymer PET, is a crucial step towards a bio-based circular plastic economy. Article I demonstrates that metagenome-derived thermophilic PET hydrolases can be significantly improved using different engineering approaches to achieve a similar activity level as the well-established leaf-branch-compost cutinase (LCC) F243I/D238C/S283C/Y127G variant (LCC ICCG). In Article II, thermostable variants of a mesophilic enzyme (PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis) ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160916-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076573-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133597-1>
Quantification of soil structural heterogeneity and its impact on flow and transport ¤ Flow and transport in the subsurface are determined by the structural heterogeneity of natural porous media. Connectivity is known to be an important facet of structural heterogeneity that has to be captured adequately in order to facilitate or improve model predictions on diverse physical processes in porous formations. This thesis presents some novel insights into the approaches to quantify structural connectivity and the complex relationship between structural and functional connectivity in the realm of vadose zone hydrology. Functional connectivity is expressed as effective hydraulic behavior with respect to stationary flow, solute transport and hydraulic non-equilibrium during infiltration. Numerical simulations demonstrate that a good reproduction of structural connectivity also entails a good reproduction of functional connectivity metrics.

The United States and the transatlantic slave trade to the Americas, 1776-1867 ¤ While much of modern scholarship has focused on the American slave trade's impact within the United States, considerably less has addressed its effects in other parts of the Americas. A rich analysis of a complex subject, this study draws on Portuguese, Brazilian, and Spanish primary documents--as well as English-language material--to shed new light on the changing behavior of slave traders and their networks, particularly to Brazil and Cuba. Slavery in these nations, Marques describes, contributed to the mounting tensions that would ultimately lead to the US Civil War. Taking a truly Atlantic perspective, Marques outlines the multiple forms of US involvement in this traffic amid various legislation and shifting international relations, exploring the global processes that shaped the history of this participation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4198287-3>
Modernism in late-Mao China : architecture for foreign affairs in Beijing, Guangzhou and overseas, 1969-1976 ¤ This book investigates the architectural history of China in the Mao era (1949-1976), focusing on the rise of modernism in the last seven years of the Cultural Revolution from 1969 to 1976. It highlights the new architecture of this period, exemplified by three clusters of buildings for foreign affairs, namely buildings for foreign diplomacy in Beijing, buildings for foreign trade in Guangzhou and China's foreign aid projects overseas.The emergence of new architecture in the early 1970s is closely associated with China's political and diplomatic shift of the time, from a radical emphasis on ideological struggle to a dynamic balance between leftist ideology and pragmatic concerns. In this context, China's relations with the West quickly improved, culminating with American president Richard Nixon's visit to China in 1972. The increasing foreign affairs brought new opportunities to Chinese architects who referenced both Western modernism and Chinese architectural traditions to create a new version of Chinese modernism. The book brings dimensions of form, politics and knowledge to the analysis of architecture, to construct an understanding of architectural design as an aesthetic, political and intellectual practice.Modernism in Late-Mao China will be an enriching and useful reference for students and scholars who are interested in the global architectural history of the twentieth century, especially Cold War modernism	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120507-8>
Treatment of solid wood with silanes, polydimethylsiloxanes and silica sols ¤ The study can be divided into three sections. In the first section, wood was treated with different commercially available silica sols of varying pH and surface modification. While alkaline silica sols could not be impregnated into the wood due to lowering of pH and precipitation, neutral and acidic silica sols showed good penetration. One of the tested silica sols with an acidic pH value and cationic surface modified with aluminum-oxychloride reduced water uptake and fungal decay due to incubation with the brown rot fungus Coniophora puteana (pine sapwood) and the white rot fungus Trametes...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4332403-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4401682-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4181296-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175157-7>

Treaty overriding : a contribution to the constitutional admissibility of treaty-overriding federal laws ¤ BEGIN: The deliberate breach of international treaties by the legislator raises a number of constitutional questions. Martin Schäfer considers, inter alia, whether the German constitution's often-cited openness to international law and the principle of separation of powers pose an obstacle to the practice of treaty overriding. How does German constitutional law relate to the question of whether the Bundestag is bound by international treaties in its legislative activity? Martin Schäfer examines this and shows how »friendly« the Basic Law is towards international law. How does a possible binding of the legislator to international treaties relate to his freedom, guaranteed by the democratic principle, to withdraw or change decisions made in the past? The author discusses which rank international treaties occupy in the German norm pyramid and which conclusions the distribution of competences among organs in the area of foreign power allows regarding the question of whether the so-called Treaty Overriding is constitutionally admissible.

Concept: a dialogic instrument in architectural design ¤ INTRODUCTION -- A notional outline -- Interdisciplanarity in architecture -- An instrumental definition of the concept -- Generators and depictions of concept -- Apparatus : Selection of interdisciplinarily conceptualized designs -- List of figures "Concept - this is a key term in architectural discourse. However, all too often it is used imprecisely or merely for marketing purposes. What is a concept actually? This publication moves between design theory and design practice and follows the history of the definition of concept in architecture, leading to the formulation of a specifically instrumental and operative definition. It bases concept in architecture on its strategic potential in design decision-making processes. In the changing profession of the designing architect, decisions are increasingly made in multidisciplinary groups. Concept can serve as a dialogic instrument in the process, making it possible to process heterogeneous information from a range of spheres of knowledge. The effective presentation of selected information becomes a relevant interface in the design process, which has a significant influence on the quality of the design.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4204973-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004744-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112587-3>

The Codification of European Administrative Law: Theoretical and Dogmatic Foundations ¤ A General Act on EU Administrative Law – that is the conceptual foundation on which Lucas Hartmann builds a theoretical approach for codification of EU administrative law, leveraging a comprehensive examination of key legislation on the EU's direct administration to demonstrate that this kind of codification is indeed feasible. The idea of tracing the specificities of the individual areas of European administrative law back to the ordering idea of a general administrative law – this idea gains importance for the European Union in the face of a steadily increasing and differentiated administrative legislation and jurisprudence by organs of the European Union. Lucas Hartmann outlines a theoretical, constitutional-democratic concept of codification for legislation in European administrative law. To this end, he formulates an ideal concept of codification and develops a comprehensive test framework based on it, with which the added value of a codification project can be determined. By applying this test framework, the author, inter alia, shows that there are numerous commonalities in central areas of EU self-administration law. Building on this, he submits a regulatory proposal.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063351-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031459-5>

Thermoplastic, Bio-Based, Polyethylene-Like Polyesters and Isocyanate-Free Representation of Bio-Based Polymers under Complete Material Utilization ¤ Abstract: In this work, novel bio-based thermoplastic and thermoset materials were synthesized using renewable raw materials and carbon dioxide, and their basic structure-property relationships were elucidated. An important task was the polycondensation of crystallizable long-chain diesters, which are accessible by alkoxycarbonylation of unsaturated fatty acid esters, to produce polyethylene-like polyesters with variable oligo ethylene segments. The polyesters were processed by injection molding, film extrusion, and electrospinning. As an alternative to polycondensation, which requires several hours of reaction time, high molecular weight polyesters, polyurea-amides, and polyurea-ester-amides were obtained by reactive extrusion within minutes by isocyanate-free polyaddition reactions in polymer melts. The focus was on polyaddition reactions of purified limonene dicarbonate, which made isocyanate-free linear high molecular weight polyurethanes, polyurethane networks, and coatings accessible by the use of CO2. Together with the group of Prof. Mecking, bio-based α, ω-oligoethylene diesters with variable and crystallizable hydrocarbon segments were obtained by transesterification of fats with methanol and subsequent isomerizing alkoxycarbonylation in one step and successfully used in the polyester synthesis. These bio-based materials combine typical properties of polyethylene and polyesters. For the first time, high molecular weight and readily processable homo- and copolyesters became accessible by polycondensation with diols. It was possible to control their material properties by the oligo ethylene segment length. The polyethylene-like polyesters were obtained with melting temperatures above 100 °C, Young's modules up to 400 MPa, and values for the elongation at break of about 600 %. Electrospun nonwovens made from polyester solutions were biocompatible, biodegradable, and suitable for cell colonization, which was investigated in cooperation with Prof. Shastri's group. By melt compounding films and phase-separated blends with other polyesters and polyolefins have been made available. Already 5 wt% polyester blended with PLA was sufficient to reduce the hydrophilicity and to enhance the resistance to hydrolysis. Polyesters were loaded by melt compounding with dyes and its function as a carrier for the controlled release of dyes were demonstrated. As an alternative to polyester synthesis by polycondensation, isocyanate-free reactive extrusion methods have been developed, which deliver high molecular weight polyesters, polyurea-amides, and polyurea-ester-amides within minutes. These methods enable the production of polyester blends with other polymers, which exhibit improved hydrolysis resistance and reduced hydrophilicity. The developed bio-based materials have great potential for application in various fields, such as medicine, textiles, and packaging.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031648-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4609161-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175096-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175168-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175327-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046699-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175207-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4713263-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4783315-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4634464-0>

Function spaces of dominating mixed smoothness, Weyl and Bernstein numbers ¤ Function spaces of dominating mixed smoothness were first introduced in the early sixties. Recently, there is an increasing interest in those spaces in information-based complexity and high-dimensional approximation. In this work, on the one hand, we concentrate on studying some further properties of Besov-Triebel-Lizorkin spaces of dominating mixed smoothness such as pointwise multiplication, characterization by mixed differences, and change of variable operators which are connected to numerous applications. On the other hand, we investigate the order of convergence of Weyl and Bernstein numbers of compact embeddings of tensor product Sobolev and Besov spaces into Lebesgue spaces on the unit cube. These quantities belong to the class so-called s-numbers and play an important role in the study of the complexity problems since they are lower bounds for worst-case approximation errors. Our method is based on the wavelet decomposition of Besov-Triebel-Lizorkin spaces of dominating mixed smoothness to reduce the problem to analyzing Weyl and Bernstein numbers in the level of sequence spaces.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120913-8>
Biosynthesis of polyphenols in Norway spruce as a defense strategy against attack by the bark beetle associated fungus Ceratocystis polonica ¤ The family Pinaceae (order Coniferales) includes many environmentally and economically important softwood tree genera. The most important Pinaceae species endemic to Europe is the Norway spruce tree (Picea abies). This tree species is frequently subject to severe attacks by the scolytid bark beetle Ips typographus and its microbial associate, the blue stain fungus, Ceratocystis polonica. Spruce trees have structural and chemical defense strategies against invasion by the beetle-fungus complex, including cells with autofluorescent inclusion bodies containing aromatic compounds such as stilbene glucosides and flavan-3-ols. The goal of our research was the elucidation of the pathways leading to the formation of stilbene glucosides and flavan-3ols in spruce and to determine their role in the defense of this tree against infection by the bark beetle associate C. polonica. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175280-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147484-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017047-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4146343-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006902-3>

Actors of international cooperation in prewar Japan : the discourse on international migration and the League of Nations Association of Japan ¤ The book is the first study on the history of one of the most powerful semi-governmental international organizations in interwar Japan: the League of Nations Association of Japan. Established in 1920 for the purpose of achieving the spirit of the League of Nations, the association was at the center of Japanese international cooperation and, even after Japan’s withdrawal from the League itself, acted vigorously as a member of the non-governmental International Federation of League of Nations Societies.Based on extensive multi-archival research, this book explores how members of the association including both governmental and non-governmental actors tried to address international problems such as racial equality, migration, labour, and population. By doing so, the book reconstructs a little-known history of Japan’s international cooperation and puts it into the context of global history.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120503-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072885-7>
State of the art software development in the automotive industry and analysis upon applicability of software fault prediction ¤ In recent years the amount of software within automobiles has increased up to 100 Million LOC in modern day premium vehicles. Virtually all innovations in automotive engineering in the last decade include software components. Parallel to this increasing amount, testing becomes more vital. Automotive software development follows restrictive guidelines in terms of coding standard, language limitations and processes. Traditionally testing is a core part of automotive development, but the raising number of features increases the time and money required to perform all tests. Repeating them multiple times due to programming errors might jeopardises a cars introduction on the market. SFP is a new approach to forecast bugs already at time of commit, thus to guide test engineers upon defining testing hotspots. This work reports on the first successful application using model driven and code generated automotive software as a case study and a success prediction rate up to 97% upon a bug or fault free commit. A compiled and published dataset is presented along with analysis upon the used software metrics. Performance data achieved using different machine learning algorithms is given. An indepth analysis upon factors preventing CPFP is conducted. Further usage and practical application areas will conclude the work	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191569-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4238603-2>
Modelling the Conditions for Cutting, Especially in a Mincer Machine, with the Goal of Optimizing the Comminution Process and Increasing Product Quality ¤ Comminution processes are essential for sausage production. Until now, mincers are not suited for producing fine comminuted emulsified meat batters at high quality, therefore choppers are used. The aim of this work was to develop a continuous process for the production of fine comminuted emulsified meat battersfor high-quality cooked sausages, based on the mincing principle. At first, the operation principles of mincing (fixed knife cut, rotating shear cut) were described and the necessary works (compression, friction, disintegration, shift) were derivedby using mathematical models. Next, the influences on works or length of meat pieces by raw material (e.g. type of tissue, temperature, sample size) and technology (drill-hole diameter, pressure) were deduced. Based on this, the new process for production of fine comminuted emulsified meat batter were developed (and patented). As a result, the sensory and nutritional quality of the cooked sausages was comparable with those from chopper, but more cost-effective atproduction. A prerequisite was, that sample size, drill-hole diameter, pressure and knife rotation speed were tool-specific adapted on each other. Zerkleinerungsprozesse sind zur Wurstherstellung essentiell. Wölfe sind nicht zur Erzeugung emulgierter Feinbräte hoher Qualität geeignet; deshalb werden Kutter verwendet. Ziel der Arbeit war, eine nach dem Wolfprinzip arbeitende kontinuierliche Technologie zu entwickeln, die hochwertige feinst zerkleinerte emulgierte Brühwurstbräte erzeugt. Dazu wurden die beim Wolfen wirkenden Zerkleinerungsprinzipien (rotatorischer Scherschnitt, fester Messerschnitt) beschrieben und die notwendigen Arbeiten (Kompression, Reibung, Zerstörung, Verschiebung) über mathematische Modelle hergeleitet. Dann wurden Einflüsse auf die Arbeiten bzw. Zäpfchenlänge durch den Rohstoff (z.B. Gewebeart,Temperatur, Zerkleinerungsgrad) und die Technologie (Bohrungsdurchmesser, Förderdruck) abgeleitet, um das neue Verfahren zur Feinbrätherstellung zu entwickeln (und zu patentieren). Im Ergebnis wurden sensorisch und ernährungsphysiologisch hochwertige Brühwürste in vergleichbar hoher Qualität wie im Kutter, aber kostengünstiger erzeugt.

Detection and Kirchhoff-type migration of seismic events by use of a new characteristic function ¤ The classical method of seismic event localization is based on the picking of body wave arrivals, ray tracing and inversion of travel time data. Travel time picks with small uncertainties are required to produce reliable and accurate results with this kind of source localization. Hence recordings, with a low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) cannot be used in a travel time based inversion. Low SNR can be related with weak signals from distant and/or low magnitude sources as well as with a high level of ambient noise. Diffraction stacking is considered as an alternative seismic event localization method that enables also the processing of low SNR recordings by mean of stacking the amplitudes of seismograms along a travel time function. The location of seismic event and its origin time are determined based on the highest stacked amplitudes (coherency) of the image function. The method promotes an automatic processing since it does not need travel time picks as input data. However, applying diffraction stacking may require longer...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145094-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165403-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4383458-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180765-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172886-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048606-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4158123-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015134-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152638-7>
Paleozoic to Pliocene evolution of the Andean retroarc between 26 and 28°S : interactions between tectonics, climate, and upper plate architecture ¤ Interactions and feedbacks between tectonics, climate, and upper plate architecture control basin geometry, relief, and depositional systems. The Andes is part of a longlived continental margin characterized by multiple tectonic cycles which have strongly modified the Andean upper plate architecture. In the Andean retroarc, spatiotemporal variations in the structure of the upper plate and tectonic regimes have resulted in marked along-strike variations in basin geometry, stratigraphy, deformational style, and mountain belt morphology. These along-strike variations include high-elevation plateaus (Altiplano and Puna) associated with a thin-skin fold-and-thrust-belt and thick-skin deformation in broken foreland basins such as the Santa Barbara system and the Sierras Pampeanas. At the confluence of the Puna Plateau, the Santa Barbara system and the Sierras Pampeanas, major along-strike changes in upper plate architecture, mountain belt morphology, basement exhumation, and deformation style can be recognized.

New anode- and cathode-active materials for organic batteries ¤ The development and synthesis of new polymers for organic batteries is a long and difficult process rife with challenges. However, the reward for this are suitable materials for the next generation of secondary batteries. The investigations within the scope of this thesis are focused on the discovery of new redox-active polymers suitable as active materials in batteries. These organic battery materials can compete with inorganic materials in terms of theoretical capacity, power and energy density. The most beneficial features of these compounds like light weight, flexibility, printability and environmental friendliness make them promising candidates for secondary organic batteries. With the vast repertoire of known redox-active species the transfer of those into a polymeric structure and their subsequent electrochemical testing can provide access to a wide variety of different electrode materials. In this thesis new polymers were developed as active battery-materials and tested for their capabilities in batteries. This includes the functionalization and optimization of well-known polymers like galvinoxyles and the incorporation of less-known redox-materials in polymeric compounds. Several new polymers, containing anode- or cathode-active compounds were synthesized. Galvinoxyl- and phenoxyl-compounds are addressed as well as quinones, anthraquinones and nitroxides. These polymeric compounds were subsequently intensively tested for their application as electrode material and incorporated into batteries, including the fabrication of a battery using inkjet-printing. By changing the functional groups of the polymers, their redox-potentials, stability or solubility are changed and new batteries were created. Those different batteries show the versatility of polymers as electrode-materials and the possibility to adjust a batteries capability to the desired specifications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4319759-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4403842-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155916-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004687-4>
Process-based modelling of the methane balance in periglacial landscapes ¤ A detailed process-based methane module for the global land surface scheme JSBACH has been developed that is general enough to be applied in permafrost regions as well as wetlands outside permafrost areas. Methane production, oxidation and transport by ebullition, diffusion and plants are represented. Oxygen has been explicitly incorporated into diffusion, transport by plants, bulk soil oxidation and rhizospheric oxidation. Permafrost and wetland soils show special behaviour, e.g. variable soil pore space due to freezing/thawing or water table depths due to changing soil water content. This was integrated directly into the methane-related processes. A detailed application at the Samoylov polygonal tundra site, Lena River Delta, was used for evaluation purposes, which shows differences in the importance of the several processes and in the methane dynamics under varying soil moisture, ice and temperature conditions during different seasons and on the two different microsites, the elevated moist polygonal rim and the depressed wet polygonal centre. The evaluation shows sufficiently good agreement with field observations despite the module was not specifically calibrated to these data. In a second step, an enhanced version of JSBACH, including an updated methane module, was used for regional future climate experiments. The changes concern hydrology, carbon decomposition, methane production, order of the transport processes and plant transport. A new transport process was included, the diffusion through snow. The updated model was applied at the larger area of the Lena River Delta. Detailed analyses of soil respiration and methane process fluxes, their spatial distribution as well as changes with time and in the seasonal behaviour are presented. They show the relevance of methane compared to the carbon dioxide fluxes, the pattern of regions with favourable conditions for methane emissions as well as the increase of fluxes and emission season length due to climate change.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129794-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4286529-3>
Higgs Potential and Naturalness After the Higgs Discovery ¤ BEGIN Introduction -- Bare Parameters at Cutoff Scale -- Higgs Inflation and Standard Model Criticality -- Naturalness Problem and Quantum Gravity -- Dark Matter and Higgs Potential -- Summary -- Appendix A - Convention -- Appendix B - Renormalization Group Equations -- Appendix C - Brief Review of Inflation -- Appendix D - Strong CP Problem -- Appendix E - Quantization of Majorana Field -- Appendix F - The Effect of the Principle Value. This thesis focuses on the theoretical foundation of the Standard Model valid up to the Planck scale, based on the current experimental facts from the Large Hadron Collider. The thesis consists of two themes: (1) to open up a new window of the Higgs inflation scenario, and (2) to explore a new solution to the naturalness problem in particle physics. In the first area, on the Higgs inflation scenario, the author successfully improves a large value problem on a coupling constant relevant to the Higgs mass in the Standard Model, in which the coupling value of the order of 10^5 predicted in a conventional scenario is reduced to the order of 10. This result makes the Higgs inflation more attractive because the small value of coupling is natural in the context of ultraviolet completion such as string theory. In the second area, the author provides a new answer to the naturalness problem, of why the cosmological constant and the Higgs mass are extremely small compared with the Planck scale. Based on the baby universe theory originally proposed by Coleman, the smallness of those quantities is successfully explained without introducing any additional new particles relevant at the TeV energy scale.

Amino cellulose sulfate : synthesis, characterization and physicochemical behavior ¤ Amino cellulose sulfates, a new class of polyampholytic polysaccharide derivatives, are accessible by a three step synthesis; tosylation, sulfation and nucleophilic displacement for introduction of amino moieties. Thus, tosylate moieties can be introduced in position 6 of the repeating unit of the cellulose backbone. Subsequently, anionic sulfate groups can be linked to the tosyl cellulose by the treatment with sulfur trioxide pyridine complex. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326843-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185747-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147454-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138384-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4720924-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131871-7>
What Remains of War : Unpeaceful Relations in Sierra Leone ¤ A new image of unpeaceful relations that challenges common concepts of research about post-war societies. How do social relations reorder themselves after violent conflict? And how do those affected and involved deal with ongoing unpeaceful relations? At the example of Sierra Leone, Anne Menzel investigates the line of separation between the civilian population and (former) fighters, which is often considered given and taken for granted in research on post-war societies as well as in peacebuilding practice. Her study opens up new and surprising perspectives by providing insight into the emergence and ongoing practice of a local 'aesthetics of danger', in which no clear distinction between ex-combatants and the civilian population can be made.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7590110-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4421423-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4456599-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165734-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190984-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4726796-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7540899-5>
Theoretical studies of the constriction of rare-gas glow discharge plasmas ¤ Gas discharge, rare gas, contraction, fluid modeling, positive column, low-temperature plasma, glow-to-arc transition, low-temperature plasma In the present work, a time- and radial-dependent fluid model has been developed to describe the glow-to-arc transition of the positive column in the course of constriction. The self-consistent model comprises the particle balance equations for the relevant species, the balance equation of the mean electron energy and the heavy particle temperature in the plasma, the Poisson equation for the space-charge potential, and a current balance determining the axial electric field. The model adopts the nonlocal moment method, i.e., the system of the balance equations resulting from the moments of the radially dependent Boltzmann equation is solved. The electron transport and rate coefficients are adapted as functions of the mean energy of the electrons, the gas temperature and the ionization degree. The model is applied to a description of the constriction of the dc positive column in argon, for a wide range of pressures and applied currents. Pronounced nonlocal features of the mean electron energy balance are found and their influence on the constricted argon positive column is analyzed...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4339344-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139645-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170297-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017690-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151020-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165178-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4192606-7>

Uncertainties in climate data analysis : perspectives on working with measurement errors and other unknowns ¤ Scientific inquiry requires that we formulate not only what we know, but also what we do not know and by how much. In climate data analysis, this involves an accurate specification of measured quantities and a consequent analysis that consciously propagates the measurement errors at each step. The dissertation presents a thorough analytical method to quantify errors of measurement inherent in paleoclimate data. An additional focus are the uncertainties in assessing the coupling between different factors that influence the global mean temperature (GMT). Paleoclimate studies critically rely on `proxy variables' that record climatic signals in natural archives. However, such proxy records inherently involve uncertainties in determining the age of the signal. We present a generic Bayesian approach to analytically determine the proxy record along with its associated uncertainty, resulting in a time-ordered sequence of correlated probability distributions rather than a precise time series. We further develop a recurrence based method to detect dynamical events from the proxy probability distributions. The methods are validated with synthetic examples and demonstrated with real-world proxy records. The proxy estimation step reveals the interrelations between proxy variability and uncertainty. The recurrence analysis of the East Asian Summer Monsoon during the last 9000 years confirms the well-known `dry' events at 8200 and 4400 BP, plus an additional significantly dry event at 6900 BP. We also analyze the network of dependencies surrounding GMT. We find an intricate, directed network with multiple links between the different factors at multiple time delays. We further uncover a significant feedback from the GMT to the El Niño Southern Oscillation at quasi-biennial timescales. The analysis highlights the need of a more nuanced formulation of influences between different climatic factors, as well as the limitations in trying to estimate such dependencies	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125276-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136907-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4803995-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4288494-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131193-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123037-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173112-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4596948-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121894-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038971-6>
Precision Measurements to Test the Standard Model and for Explosive Nuclear Astrophysics ¤ This thesis presents two significant results in the field of precision measurements in low-energy nuclear physics. Firstly, it presents a precise half-life determination of 11C, leading to the most precise ft-value for a beta decay transition between mirror nuclides, an important advance in the testing of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model. Secondly, it describes a high-precision mass measurement of 56Cu, a critical nucleus for determining the path of the astrophysical rapid-proton capture process, performed by the author using the LEBIT Penning trap at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory. This new measurement resolves discrepancies in previously-reported calculated mass excesses. In addition, the thesis also presents the construction and testing of a radio-frequency quadrupole cooler and buncher that will be part of the future N = 126 factory at Argonne National Laboratory aimed at producing nuclei of interest for the astrophysical rapid-neutron capture process for the first time Chapter 1.

Minimizers of generalized Willmore energies and applications in general relativity ¤ The Willmore functional is a function that maps an immersed Riemannian manifold to its total mean curvature. Finding closed surfaces that minimizes the Willmore energy, or more generally finding critical surfaces, is a classic problem of differential geometry. In this thesis we will develop the concept of generalized Willmore functionals for surfaces in Riemannian manifolds. We are guided by models in mathematical physics, such as the Hawking energy of general relativity and the bending energies for thin membranes. We prove the existence of minimizers under area constraint for these generalized Willmore functionals in a suitable class of generalized surfaces. In particular, we construct minimizers of the bending energy mentioned above for prescribed area and enclosed volume. Furthermore, we prove that critical surfaces of generalized Willmore functionals with prescribed area are smooth, away from finitely many points. These results and the following are based on the existing theory for the Willmore functional. This ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4844614-2>
The Debate on French and German Identity in Press Reporting in France and Germany (1997-2012): A Return of the National Myth? ¤ The main research areas are the debate on national identity and the national myth. The focus lies on the question how these terms were reflected in the print media in Germany and France during the investigation period from 1997 to 2012. It is to be considered that the Federal Republic of Germany of the 21 century relates less to myths than France where the different political camps continually reactivate personalities from the national history with the aim of giving its citizens a certain confidence in the future and to reinforce national identity.

Economic opening and growth in China ¤ China's remarkable growth in recent years has been often rather arbitrarily ascribed to a number of politico-economic factors. In this volume, the specific effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows is measured quantitatively and estimated on a regional basis. The authors find that there is a much more complex relationship between such flows and growth overall than had hitherto been supposed. While growth associated with FDI flows and a consequent foreign technology input is clearly highest in the coastal, open provinces, geographical dispersion effects can also be identified.

Pursuit of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity as Crimes Against Humanity ¤ From an interdisciplinary perspective, this book analyses the definition of gender in the Rome Statute with regard to the question of whether sexual orientation and gender identity are included in it. On the basis of this analysis, its author shows that although sexual orientation and gender identity are human rights, both elements are not included in the definition. Moreover, she shows that this lack of protection needs to be redressed because persecution based on sexual orientation and gender identity is comparable in its gravity with the grounds for prosecution already codified in the Statute, and subsequently proposes some ways in which this failing could be rectified. Die Arbeit untersucht die Definition des Geschlechts im Statut des Internationalen Strafgerichtshofs im Hinblick darauf, ob diese die sexuelle Orientierung und die Geschlechtsidentität erfasst. Die Analyse der Definition wird getragen von dem Anspruch, auch sozialwissenschaftliche, ethnologische und medizinische Erkenntnisse zum Begriff des Geschlechts zu berücksichtigen. Ausgehend von dieser interdisziplinären Analyse der Definition des Art. 7 III IStGH-Statut wird gezeigt, dass die sexuelle Orientierung und die Geschlechtsidentität auch bei Berücksichtigung menschenrechtlicher Standards, mit deren Bedeutung für die Auslegung des IStGH-Statuts sich die Autorin ebenfalls auseinandersetzt, nicht davon erfasst sind. Anschließend zeigt die Autorin, dass darin aufgrund der Verfolgungen wegen der sexuellen Orientierung und der Geschlechtsidentität eine Schutzlücke zu sehen ist und macht Vorschläge, wie deren Schließung gelingen kann.

The real paradox of the actor : how to capture in words the complex paradoxical power that underpins every exceptional acting performance ¤ This work examines what it is that exceptional actors do when they resonate with audiences, and how to capture these actors’ performances in words. At present, there exists no suitable language to describe poignant acting performances. Hitherto, exceptional performers have been characterized as having elusive qualities such as “charisma,” great “presence,” or the “It-factor.” Since acting is primarily a physical art, it is difficult to express what actors do with dualistic language that values mind over body and neglects that the body also shapes the mind. Furthermore, the history of acting theory demonstrates a distrust toward an art form that resists reductive linguistic appropriation. A compelling example of such an anti-theatrical and dichotomous viewpoint is Denis Diderot’s polemical essay of 1773, The Paradox of the Actor. In this essay, Diderot insists—wrongly, I argue—that the actor’s paradox is that only a robotic, unmoved actor can move an audience because the actor’s mind has complete control over his body and can circumvent the soul. My paper builds on Diderot’s essay, and with holistic language redrafts and redresses what I understand to be the real paradox of the actor. Through an interdisciplinary approach that observes manifest Shakespearean acting performances and puts them into context with acting theories (such as Stanislavski’s system) and new scientific approaches to acting (such as cognitive neuroscience and Alba emoting), this study finds that a more receptive, expressive, and comprehensive language is needed to describe and give meaning to what it is actors do that inspires audiences. This paper argues that acting performances that resonate with audiences are comprised of paradox and in-between states that are successfully conveyed through non-verbal communication but inadequately conveyed with dualistic language. This study concludes that a more embodied, inclusive, and generous language that encompasses liminal, non-binary and contradictory states gives means to make visible the invisible paradoxical power that underpins every exceptional acting performance.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129090-2>

Biohacking, bodies and do-it-yourself : the cultural politics of hacking life itself ¤ From self-help books and nootropics, to self-tracking and home health tests, to the tinkering with technology and biological particles - biohacking brings biology, medicine, and the material foundation of life into the sphere of »do-it-yourself«. This trend has the potential to fundamentally change people's relationship with their bodies and biology but it also creates new cultural narratives of responsibility, authority, and differentiation. Covering a broad range of examples, this book explores practices and representations of biohacking in popular culture, discussing their ambiguous position between empowerment and requirement, promise and prescription.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069491-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167306-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4324980-2>
Synthesis and Evaluation of Novel Triterpenes Derivatives ¤ Betulinic acid and Glycyrrhetinic acid are of great interest in pharmacological and chemical research because of their great potential for treating several diseases including HIV, herpes and cancer. Both triterpenes are wide-spread in plant kingdom and showed cytotoxic activity against several cancer cell lines by triggering apoptosis. Betulinic acid showed a selective cytotoxicitiy for melanoma cells in an animal model. Because of no acute or chronic side effects even at doses of 500 mg/kg, betulinic acid prevails as a potent alternative in chemotherapeutic therapy, which is currently researched in clinical trials. The subject of this work is synthesis and evaluation of novel derivates of betulinic acid and glycyrrhetinic acid bearing a carbon-carbon triple bond. The prepared alkynol and alkynketone derivates were evaluated by using a SRB assay. Several alkyne derivates showed increased cytotoxic behavior against nine cancer cell lines with IC50 > 1 μM. Additional several triazols and propargyl amines were gained from alkynyl derivates and showed good cytotoxic activity. Further assays like AO/EP, trypan blue, annixin-V , investigation of cell cycle and DNA laddering experiments suggest that alkynyl derivates trigger apoptosis in cancer cell lines. betulin; betulinic acid; glycyrrhetinic acid; propargyl amin; 1,2,3-triazol; Click-reaction; alkynyl; Mannich; apoptosis; SRB-assay Triterpenes are of great interest in pharmaceutical and chemical research due to their diverse pharmacological properties. Betulin and Glycyrrhetinic acid are exemplary natural substances with antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer potential. Their possible apoptotic mode of action makes them valuable alternatives in cancer medicine. In the present work, the influence of alkyne substituents on the cytotoxic behavior of these triterpenes is investigated. The synthesized alkenols and alkyl ketones were analyzed for their cytotoxic activities using the SRB assay. It was shown that with alkyne derivatives of betulin and glycyrrhetinic acid, comparable growth rates can be achieved compared to the reference substances. Nine alkyne derivatives exceed the activities of the references with IC50 values partially below 1 μM. Synthesized triazole and propargyl derivatives also show increased cytotoxic potential. Selected compounds were also investigated with the AO/PI- and AO/EB-assay, the trypan blue assay, the annexin-V assay, as well as DNA laddering and cell cycle analysis regarding their apoptotic mode of action.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143176-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186236-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133806-6>

Measurement of stratospheric chlorine monoxide and water vapor in the Arctic: Extension and optimization of the passive microwave radiometer RAM in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard ¤ The "Radiometer for Atmospheric Measurements" is a passive microwave radiometer which measures the rotational emission lines of water vapor, ozone and chlorine monoxide. As part of the αNetwork for the Detection of Stratospheric Change the RAM is situated in Ny-Ålesund at 79° North at the Spitsbergen archipelago. This location is special, because in arctic winter it mostly lies under the polar vortex which is essential for the measurement of chlorine activation and therefore the observation of ozone depletion. Since the designation of heterogenous chemistry as basic cause for the Antarctic ozone hole the observation of stratospheric chlorine monoxide is more important than ever. The RAM is the only instrument in the Arctic for long term monitoring of this crucial species. Within the scope of this work several improvements have been made on the instrumentś hard- and software. We will show measurements of stratospheric chlorine monoxide from 2000 which have been analyzed with a newly implemented retrieval software. In this context we will show measured diurnal chlorine monoxide cycles as well as the comparison to other instruments and models. As tracer for global warming and participant in catalytic ozone depletion water vapor is an important species for atmospheric physics. In the last decades stratospheric water vapor has increased noticeably in lower stratosphere which not can be explained by current theories. In this work we will present the technical realization of the new installed instrument, the water vapor retrieval software as well as some evaluated measurements. Tropospheric water vapor is also a disturbing factor to microwave measurements. In this work we have inspected several sites for their suitability as location of a newly planned 278 GHz chlorine monoxide radiometer. As result we discovered Summit in Greenland and Mérida in Venezuela as ideal places which eventually lead to the installation of two new instruments.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169982-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4149608-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132622-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176837-1>
Development of a high-accuracy continuous CO2/CH4/H2O analyzer for deployment on board a commercial airliner ¤ This thesis presents investigations into CO2 and CH4 measurements aboard commercial airliners, and potential applications of CO2 profiles from the In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) project for carbon cycle studies. The design of a high-accuracy continuous CO2/CH4/H2O analyzer suitable for use aboard commercial airliners has been accomplished based on improvements of a commercially available instrument using the cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) technique. In order to obtain dry air mixing ratios of CO2/CH4/H2O from direct measurements of wet air, water correction functions have been developed from laboratory experiments. The CRDS analyzer was flown without a drying system or any in-flight calibration gases during a campaign over the Amazon rain forest in Brazil in May 2009. To validate the continuous in situ CO2/CH4 measurements made by the CRDS analyzer against reliable discrete CO2/CH4 measurements from air samples taken with glass flasks during flight, weighting functions have been derived for both single flasks and paired flasks. The comparison results demonstrate that the CRDS analyzer is fully adequate for high-accuracy continuous CO2 and CH4 measurements without a drying system or in-flight calibrations during a field aircraft campaign.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4438735-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4553045-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132825-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031648-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169678-5>

Attacking complexity in logic synthesis of asynchronous circuits ¤ Most of the microelectronic circuits fabricated today are synchronous, i.e. they are driven by one or several clock signals. Synchronous circuit design faces several fundamental challenges such as high-speed clock distribution, integration of multiple cores operating at different clock rates, reduction of power consumption and dealing with voltage, temperature, manufacturing and runtime variations. Asynchronous or clockless design plays a key role in alleviating these challenges, however the design and test of asynchronous circuits is much more difficult in comparison to their synchronous counterparts. A driving force for a widespread use of asynchronous technology is the availability of mature EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools which provide an entire automated design flow starting from an HDL (Hardware Description Language) specification yielding the final circuit layout. Even though there was much progress in developing such EDA tools for asynchronous circuit design during the last two decades, the maturity level as well as the acceptance of them is still not comparable with tools for synchronous circuit design. In particular, logic synthesis (which implies the application of Boolean minimisation techniques) for the entire system's control path can significantly improve the efficiency of the resulting asynchronous implementation, e.g. in terms of chip area and performance. However, logic synthesis, in particular for asynchronous circuits, suffers from complexity problems. Signal Transitions Graphs (STGs) are labelled Petri nets which are a widely used to specify the interface behaviour of speed independent (SI) circuits - a robust subclass of asynchronous circuits. STG decomposition is a promising approach to tackle complexity problems like state space explosion in logic synthesis of SI circuits. The (structural) decomposition of STGs is guided by a partition of the output signals and generates a usually much smaller component STG for each partition member, i.e. a component STG with a much smaller state space than the initial specification. However, decomposition can result in component STGs that in isolation have so-called irreducible CSC conflicts (i.e. these components are not SI synthesisable anymore) even if the specification has none of them. A new approach is presented to avoid such conflicts by introducing internal communication between the components. So far, STG decompositions are guided by the finest output partitions, i.e. one output per component. However, this might not yield optimal circuit implementations. Efficient heuristics are presented to determine coarser partitions leading to improved circuits in terms of chip area. For the new algorithms correctness proofs are given and their implementations are incorporated into the decomposition tool DESIJ. The presented techniques are successfully applied to some benchmarks - including 'real-life' specifications arising in the context of control resynthesis - which delivered promising results.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4271581-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4312536-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4159102-1>
The notion of secrecy : a balanced approach in the light of the trade secrets directive ¤ In the digital age, information has become an increasingly valuable, but at the same time vulnerable commodity. The strategic role that trade secrets play in the economy of the Single Market and the scattered legal framework across EU jurisdictions prompted the EU Commission to harmonise this field of law and to adopt the Trade Secrets Directive. This thesis analyses the conditions under which information loses its secret nature, enters the public domain and is then free for competitors to use, taking into account the legal framework created by the Trade Secrets Directive.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140232-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127982-7>

Such computations can provide guidance for experimental studies and insight into underlying causes of observations, or explore conditions and properties that are inaccessible to experiments at the current time. A variety of approaches have been applied in such research, with density functional theory based methods having become a reliable tool in computational mineral sciences. Despite this progress there are interesting problems which density functional theory based methods are not able to tackle on a routine basis.

Local smoothers with regularization ¤ Mrázek et al. [25] proposed a unified approach to curve estimation which combines localization and regularization. Franke et al. [10] used that approach to discuss the case of the regularized local least-squares (RLLS) estimate. In this thesis we will use the unified approach of Mrázek et al. to study some asymptotic properties of local smoothers with regularization. In particular, we shall discuss the Huber M-estimate and its limiting cases towards the L2 and the L1 cases. For the regularization part, we will use quadratic regularization. Then, we will define a more general class of regularization functions. Finally, we will do a Monte Carlo simulation study to compare different types of estimates.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4774972-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4846428-4>

Genetic basis and adaptive significance of repeated scent loss in selfing Capsella species ¤ Floral scent is an important way for plants to communicate with insects, but scent emission has been lost or strongly reduced during the transition from pollinator-mediated outbreeding to selfing. The shift from outcrossing to selfing is not only accompanied by scent loss, but also by a reduction in other pollinator-attracting traits like petal size and can be observed multiple times among angiosperms. These changes are summarized by the term selfing syndrome and represent one of the most prominent examples of convergent evolution within the plant kingdom. In this work the genus Capsella was used as a model to study convergent evolution in two closely related selfers with separate transitions to self-fertilization. Compared to their outbreeding ancestor C. grandiflora, the emission of benzaldehyde as main compound of floral scent is lacking or strongly reduced in the selfing species C. rubella and C. orientalis. In C. rubella the loss of benzaldehyde was caused by mutations to cinnamate:CoA ligase CNL1, but the biochemical basis and...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4205897-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4699715-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308832-6>
Distributive justice and its realization in Nigeria : philosophy and education as a roadmap to change for a multi-cultural society ¤ This dissertation began with the debate on what exactly constitutes the correct currency of justice in a political society.

Aspects of Public Service Provision in the Context of Demographic Change ¤ The thesis analyzes the effects of demographic change on municipal budgets in Saxony-Anhalt. Population loss increases per capita expenditures in all sectors of public good provision, but substantial generational conflicts cannot be detected. Municipalities lack of fiscal freedom, since 90 % of expenditures are determined by regulations of higher level authorities. Moreover, empirical results suggest that volunteering in Germany is not a homogenous good. The effects of socioeconomic variables vary across voluntary sectors and have contradicting impacts on the decision to participate in and the decision how much time is spent on volunteer activities. The influence of public budgets on volunteering is also heterogeneous. However, it seems that in the cultural and social sector public budgets may crowd out the intensity of volunteering in these sectors. Demographic change; provision of public goods; generational conflicts; volunteering; Tobit-II; nonlinear SUR	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043150-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043212-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006292-2>
Biomechanical analysis of nursing tasks for physical relief by collaborative robotics ¤ Musculoskeletal disorders are among the most significant health risks contributing to the global decline in mental health and physical performance. Occupations with high physical work demands, such as patient handling in nursing, are associated with high rates of long-term absenteeism and disability due to musculoskeletal pain and disorders. Robotic assistance systems are revolutionizing bedside care and could provide a healthy future for caregivers. For the first time, the potential of a collaborative robotic system to assist nurses in a manual patient handling scenario has been quantified. Using the system significantly reduced the maximum effort required, resulting in physical relief. It demonstrates the feasibility of robot-assisted patient repositioning and highlights the need for interdisciplinary research to adaptively respond to the individual needs and functional abilities of nurses. This work provides a foundation for future research and practical implementation. The use of robotics is innovative, contemporary, widely applicable, and promising for reducing existing risk factors in nursing care.

Inversion of surface parameters using polarimetric SAR ¤ In this dissertation on the Inversion of Surface Parameters using Polarimetric SAR, the potential of implementing recent advances made in Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar to surface parameter estimation is investigated. The sensitivity of microwave scattering to the dielectric properties and the geometric structure of bare soil surfaces makes radar remote sensing a challenge for a wide range of environmental issues related to the condition of natural surfaces.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4228012-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176770-6>
Time-resolved investigations on ultrafast shape modification dynamics of silver nanoparticles embedded in glass ¤ silver nanoparticles, glass, surface plasmon resonance, ultrafast dynamics, electron emission, ionization, two temperature model. The goal of this work is to investigate the laser-induced permanent shape modification dynamics of silver nanoparticles embedded in glass. In this context, a pulse-pair irradiation technique is proposed, in which spherical silver nanoparticles are irradiated by time-delayed fs-pulse pairs. This method leads to time-dependent nanoparticle shape changes; therefore, the persistent changes of the surface plasmon bands can be analyzed as a function of time delay and the relative polarization of the pulse pairs. The temporal evolution of the surface plasmon bands is obtained up to a delay of 1 ns. It is found that the strongest nanoparticle shape changes, i.e., the highest aspect ratios are achieved when the delay between pulse pairs is less than 3 ps. After 10 ps, the dichroism in the case of pulse pairs with identical polarization is strongly reduced and disappears with pulse pairs with orthogonal polarization. The results strongly suggest that the electron and ion emissions from the nanoparticles are completed within less than 20 ps. After 20 ps, the resulting aspect ratio remains at a minimum until 100 ps and for longer delays, the aspect ratio increases slowly up to 1 ns. The results, summarized above, provide insight into the dynamics of nanoparticle shape changes over a fairly long time period with very good experimental accuracy. In this context, the introduced technique proves to be a valuable tool for investigating nanoparticle shape modification dynamics or more generally, any ultrafast laser-induced processes leading to permanent optical changes.

ABC for Life - Are Mindfulness Programs in the School Context an Effective Approach? ¤ Introduction: Mindfulness programs for schools are popular. Currently, the enthusiasm for this approach outweighs the evidence supporting its application. In this dissertation I present a) a meta-analytic review of the existing evidence and b) further empirical data regarding the efficacy of mindfulness-based school programs, also considering the methodological quality of evaluation studies in this nascent field. Methods: a) In order to locate both published and unpublished studies a comprehensive search strategy was applied. Data on methodology and outcomes of included studies were extracted. Effect sizes were combined using the random-effect model. b) In two pilot studies, effects of a mindfulness-based school program on measures of attention, self-regulation, empathy, mental health and well-being were examined in a controlled pre-post design. In study I, n = 20 fourth grade students took part in a 6 week-mindfulness program; in study II, n = 25 second grade students participated in a modified version of the mindfulness program (20 weeks). Parallel classes served as the control. Results: a) Twenty-four studies were located, of which eleven were unpublished. Nineteen studies used a controlled design. Altogether, 1,348 students were instructed in mindfulness, with 863 serving as comparison groups, ranging from school grades 1 to 12. Overall effect sizes were g = 0.41 within groups and g = 0.40 between groups. Domain specific, controlled, effect sizes varied from g = 0.80 for measures of cognitive performance to g = 0.19 for measures of emotional problems. However, heterogeneity was significant and could partly be explained by the intensity of mindfulness programs. b) In study I, interaction effects (time x group) occurred in three subscales of teacher ratings on mental health (hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationship problems, prosocial behavior), indicating the superiority of the control (all p ≤ .05). In study II, interaction effects (time x group) occurred in one subscale of teacher questionnaires in mental health (conduct problems, p ≤ .01) and in two subscales of after-school-care teachers (peer relationship problems, prosocial behavior (both p ≤ .05)), reflecting improvement in the mindfulness class. In general, the feasibility of this evaluation can be confirmed, but the adequacy of some measures being applied in this field of research need to be addressed. Conclusion: Preliminary evidence supports the efficacy of mindfulness programs, but replication in rigorous research designs is required. Future research should consider the special features of students and the school setting. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162156-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053474-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4297929-8>
The Modelling of Radiation Damage in Metals Using Ehrenfest Dynamics ¤ Atomistic simulations of metals under irradiation are indispensable for understanding damage processes at time- and length-scales beyond the reach of experiment. Previously, such simulations have largely ignored the effect of electronic excitations on the atomic dynamics, even though energy exchange between atoms and electrons can have significant effects on the extent and nature of radiation damage. This thesis presents the results of time-dependent tight-binding simulations of radiation damage, in which the evolution of a coupled system of energetic classical ions and quantum mechanical electrons is correctly described. The effects of electronic excitations in collision cascades and ion channeling are explored and a new model is presented, which makes possible the accurate reproduction of non-adiabatic electronic forces in large-scale classical molecular dynamics simulations of metals.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057825-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4463785-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038860-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4318601-4>

Monitoring of methionine oxidation with fluorescent proteins ¤ Methionine (Met) oxidation to methionine sulfoxide (MetO) is a post-translational protein modification that can appear unspecifically during exposure of Met to oxidants in normal growth and oxidative stress, such as occurring in aged organisms and in various degenerative diseases and pathologies. The importance of MetO is emphasized by a set of methionine sulfoxide reductases (Msrs) present in virtually almost all organisms. Studies of Met oxidation typically involve biochemical work-up, thus precluding real-time measurements in living cells. Moreover, there is no specific antibody against MetO for the convenient labeling or enrichment of oxidized proteins. Therefore, there is a demand for a tool that can report Met oxidation in vitro and in living cells. Here we introduce a Genetically-Encoded fluorescent Probe of Met Oxidation (GEPMO). We designed and optimized variants of superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) which provide excitation-ratiometric fluorescent signals reporting on the degree of Met oxidation. Produced in a bacterial expression system, the variants of sfGFP were characterized under fully controlled conditions in a spectrofluorometer. A derivative with the best performance was chosen for further work. Oxidation of the principal solvent-exposed Met147 in GEPMO changed the distribution of chromophore’s neutral and protonated states which can be monitored as the ratio of fluorescence intensities F400 / F470. Incubation of the indicator with Met oxidants showed robust changes in the fluorescent ratio F400 / F470; full oxidation resulted in an about 2-fold decrease. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that oxidation of a Met residue in the indicator is responsible for the ratio changes. We determined the rate constant of Met oxidation with chloramine T. We demonstrated that chloramine T is a Met-specific oxidant. GEPMO fills a gap in the genetically encoded redox sensor toolkit, which is currently represented only by Cys-based sensors.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137187-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197032-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4204069-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169698-0>

Phase behavior of liquid crystals in confinement ¤ We use computer simulations to investigate the isotropic-to-nematic phase transition of liquid crystals. Using the Lebwohl-Lasher model with sophisticated algorithms, the phase transition is found to match experimental results and is weakly first-order in bulk. By changing the strength of a microscopic detail we show the macroscopic phase transition can be made more strongly first-order. Our simulations are made more complicated by adding planar confinement and quenched disorder. In both cases, depending on the microscopic detail, the possible phase behaviors are a first-order phase transition, a continuous phase transition, or no phase transition at all.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171428-3>
Search Engines in the Union Competition Law Abuse Control: A Jurisprudential-Economic Analysis under Special Consideration of the Vertical Integration of Own Services and Content ¤ This work deals with one of the central questions with regard to the application of competition law to markets of the internet economy: To what extent can the prohibition of the abuse of market power according to Art. 102 TFEU be applied to innovative markets like the internet search engine market? The challenges which the law faces in this context due to the special economic dynamic have not yet been thoroughly analysed. The study sheds light on the definition of the relevant markets and the important economic characteristics (indirect positive network effects in particular). On this basis, the work focuses on the preferential treatment of proprietary services and content (vertical integration) as potential abusive behaviour with reference to the essential facilities doctrine and unlawful tying.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037627-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4423007-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4168426-6>
Design and synthesis of dithiolene based biomimetic compounds for metal ion sensors and oxo-transfer catalytic applications ¤ Because heavy metal ions prefer to bind sulfur, inspired by molybdopterin the main goal of this work was combining dithiolene binding moieties with optically active substituents with the aim to detect/capture metal ions, which could preferably bind to the dithiolene moiety of for instance MPT. Therefore a number of dithiolene based molecules mimicking the natural immediate coordination sphere composition of Mo and W dependent oxidoreductase enzymes were synthesized and characterized by NMR, MS, IR, X-ray crystallography, UV-Vis, EPR and electrochemical methods. In order to work at the lowest possible base concentration due to potentially base sensitive substituents and reaction partners, the procedure for the de-protection of the ligand precursors and the in situ complexation reaction was first optimized in course of the work and interim we explored the surprising fact that the ring opening reaction of the 1,3- dithiol-2-one system is fully reversible and can be controlled simply by adjusting the pH-value of the solution. Then, the coordination behavior of the de-protected ligands towards different metal ions, including biologically relevant ions like Cu+, Cu2+, Fe3+ was tested. As the optically active substituents necessarily possess interesting electronic properties, a second focus of this work was to utilize the developed ligand systems for MoCo and WCo models and to investigate their potential catalytic activity in the model oxotransfer reaction between DMSO and PPh3 in ...

Detection and Characterization of Polyphosphate-Storing Bacteria in Aquatic Sediments ¤ This thesis investigated the occurrence of polyphosphate (poly-P) in different lake sediments in combination with a molecular characterization of the bacterial communitiy structure on different phylogenetic levels applying 16S rRNA gene clone libraries, DGGE and CARD-FISH. The inducibility of poly-P synthesis in the uppermost sediment layers and stimulation of growth of Poly-P accumulating bacteria (PAO) were studied in laboratory experiments. A high bacterial diversity was found in all studied samples but no significant correlations occurred between poly-P contents and the presence of specific microbial groups. Since analysis of microbial communities using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and FISH did not reveal PAO in the poly-P rich lake sediments a laser microdissection method has been established for the separation of poly-P positive bacterial cells (visualized by DAPI staining under a fluorescence microscope) from lake sediment and activated sludge samples. Coupled with a phylogenetic characterization of the selected bacteria a high diversity of known and unknown PAO were identified across all samples. <engl.> Das Vorkommen von Polyphosphat (Poly-P) in den obersten Sedimentschichten verschiedener Gewässer wurde untersucht. Parallel erfolgte eine molekularbiologische Charakterisierung der Bakteriengemeinschaften auf unterschiedlichem phylogenetischem Niveau durch 16S rDNA Klonbibliotheken, DGGE und CARD-FISH. Ergänzende Untersuchungen wurden mittels Inkubationsexperimenten durchgeführt. Es zeigte sich in allen Proben eine große Diversität, in keinem Fall koinzidierte jedoch ein gehäuftes Vorkommen einer bestimmten Großgruppe mit einem hohen Poly-P Gehalt. Da die bisher eingesetzten Methoden zur Charakterisierung der Bakteriengemeinschaft in Hinblick auf Poly-P speichernden Bakterien (PAO) nicht den erhofften Erfolg brachten, wurde in der vorliegenden Arbeit die Laser-Mikrodissektion für Umweltproben etabliert. Bakterien mit Poly-P Granula wurden gezielt aus Sediment- und Belebtschlammproben separiert und phylogenetisch charakterisiert. Erste Ergebnisse zeigen eine hohe Diversität von bekannten aber auch bisher unbekannten Poly-P speichernden Bakterien in den untersuchten Proben. <dt.>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175289-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129652-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004296-0>

The Fontane workshop : manufacturing realism in the industrial age of print ¤ Introduction : remediating copy and paste -- Media-historical coordinates : literature in the industrial age of print -- Biography vs. autobiography : the making of a compiler -- A living archive : generating input -- The manufacture of literature : generating output -- Coda : the calculated novel : Mathilde Möhring's "uncreative" writing. "With an innovative approach that combines material media history, media theory, and literary poetics, this book reconstructs the great German writer Theodor Fontane's creative process. Petra McGillen follows Fontane into the engine room of his text production. Analyzing a wealth of unexplored archival evidence--which includes a collection of the author's 67 extant notebooks, along with an array of other 'paper tools,' such as cardboard boxes, envelopes, and slips--McGillen demonstrates how Fontane compiled his realist prose works. That is, he assembled them from premediated sources, literally with scissors and glue, in an extraordinarily inorganic and radically intertextual manner that turned 'writing' into a process of ongoing remix. By exploring the far-reaching implications of Fontane's creative practices for our understanding of his authorship, originality, and poetics, this book opens up a completely new way to think about his works and, by extension, 19th-century literary realism. This conceptualization of authors' notebooks as creative tools makes a substantial contribution to scholarship on the history of writing media in several disciplines, from German studies and literary studies to media history, and to our understanding of the relationship between mass media and literary creativity in the late 19th century."--	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167882-5>

Non-canonical structures, they use them differently : information packaging in spoken varieties of English ¤ Summary: This book contributes to the study of information structure in varieties of English around the world. Situated at the interface of dialectology, syntax and pragmatics, it examines structural devices such as left and right dislocation, fronting, existential there-constructions and cleft sentences, which help speakers change the rather fixed word order of present-day English and organize sentence information in ways which are better suited to the discourse context.Approaching information structure from a cross-varietal perspective, this study compares speech data from nine varieties of English, culled from the International Corpus of English and complemented by data from the Corpus of Global Web-based English and the Corpus of Contemporary American English. In its breadth and systematicity of coverage, this is the most comprehensive study to date of the use of information-packaging constructions across varieties of English. Through this comprehensive approach diverging patterns of use and frequency distributions can be identified. Factors impacting on the frequency of use involve substrate influence in language contact situations, universal developmental processes in language acquisition and specific features of the socio-cultural setting	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165338-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014777-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058779-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1065686323> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076315-8>

Multi-Step multi-input one-way quantum information processing with spatial and temporal modes of light ¤ In this thesis, the author develops for the first time an implementation methodology for arbitrary Gaussian operations using temporal-mode cluster states. The author also presents three experiments involving continuous-variable one-way quantum computations, where their non-classical nature is shown by observing entanglement at the outputs. The experimental basic structure of one-way quantum computation over two-mode input state is demonstrated by the controlled-Z gate and the optimum nonlocal gate experiments.

Advancing the characterization of neuronal cyto-architecture by x-ray phase-contrast tomography ¤ To bring physiology and pathology of the human brain into better micro-anatomical and histological context, studies with different methodologies are required. Established techniques such as electron microscopy or histology show limitations in view of invasiveness, labor-intense and artifact-prone sample preparation, as well as an adequate ratio between resolution and volume throughput. For this reason, X-ray phase-contrast tomography (PC-CT) has been proposed as a three-dimensional non-destructive imaging technique, which requires less effort in sample preparation and can assess larger volumes. Furthermore, it offers quantitative electron density based contrast even for unstained tissue. Up to now, however, PC-CT studies fell short in number of samples, so that structural alterations caused by neurodegenerative diseases cannot be distinguished from physiological inter-subject variations. In this thesis, the scalability of PC-CT with respect to the required number of samples and resolution-to-volume-throughput is demonstrated, and the methodology is advanced with respect to data acquisition, processing and segmentation. In addition to the human cerebellum, cortex and hippocampus are studied. Concerning quantification and analysis of PC-CT data, this work introduces optimal transport analysis to obtain quantitative metrics of the cyto-architecture and to identify changes due to neurodegenerative diseases. For the case of Alzheimer’s disease, this workflow reveals a yet undescribed compactification of granular cells in the human hippocampus. This thesis also provides optimized configurations to study neural tissues with laboratory instrumentation, and – finally – provides new correlative imaging approaches, in particular with scanning electron microscopy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4159947-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113240-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4475269-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174161-4>
Interacting with personal fabrication devices ¤ Personal fabrication tools, such as 3D printers, are on the way of enabling a future in which non-technical users will be able to create custom objects. However, while the hardware is there, the current interaction model behind existing design tools is not suitable for non-technical users. Today, 3D printers are operated by fabricating the object in one go, which tends to take overnight due to the slow 3D printing technology. Consequently, the current interaction model requires users to think carefully before printing as every mistake may imply another overnight print. Planning every step ahead, however, is not feasible for non-technical users as they lack the experience to reason about the consequences of their design decisions. In this dissertation, we propose changing the interaction model around personal fabrication tools to better serve this user group. We draw inspiration from personal computing and argue that the evolution of personal fabrication may resemble the evolution of personal computing: Computing started with machines that executed a program in one go before returning the result to the user. By decreasing the interaction unit to single requests, turn-taking systems such as the command line evolved, which provided users with feedback after every input. Finally, with the introduction of direct-manipulation interfaces, users continuously interacted with a program receiving feedback about every action in real-time. In this dissertation, we explore whether these interaction concepts can be applied to personal fabrication as well. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125909-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027266-7>
Role of calmodulin-like proteins in calcium-mediated herbivore defense pathways in arabidopsis ¤ During their lifetime, plants need to adapt to various stimuli originating from the abiotic and biotic environment. One major biotic stress factor is the attack of herbivorous insects feeding on the plant. During the feeding process wounding of plant tissue and contact with elicitors in insect’s oral secretion (OS) occurs. The early events upon perception of these stimuli are still poorly understood. Elevations in cytosolic calcium are one of these early events, which activate the downstream signaling network. To reach this a proper decoding of calcium signals is important. In this study it was demonstrated that in Arabidopsis thaliana, several members of the calmodulin-like proteins (CMLs), one group of calcium sensors, are induced upon OS of the generalist herbivore Spodoptera littoralis. In herbivory, CML37 is strongly upregulated upon mechanical wounding, but responds additionally to elicitors in OS. Upon stress stimuli, CML37 binds to cytosolic free calcium and undergoes conformational changes. Mutation of CML37 increases plants susceptibility to herbivore feeding indicating that CML37 acts as a positive defense regulator. Beside herbivore defense, CML37 is also involved in ABA signaling during drought stress where mutation of CML37 results in drastically reduced survival of plants. Plant defense is a complex network of different pathways. Next to the jasmonate pathway, also the accumulation of γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) is calcium-mediated. Upon elevation of cytosolic calcium and binding by calmodulin (CaM), the glutamate decarboxylases (GADs) are activated and GABA produced. It was demonstrated that GABA is accumulated upon wounding of plant tissue and Spodoptera littoralis feeding. Higher level of GABA in a mutant or in artificial diet significantly reduced growth of Spodoptera littoralis larvae showing that herbivore-induced accumulation of GABA is a wound-induced, JA-independent and systemic plant defense.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141299-0>
Synthesis of artificial building blocks for sortase-mediated ligation and their enzymatic linkage ¤ The enzyme Sortase A catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond between the recognition sequence LPXTG and an oligoglycine. While manifold ligations between proteins and various biomolecules, proteins and small synthetic molecules as well as proteins and surfaces have been reported, the aim of this thesis was to investigate the sortase-catalyzed linkage between artificial building blocks. Hence, this could pave the way for the use of sortase A for tasks from a chemical point of view and maybe even materials science. For the proof of concept, the studied systems were kept as simple as possible at first by choosing easily accessible silica NPs and commercially available polymers. These building blocks were functionalized with peptide motifs for sortase-mediated ligation. Silica nanoparticles were synthesized with diameters of 60 and 200 nm and surface modified with C=C functionalities.

Standards of Democratic Legitimization : An Examination of the Jurisprudential Discourse on Democratic Standards in German Constitutional Law and Primary Law of the European Union ¤ The concept of democratic legitimization is used in various disciplines and also in different legal contexts. However, it is regularly not a matter of one and the same legal standard; rather, German constitutional law and EU primary law appear to contain very different approaches. There are also certain shifts in discourse between jurisprudence and legal scholarship. The thesis differentiates methodologically and disciplinarily in order to put the different positions in relation to each other and to gain a better overview of the discourse.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7634864-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128412-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114382-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182672-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115710-2>
Studies towards radical and metalhydride mediated carbonylation reactions ¤ In this dissertation, we present a new method for the Mn-catalyzed ring-opening carbonylation of cyclobutanols. Next, we describe the C-C coupling reaction of alkenylboronic acids and arendiazonium tetrafluoroborate salts to afford stilbenes. We then report the first Pd-catalyzed oxidative carbonylation in which the oxidant could be completely replaced by visible light. Oxalamides were obtained from the corresponding amines. Finally, we describe a direct one-step synthesis of ethylene glycol from paraformaldehyde.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147316-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029921-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183323-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166199-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043793-0>
Security as a Principle: A Basic Rights Doctrine Reconstruction in EU Law at the Example of Cybersecurity ¤ In its basic rights doctrine, security takes on various different guises. However, the understandings of security as a legitimate aim, as a positive obligation to protect, or even as a fundamental right, do not do justice to its special need to be treated differently. How, then, might security be fundamentally re-thought? In his ruling on data retention, the European Court of Justice recently derived a separate fundamental right to security from Article 6 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This continues the trend of constitutionalizing security policy, which has primarily been observed at the national level, to the European level. However, security is seen sociologically and politically as a particularly negotiable protective good. Sebastian Leuschner criticizes the idea of security as the content of constitutional protection claims in EU law in general and with regard to cybersecurity in particular. He shows its contradictions to the EU constitutional principles of democracy and separation of powers and develops an alternative within the framework of basic rights doctrine: the EU security principle as a principle in the sense of Article 52(5) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133886-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022344-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4266146-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054790-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128511-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129195-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274324-2>
Multi-Algorithmen-Rendering : Real-time 3D rendering of heterogeneous scenes ¤ Many large virtual 3D scenes are not structured evenly, for example because they exhibit a highly varying density distribution of their polygons. For such heterogeneous data, there is no single algorithm that constantly performs well with any type of scene and that is able to render the scene at each position fast with the same high image quality. For a small set of scenes, this situation can be improved, if an experienced user is able to manually assign different rendering algorithms to particular parts of the scene. We introduce the Multi- Algorithm-Rendering method which automatically deploys different rendering algorithms simultaneously for a broad range of scene types. The method divides the scene into suitable subregions and measures the behavior of the different algorithms for each region in a preprocessing step. During runtime, this data is utilized to compute an estimate for the quality and running time of the available rendering algorithms from the observers point of view. By solving an optimizing problem embedded in a control cycle, the image quality can be optimized by the appropriate assignment of algorithms to regions, while keeping the achieved frame rate almost constant. In an experimental evaluation, we compare our methods running time and image quality with that of standard rendering algorithms. BEGIN END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4219666-8>
The legitimacy of EU criminal law ¤ This book traces the history of the EU competence, EU policy discourse and EU legislation in the field of criminalisation from Maastricht until the present day. It asks 'Why EU Criminal Law?' looking at what rationales the Treaty, policy document and legislation put forth when deciding whether a certain behaviour should be a criminal offence. To interpret the EU approach to criminalisation, it relies on both modern and post-modern theoretical frameworks on the legitimacy of criminal law, read jointly with the theories on the functions of EU harmonisation of national law. The book demonstrates that while EU constitutional law leans towards an effectiveness-based, enforcement-driven, understanding of criminal law, the EU has in fact in more than one instance adopted symbolic EU criminal law, ie criminal law aimed at highlighting what values are important to the EU, but which is not fit to actually deter individuals from harming such values. The book then questions whether this approach is consistent or in contradiction with the values-based constitutional identity the EU has set for itself.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170174-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057795-8>
Numerical simulation of ice accretion on coated wind turbine blades ¤ This thesis aims to develop new OpenFOAM codes to simulate the ice accretion on wind turbine blades in cold climates and the effects of ice-phobic coatings on the overall anti-icing heat. To avoid high computational costs of resolving complex profiles of ice, rough wall functions are used to model the effects of roughness on the airflow without completely resolving the flow field. Water particles carried by air are then tracked using Lagrangian particle tracking to calculate the exact locations of impingement on the surface to determine whether the particles are pinned or bouncing on the surface. The water mass on the surface is determined and the thermodynamic model of icing is solved to determine the ice profile. A 3D rotating wind turbine blade is simulated using the quasi-3D technique and compared with other CFD codes for validation and the expected minimum anti-icing heat in case ordinary surfaces is compared to the ice-phobic case to study the feasibility of such coatings.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151476-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189962-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4286652-2>
Essays on real estate and financial crisis : from the US housing market downturn to the global financial crisis ¤ The thesis studies three pivotal episodes in the evolution of what became the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-09. These three events - the collapse of the US housing market, the breakdown of the repo money market, and the banking crash - are indispensable for understanding some of the key economic forces that supposedly lay behind the escalation of the Global Financial Crisis. They tell a story of what went wrong and why. For instance, had mortgage contracts not been ill-designed in the sense that they facilitated deliberate defaults, the drag on the wider US housing market would have been less dramatic. Had large financial institutions not relied that heavily on short-term funding backed by US housing collateral, they might have been able to sufficiently roll over their obligations. Had the hoarding of liquid securities by prime brokers not harmed financial intermediation, the secured funding market might not have squeezed. Consequently, the investment bank Lehman Brothers would have possibly been intact today. No financial contagion would have been released. But unfortunately, all of these events did occur. Nonetheless, this experience gives policy makers, professionals and researchers the opportunity to learn how comparable episodes of turbulence might be better coped with.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123416-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7635855-0>
Scaling laws for internally heated mantle convection ¤ This work presents a new method to simulate mantle convection in a 3D spherical shell with fully spatially varying viscosities. The formulation of the governing equations is based on the finite-volume (FV) method for fully irregular grids using Voronoi-cells. The simulation code is efficiently parallelized for more than 1000 CPUs. A new irregular grid with varying lateral resolution, the spiral grid, was investigated. The discretization method is second-order accurate in space and time. The Krylov-subspace solver BiCGS with a Jacobi preconditioner is employed to solve the resulting system of equations. The discretization of the stress tensor can handle viscosity variations of up to 8 orders of magnitude from cell-to-cell and up to 45 orders of magnitude system wide. As an application to purely internally heated mantle convection in a spherical shell, a parameter study of 88 cases is carried out to derive scaling laws for heat transport, stagnant-lid thickness and structural complexity...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4354719-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1>

Improving educational outcomes : analyses of intervention and public opinion ¤ Katharina Wedel prepared this study while she was working at the Center for the Economics of Education at the ifo Institute. The study was completed in September 2023 and accepted as doctoral thesis by the Department of Economics at LMU Munich. It consists of four distinct empirical essays that address various aspects of the economics of education. Chapter 2 sheds light on the interaction of two inputs into the education production function: instruction time and teacher qualifications. The results show that teacher qualifications play a moderating role for the effect of instruction time on student achievement. Chapter 3 examines dropout from a mentoring program designed to help disadvantaged adolescents and analyzes a program agency's cost-benefit trade-offs in the decision to target additional interventions to prevent dropout. Chapter 4 investigates public opinion towards targeted financial support and the role of external circumstances compared to own effort for (educational) success. This chapter shows how information on the differences in academic-track attendance by parental background in Germany increases the perception that external circumstances determine educational success, and private donations to charities but does not affect demand for redistributive education spending. Finally, chapter 5 studies the consequences of technological change on individuals' labor-market expectations and their intentions to participate in further training. Experimental results show that information about the automatability of one's occupation affects labor-market expectations and increases the likelihood to participate in further training and retraining.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006681-2>
Charge and Spin Transport in Disordered Graphene-Based Materials ¤ INTRODUCTION -- Electronic and Transport Properties of Graphene -- The Real Space Order O(N) Transport Formalism -- Transport in Disordered Graphene -- Spin Transport in Disordered Graphene -- Conclusions. This thesis presents an in-depth theoretical analysis of charge and spin transport properties in complex forms of disordered graphene. It relies on innovative real space computational methods of the time-dependent spreading of electronic wave packets. First a universal scaling law of the elastic mean free path versus the average grain size is predicted for polycrystalline morphologies, and charge mobilities of up to 300.000 cm2/V.s are determined for 1 micron grain size, while amorphous graphene membranes are shown to behave as Anderson insulators. An unprecedented spin relaxation mechanism, unique to graphene and driven by spin/pseudospin entanglement is then reported in the presence of weak spin-orbit interaction (gold ad-atom impurities) together with the prediction of a crossover from a quantum spin Hall Effect to spin Hall effect (for thallium ad-atoms), depending on the degree of surface ad-atom segregation and the resulting island diameter.

The Federalism of Fundamental Rights in the United States of America: A Representation in the Context of the Debate on the Binding of Member States to the Fundamental Rights of the European Union ¤ The applicability of the Charta of Fundamental Rights to EU member states is one of the big construction sites of EU federalism. The thesis casts a glance across the Atlantic and examines fundamental rights protection in US federalism, which reveals remarkable similarities, and yet major differences compared to the EU and the applicability of the Charta. First, it examines the case law of the U.S. Supreme Court that has made individual rights of the Federal Constitution widely applicable to the States. It has thus led to a unitarian protection of fundamental rights. In a second step, the thesis looks to State courts and their (re-)federalization of fundamental rights protection. State courts have interpreted their own constitutions’ rights to partially grant more protection than the Federal Constitution. The thesis is the result of research conducted at the University of California, Berkeley.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115712-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170174-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4271809-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022344-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4267736-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017754-3>

Distribution patterns and environmental drivers of methane-cycling microorganisms in natural environments and restored wetlands ¤ Methane is an important greenhouse gas contributing to global climate change. Natural environments and restored wetlands contribute a large proportion to the global methane budget. Methanogenic archaea (methanogens) and methane oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs), the biogenic producers and consumers of methane, play key roles in the methane cycle in those environments. A large number of studies revealed the distribution, diversity and composition of these microorganisms in individual habitats. However, uncertainties exist in predicting the response and feedback of methane-cycling microorganisms to future climate changes and related environmental changes due to the limited spatial scales considered so far, and due to a poor recognition of the biogeography of these important microorganisms combining global and local scales. With the aim of improving our understanding about whether and how methane-cycling microbial communities will be affected by a series of dynamic environmental factors in response to climate change, this PhD thesis ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169678-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039226-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124348-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016960-1>
Authenticity in political communication : conceptualization, measurement, and examination of a popular concept ¤ This dissertation investigates the concept of political authenticity from a communication science perspective. The literature on political personalization and changing notions of good politicians constitutes the theoretical framework for the three research articles in the thesis. The first article offers a communication science conceptualization of political authenticity. Based on a narrative literature review, it proposes a definition of political authenticity, identifies research perspectives to analyze the concept, and derives four theoretical concept dimensions (consistency, ordinariness, intimacy, and immediacy). The article integrates the perspectives and dimensions to derive a process model for the public construction of political authenticity. The second article draws upon the conceptualization of political authenticity to develop and validate a new scale for perceived political authenticity. Three consecutive empirical studies were conducted to test the composition, performance, and validity of the instrument. Results from an expert panel and two independent online quota surveys suggest a three-dimensional 12-item scale. The new P-PA Scale was found to be a robust and reliable measure that highly correlates with relevant political attitudes and behavioral intentions. Finally, the third article investigated the effects of political media exposure on perceived political authenticity. It draws on the literature on media priming theory, performed political authenticity in social media, personalization in media reporting, and dual processing theory to derive assumptions about media exposure effects on political authenticity. Results show that differences in perceived political authenticity are related to exposure to political information in different media types. Overall, the thesis sheds light on a popular concept in modern political communication and makes theoretical, methodological, and empirical contributions to its investigation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193985-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062860-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120719-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134262-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076217-8>
Novel nanostructured materials from cellulose esters ¤ Cellulose, the most abundant natural polymer on earth, constitutes virtually an inexhaustible source for the fabrication of nanostructured materials. Combining its biocompatibility and biodegradability, cellulose-based nanostructured materials possess significant benefits when compared to conventional nanostructured materials. Nanostructured materials, such as cellulose nanocrystals and cellulose nanofibers, have been isolated from cellulose, via top-down approaches. The present thesis focuses on the bottom-up approach for constructing nanostructured materials with cellulose derivatives, wh...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4204530-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4431018-3>
The Mimicry of International Law : Andrés Bello's "Principios de Derecho Internacional" ¤ To this day, the history of international law is dominated by a Eurocentric historiography in which non-European worlds play a passive role at best. Master narratives of universalisation and progress may include their histories; however, they appear not in the form of actors, but as mere receivers.By analysing the first Hispano-American textbook on international law, this transdisciplinary study questions this narrative of passivity. In his compendium, published in 1833, the Chilean polymath Andrés Bello translated Euro-pean doctrines of international law for use in the context of the “New World”. Using a postcolonial approach, the study demonstrates that the imitation of the European discourse on international law was not a purely passive and submissive act, but deeply ambivalent behaviour which opens up a space for resistance and is reminiscent of Homi K. Bhabha’s concept of mimicry.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063693-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4566658-1>
Use-conditional meaning: studies in multidimensional semantics ¤ This book seeks to bring together the pragmatic theory of 'meaning as use' with the traditional semantic approach that considers meaning in terms of truth conditions. Daniel Gutzmann adopts core ideas by the philosopher David Kaplan in assuming that the meaning of expressions such as oops or damn can be captured by giving the conditions under which they can be felicitously used. He develops a multidimensional approach to meaning, called hybrid semantics, that incorporates use conditions alongside truth conditions in a unified framework. This new system overcomes the empirical gaps and conceptual problems associated with previous multidimensional systems; it also lessens the burden on the compositional system by shifting restrictions on the combination of use-conditional expressions to the lexicon-semantics interface instead of building them directly into the combinatoric rules	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076315-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054490-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074915-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122144-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201436-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005184-5>
Novel postmodifications of the Ugi reaction ¤ BEGIN multi component reaction; microwave; Staudinger-aza-Wittig reaction; copper catalysis; palladium catalysis; ortho-amidine; triazine; indazolone; hydroxytriazafluorendione; 1,6-enyne In this thesis several novel postmodifiactions of regular Ugi-4CR products have been examined. Their scope and limitations were tested both by permutating the required functionalities around the Ugi scaffold and by synthesizing compound libraries for successful permutations. The following reactions were examined: 1. Radical cyclizations of Ugi-4CR products with o-halogenoaryl and alkene substituents. The Ugi-4CR scaffold was found to be stable under radical cylization conditions with Bu3SnH but not with (Me3Si)3SiH. 2. PdII/IV catalyzed oxidative cyclization of 1,6-enynes to substituted 3-aza-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-ones. 3. Cyclizations strategies for tetrazol-Ugi-4CR products of boc-hydrazine. 4. Improved synthesis of highly substituted indazolones with improved yields and a fourth point of diversity. 5. Cyclizations of Ugi-4CR products derived from 2-azidoethylamine by a Staudinger/aza-Wittig reaction sequence. In some cases the formation of the corresponding o-amidines was observed.

Supernovae observations and dark energy models ¤ In this thesis we review data sets available from various SNe groups like SNLS and HSST and utilize them to put constraints the cosmological parameters. We use the software CMBEASY to apply the MCMC method to models like lambdaCDM, Constant Equation of State (EoS) w and Quintessence, with our emphasis being on the IPL and Corasaniti model. We do the analysis using the Riess Gold Set, the SNLS sample and the Union Data Set (with and without systematics). We have extended CMBEASY to include the Union Data Set and hence be up-to-date with latest observations. Our results show that omega m might be smaller than commonly assumed. Further, we find that irrespective of model or data set chosen we get approximately the same value for omega m, whereas this is not the case with w. The work in this thesis indicates that the emphasis in constructing new cosmological models should change from empirical to theoretical motivations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184117-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7589166-9>

New concepts for parallel object-relational query processing ¤ During the last few years, parallel object-relational database management systems have emerged as the leading data management technology on the market. These systems are extensible by user-defined data types and user-defined functionality for the data. This work focuses on the efficient parallel execution of user-defined functionality. The main contributions describe techniques to support data parallelism for user-defined scalar and aggregate functions and intra-function parallelism for the execution of a scalar function on a large object, and a new technology to provide extensibility with regard to new set-oriented database operations that can efficiently implement user-defined functionality in parallel object-relational database management systems	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4391852-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4378490-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075860-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4534774-8>

Above-threshold ionization driven by spatially structured laser fields ¤ Strong laser fields are a valuable tool to study the electron dynamics in atoms and molecules. A prominent strong-field process is the above-threshold ionization (ATI). Recent advances in the generation of intense laser beams at mid-infrared wavelengths enable the investigation of ATI in a new parameter range. Moreover, laser beams with a sophisticated spatial structure as a result of an orbital angular momentum (twisted light) have found applications in the strong-field regime. In this dissertation, we theoretically investigate ATI driven by mid-infrared and twisted light beams. We show that their spatial dependence has a pronounced impact on the ionization dynamics due to nondipole interactions. Therefore, we develop a general theoretical approach to ATI that incorporates this spatial structure: in order to extend the strong-field approximation (SFA), we construct nondipole Volkov states which describe the photoelectron continuum dressed by the laser field. The resulting nondipole SFA allows the treatment of ATI driven by spatially structured laser fields. We apply this SFA to the ATI driven by plane-wave laser beams and show that peak shifts in the photoelectron momentum distributions can be computed in good agreement with experiments. As a second application, we consider the ATI driven by standing waves, known as high-intensity Kapitza-Dirac effect. Here, we calculate the momentum transfer to photoelectrons for elliptically polarized standing waves and demonstrate that low- and high-energy photoelectrons exhibit different angular distributions. Finally, we investigate the ATI of localized atomic targets driven by few-cycle Bessel pulses. We demonstrate that the photoelectrons can be emitted along the propagation direction of the pulse owing to longitudinal electric field components. Moreover, the ATI spectra depend on both the opening angle and the orbital angular momentum of the Bessel pulse. We also discuss the extension of this work towards long pulses.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4226687-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003423-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/120824017X> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153902-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4234583-2>
Understanding massive disk galaxy formation through resolved stellar populations ¤ In this thesis we utilize resolved stellar populations to improve our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. In the first part we improve a method for metallicity determination of faint old stellar systems, in the second and third part we analyze the individual history of six nearby disk galaxies outside the Local Group. A New Calibration of the Color Metallicity Relation of Red Giants for HST data: It is well known, that the color distribution of stars on the the Red Giant Branch (RGB) can be used to determine metallicities of old stellar populations that have only shallow photometry. Based on the largest sample of globular clusters ever used for such studies, we quantify the relation between metallicity and color in the widely used HST ACS filters F606W and F814W. We use a sample of globular clusters from the ACS Globular Cluster Survey and measure their RGB color at given absolute magnitudes to derive the color-metallicity relation. We find a clear relation between metallicity and RGB color; we investigate the scatter of this relation and check if it is applicable for different luminosity ranges. We discuss the implications of this relation on the determination of metallicities of old stellar populations and present examples for the application of this relation on the analysis of HST data. In the second part of the work we analyze the individual history of six nearby disk galaxies outside the Local Group. We use the resolved stellar populations to reconstruct the history of the galaxies and investigate the effects of different factors on galaxy evolution. In the third part of the work we improve a method for metallicity determination of faint old stellar systems. We use a combination of photometric and spectroscopic data to determine the metallicity of stars in these systems. We discuss the implications of this method on the determination of metallicities of old stellar populations and present examples for the application of this method on the analysis of HST data.

Arsenic and antimony in the environment : release and possible immobilization mechanisms ¤ This thesis is dedicated to the release and immobilization of As5+ and Sb5+ in contaminated geomaterials. Although the physical properties and chemical composition of the contaminated materials vary widely, the mechanisms, which control the fate of the contaminants are supposedly similar. In order to understand these mechanisms, I carried out a mineralogical and geochemical investigation of a soil, which was mixed with contaminated As-rich ash waste. With techniques including powder-PXRD, ICP-MS, sequential extractions, EMPA and synchrotron based µ-XRD and XANES, the carriers of As5+ in the fresh ash waste and soil-ash mixtures were identified and characterized. Glass particles and unburned coal particles with veinlets of As-rich calcite are the main carriers of As5+. In the soil-ash mixtures, the soluble As5+ containing phases of the ash-waste almost completely disappeared and As5+ migrated into the soil components, presumably consisting of iron oxides. In the following study, the immobilization of As5+ by iron oxides in the context of As5+ incorporation in hematite was investigated. As5+-ferrihydrite was transformed to hematite and examined by ICP-MS, powder-XRD, SEM, TEM, and EXAFS spectroscopy. The results show that As5+ can be incorporated into hematite with concentrations of 1.9 wt%. This novel immobilization mechanism encouraged me to investigate the possibility of Sb5+ incorporation into iron oxides in a subsequent study. Ferrihydrite was doped with different concentrations of Sb5+, As5+, and P5+ and transformed to more-well crystalline products. The transformation products were analyzed and characterized by ICP-MS, PXRD, SEM and TEM. The results show that Sb5+ directly controls the outcome of the ferrihydrite transformation and therefore the transformation products. These transformation products contain Sb5+ with up to 14 wt.%, exceeding an exclusive adsorption mechanism by far, suggesting structural incorporation of Sb5+ into the iron oxides.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188107-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4206275-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143104-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4480680-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142712-9>

Increasing culturability of plant microbiome towards core microbiome manipulation and engineering ¤ This study aimed to optimize the use of plant-based culture media for exploration of the plant-associated microbiota and extend the culturability borders to isolate novel bacterial taxa and meticulously characterize the culture-dependent and culture-independent microbiomes in view of the developed plant-based culture media. Throughout the study, we could prove that plant-based culture media are able to support the recovery of previously uncultured plant-associated bacteria, and also support the enrichment of bacterial lineages that belong to the candidate phyla radiation (CPR).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169816-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045539-7>
Encountering empire : African American missionaries in colonial Africa, 1900-1939 ¤ In Encountering Empire, Elisabeth Engel traces how black American missionaries – men and women grappling with their African heritage – established connections in Africa during the heyday of European colonialism. Reconstructing the black American 'colonial encounter,' Engel analyzes the images, transatlantic relationships, and possibilities of representation African American missionaries developed for themselves while negotiating colonial regimes. Between 1900 and 1939, these missionaries paved the way for the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the oldest independent black American institution, to establish a presence in Britain's sub-Saharan colonies. Illuminating a neglected chapter of Atlantic history, Engel demonstrates that African Americans used imperial structures for their own self-determination. Encountering Empire thus challenges the notion that pan-Africanism was the only viable strategy for black emancipation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039575-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116433-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073624-6>
Investigations on post-transcriptional gene silencing in (monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous) plants and its influence on increasing transgene expression ¤ post-transcriptional gene silencing; recombinant proteins; barley; GFP-expression; RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs); Arabidopsis thaliana; GUS-expression; DNA methylation; siRNAs Post-transcriptional gene silencing; recombinant proteins; barley; GFP-expression; RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs); Arabidopsis thaliana; GUS-expression; DNA methylation; siRNAs The aim of this thesis was to investigate to what extent the mechanisms of post-transcriptional gene silencing influence the expression of recombinant proteins in the endosperm of barley (Hordeum vulgare). In a parallel approach, studies on the mechanism of post-transcriptional gene silencing were conducted in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The roles of different RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs) in transcription-level post-transcriptional gene silencing were investigated in A. thaliana using a reverse-genetic approach. 4xGUS rdr5 plants showed a similarly high GUS-expression as 4xGUS rdr6 plants. No GUS-derived siRNAs could be detected. In comparison to 4xGUS rdr6 plants, the DNA methylation of GUS sequences in 4xGUS rdr5 plants was less reduced and was highly variable between individual plants. The results for RDR5 suggest a similar function in the context of transcription-level post-transcriptional gene silencing as for RDR6. This was the first time a function for RDR5 was described. In the second experimental approach, a collection of transgenic lines with defined, different copy numbers (one to five) of a GFP reporter gene under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter was generated in barley. The strongest GFP-expression or fluorescence was found in line PS 379 with 3 T-DNA copies, the lowest GFP-expression or fluorescence in line BA 49 with 5 T-DNA copies. There was no linear increase in GFP-expression with the number of T-DNA copies. This can be interpreted as consistent with transcription-level post-transcriptional gene silencing in the endosperm of barley. Furthermore, hybrid lines with even higher T-DNA copy numbers (up to eight T-DNA copies) were generated, which are now available for further studies on post-transcriptional gene silencing in the endosperm of barley.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156898-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4277353-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4820638-6>
DiverCity - global cities as a literary phenomenon : Toronto, New York, and Los Angeles in a globalizing age ¤ Based on the structured analysis of selected North American novels, this work examines global cities as a literary phenomenon (»DiverCity«). By analyzing Dionne Brand's Toronto, »What We All Long For« (2005), Chang-rae Lee's New York, »Native Speaker« (1995), and Karen Tei Yamashita's Los Angeles, »Tropic of Orange« (1997), Melanie U. Pooch provides the connecting link for exploring the triad of globalization and its effects, global cities as cultural nodal points, and cultural diversity in a globalizing age as a literary phenomenon. Thus, she contributes to a global, interdisciplinary, and multi-perspectival understanding of literature, culture, and society.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126697-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4725236-4>
Copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition as synthetic tool for triazole-based ligands ¤ Within the last five years, chemists have identified a wide range of additional applications for the 1H-1,2,3-triazole heterocycle, e.g., synthesizing bidentate 2-pyridyl-substituted 1H-1,2,3-triazole (trzpy) ligands. The system itself is known since 1970 and has been obtained by recyclization of v-triazolo[l,5-a]pyridines. In 1977, Seebach et al. combined non-enolizable nitriles and lithiated nitrosamines providing N1-substituted trzpys. The regioselective copper(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of 2-ethynylpyridines with organic azides exclusively yields 1,4-substituted trzpys, a very versatile scaffold offering plenty of beneficial properties. This thesis compiles construction, metal coordination chemistry and macromolecular chemistry of trzpy ligands. The regioselective copper(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between organic azides and terminal alkynes (CuAAC) represented the key step for the preparation of the trzpy-based chelators. The use of the triazole entity provided a facile access to bidentate chelates that can be regarded as analogs to 2,2´-bipyridines. Using the CuAAC as a synthetic tool enabled a convenient functionalization of the trzpy ligands: Reactive functional groups can be directly introduced by designing the organic azide and allow subsequent chemical transformations, such as the application of radical polymerization methods. Furthermore, the CuAAC is able to support the introduction of additional functional moieties at the triazole (providing solubility, introducing substituents) due to its high tolerance to a wide range of reaction conditions and to a large independence on the electronic configuration of the deployed reactants.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186045-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4223142-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4266702-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148483-6>
Object alignment and detection ¤ BEGIN Abstract: Alignment of images is one of the central problems in computer vision. This work focuses on alignment in general and on optical flow in particular. For the latter, we propose a combinatorial matching algorithm that improves the performance of a whole class of current state-of-the-art methods.<br>Apart from classical optical flow estimation, we introduce an alignment algorithm capable of matching different objects from different scenes. We formulate this as an energy minimization task where the energy takes similarity and motion into account and is thus a powerful distance measure. We evaluate this in terms of nearest neighbor queries and clustering tasks.<br>Furthermore, at the task of object detection, we employ these distances to partition the training data. The known alignment helps the detector to deal with the variation within the data set.<br>Switching from images to videos, we integrate cues from detection and optical flow into semantic video object segmentation. Especially the tracks of detection improve the results in many cases where motion based approaches fail, and it also gives the segmented objects a semantic meaning.<br>The thesis ends with an object detector that uses the proposed video segmentation to retrain itself Abstract: Alignment of images is one of the central problems in computer vision.

Exogenous effects of alpha-linolenic and linoleic acid on the fatty acid distribution and the regulation of lipid metabolism in ruminant tissues ¤ This work is concerned with the exogenous effects of alpha-linolenic (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA) on the fatty acid distribution and the regulation of lipid metabolism in ruminant tissues. Two animal experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of diets enriched in ALA or LA in German Simmental and Holstein bulls. The influence of LA and ALA enriched diets on the protein expression of lipogenic enzymes in cattle, the tissue specific differences and the relationship between protein expression of lipogenic enzymes, enzyme activities and the products of these enzymes as well as the absorption and deposition of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids in ruminants and beef products was analyzed. Feeding a diet enriched in LA or ALA results in an increased deposition of these fatty acids, induced chain elongation, desaturation and deposition of the long-chain products in tissues of ruminants. Essential fatty acids are preferentially deposited in longissimus muscle (MLD) compared to subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and also preferred in erythrocytes; conclusively they are good long-time marker for the fatty acid intake. Despite the low proportion of de novo fatty acid synthesis in the liver of ruminants the concentration of n-3 fatty acids and de novo synthesised n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids is much higher compared to MLD. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185477-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153047-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018837-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4146912-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191159-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4768139-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035875-6>
Role of bacterial biofilms and extracellular polymeric substances in the colloidal stability and transport of hematite nanoparticles in synthetic porous media ¤ The heterogeneous physicochemical properties of biofilm and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) play an important role in deciding the fate of transport of nanoparticles in subsurface. However, contrasting results have been observed for the mobility of different nanoparticle transport in porous media coated with biofilms. Also, no comparative studies have been done linking the effect of biofilms on colloidal stability and mobility of colloids to date. Laboratory scale experiments were conducted to obtain insights into different ways bacterial biofilms and EPS can influence the transport of nanoparticles in porous media. Using complementary experimental approaches, we investigated (1) the effect of microbial EPS on the colloidal stability of nanoparticles, (2a.) the transport of uncoated colloidal nanoparticles in biofilm and EPS-coated porous media, (2b.) the transport of EPS-coated colloidal nanoparticles in uncoated porous media (2c), the combined transport of EPS-coated colloids in biofilm and EPS-coated porous media, and finally (3) the remobilization of deposited colloidal nanoparticles by EPS. Laboratory synthesized hematite nanoparticles (HNP) and Bacillus subtilis 168 (DSM 402) were used as nanoparticles and biofilm forming bacterium respectively. To study the effect of EPS on the colloidal stability, HNP were amended with three increasing concentrations of EPS (20, 200 and 500 mg/l carbon) resulting in carbon:iron ratios 1:5, 2:1 and 5:1, respectively. The zeta potential (ZP), the shift in isoelectric point and the change in the critical coagulation concentration (CCC) for NaCl and CaCl2 showed formation of colloidally stable organo-mineral colloids at higher concentrations of EPS (200 mg/l and 500 mg/l of carbon, HNP2:1, HNP 5:1). However, lower concentrations of EPS (20 mg/l carbon, HNP 1:5) resulted into aggregation of HNP. The transport of uncoated and EPS-coated HNP colloids at environmental pH was studied with closed flow columns experiments in three different synthetic porous media, i.e., uncoated, biofilm-coated, and EPS-coated glass beads. No drastic change was observed in the pH and the electrical conductivity of the system during the transport experiments. However, a constant amount of organic matter and bacterial cells were continuously released from the porous media coatings. In the first scenario, positively charged uncoated HNP were immobile and retained in uncoated-glass bead porous media. Contrary, a mobile fraction of negatively charged HNP was observed in biofilms and EPS-coated porous media. The charge reversal of HNP during transport is due to adsorption of organic matter released from the coatings forming organomineral associations of HNP and components of the biofilm or EPS.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004296-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4443397-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164695-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4232790-8>
Heterogeneous catalysis for the conversion of fructose to chemicals and fuel in a continuous flow process ¤ The valorization of carbohydrates is one of the most promising fields in green chemistry, as it enables to produce bulk chemicals and fuels out of renewable and abundant resources, instead of further exploiting fossil feedstocks. The focus in this thesis is the conversion of fructose, using dehydration and hydrodeoxygenation reactions. The main goal is to find an easy continuous process, including the solubility of the sugar in a green solvent, the conversion over a solid acid as well as over a metal@tungsten carbide catalyst. At the beginning of this thesis, solid acid catalysts are synthesized by using carbohydrate material like glucose and starch at high temperatures (up to 600 °C). Additionally a third carbon is synthesized, using an activation method based on Ca(OH)2. After carbonization and further sulfonation, using fuming sulfuric acid, the three resulting catalysts are characterized together with sulfonated carbon black and Amberlyst 15 as references. In order to test all solid acid catalysts in reaction, a 250 mm x 4.6 mm stainless steel column is used as a fixed-bed continuous reactor. The temperature (110 °C to 250 °C) and residence time (2 to 30 minutes) is varied, and a direct relationship between contact time and selectivity is determined. The reaction mechanism, as well as the product distribution is showing a dehydration step of fructose towards 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). These furan-ring molecules are considered as “sleeping giants”, due to the possibility of using them as fuel, but also for upgrading them to chemicals like terephthalic acid or p-xylene. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155521-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4284824-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4149192-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7563215-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123377-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4226769-9>

Multifunctional Microballoons for the active and passive control of fluid-flows ¤ Functional materials, also called "Smart Materials", are described by their ability to fulfill a desired task through targeted interaction with its environment. Due to this functional integration, such materials are of increased interest, especially in areas where the increasing micronization of components is required. Modern manufacturing processes (e.g. microfluidics) and the availability of a wide variety of functional materials (e.g. shape memory materials) now enable the production of particle-based switching components. This category includes micropumps and microvalves, whose basic function is the active control of liquid flows. One approach in realizing those microcomponents as pursued by this work, enables variable size-switching of water-filled microballoons by implementing a stimulus-sensitive switching motif in the capsule's membrane shell, while being under the influence of a constant driving force. The switching motif with its gatekeeper function has a critical influence on one or more material parameters, which modulate ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274825-2>
Local earthquake tomography in Central Pacific margin of Costa Rica ¤ The Central Pacific area of Costa Rica is a convergent erosional margin, characterized by a high seismicity rate, coincident with the subduction of rough-relief ocean floor. It has generated earthquakes with magnitude up to seven in the past along the subduction megathrust and the inner-forearc faulting. This study uses the records from a temporal seismological network, consisting of on- and offshore stations, installed for a period of six months in this segment of the Middle American margin. The aim was to obtain a model of the 3-D velocity structure of the margin and to characterize the seismicity of the shallow part (< 70 km depth) of the subduction zone, with the focus on the seismogenic zone. A subset of well locatable events was selected to calculate a minimum 1-D model for the P-wave velocity. This model served as initial reference model for the subsequent 3-D inversion in a Local Earthquake Tomography, performed by inverting P- and S-wave traveltimes from 595 selected earthquakes. Several tools for resolution assessment were applied. Additionally, first-motion, double-couple focal mechanisms were determined for earthquakes originated at the plate interface, the subducting slab and the overriding plate. The results reflect the complexity associated to subduction of ocean-floor morphology and the transition from normal to thickened subducting oceanic crust...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180767-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015134-7>
Impacts of temperature regimes and radiation (PAR and UVR) conditions on the possible geographic distribution of desmids ¤ This preliminary study revealed that the Cosmarium strains collected from various geographic regions demonstrated different physiological behaviour which is in accordance with the climate prevailing at the site of the clonal origin. The species- and strain-specific differences were expressed under a set of varying temperature and radiation (PAR and UVR) conditions, demonstrating that the responses are genetically preserved (i.e. such physiological performances can be considered as adaptations - genotypic responses to long-term environmental changes). Acclimation under relatively low light-temperature conditions of a climate chamber affected more photosynthetic parameters than morphological or growth parameters.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4332360-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4727742-7>
The Managing Director's Duty to Act Lawfully in a Capital Market-Oriented Corporation ¤ BEGIN: A managing director’s duty to act lawfully has—despite seeming ostensibly obvious—increasingly received legal research literature’s attention in recent years. This is shown by the various issues controversially discussed to date in connection with the duty to act lawfully and compliance, including its dogmatic foundations, the relationship between legality and the business judgement rule, efficient breaches of public law and contracts, the calculation of damages, the collision of duties as well as approaches to limiting liability. This book discusses the fundamentals and classification of the duty to act lawfully based on the example of a capital market-oriented corporation and examines the controversial issues developed from the aforementioned classification.

Mapping of a machine learning algorithm representation to distributed disaggregated FPGAs ¤ The winding down of Moore's law and the end of Dennard scaling have created a demand for specialized accelerators, including field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), in cloud and high-performance computing to fuel high demanding workloads, like machine learning models and artificial intelligence. At the same time, compute resources are increasingly consumed by cloud offerings to save costs and avoid the maintenance of sparsely utilized on-premise hardware. Despite their advantages in performance, adaptability, and energy-efficiency, FPGAs are not yet being deployed at scale due to their difficult tool support. Therefore, this thesis intends to contribute to a wider adoption of FPGAs in the future with improvements on three levels:First, a system architecture for managing a large number of disaggregated network-attached FPGAs in an efficient, flexible and scalable way is presented. To ensure the integrity of the infrastructure, partial reconfiguration is used to separate the non-privileged user logic from the privileged system logic.The resulting combination of traditional CPU servers and FPGA nodes, which are all connected via the same network, leads to heterogeneous clusters for which no established programming model exists. Here, as a second level of this thesis, the proposed programming models for such clusters are revisited and it is argued that the Message Passing Interface (MPI) is suitable for programming CPU-FPGA clusters.Finally, as a third level of this thesis, a framework for mapping deep neural network (DNN) models to distributed disaggregated FPGAs is developed. After assessing the current state-of-the-art of compilation frameworks for DNNs, the concepts of a meta-compiler and operation set architectures are presented and implemented. This meta-compiler, called DOSA, enables the evaluation, selection, and combination of existing but restricted DNN-to-FPGA tools to leverage previous research and to generate more efficient solutions	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4347749-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193754-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1135808198> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4238872-7>

Comparison results for the one-dimensional marginals of Markov processes are established and then transferred to semimartingales by the method of Markov projections. Also a direct comparison of one-dimensional marginals of general semimartingales is accomplished.

Study and optimization of the morphological characteristics of nanostructures for heterogeneous catalysis applications : theoretical study ¤ BEGIN Abstract: The distinct organization of nanostructured materials influences several catalytic characteristics, like selectivity, sensitivity or catalytic efficiency, which are important issues in catalytic applications, such as fuel cells and electrochemical sensors. Indeed, pores on electrodes provide a three-dimensional active area, which results in a high surface area and an increased reaction rate at the electrode. This work draws the attention to the optimal morphology of hierarchical and non-hierarchical nanostructures and the morphological characteristics that lead to a rational design of heterogeneous nanocatalysts, especially that have sluggish kinetics. Such optimization is achieved through a deep understanding of the catalytic activity of porous layers based on the impact of pore morphology on pore accessibility. For that purpose, four types of nanostructures, i.e., hierarchical external, hierarchical internal, non-hierarchical external and non-hierarchical internal nanostructures, were utilized in simulations of the electrode kinetics of organic and bioorganic fuels oxidation.<br><br>Generally, external nanostructures reveal higher utilization of catalytic surface than internal nanostructures. Simulation results of non-hierarchical nanostructures demonstrate that porous layers with small pores and large numbers of pores are selective to the species with high diffusion coefficient because of high pore accessibility. In contrast, porous electrodes with a low number of large pores and a large top surface area are selective to the species with low diffusion coefficient because of low pore accessibility. Nonetheless, the mass transport in hierarchical external nanostructures is the best among the four investigated nanostructures. Hierarchical external nanostructures show an outstanding accessibility of active sites and a kinetic-controlled regime for the species with low diffusion coefficient. In contrast, hierarchical internal nanostructures show slightly less specific activity than nonhierarchical internal nanostructures because of high total diffusional resistance and longer diffusional path.<br><br>For hierarchical nanostructures optimization, macropore-size exhibit the most comprehensive characteristic for evaluating specific activity and current density of hierarchical nanostructures. The optimal current densities for external and internal hierarchical nanostructures are achieved at macropore-size ranges of 3.2 - 4.5 μm and 1.9 - 3.2 μm, resp ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4342626-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123377-3>
The Gallery and the Rulers' Portraits in Jever Castle: Equipment and Statement of the Potentatengalerie of 1838 against the Background of its Predecessors ¤ The gallery and portraits of the rulers in Jever Castle. The interior design and statement of the Potentatengalerie of 1838. The Jever Castle is one of the most important monuments in the coastal region of northwest Germany. Today it hosts a modern culture and regional history museum. The design of the Beletage dates back to the late1830's period when the last substantial interior reconstruction of the Castle was completed. Today the fürstliche Galerie provides an interesting example of the interior design styles of the early to mid nineteenth century. It is characterized by the hand-painted and stenciled decorations in antique style. A portrait gallery, displaying the 32 Regents of the Jever in chronological order from the period between the 16th and 19th centuries was initiated by the former lord of the castle, the Grand Duke of Oldenburg, Paul Friedrich August. The former portrait ensamble is no longer complete. But the existing source material offer informations about the arrangement of the portraits and their detailed appearance. According to these sources, seven portraits from the set-up time around 1838 in the castle have preserved. The genesis of this room of representation particularly with regard to the architectural and sculptural aspects is the central theme of this work. Both, the written testimonies of the time around 1830, first of all the letters and drawings of the architects, who were in charge of the rebuilding, as well as the still existing relics ...

Intramolecular Structure Formation by Stiffness Variation and the Effect of the Presence of Specific Interactions ¤ Homopolymer; Monte Carlo Simulation; Stochastic Approximation Monte Carlo; contactmarix; Phase diagram; State diagram; Specific Interactions Homopolymer; Monte-Carlo Simulation; Stochastic Approximation Monte-Carlo; Contact matrix; Phase diagram; State diagrams; Specific Interactions This thesis studies the effect of geometric stiffness on structure finding in homopolymers. The basis for the research is an isolated, off-lattice and coarse grained homopolymer chain. The stiffness variation is achieved by the bond length parameter variation. The Stochastic Approximation Monte-Carlo (SAMC) method is used to iteratively determine the logarithm of the density of states ln[g(E)], which leads to a direct access to the thermodynamics of the system. Applying the microcanonical and canonical analysis, state diagrams were created for two different chain lengths. For interpretation of the pseudotransition lines of the state diagram, morphological chain properties were used. For this purpose, spatial expansion and distances, as well as contact matrices, angle correlations and the curvature behaviour were evaluated. In addition to the stiffness, the resulting effects of an additional specific interaction potential were investigated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045956-1>
Characterisation of young nearby stars : the Ursa Major group ¤ This work presents a homogeneous set of stellar parameters for a larger sample of kinematic Ursa Major (UMa) group members with spectral types late-F to early-K. The UMa group is comprised of the stars in the UMa cluster in the Big Dipper constellation and of many co-moving stars spread over the whole sky. The definition of kinematic membership criteria has ever been difficult so that spectroscopic criteria should be added. Previous work indicated that the UMa group members are young with an age of roughly 300 Myrs. The youth leaves traces in the stellar spectrum, i.e. the Li I 6707.8 A absorption line, and activity features, e.g. partial filling-in of the core of the H alpha line due to chromospheric emission. Furthermore rotational line broadening is stronger than that of older stars. Additional to the youth indicators, iron abundance is an appropriate membership criterion in case it is different from that of other groups of stars. Spectroscopic properties of the UMa group already have been specified but resulting membership criteria are rather inconclusive.

Monitoring wetlands and water bodies in semi-arid Sub-Saharan regions ¤ Surface water in wetlands is a critical resource in semi-arid West-African regions that are frequently exposed to droughts. Wetlands are of utmost importance for the population as well as the environment, and are subject to rapidly changing seasonal fluctuations. Dynamics of wetlands in the study area are still poorly understood, and the potential of remote sensing-derived information as a large-scale, multi-temporal, comparable and independent measurement source is not exploited. This work shows successful wetland monitoring with remote sensing in savannah and Sahel regions in Burkina Faso, focusing on the main study site Lac Bam (Lake Bam). Long-term optical time series from MODIS with medium spatial resolution (MR), and short-term synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series from TerraSAR-X and RADARSAT-2 with high spatial resolution (HR) successfully demonstrate the classification and dynamic monitoring of relevant wetland features, e.g. open water, flooded vegetation and irrigated cultivation. Methodological highlights are time series analysis, e.g. spatio-temporal dynamics or multitemporal-classification, as well as polarimetric SAR (polSAR) processing, i.e. the Kennaugh elements, enabling physical interpretation of SAR scattering mechanisms for dual-polarized data. A multi-sensor and multi-frequency SAR data combination provides added value, and reveals that dual-co-pol SAR data is most recommended for monitoring wetlands of this type. The interpretation of environmental or man-made processes such as water areas spreading out further but retreating or evaporating faster, co-occurrence of droughts with surface water and vegetation anomalies, expansion of irrigated agriculture or new dam building, can be detected with MR optical and HR SAR time series. To capture long-term impacts of water extraction, sedimentation and climate change on wetlands, remote sensing solutions are available, and would have great potential to contribute to water management in Africa.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067486-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176770-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016960-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075677-4>
Meaningful Supervision : Dimensions of Supervision Literature in Dialogue with H.-E. Hengstenberg's Understanding of Meaning ¤ Supervision is assumed to be a meaningful form of counselling, which assists in finding meaning in one’s work. This statement is examined through an analysis of relevant literature. The first part of the thesis explores the concept of meaningfulness on the basis of six categories and developes the understanding of supervision. The second part provides a detailed account of current thinking on the topic, and describes further aspects of meaning and sense in supervision. In the third part, Hans-Eduard Hengstenberg’s theory of meaning is presented and applied to supervision. Besides a structure comprised of different elements of meaning and sense, it provides the definition of a criterion for meaningfullness. In the final part the results are compared, discussed and made fruitful for practical application. Thus supervision can help to develop a general competency to deal with questions of meaning, for example in the knowledge of different understandings of sense, a clear distinction between meaningfulness and utility and the definition of criteria for meaningfulness. <engl.> END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172187-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133154-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4149932-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058640-6>
Characterization of macromolecular systems by mass spectrometry and hyphenated techniques ¤ The focus of this thesis was to gain in-depth structural information of synthetic polymers by the application of several combined techniques. The second chapter provides an overview about the influence of the polymer architecture on its characterization by mass spectrometry and complementary methods. In the third chapter, we demonstrate the use of MS, more specifically MALDI-ToF MS, which provides molar masses and dispersity values for poly(furfuryl glycidyl ether) (PFGE). The second example is the study of poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNiPAm) copolymers with glyco-monomers with specific combinations of matrices and cationization agents. The fourth chapter will combine three different examples regarding linear, star-shaped and hybrid polymers, which were analyzed by advanced techniques. The linear copolymers were analyzed by separating them according to their chemical heterogeneity using liquid absorption chromatography at critical conditions (LACCC) of poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEtOx), followed by automated spotting onto a MALDI target, which was subsequently analyzed by MALDI. Secondly, star-shaped polymers: [poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-b-PEtOx]8 were monitored firstly by using LACCC of linear PEO as first separation dimension and furthermore injected onto an SEC column confirming the molar mass. Lastly, a hybrid PEO star-shaped polymer was investigated using MALDI to verify the complete functionality of the core with PEO arms. Finally, the last chapter will focus on the creation of a software to obtain information regarding average composition, overcoming isotopic, overlapping peaks and isobaric species from MS spectra. Moreover, the quantitative studies were carried out by correction of the mass discrimination and isotopic abundance. Consequently, advanced analytical techniques such as different ionization techniques within MS, a range of chromatographic hyphenation and computational methods are implemented for elucidating the complexity of synthetic polymers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046699-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4009840-0>
Klassenmusizieren im Praktikum : Competence Self-Assessments of Music Teacher Trainees ¤ Debate on the effectiveness of practical courses in teacher education has a long history. Today, music-related investigations are still pending. This dissertation examines the self-assessments of student teachers of music (with a focus on music-making) over a five-week practical course with a school class. As a part of the preliminary investigation, an expert survey (n=8) was conducted. Subsequently, music student teachers in the Master's Program at Carl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg (n = 8) were interviewed before, during, and after the practicum. Data was collected via interviews, video-stimulated-interviews and cognitive mapping techniques. The data was then analyzed using qualitative content analysis and descriptive statistics. The insights gained from this study can be used to make adjustments in music teacher training, particularly in the field of making music. Debates on the effectiveness of integrated practical components in teacher education have a long tradition. However, empirical results from the perspective of music education are still pending. The present work examines the competence self-assessments of teacher trainees in the Master's program in music in the field of class music-making during the subject practicum. Using expert interviews (n=8), a preliminary model of class music-specific (teaching) competences was developed first. In the subsequent main study, music teacher trainees at Carl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg (n=8) were interviewed before, during, and after the practicum using guided interviews, video-stimulated recall interviews, and a construction technique. The data was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. The results show that class music-making is characterized by a great diversity, which refers to the understanding of concepts as well as music-related activities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035093-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140880-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127380-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170838-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131522-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133589-2>
Green natural zeolite catalyst - preparation, characterization and acid catalytic performance ¤ Natural clinoptilolite zeolite-CLIN was acidified by ammonium ion exchange followed by calcination and HCl treatment under soft conditions. The influence of the modification type and treatment conditions on the structure, morphology and acidity was studied by XRD, SEM, FTIR, ICP-AES, TG/DSC, ammonia-TPD, 1H, 27Al and 29SI MAS NMR and N2-ads-des. High temperature calcination of NH4-CLIN and concentrated acid has a more severe impact on the clinoptilolite structure. H-CLIN catalysts are potential and active acid catalysts and synthesis-structure-porosity-acidity-activity relationship was found.<eng>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029919-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067660-2>
Criminal Law in the Age of Artificial Intelligence: The Influence of Autonomous Systems and AI on Traditional Criminal Liability Structures ¤ The work deals with criminal law problem areas that arise in the use of AI. Not only AI, but also autonomous systems are finding their way into our everyday lives. Similarities and differences between these concepts and their impact on criminal law assessment are elaborated. The rapidly progressing development in the field of AI makes the discussion of a new criminal law subject "AI" inevitable. Special consideration is given to the criminal responsibility of humans in the production of defective AI products. Potential changes in the law to counteract risky AI developments at an early stage, while at the same time promoting promising results, round off the work.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177269-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057799-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131795-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033447-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143713-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175820-1>
Nursery Concepts of the GDR Institutions: A Comparative Analysis with Special Consideration of the Relationship between Autonomy and Pedagogical Guidance ¤ The thesis deals with nursery concepts which were developed in the GDR in the years 1956, 1957, 1968 and 1985. The study mainly focuses on the question of the relationship between autonomy and pedagogical guidance. Further issues are the possible usability of innovative contents in the final program of 1985 and the role of the social hygienist Eva Schmidt-Kolmer. The text analyses follow an introductory theoretical part on early childhood education and the education and nursery system in the GDR. A variety of categories which are essential for the early childhood sector, for instance the child image or the role of the educators, form the basis of the analysis. As a result, it is clear that the reforms of the program of 1985 could not prevail without restrictions. Due to rigid development and educational goals the allowance of self-education processes remained limited. However, the analysis of a different concept (2004), which is based on the program of 1985, also shows that various contents are indeed transferable and can be utilized for the training of early childhood care.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137544-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018776-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015482-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030603-3>
Mild solutions of SPDE's driven by Poisson noise in infinite dimensions and their dependence on initial conditions ¤ We investigate stochastic partial differential equations in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space H of the following form: dX(t)=[AX(t)+F(X(t))]dt+B(X(t),y)q(dt,dy), X(0)=g, where q(dt,dy) is a compensated Poisson random measure associated to a stationary Poisson point process on a [sigma]-finite measure space (U,C,m), A is the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup, F is a measurable mapping from H to H, B is a measurable mapping from the product space HxU to H and g is an H-valued random variable. We are interested in the existence and uniqueness of a so called mild solution. But, apart from the existence and uniqueness of mild solutions our main interest is directed towards their regularity w.r.t. the initial datum g. Under Lipschitz assumptions on the drift and the diffusion we show that for every initial condition g, which is a p-integrable random variable, there exists a unique mild solution in the space of predictable p-integrable processes, where p>=2. In the case that p equals two this is done by Banach's fixed point theorem and the help of the isometric property of the stochastic integral ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174971-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4286863-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135969-0>
Ma(r)king the Difference : Multiculturalism and the Politics of Translation ¤ This research delivers a conceptual reconstruction of the trajectory of concepts used to mark qualitative differences among identities from the 16th to the 21st century in central Europe and the Americas. The surplus lies in the inclusion of colonial history in the genealogy of Western political thought and ideas, as well as in the postcolonial discussion of multiculturalism. The manuscript deals with the power and authority of translation providing the reader with an insight into the history of colonial racism through a deep conceptual analysis of three historical debates that have not been previously discussed together. By linking the so-called 'Indian Question', the 'Jewish Question' and the multicultural question, this thesis includes a valuable critical revision of the origins of Humanism in colonial times and contexts and an original critique to the power and violence of language in ma(r)king differences, which is described in terms of translation. This thesis was selected among the three best dissertations in critical social thinking of the year 2019 by the Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung. About the author: Tania Mancheno is a political scientist, an independent critical researcher and a lecturer at the Department of Geography, at the University of Hamburg. She teaches on critical space theory, conceptual history and urban multiculturalism. Mancheno is an associate researcher at the centre 'Hamburg's (post-)colonial legacy'.

Mechanical behavior of synthetic omphacite aggregates at high temperature and high pressure ¤ Triaxial compression experiments were performed on the synthesized samples and Fe-bearing clinopyroxenite in a solid medium apparatus at a confining pressure of 0.75 to 2.5 GPa, temperatures 900 to 1175oC, and strain rates between 1.1x10^-6 s^-1 to 8.5x 10^-5 s^-1. Samples of calcic compositions deformed at high differential stresses reveal abundant mechanical (100)[001] twins, whereas jadeite aggregates deformed at low differential stress show well developed subgrain boundaries. Combining the mechanical data and observed microstructures for deformed synthetic samples reveal that the deformation of diopside aggregates is controlled by dislocation glide, while the kinetics of dislocation climb controls the deformation of jadeite aggregates. The variation in strength with composition obeys scaling by the dependence of melting temperature and shear modulus on composition. In contrast to climb-controlled deformation, glide-controlled deformation should be insensitive to impurity concentrations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4282806-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4217961-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4278264-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077444-2>

Micromechanical modeling of size-dependent crystal plasticity and deformation twinning ¤ BEGIN: The computational modeling and simulation of the deformation behavior of crystalline materials at the micron scale is the objective of this thesis. Numerous experimental studies have proven that small-scaled metallic probes behave mechanically different from their bulk counterparts, in particular, the yield strength and work hardening behavior is affected in the way that smaller single crystals behave stronger. This characteristic behavior opens up new design possibilities for further improvement of mechanical properties of engineering material systems. In view of high expenses for advanced and complex experimental work along with the inherent testing limitations, numerical methods offer a great option to validate experimental findings, support the development of suitable theories, and extend scientific investigations on a computer-aided basis. A gradient crystal plasticity model is presented in this thesis and applied to selected scientific problems including the mechanical testing of single crystals via simulation of microcompression and microbending using a three-dimensional finite element framework. The model is implemented on an element basis and linked to the commercial finite element software Abaqus via the user subroutine UEL. Two major deformation mechanism are considered by the underlying model. Deformation via crystallographic slip is modeled in a non-local fashion allowing to account for gradient effects. Geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) densities associated with plastic slip gradients are introduced as additional nodal degrees of freedom while the actual plastic slip variables are handled as internal variables. Deformation twinning is accounted for in terms of a simple shear deformation associated with shear and shuffling of atoms. In addition, the twinning-induced reorientation of the crystal lattice is fully considered along with subsequent activation of slip modes within the twinned region. In accordance to the non-local crystal plasticity framework, the gradient of the twin volume fraction is introduced at the nodal level. The actual twin volume fraction is treated as an extended internal variable yielding a coupled system of highly non-linear equations at the local level. The competitive nature between slip deformation and deformation by twinning is addressed by physically motivated interaction relations. The characteristic features of the model are portrayed for a variety of micromechanical problems and in relation to experimental results. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4205811-9>
Hanging together : role-based constitutional fellowship and the challenge of difference and disagreement ¤ This book investigates how citizens who have differences and disagreements ought to relate to one another in a liberal democracy. Specifically, this book advances a metaphor of citizenship that I call 'role-based constitutional fellowship.' Role-based constitutional fellowship, I argue, is a desirable way for citizens to relate to one another in conditions of modern pluralism, where multiple races, ethnicities, religions, and economic statuses exist ('difference') and where citizens adhere to and pursue competing political interests, creeds, and objectives ('disagreement'). Under role-based constitutional fellowship, citizens share a sense that they are united in a common aim and that they are largely committed to doing what is necessary to pursue that aim - that they are fellows. I describe this sense of fellowship as constitutional and role-based: -- Introduction: Difference, disagreement, and civic aggression -- Aiming too high, aiming too low : the limits of discourse and ourse and contestation -- Fellowship's forefather : moving beyond Aristotelean fellowship -- Broadening the base : the necessity and dilemmas of liberal nationalism -- Three dimensions of trust -- Principled pragmatists, principled purists, and the liberal democratic front -- Talking, shouting back, and listening better -- Justifying (and constraining) salutary hypocrisy -- Facilitating fellowship : translucent veils, unlikely associations, and constraints on campaigns -- Conclusion: The question of borders and problem of enemies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129503-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011413-2>
Quantum chemistry and surface hopping dynamics of azobenzenes : free and constrained models ¤ This cumulative doctoral dissertation, based on three publications, is devoted to the investigation of several aspects of azobenzene molecular switches, with the aid of computational chemistry. In the first paper, the isomerization rates of a thermal cis → trans isomerization of azobenzenes for species formed upon an integer electron transfer, i.e., with added or removed electron, are calculated from Eyring’s transition state theory and activation energy barriers, computed by means of density functional theory. The obtained results are discussed in connection with an experimental study of the thermal cis → trans isomerization of azobenzene derivatives in the presence of gold nanoparticles, which is demonstrated to be greatly accelerated in comparison to the same isomerization reaction in the absence of nanoparticles. The second paper is concerned with electronically excited states of (i) dimers, composed of two photoswitchable units placed closely side-by-side, as well as (ii) monomers and dimers adsorbed on a silicon cluster. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4444367-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143804-8>
Exclusive event generation for the COMPASS-II experiment at CERN and improvements for the Monte-Carlo chain ¤ Summary: Measuring exclusive production processes to a high precision allows an access to the generalized parton distributions (GPDs). These GPDs can be used according to Ji's sum rule, which gives an access to the total angular momentum of the quarks and gluons. The COMPASS-II experiment at CERN is designed to carry out these measurements. This thesis comprises the development of an event generator for exclusive photon and meson production in the COMPASS-II kinematic. In this process, the Goloskokov and Kroll model for exclusive neutral pion production has been implemented. Furthermore, several improvements for the Monte-Carlo software were introduced to the COMPASS-II reconstruction software. The main objective of this work was an increase of the overall accuracy and performance of the Monte-Carlo chain for experimental acceptance studies and model comparisons	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4330869-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4723679-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4240945-7>
The European People's Party and the East : party cooperation in Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia ¤ Using the example of the European People’s Party’s (EPP) activities in the Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, this book demonstrates that European political parties may, under certain conditions, successfully influence political party transformation in the Eastern European Neighbourhood. In order to cover the highest possible variety of interactions between the EPP and its partner parties, the study examines three different mechanisms of norm promotion: conditionality, persuasion and social influence. While the EPP has influenced its partner parties to a certain extent both on an internal and an external level of party development, certain features of its partner parties have, however, strongly limited its influence, and its partner parties have often been resistant to change. Equally, their compliance with the EPP has frequently been merely rhetorical or formal. Finally, the author suggests a typology of which type of partner parties has been more likely to demonstrate such compliance.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044737-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032386-9>

Characterization of atmospheric processes related to hydro-meteorological extreme events over the south-central Andes ¤ The significant environmental and socioeconomic consequences of hydrometeorological extreme events, such as extreme rainfall, are constituted as a most important motivation for analyzing these events in the south-central Andes of NW Argentina. The steep topographic and climatic gradients and their interactions frequently lead to the formation of deep convective storms and consequently trigger extreme rainfall generation. In this dissertation, I focus on identifying the dominant climatic variables and atmospheric conditions and their spatiotemporal variability leading to deep convection and extreme rainfall in the south-central Andes. This dissertation first examines the significant contribution of temperature on atmospheric humidity (dew-point temperature, Td) and on convection (convective available potential energy, CAPE) for deep convective storms and hence, extreme rainfall along the topographic and climatic gradients. It was found that both climatic variables play an important role in extreme rainfall generation. However ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117572-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121721-4>

Identification of Genes Involved in Chromosomal Translocations ¤ Malignant diseases show frequently characteristic genetic alterations. The detections of such alterations were facilitating by improved molecular approaches in recent years. The focus of this work is the precise characterisation of breakpoint regions of chromosomal alterations of T-cell acute lymphatic leukaemia. For this purpose the fine-tiling comparative genomic hybridization (FT-CGH) were combined with the ligation mediated-PCR (LM-PCR). These both approaches were established in cell lines and subsequently used in different leukaemia samples. Chromosomal aberrations are frequently accompanied by genetic losses or gains. Such unbalanced alterations can be detected by the comparative genomic hybridization, which allows the detection of DNA copy number differences between a test sample and a reference sample. The fine-tiling-CGH detects with high resolution the DNA amount differences in specific genomic areas. The detected breakpoint regions can be further analysed by the LM-PCR. A comparison with the internal control cell line HEK 293-T revealed atypical PCR fragments in the analysed leukaemia sample. Using the BLASTn search database resulted in the identification of different genomic alterations in cell lines and T-cell acute lymphatic leukaemia samples. The combination of the FT-CGH and the LM-PCR allowed the clarification of simple deletions as well as complex chromosomal translocations ...

Investigation of 3D nano printed on-chip hollow core waveguides ¤ This thesis explores optical waveguides for integrated applications involving signal detection and object observation through guided light. Conventional optical waveguides use exposed evanescent fields to analyze water-based solutions, but their limited interaction area necessitates longer devices. To address this, the thesis employs the anti-resonant reflecting optical waveguide (ARROW) concept and presents novel microfluidic waveguides, light cages, and micro-gap waveguides, featuring side access to the core. These are manufactured using 3D nano printing based on two-photon polymerization (TPP) technology. The thesis comprises two parts: the light cage and the micro-gap waveguide. The light cage resembles a hollow core fiber, with modal attenuation of 0,5 to 1,0 dB/mm confirmed through experiments and simulations. It facilitates light guidance in liquids and is used for refractive index, absorption, and emission spectroscopy. Side access is emphasized via diffusion measurements, outperforming capillary fibers. Unique nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) within the light cage detects scattered light from nanoparticles, allowing measurement of solvency-induced nanoparticle collapse in different liquid environments. The micro-gap waveguide, characterized by a narrow gap, specific core size, wall thickness, and segment length, demonstrates strong light-matter interactions. It is applied in refractive index monitoring, absorption spectroscopy, and exhibits significantly faster diffusion compared to capillary fibers.

Unveiling the epoch of reionization by simulations and high-redshift galaxies ¤ The Epoch of Reionization marks after recombination the second major change in the ionization state of the universe, going from a neutral to an ionized state. It starts with the appearance of the first stars and galaxies; a fraction of high-energy photons emitted from galaxies permeate into the intergalactic medium (IGM) and gradually ionize the hydrogen, until the IGM is completely ionized at z~6 (Fan et al., 2006). While the progress of reionization is driven by galaxy evolution, it changes the ionization and thermal state of the IGM substantially and affects subsequent structure and galaxy formation by various feedback mechanisms. Understanding this interaction between reionization and galaxy formation is further impeded by a lack of understanding of the high-redshift galactic properties such as the dust distribution and the escape fraction of ionizing photons. Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) represent a sample of high-redshift galaxies that are sensitive to all these galactic properties and the effects of reionization. In this the...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135379-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057375-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178556-3>
Investigation of P-Glycoprotein-Inhibiting Phospholipids as Bioavailability-Enhancing Excipients ¤ Abstract: The efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is responsible for a diminished intestinal absorption of various drug substances, which can impair their oral bioavailability. As a result, higher doses are necessary. This in turn raises therapy costs and increases the risk of intestinal side effects due to higher amounts of incompletely absorbed substance. Hence, suitable P-gp inhibitors as oral bioavailability enhancers are of great interest.Phospholipids exist ubiquitously in nature. They are the most important part of biomembranes, play an essential role in lipid metabolism and are involved in many other physiological processes. Moreover, due to their amphiphilic properties and the ability to form stable vesicles (liposomes) in an aqueous environment, phospholipids are useful pharmaceutical excipients. One application field is the enhancement of solubility and permeability in order to increase the oral bioavailability of drugs. In previous work extraordinary P-gp inhibiting properties were found for the medium-chain phospholipids 8:0 PC and 10:0 PC as well as for the long-chain derivative 22:6 PC	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062550-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174398-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4773018-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017701-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4321152-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128790-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167790-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140438-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131432-3>
3d virtual histology of neuronal tissue by propagation-based x-ray phase-contrast tomography ¤ Deciphering the three-dimensional (3D) cytoarchitecture of neuronal tissue is an important step towards understanding the connection between tissue function and structure and determining relevant changes in neurodegenerative diseases. The gold standard in pathology is histology, in which the tissue is examined under a light microscope after serial sectioning and subsequent staining. It is an invasive and labor-intensive technique which is prone to artifacts due to the slicing procedure. While it provides excellent results on the 2D slices, the 3D anatomy can only be determined after aligning the individual sections, leading to a non-isotropic resolution within the tissue. X-ray computed tomography (CT) offers a promising alternative due to its potential resolution and large penetration depth which allows for non-invasive imaging of the sample's 3D density distribution. In classical CT, contrast formation is based on absorption of the x-rays as they pass through the sample. However, weakly absorbing samples like soft tissue from the central nervous system give nearly no contrast. By exploiting the much stronger phase shifts for contrast formation, which the sample induces in a (partially) coherent wavefront, it can be substantially increased. During free-space propagation behind the sample, these phase shifts are converted to a measurable intensity image by interference of the disturbed wave fronts. In this thesis, 3D virtual histology is performed by means of propagation-based x-ray phase-contrast tomography on tissue from the central nervous system of humans and mice. A combination of synchrotron-based and laboratory setups is used to visualize the 3D density distribution on varying lengths scales from the whole organ down to single cells. By comparing and optimizing different preparation techniques and phase-retrieval approaches, even sub-cellular resolution can be reached in mm-sized tissue blocks. The development of an automatic cell segmentation workflow provides access to the 3D cellular distribution within the tissue, enabling the quantification of the cellular arrangement and allowing for extensive statistical analysis based on several thousands to millions of cells. This paves the way for biomedical studies aimed at changes in cellular distribution, e.g., in the course of neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or ischemic stroke.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019752-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113240-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025092-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038639-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169148-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041649-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4756133-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171594-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4321722-9>
Settlement and history in Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine Galilee : an archaeological survey of the Eastern Galilee ¤ Uzi Leibner aims to provide the most accurate picture possible of the nature and history of the rural settlement in the Lower Galilee during Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods when this region played an important role in the development of both Judaism and Christianity. In an attempt to draw a historical reconstruction based on systematic data, a test case area in the »heart« of ancient Galilee was chosen for this research. Uzi Leibner used two distinct disciplines: the study of the relevant historical sources and the advanced archaeological field survey. Greek, Latin, Hebrew and Aramaic sources concerning settlements in the region were translated and discussed. Some fifty archaeological sites from the periods under discussion were identified and surveyed. The analysis of the finds enabled the author to draw a detailed portrait of settlement - including periods of construction, abandonment, prosperity and decline in each site and in the region as a whole. This book sheds new light on major historical issues such as the origins of the Galilean Jewry in the Second Temple Period, the First Jewish Revolt and its outcomes, the Jews of Galilee under Christian regime, demography, economy, continuity and decline	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054858-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071507-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129464-6>

Iron and zinc translocation from senescent leaves to grains of wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Akteur) in response to nitrogen fertilization and citric acid application ¤ In plant seeds, the micronutrients Fe and Zn are required to sustain the early development of seedlings. A large part of the Fe and Zn in the seeds derives from retranslocation from senescing leaves or stems. Nitrogen nutrition has been reported to play an important role in micronutrient retranslocation to grains by stimulating the synthesis of Fe chelators like nicotianamine and phytosiderophores. The present study assessed the effect of different N fertilizer forms on leaf senescence and on micronutrient accumulation in wheat grains (Triticum aestivum cv. Akteur) under field conditions in two consecutive years. Flag leaf senescence was delayed by N fertilization, and in both field experiments the supply of ammonium after anthesis resulted in higher Fe and Zn contents in the grains. Nicotianamine levels increased in leaves and leaf exudates, whereas phytosiderophore concentrations were less responsive to N treatments. To enhance Fe and Zn mobilization, citric acid was sprayed onto senescing leaves of wheat. In N-fertilized plants citric acid application did not increase Fe and Zn accumulation in grains. However, in non-fertilized plants citric acid application increased Fe and Zn remobilization and led to significantly elevated Fe contents in the grains. The results of the present study indicate that N fertilization can improve the fortification of wheat grains with Fe and Zn, in particular when the different effects of fertilizer N forms are respected, while citric acid application could not be proven efficient to increase Fe and Zn accumulation in grains.

Time-continuous state and parameter estimation with application to hyperbolic SPDEs ¤ Data assimilation has been an active area of research in recent years, owing to its wide utility. At the core of data assimilation are filtering, prediction, and smoothing procedures. Filtering entails incorporation of measurements' information into the model to gain more insight into a given state governed by a noisy state space model. Most natural laws are governed by time-continuous nonlinear models. For the most part, the knowledge available about a model is incomplete; and hence uncertainties are approximated by means of probabilities. Time-continuous filtering, therefore, holds promise for wider usefulness, for it offers a means of combining noisy measurements with imperfect model to provide more insight on a given state. The solution to time-continuous nonlinear Gaussian filtering problem is provided for by the Kushner-Stratonovich equation. Unfortunately, the Kushner-Stratonovich equation lacks a closed-form solution. Moreover, the numerical approximations based on Taylor expansion above third order are fraught with ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057621-8>
Content management and knowledge management : two faces of ontology-based deep-level interpretation of text ¤ In order to make content management systems able to exploit annotations about content semantics for the management of content, this work proposes an approach for text interpretation that is built on the principles of logic-based abduction. The approach is presented in the context of a framework that allows for a deep-level interpretation of text. The research contributions of this work encompass (1) a framework for the integration of shallow-processing techniques of text with logic-based techniques to cope with the extraction of content descriptions that describe media contents in detail; (2) the design of a logic-based process for multimedia fusion that supports the systematic combination of interpretation results obtained from different types of media (e.g., text and image); (3) the description of design patterns for domain ontologies and rules useful for logic-based media interpretation; (4) the use of text interpretation to guide the task of ontology design (Grounded Ontology Design") as a strategy to support knowledge management in an organization; (5) the design and implementation of an application that shows the advantages of using annotations to support location-aware and situation-specific services as a new kind of content management.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4241679-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4827894-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4673954-3>

Site Selection for a Repository for High-Level Radioactive Waste: Intergenerational Justice, Knowledge Generation, and Acceptance through Organization and Procedure ¤ The Site Selection Act has created the first ever legal framework for the siting of a high-level nuclear waste repository in Germany. The act provides for a staged selection procedure which makes use of a variety of innovative procedural and organisational governance tools. Lisa Hamacher examines the extent to which this legal framework enables an inter-generationally just, knowledge-based, democratically legitimised, and publically accepted siting decision. High-level radioactive waste disposal poses challenges for lawmakers and administrators: planning is complex and takes place on an unstable knowledge base. Acceptance is particularly low among the potential site population. The decisions made will bind future generations far into the future and must take their interests into account in particular. With the Site Selection Act, there is a legal basis for the search for a repository site for the first time. It provides for an innovative selection procedure with staged legal planning and a wide range of new participation instruments. With this, the legislator relies significantly on the steering potential of organization and procedure. What role does this decision-making framework play in addressing the mentioned challenges? Can the chosen instruments enable a knowledge-based, accepted, and future-oriented site decision?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114266-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014641-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048190-6>
Design, active sites and performance of unconventional ZrO2-based catalysts for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3-C4 alkanes ¤ Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of C3 - C4 alkanes is of increasing importance due to the growing demand for the corresponding olefins. Commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt-Sn species have, however, shortcomings of being toxic or limited availability.

Phenomenological Structure for the Large Deviation Principle in Time-Series Statistics : A method to control the rare events in non-equilibrium systems ¤ Phenomenological structure for the large deviation principle -- Iterative measurement-feedback procedure for large deviation statistics -- Common scaling functions in dynamical and quantum phase transitions -- van Zon-Cohen singularity and a negative inverse temperature -- Conclusions and future perspectives. This thesis describes a method to control rare events in non-equilibrium systems by applying physical forces to those systems but without relying on numerical simulation techniques, such as copying rare events. In order to study this method, the book draws on the mathematical structure of equilibrium statistical mechanics, which connects large deviation functions with experimentally measureable thermodynamic functions. Referring to this specific structure as the “phenomenological structure for the large deviation principle”, the author subsequently extends it to time-series statistics that can be used to describe non-equilibrium physics. The book features pedagogical explanations and also shows many open problems to which the proposed method can be applied only to a limited extent. Beyond highlighting these challenging problems as a point of departure, it especially offers an effective means of description for rare events, which could become the next paradigm of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4330658-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4425827-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171730-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067486-1>
Campaign like a Mud Fight? : An Analysis of Negative Campaigning by Parties in the 2017 German Federal Election ¤ BEGIN Is negative campaigning in German politics a myth? In this book, Susanne Thelen tries to find an answer to this question while analysing the 2017 German federal election, especially the parties’ manifestos, their Twitter and Facebook activities as well as the television debate between Chancellor Angela Markel and her challenger Martin Schulz. For most people, negative campaigning simply involves one person attacking another’s character through ‘below-the-belt’ comments. But negative campaigning can be defined as any true or untrue criticism levelled by one party or candidate against another during a campaign. Attacks can be implicit or explicit; they can be direct or comparative, but they must at least address the opponent in some way. Thelen distinguishes between attacks on personality traits and those on issues. Moreover, she develops a third category relating to nationality, religion and law and order: attacks on values. Thelen provides an overview of negative highlights in previous federal elections in Germany and she compares German strategies with the negativity we experienced during the 2016 US presidential election. Negative Campaigning in Deutschland gibt es nicht – oder etwa doch? Susanne Thelen untersucht die Wahlprogramme, Plakate, Twitter- und Facebook-Aktivitäten sowie TV-Duelle von CDU, SPD, AfD und Co im Bundestagswahlkampf 2017. Negative Campaigning ist die gezielte Verbreitung von wahren und unwahren Informationen über einen politischen Gegner mit der Strategie, dessen Schwächen in den Vordergrund zu rücken. Das Ziel ist, die fachliche und persönliche Eignung des Kontrahenten für ein politisches Amt anzuzweifeln. Dies bezieht sich auf einzelne Kandidaten genauso wie auf Parteien. Thelen vergleicht dabei nicht nur die Parteien miteinander, sondern beachtet auch das Negative Campaigning während des US-Präsidentschaftswahlkampfes 2016. Die bisher vorherrschende Unterscheidung in der Literatur zwischen „trait attacks“ und „issue attacks“ wird von Thelen um „value attacks“ als dritte Dimension ergänzt: Neben Attributen wie Ehrlichkeit und Vertrauenswürdigkeit sowie Fachkompetenz durch Qualifikation und politische Erfahrung zählen ähnliche Lebens- und Wertvorstellungen zu den Dimensionen des Negative Campaigning.

Hierarchical neural networks for image interpretation ¤ Human performance in visual perception by far exceeds the performance of contemporary computer vision systems. While humans are able to perceive their environment almost instantly and reliably under a wide range of conditions, computer vision systems work well only under controlled conditions in limited domains. This book sets out to reproduce the robustness and speed of human perception by proposing a hierarchical neural network architecture for iterative image interpretation. The proposed architecture can be trained using unsupervised and supervised learning techniques. Applications of the proposed architecture are illustrated using small networks. Furthermore, several larger networks were trained to perform various nontrivial computer vision tasks.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193754-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4159833-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4226127-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134101-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4264283-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4202022-0>

Improving network inference by overcoming statistical limitations ¤ A reliable inference of networks from data is of key interest in many scientific fields. Several methods have been suggested in the literature to reliably determine links in a network. These techniques rely on statistical methods, typically controlling the number of false positive links, but not considering false negative links. In this thesis new methodologies to improve network inference are suggested. Initial analyses demonstrate the impact of falsepositive and false negative conclusions about the presence or absence of links on the resulting inferred network. Consequently, revealing the importance of making well-considered choices leads to suggest new approaches to enhance existing network reconstruction methods. A simulation study, presented in Chapter 3, shows that different values to balance false positive and false negative conclusions about links should be used in order to reliably estimate network characteristics. The existence of type I and type II errors in the reconstructed network, also called biased network, is… END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171531-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4284158-6>

The Human Body as a Social Phenomenon and Ethical Challenge for Mutual Understanding: Between Identity Search and Recognition of Self- and Foreign Images ¤ In a digitalized world with the possibility of permanent availability and self-presentation, a cosmos emerges that holds both surveillance and suppression. The focus is on the 'fit' body, which is subjected to a persistent evaluation with the goal of self-affirmation, which does not mean a (critical) examination of the respectively depicted in each case. The fast-moving beauty industry suggests an 'outside' of the individual, which usually has little to do with the 'inside' and causes body frustration and self-doubt. The study therefore critically examines the neglect of the soul and its consequences in the context of 'body cult' and seeks solutions to understand the individual again as a whole, consisting of body, mind and soul. The recourse to the classical philosophical position of Greek antiquity and the position of philosophical anthropology clarify, with the help of the emphasis on the soul, the turmoil in which the individual finds itself in the present and the omnipresent challenges to which it is exposed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026482-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040222-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180864-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031575-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054146-0>

Electrical discharge machining of non-conductive advanced ceramics ¤ Abstract: Characterized by excellent material properties such as high mechanical, thermal and chemical stability advanced ceramics such as ZrO2, SiC, Si3N4 and AlN are increasingly used for various applications. Traditional means of machining sintered ceramics are expensive and the structure formed using them are limited in accuracy and geometry. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is an electro-thermal machining process used to structure conductive materials. By applying a conductive layer (denoted as assisting electrode (AE)) on top of the non-conductive material, the EDM process can also be used to structure non-conductive ceramics. The EDM process starts with a discharge taking place between the tool electrode and the assisting electrode. During the process, carbon particles that are secreted from the dielectric oil are deposited on the newly exposed non-conductive ceramic surface forming a thin conductive layer. This intrinsic conductive layer (ICL) insures that the electric contact between the workpiece and the generator is maintained. After the machining process, the conductive layer can easily be removed for instance by heating. However, the fundamental conditions required for the formation of the ICL and the underlying material removal mechanism of the µ-EDM of the non-conductive ceramics using AE is not fully understood	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4329808-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4841919-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4226770-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014255-3>
Interactions involving lipid-based surfaces : from protein adsorption to membrane adhesion ¤ Interactions involving biological interfaces such as lipid-based membranes are of paramount importance for all life processes. The same also applies to artificial interfaces to which biological matter is exposed, for example the surfaces of drug delivery systems or implants. This thesis deals with the two main types of interface interactions, namely (i) interactions between a single interface and the molecular components of the surrounding aqueous medium and (ii) interactions between two interfaces. Each type is investigated with regard to an important scientific problem in the fields of biotechnology and biology: 1.) The adsorption of proteins to surfaces functionalized with hydrophilic polymer brushes; a process of great biomedical relevance in context with harmful foreign-body-response to implants and drug delivery systems. 2.) The influence of glycolipids on the interaction between lipid membranes; a hitherto largely unexplored phenomenon with potentially great biological relevance.

Sources of intuitive and deliberative decisions : the role of implicit and explicit motives ¤ The question of underlying (motivational) sources of decisions has largely been neglected within both psychology and economics. This dissertation aims to understand the ‘what’ of decision making by connecting two fields of research that have up to now been studied independently and in isolation: Intuitive/Deliberative Decisions and Dual-Motive Theory. The dual-motive theory proposes two kinds of underlying motivational sources: Implicit and Explicit Motives. While implicit motives are non-declarative, affective-based and partially an innate-system, explicit motives are declarative, cognitively elaborate and a socially-influenced system. This dissertation proposes that intuitive decisions are driven by implicit motives while deliberative decisions are driven by explicit motives. These two hypotheses were tested empirically across five experiments. Throughout the experiments, intuitive and deliberative decision modes were induced via instructions. Decisions were in the form of scenarios with options corresponding to Achievement, Affiliation or Power motives. Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find differences depending on the decision mode. Regardless of whether decisions were made intuitively or deliberatively, explicit motives predicted decisions and implicit motives did not predict decisions. The fact that implicit motives did not predict decisions could mean that (a) it is not implicit motives that drive intuitive decisions or (b) it was not intuition which was assessed. Further examinations on implicit motive and decision making literature revealed that (a) while the influence of implicit motives has been shown in a variety of cognitive and behavioural indicators, the exact processes of how motives affect behaviors have not been properly addressed and (b) while the basic distinction between intuitive and deliberative may be clear, it remains unclear when exactly each mode of decision making becomes activated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014904-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075001-2>

On the origin of epithermal Sn-Ag-Zn mineralization at the Pirquitas mine, NW Argentina : fluid inclusion and isotopic constraints ¤ The Central Andes host large reserves of base and precious metals. The region represented, in 2017, an important part of the worldwide mining activity. Three principal types of deposits have been identified and studied: 1) porphyry type deposits extending from central Chile and Argentina to Bolivia, and Northern Peru, 2) iron oxide-copper-gold (IOCG) deposits, extending from central Peru to central Chile, and 3) epithermal tin polymetallic deposits extending from Southern Peru to Northern Argentina, which compose a large part of the deposits of the Bolivian Tin Belt (BTB). Deposits in the BTB can be divided into two major types: (1) tin-tungsten-zinc pluton-related polymetallic deposits, and (2) tin-silver-lead-zinc epithermal polymetallic vein deposits. Mina Pirquitas is a tin-silver-lead-zinc epithermal polymetallic vein deposit, located in north-west Argentina, that used to be one of the most important tin-silver producing mine of the country.

Defects Rights before Acceptance in the BGB Construction Contract: Considerations de lege lata and de lege ferenda ¤ In German building law, the question of the applicability of warranty rights before acceptance is of high practical relevance. The author examines the prevailing legal position, illuminates the different views of the literature and judicature and submits a reform proposal.The focus is on the question of the intervention of the owner when occurring deficiencies prior the completion date and on the question whether the acceptance is a reasonable intersection for the applicability of warranty rights. The question of the application of contractual defect rights before acceptance is of high practical relevance and has not been decided by the BGH to date. Even the draft for the creation of a separate construction contract law does not provide for clarification. The author examines the prevailing legal position, analyzes the prevailing views, and proposes his own approach for reforming the existing contract law in terms of an interest-oriented solution. In the foreground are the question of the owner's intervention possibilities in the event of occurring (serious) defects before reaching the completion date and the question of whether acceptance is a reasonable intersection for the application of contractual defect rights.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4391998-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004977-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036886-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141076-2>
Relations between seismic signals and reservoir properties of deep gas reservoirs in Northwest-Germany - Wustrow member, Rotliegend ¤ This study tries to find the petrophysical basis for correlations between reservoir properties and seismic signals calibrated with geological information for Wustrow-sediments of the Rotliegend in NW-Germany. A secondary objective consists in explaining the large scatter of permeability for Wustrow reservoir rocks of comparable properties. The correlations were ascertained in the DGMK-project 593-8, for instance to authigenic clay mineral types and permeability. The investigations demonstrate that the differences in seismic signals (amplitude, shape and lateral coherency of seismic traces) are a product of distinct compressional field velocities (from wireline logs) and attenuation processes as in-situ bulk densities are barely varying within the investigated horizon. The regions of different clay mineral authigenesis (illite and chlorite) diverge by their average compressional in-situ speeds. The differences suffice to provoke relevant variations in seismic signals. Total porosity appears not to affect the field wave characteristics distinctly as high void volumes are encountered in the province of high compressional speed. The distinct velocities for rocks of different authigenesis and the subsidiary effect of void volume are ascertained also at plug dimensions. Other rock properties affecting wave characteristics than porosity become thus relevant. Plugs of comparable properties but largely varying compressional ultrasonic velocity are analyzed for textural features which certainly or potentially influence wave characteristics. These features represent, affect or indicate also reservoir quality ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185687-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178544-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4414221-3>

WDM network planning and management ¤ The rapid growth of Internet as well as bandwidth-intensive networking applications such as video-on-demand or multimedia conferencing, raise new challenges in network planning and management, and hence requires extensive new research in high-bandwidth transport networks, of which optical networks employing WDM technology is a promising candidate. Therefore, in this thesis, we study several issues related WDM networks. It includes 1.) network planning and optimization for WDM networks, 2.) wavelength converter placement and wavelength assignment in wavelength converting networks, 3.) design and 4.) reconfiguration of logical topologies for IP over WDM networks, and 5.) survivability for multi-layer WDM networks.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5>
The judicialisation of politics in India : origins and consequences of the power of the Indian supreme court ¤ This thesis is a longitudinal study of judicial power in India and captures the history of the Supreme Court from the perspective of positive political theory. Combining measurements of competitiveness of political participation with quantitative indicators that describe the court as a composite actor, the thesis identifies both the structuration of opportunities for judicial power expansion as well as critical junctures resulting from the court’s strategic choices. Each chapter combines empirical data and historiographic narratives to portray such phases of institutional flux, re-conceptualizing the overall trend towards judicial power expansion as distinct sequences of judicial overreach, jurisdiction stripping, and judicial self-empowerment alternating between regime supportive judicial activism and judicial assertiveness. Like all good dependent variables the power of the Indian Supreme Court thus varies over time, while the theoretical frameworks for tying together this thesis always derive from the same paradigm of separation-of-power-games, drawing on strategic approaches in judicialization studies to explain juristocratic patterns of judicial power expansion in India.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042623-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177253-2>
Theoretical and experimental investigation of the plasmonic probe ¤ BEGIN: The diffraction limit does not permit us to reveal information from dimensions smaller than roughly one-half of the wavelength. Hence, it was traditionally impossible to optically interact selectively with nanoscale features. However, with the increasing trend towards nanoscience and nanotechnology, nano-optics science emerged. A central goal of nano-optics is to extend optical techniques to length scales beyond the diffraction limit. In recent years, several new approaches have been developed to overcome this limitation. Tip-enhanced near-field microscopy techniques, such as TERS and PiFM, are among the innovations built around an AFM system. In this work, first, an algorithm for batch processing of the measured AFM data is introduced and utilized to analyze the height distribution of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 samples. In the next chapter, plasmonic probes, as the crucial components of any near-field optical microscopy techniques, are modeled and investigated. Here, complex and realistic particle shapes are used to analyze particle-based probes’ near- and far-field behavior. It has been shown that only the frontmost particle is decisive for the near-field signal. On the other hand, the rest of nanoparticles enhance the scattering intensity. Apart from the optical responses, the mechanical properties of tips are also modeled because higher harmonics of the tip’s oscillations are the foundation of new patents such as torsional force microscopy and photo-induced force microscopy (PiFM). In the last chapter, the PiFM is introduced and employed in various applications, i.e., plasmonic probe’s quality, field mapping, and optical response of the plasmonic NPs.

The architecture of determiners ¤ The Architecture of Determiners is a treatise of a set of function words, the closed class of determiners. The dissection of a series of different determiners in German and other Germanic languages brings to light unexpected structural regularities previously unexplored in this class of words, regularities that resemble syntactic patterns familiar from the clause. "Work in morphology is typically concerned with productive word formation and regular inflection, in any event with open class categories such as verbs, nouns, and adjectives, and their various forms. The Architecture of Determiners, by contrast, is devoted to a set of function words: the closed class of determiners. While it is traditionally assumed that function words are syntactically atomic, Thomas Leu shows that a comparative perspective on a series of determiners - each insistently vivisected into its minimal morphotactic segments - reveals an anatomy with properties analogous to clausal syntax, including a lexical, an inflectional, and left peripheral layer, as well as transformational relations among subconstituents. Leu argues that determiners are extended adjectival projections with a closed class minimal stem. Leu focuses on Swiss German and German, using other Germanic and non-Germanic languages as a comparative domain. His discussion of the internal structure of determiners includes demonstratives (ch.2), distributive quantifiers (ch.4), possessive and negative determiners (ch.5), and interrogative determiners such as 'was für' (ch.6). His main claim - that all of these involve extended adjectival projections - connects naturally to a discussion of adjectival / determiner inflection in German. Chapter 3 addresses the oft-debated strong versus weak agreement alternation in a novel way, proposing that the adjective moves within its own extended projection, in a way akin to verb movement to C in the clause. This accounts for the central facts of nominative and accusative inflection. Chapter 7, then, addresses dative and genitive morphology, setting them syntactically apart from adjectival / determiner inflection in a way that leads to a surprising account of most of the systematic (meta-) syncretism patterns in German adjectival inflection	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073708-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4204351-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116442-8>
Late Mesozoic to Cenozoic erosion and sediment dispersal in the Dinaride orogen : a sedimentary provenance approach ¤ This work presents the results of a sedimentary provenance study undertaken in Cretaceous to Tertiary basins of the Dinarides. The major objective has been to put new constraints on the orogenic evolution of this integral, yet one of the least known segment of the European Alpine chain. We have taken on the approach of in-depth characterizing the detritus derived from major tectonostratigraphic units, focusing on information extracted via the geochemistry, geochronology and fission-track thermochronology of single detrital grains. We used these results to describe the paleogeology and understand sediment dispersal patterns which are all dependent on the large-scale crustal and surface processes involved in the Alpine orogeny. The Bosnian Flysch forms a c. 3000 m thick, intensely folded stack of Upper Jurassic to Cretaceous mixed carbonate and siliciclastic sediments in the Central Dinarides, sandwiched between the Adriatic Carbonate Platform and the Dinaride Ophiolite Zone ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4238903-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127360-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180610-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4277253-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020199-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075273-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057956-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120440-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4198719-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038793-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4412829-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154927-2>
A data-driven concept and realization for engineering change management decision support ¤ In today's automotive industry, quickly reacting to engineering changes and providing market-driven products within a short period remains a competence for all Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). Due to the complexity of products, changes to one component can lead to unexpected chain reactions in others. Besides, from creation to the approval of a change request can take weeks or even months without apparent reasons for the delays. To coordinate and control changes, companies established Engineering Change Management (ECM) processes. ECM processes can impact all determinants of competition of products: cost, quality, and time-to-market. Without proper management of Engineering Changes (ECs), negative impacts will happen. In the scope of this dissertation, a machine-learning based ECM decision support solution is developed which includes two main functions: change impacts prediction and lead time prediction. These functions support engineers to have an overview of change consequences in the early phase of the ECM process. The solution was evaluated based on the data from an automotive company and reached good performance. Therefore it was rated as beneficial to increase the efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of the existing ECM processes	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139402-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032690-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193754-5>
The Facts of Norm Control ¤ Facts play a decisive role in the judicial review of legislation. Analyzing the case law of both the EU's Court of Justice and the German Federal Constitutional Court, this study takes a comparative approach to investigating the different strategies courts employ to handle these factual questions and the problems involved. Facts play a decisive role in court decisions. Even in the review of laws, courts are confronted with factual questions. However, it is about different facts here: general causal relationships, not individual cases. The determination of facts can therefore not be integrated into a court proceeding in the same way. At the same time, courts in the review of laws are faced with the legislator, who deals with facts and uncertainties in the mode of political decision-making in a completely different way. How can courts meet the requirements of their own procedure despite these differences? And how do the different approaches affect the legislative procedure? Johannes Bethge develops these questions comparatively and with a view to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Federal Constitutional Court.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042623-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135179-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178846-1>

Dense stellar systems and massive black holes : sources of gravitational radiation and tidal disruptions ¤ Gravity dictates the structure of the whole Universe and, although it is triumphantly described by the theory of General Relativity, it is the force that we least understand in nature. One of the cardinal predictions of this theory are black holes. Massive, dark objects are found in the majority of galaxies. Our own galactic center very contains such an object with a mass of about four million solar masses. Are these objects supermassive black holes (SMBHs), or do we need alternatives? The answer lies in the event horizon, the characteristic that defines a black hole. The key to probe the horizon is to model the movement of stars around a SMBH, and the interactions between them, and look for deviations from real observations. Nuclear star clusters harboring a massive, dark object with a mass of up to ~ ten million solar masses are good testbeds to probe the event horizon of the potential SMBH with stars. The channel for interactions between stars and the central MBH are the fact that (a) compact stars and stellar-mass black holes can gradually inspiral into the SMBH due to the emission of gravitational radiation, which is known as an “Extreme Mass Ratio Inspiral” (EMRI), and (b) stars can produce gases which will be accreted by the SMBH through normal stellar evolution, or by collisions and disruptions brought about by the strong central tidal field. Such processes can contribute significantly to the mass of the SMBH. These two processes involve different disciplines, which combined will provide us with detailed information about the fabric of space and time. In this habilitation I present nine articles of my recent work directly related with these topics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4158119-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053793-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4150454-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169052-7>
Person and Form: A Media and Knowledge History of Personality Diagnosis ¤ What is personality? As an appealing cultural concept, it developed great productive power within the psychological sciences particularly in the first half of the 20th century. But which set of tools enabled researchers to determine and diagnose personality?In this study, David Keller reckons with the diversity of media and techniques that played a critical role in legitimizing 'personality' as a stable concept for the human sciences. By reconstructing research practices and diagnostic procedures, and by taking popular discourses into account, the work illustrates how the search for personality generated new knowledge and provoked further questions. David Keller shows how 'personality' became a continuing challenge for the human sciences. Was ist Persönlichkeit? Und wie kann sie wissenschaftlich erschlossen und diagnostiziert werden? Vor allem in der ersten Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts entfaltete die kulturell voraussetzungsreiche Idee der Persönlichkeit innerhalb der psychologischen Wissenschaften große produktive Kraft. David Keller stellt eine Vielfalt von Medien und Techniken in den Mittelpunkt seiner systematischen Untersuchung, die mobilisiert wurden, um 'Persönlichkeit' anhand experimenteller Suchprozesse als ein stabiles Konzept der Humanwissenschaften zu legitimieren. Dabei verdeutlicht seine Rekonstruktion einschlägiger Forschungs- und Diagnosepraktiken sowie die Betrachtung popularisierender Diskurse, wie die Suche nach der Persönlichkeit nicht allein eine wissensstiftende Funktion besaß, sondern zuletzt immer neue Fragen aufwarf. Auf diese Weise wurde sie zu einer fortgesetzten Herausforderung für die Wissenschaften vom Menschen.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075996-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173861-5>

Synthesis of biomimetic elastin-like polypeptides as molecular springs for the activation of Cu(I) bis(NHC) mechanocatalysts ¤ Aim of this thesis was the synthesis of latent elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) bearing Cu(I) bis N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysts which could be activated after application of an external force via ultrasound. The ELPs were chosen due to their ability to form a β-spiral which could be exploited as “molecular spring” for an efficient force transmission. In order to enable a more flexible modification of the catalysts, two low molecular weight Cu(I) bis(NHC) complexes were synthesized from the respective imidazolium precursors. The generated complexes bore either two carboxyl or two amino groups, thus allowing a postmodification and extension of the attached NHC ligands by peptide coupling of ELP sequences with varying chain lengths. Ultrasound induced activation of the synthesized complexes revealed conversions between 3.4 % and 9.9 % for a model „click“ reaction between benzyl azide and phenylacetylene.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029919-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061555-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037172-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4295813-1>
Interpretation of temperature signals from ice cores : insights into the spatial and temporal variability of water isotopes in Antarctica ¤ Earth's climate varies continuously across space and time, but humankind has witnessed only a small snapshot of its entire history, and instrumentally documented it for a mere 200 years. Our knowledge of past climate changes is therefore almost exclusively based on indirect proxy data, i.e. on indicators which are sensitive to changes in climatic variables and stored in environmental archives. Extracting the data from these archives allows retrieval of the information from earlier times. Obtaining accurate proxy information is a key means to test model predictions of the past climate, and only after such validation can the models be used to reliably forecast future changes in our warming world. The polar ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica are one major climate archive, which record information about local air temperatures by means of the isotopic composition of the water molecules embedded in the ice. However, this temperature proxy is, as any indirect climate data, not a perfect recorder of past climatic variations.

Integrative statistical methods for decoding molecular responses to insect herbivory in Nicotiana attenuata ¤ This work focuses on the development of statistical methods to select features (genes and metabolites) exhibiting induced local and systemic defense responses to insect attack in Nicotiana attenuata along with the extraction of additional information regarding their timing of action. To characterize the dynamics of activation in time and space of herbivory-induced responses, I designed a framework by combining methods previously developed for feature selection and extraction to identify activated network motifs. These motifs are the set of features that are differentially perturbed in local and systemic tissues in response to herbivory. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138579-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006896-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4416206-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7651795-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4626532-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027110-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4159584-1>
The Belarusian-Russian mixed speech as a subvariety in comparison to Russian non-standard varieties and Belarusian: Phenomena of inflectional morphological ¤ In the following dissertation a comparison is drawn between inflectional morphological phenomena of two mainly spoken subvarieties, i.e. of the mixed Belarusian-Russian speech (Trasjanka) and Russian substandard Prostorechie. The analysis reveals that in the Trasjanka there are only few similarities to simple, regular structures of the Russian Prostorechie. These parallels are given only, if they are maintained by Belarusian. The Belarusian standard shares many similarities with the Russian Prostorechie. Nevertheless, not all of these regular forms can be found in the Trasjanka. This implies even in the situations when Russian demonstrates irregular forms, its model is preferred as the model of the social dominant “prestige”-language. It can be concluded that, while in general regular structures prevail in Prostorechie, in the Trasjanka a complex combination of sociolinguistic and “internal” language factors is responsible for the distribution of forms.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074852-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170560-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1034351176> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183922-5>
The Applicability of German Criminal Law in Internet Crimes ¤ BEGIN This work shows that there is also a place of success for abstract endangering offences committed via the Internet, which can be linked to the principle of territoriality according to §§ 3, 9 I StGB. It also describes the criteria according to which the place of success in the case of Internet offences is to be determined. When content and expression offences are committed via the Internet, the question arises whether German criminal law is applicable. Such Internet offences are predominantly designed as abstract endangering offences. It is often assumed that abstract endangering offences are „typically“ activity offences that do not have a place of success in the sense of § 9 I StGB. The work shows that there is also a place of success for abstract endangering offences that are committed via the Internet, which can be linked to the principle of territoriality according to §§ 3, 9 I StGB. It also describes how the place of success for such offences is to be determined in accordance with a digital territoriality principle.

Methods for Climate Reconstruction from Historical Sources in Central Europe ¤ The ubiquity and quality of text-based historical sources in Central Europe enables the description of monthly local weather conditions for the last 500 years. The sources in this period are sufficiently rich in content to permit a summary into seven temperature classes, ranging from 3 (extremely cold) to +3 (extremely warm). For the earlier period 1000-1500, the sources can be assigned one of the three index values [-1, 0, 1]. This collection of index values was integrated by Glaser (2008) into a continuous time series, which represents the fundamental data source of the present work. Although the investigations are principally devoted to temperature reconstruction, the methods developed herein are quite general, and can equally be used to reconstruct other weather parameters from corresponding index values...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4225827-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136102-7>

Kant on Love ¤ “This is an immensely useful resource for other scholars and philosophers wishing to understand Kant’s views on love.”– Rae Langton, University of Cambridge What did Immanuel Kant really think about love? In Kant on Love, Pärttyli Rinne provides the first systematic study of ‘love’ in the philosophy of Kant. Rinne argues that love is much more important to Kant than previously realised, and that understanding love is actually essential for Kantian ethical life.The study involves two interpretative main propositions. First, that love in Kant includes an underlying general division of love into love of benevolence and love of delight. Further, the study divides Kant’s concept of love into several aspects of love, such as self-love, sexual love (and love of beauty), love of God, love of neighbor and love in friendship. A chapter of the book is devoted to each of these aspects, beginning with the lowest forms of self-love as crude animality, and moving gradually upwards towards idealised ethical notions of love. One way or another, the major aspects relate to the general division of love.This analytical trajectory yields the second main proposition of the study: Together, the aspects of love reveal an ascent of love in Kant’s thought. Perhaps surprisingly, for Kant, love permeates human existence from the strongest impulses of nature to the highest ideals of morally deserved happiness.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015602-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045791-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035646-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049415-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045798-9>
Synthesis and characterization of polymer based Cu(I)-mechanocatalysts ¤ Mechanokatalysator; Mechanophor; Copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne/azide cycloaddition; Fluorogenic “click” reaction In the scope of this thesis latent poly(isobutylene)- (PIB) and poly(styrene)- (PS) based copper(I) bis(N-heterocyclic carbene) (NHC) mechanocatalysts were developed for the copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne/azide “click” cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction. GPC and 1H-NMR spectroscopic investigations proved the initial latency and subsequent activation of the designed mechanophores by cleaving one of the shielding polymeric NHC-ligands by external force generating thus a catalytic active copper(I) monocarbene moiety. The catalytic activity towards a “click” reaction of benzyl azide and phenylacetylene could be proven up to 28% conversion for the PIB- and 52% for the PS-based mechanocatalysts after activating the catalyst by ultrasound in solution. The activation in bulk polymer matrices by compression was probed via a fluorogenic “click” reaction achieving yields up to 8% using PIB- and PS-based mechanocatalysts proving thus their potential for an autonomous stress-sensing in polymeric materials. mechanocatalyst; mechanophore; copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne/azide cycloaddition; fluorogenic “click” reaction	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148483-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7700321-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029919-3>
Language attitudes in England and Austria : a sociolinguistic investigation into perceptions of high and low-prestige varieties in Manchester and Vienna ¤ In both Manchester and Vienna, there is much anecdotal evidence about the social implications of one`s spoken language variety. However, the evaluation of a person`s character based on the way they speak might not necessarily be the same in different countries with different languages. If evaluations of a speaker`s social class, professional status and general character change according to the country and language, then in which ways? By applying a very similar methodological framework in each of these cities, this study sets out to examine the extent to which perceptions of a speaker may vary with the social and linguistic context of each urban environment. Many sociolinguistic studies have already investigated how the way we talk influences the perceptions others have of us. The research presented in this book expands on this idea by directly comparing data across two nations with two different languages.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014777-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077623-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076334-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077741-8>
Binary Neutron Star Merger Simulations ¤ Binary neutron star mergers are associated with a variety of observable phenomena in the gravitational and electromagnetic spectra and are of great importance in a number of different physical subjects, e.g. high energy and gravitational physics. In this thesis, we are investigating binary neutron star systems in the last milliseconds before and after their merger. In such systems gravity is strong and has to be described by Einstein’s full Theory of General Relativity. Because of the complexity of the governing equations of general relativity and relativistic hydrodynamics no analytical solutions exist. Thus, the usage of numerical methods is inevitable. Throughout the thesis we consider different configurations by varying the spin, the equation of state, and the mass-ratio. In particular, we present the first consistent, constraint solved simulations of spinning binary neutron stars in full general relativity and the highest mass ratios simulated to date. Additionally, new numerical methods were implemented in the existing BAM code, most notably a refluxing algorithm which ensures mass conservation across mesh refinement boundaries. This algorithm allowed us to perform the most accurate simulations of the gravitational collapse of a rotating neutron star. In addition to pure numerical waveform modeling, we used high-resolution simulations to validate an improved tidal effective-one-body model and show that the new formalism can predict the waveform accurately up to the moment of merger. Furthermore, the effective-one-body model predicts quasi-universal relations, which we found also in full general relativistic simulations for the inspiral and even in the postmerger phase.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171660-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4158119-2>

Mode control with ultra-short pulse written fiber Bragg gratings ¤ Ultra short pulse lasers are increasingly employed for fiber grating inscription. They allow for the realization of very resilient gratings in non photo sensitive fibers, in particular rare earth doped fibers. With this approach fiber gratings can be inscribed largely independent of the fiber geometry: Large cross-section fiber Bragg gratings can be realized, which cover the whole core of a fiber and its surrounding cladding as well as highly localized FBG which only affect a small part of the core. This thesis explores the resulting possibilities for tailoring the spectral response of few and multi-mode fiber gratings as well as coupling to cladding modes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4357987-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4222149-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157425-4>
Hydraulic stability of geotextile sand containers for coastal structures : effect of deformations and stability formulae ¤ New shore protection structures such as seawalls, groins, breakwaters, revetments and artificial reefs are increasingly being developed. Softer and low cost protection alternatives, such as structures made of geotextile sand containers (GSC) are often used instead of more expensive and hard coastal structures made of concrete or rubble material. Although the effect of the deformations of the sand containers on the hydraulic stability is significant, no stability formula is available to account for those deformations and the associated processes leading to the observed failures. Therefore, the primary objective of the thesis is the hydraulic stability of coastal GSC-structures, taking into account the effect of those deformations and associated processes. To achieve a better understanding of the processes that affect the stability of GSC-structures several types of hydraulic model experiments and analyses were performed. Among the processes investigated, the following are worth mentioning: (i) permeability of GSC-structures and its influence on the stability, (ii) wave-induced loads on the sand containers, (iii) wave induced flow on GSC-structures, (iv) internal movement of sand in the containers and its effect on the stability, (v) variation of contact areas among neighbouring GSCs during wave action, (vi) types of displacement of GSCs within a coastal structure and finally (vii) the effect of the deformations on the stability of GSC-structures. In addition, a flow model and two structural dynamic models were further developed, validated and applied to extend the range of the hydraulic model tests towards a better understanding of the processes involved in the wave structure interaction. The wave-induced forces on the GSCs are calculated by using a RANS-VOF type model, initially developed at Cornell University, USA. The stresses and deformations for each sand container are simulated by using a finite element model (FEM) and finally, the displacement of containers is simulated by a discrete element model (DEM). Based on the experimental and numerical results, analytical stability formulae that account for the deformation of the individual GSCs for each type of observed displacement are developed and the required drag, inertia and lift coefficients are determined experimentally. Stability formulae for each type of coastal structures made of geotextile sand containers such as breakwaters, revetments, dune reinforcement and scour protection systems are proposed. Moreover, recommendations for the application of the stability formulae and for the construction of GSC-structures are outlined. Based on the results of several experimental, numerical and theoretical studies performed in this thesis, a much better understanding of the hydro-geotechnical processes which affect the stability of the coastal GSC-structures has been achieved. Moreover, reliable stability formulae for GSC-structures which account for the deformation effect of the GSCs have been derived.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033481-8>
Art. 35a Rating-VO and International Private Law: Application and Perspectives of the Rom II-VO in the Context of Liability of Credit Rating Agencies ¤ The major role of the Rome II Regulation within Art. 35a of the CRA Regulation challenges investors, issuers and Credit Rating Agencies but also the courts. This book deals with the difficulties of applying the Rome II Regulation on financial market torts using the example of the liability of Credit Rating Agencies. The problem of where exactly economic loss occurs is discussed as well as the need for a new Conflict of Laws rule for financial torts. In this context, the proposal by the Special Committee on Financial Market Law of the German Council for Private International Law is analyzed, also taking into account the materialization of European Private International Law.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4276573-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022898-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031772-9>
Deep learning of virtual marine sensors ¤ This thesis proposes an approach to build virtual sensors based on machine learning to replace broken physical sensors. These virtual sensors are trained with sensor data from the Time Series Station Spiekeroog (TSS) and the Biodiversity-Ecosystem Functioning across marine and terrestrial ecosystems (BEFmate) project in the Wadden Sea. In the first part of my work, I begin by explaining the data and its preprocessing. Next, an unsupervised extreme event detection task on the TSS data with a subsequent expert evaluation is presented. I propose an imputation method for longer consecutively missing values, which penalizes previously interpolated values based on the length of the gaps with a k-nearest neighbors approach. In the second part, I design a neural network architecture to model broken sensors. The foundation is a bidirectional recurrent neural network with long short-term memory (bLSTM) that utilizes my time dimensionality reduction method exPAA. Then, I introduce convolutional layers, uncertainty predictions, and my input quality based dropout layer to the architecture, which proves to outperform the architecture with only bLSTM layers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4341298-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1053807805> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050851-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4226127-2>
Unauthorized Online Gambling and Prohibited Payments ¤ Patrick Kemper discusses the consequences of the operation of unauthorized online gambling across all legal fields under German law. In particular, he examines the claims situation between the player, the payment service provider, and the gambling operator. Patrick Kemper discusses the effects of the operation of unauthorized online gambling targeting German players. Initially, he subjects the gambling offers found on the market to a legality check. He then examines the gambling law participation ban and interprets the norm to clarify the requirements of the individual characteristics of the offense. Subsequently, he discusses the criminal implications of the prohibited operation of online gambling, taking into account the current case law of the highest courts. Based on his findings in the fields of gambling and criminal law, the author finally examines the claim situation within the triangle of relationship between players, payment service providers, and online gambling operators.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4021329-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182291-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139469-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4509428-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067287-6>

Evolving deep neural networks : optimization of weights and architectures ¤ Deep neural networks are powerful predictive models that are applied in many different fields of study to great success. However, training a model that generalizes well is a difficult task that requires much computational power, large datasets, and a correct choice of a vast number of hyperparameters. In this thesis, we connect evolutionary approaches to modern, large-scale deep learning to improve the training process in the three mentioned areas. We highlight the influence of the network architecture as an especially important hyperparameter and develop automated architecture search methods. Since network architecture and network weights are closely related, we also propose an evolutionary large-scale network training algorithm. For all algorithms, we place special emphasis on low computational requirements to counteract the cost of the search process. Finally, we are able to reduce the required amount of training data by integrating multi-task learning. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4366912-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4226127-2>
Representations of State in Africa: A Postcolonial Critique of a Discourse ¤ In academic as well as political and media discourse, fragile and failed states are described today as safe havens for transnational terrorists and thus as a global security threat. The vast majority of the states labelled as such are located on the African continent. Within these discourses, statehood in general is often denied to African states, or the internal state actors are represented as solely corrupt and criminal.In this book, Anna Krämer presents a critical genealogical reconstruction of hegemonic repre-sentations of statehood in the Euro-Western discourse on Africa. By juxtaposing contemporary political science discourse on statehood in Africa to the field of historical (colonial) representations of African states from the 18th and 19th centuries, she reveals continuous power relations and submits them to a critical interrogation. Thereby, her book contributes to a postcolonial conceptualisation of statehood on the African continent.

The dynamic macroeconomic effects of public capital : theory and evidence for OECD countries ¤ This book analyzes the dynamic macroeconomic effects of public capital in industrialized countries. The issue of whether public capital is productive has received a great deal of recent attention. Yet, existing empirical analyses have been limited to a small set of countries. This book presents a new database that provides internationally comparable capital stock estimates for 22 OECD countries for the 1960-2001 period. Building on this database, the book estimates the dynamic effects of public capital using a variety of econometric methods. The results suggest that public capital is productive in OECD countries on average. The theoretical analysis based on a dynamic general equilibrium model shows that the effects of public capital depend crucially on the way the government chooses to finance additional spending	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4288535-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127451-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200428-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210294-7>
Hard x-ray microscopy enhanced by coherent image reconstruction ¤ X-ray microscopy is used to study the structure, dynamics and bulk properties of matter with high spatial resolutions. It is widely applied, from physics and chemistry to material and life sciences. In the past two decades, progress in X-ray microscopy was driven either by improvements in X-ray optics or by improvements in the image reconstruction by using algorithms as computational lenses. In this work both approaches are combined to exploit the advantages of X-ray imaging with a large numerical aperture and the advantages of coherent image reconstruction. It is shown that a combined X-ray microscope using both, advanced optics and algorithms, is neither limited by flawed optics nor by constraints imposed by reconstruction algorithms, which enables to go beyond current limits in resolution and applications. The thesis is structured in four parts. In the first part hard X-ray lenses, so called multilayer zone plates, are simulated to investigate volume diffraction effects within the multilayer structure, and to study the potential for smaller focus sizes and higher efficiencies. In the second part, the multilayer zone plates are characterized and implemented in an X-ray microscope. In the third part, a new imaging scheme is presented, which combines in-line holography and coherent diffractive imaging. This method overcomes the current resolution limit of in-line holography and can achieve super-resolution with respect to the numerical aperture of the illuminating beam. Finally, in the fourth part a multilayer zone plate is used as an objective lens with a known transfer function in a novel coherent full-field imaging experiment based on iterative phase retrieval, for high resolution and quantitative contrast.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178315-3>
New Sulfates of Platinum and Rare-Earth Metals ¤ This thesis deals with syntheses and investigations on compounds of platinum metals and rare-earth elements. The work was focused on preparation of new sulfates and on research of new precursor materials based on chloro compounds of the platinoids with complex oxoanions. An overview on structural affinities is given and considering the possible use as starting materials for further reactions in sulfuric acid the compounds were successfully converted. The reaction of a hexachloroiridate in oleum led to a mixed-valence compound with a trimeric, oxo-bridged Ir-unit. Furthermore the first binary rhodium sulfate could be synthesized by a reaction of elemental Rhodium in conc. sulfuric acid. Hexachloroplatinates(IV) and a platinum(III)-sulfate were converted with different kinds of crown ethers and studied thermoanalytically. The reaction of rare-earth oxides in sulfuric acid with different concentrations of sulphur trioxide led to several new disulfates and sulfates of the respective rare-earth element. <engl.> Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wurden Untersuchungen an neuen Verbindungen der Platinmetalle und der Selten-Erd-Elemente vorgenommen.

Sound integration of process and decision models ¤ Business process management is an established technique for business organizations to manage and support their processes. Those processes are typically represented by graphical models designed with modeling languages, such as the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). Since process models do not only serve the purpose of documentation but are also a basis for implementation and automation of the processes, they have to satisfy certain correctness requirements. In this regard, the notion of soundness of workflow nets was developed, that can be applied to BPMN process models in order to verify their correctness. Because the original soundness criteria are very restrictive regarding the behavior of the model, different variants of the soundness notion have been developed for situations in which certain violations are not even harmful. All of those notions do only consider the control-flow structure of a process model, however. This poses a problem, taking into account the fact that with the recent release and the ongoing ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4237203-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121201-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4240223-2>
On making fiction : Frankenstein and the life of stories ¤ Fiction, we are told, is a fascinating, yet somehow deficient affair, merely derivative of reality. What if we could, instead, come up with an affirmative approach that takes stories seriously in their capacity to bring forth a ›substance‹ of their own? Iconic texts such as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and its numerous adaptations stubbornly resist our attempts to classify them as mere representations of reality. Friederike Danebrock shows how these texts insist that we take them seriously as agents and interlocutors in our world- and culture-making activities.

Told Music in Contemporary Literature: Investigations into Treichel, Krausser, Meißner, and Goetz ¤ Abstract: The dissertation deals with the way of adapting music in contemporary German novels from an interdisciplinary and intermedial perspective Abstract: This dissertation examines how narrative literary texts in the most recent past adapt music from an interdisciplinary and intermedial perspective. At the center of the investigation is the question of how, through various literary strategies (metaphorization, structural analogies, verbal music, etc.), meaning is assigned to music, which is fundamentally non-semantic and thus meaning-contingent. These processes of semantization close with one another on the one hand to a tradition of over 200 years of 'musicalization' of literature through verbalization. In narrative texts that focus on so-called classical or E-music, the parodic or affirmative handling of the tradition is therefore in the foreground. On the other hand, where it is about popular music, the question arises of whether and how the text procedures differ from those already established. The subject of the investigation are, among other things, novels by Hans-Ulrich Treichel, Helmut Krausser, Tobias O. Meißner, and Rainald Goetz	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000626-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035964-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032290-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156301-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047497-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132307-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050479-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114652-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040802-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0>
Conflicts dynamics in democratic and autocratic regimes, 1946-2008 ¤ The aim of this thesis is to analyze the impact of political regime type on the onset of violent conflicts. Using statistical analysis on a dataset that covers the period from 1946 to 2008, I investigate the effects of regime type on civil war, military coups, physical integrity rights violations, and the initiation of militarized interstate disputes. What foremost predicts instances of violent conflict is the extent to which regimes rely on binding, predictable rules regarding the selection of the chief executive: thus, I find that monarchies and democracies are more stable and peaceful than any other regime. Among regimes that lack such rules, I find that military dictatorships experience coups more frequently than party regimes, but this is the only outcome that can be clearly attributed to authoritarian regime type: other observed differences either stem from the mutual relationships between different manifestations of political violence, or from the security environment in which such regimes emerge. To sum up, what seems to explain political regimes’ propensity to experience or use violence is the extent to which they are institutionalized, and the extent to which leaders are secure in office.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4206090-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011413-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032081-9>

The dynamics of romantic relationship (in)experiences in adolescence and emerging adulthood ¤ Romantic relationships represent a central aspect of adolescents’ lives. Although there has been a growing recognition of the developmental importance of these relationships in theory, it is only in recent decades that substantial attention has been given to romantic relationships during adolescence. As a result, numerous aspects regarding the dynamics of romantic relationship (in)experiences remain unknown. The current dissertation aimed to fill this gap by providing a detailed understanding of these dynamics during the transition from adolescence to emerging adulthood. Three studies were conducted using data from a large and representative sample in Germany. The interdisciplinary approach allowed for a comprehensive investigation of romantic relationship (in)experiences from different perspectives, including differential, developmental, and sociological viewpoints.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167616-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124481-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176186-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028859-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054392-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4332483-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013921-9>

The Large Scale Structures : A Window on the Dark Components of the Universe ¤ Dark Energy and Dark Matter are among the greatest mysteries in modern cosmology. The present work explores in depth how large cosmic structures can help us unveil the nature of these components of the Universe. One the one hand, it focuses on a signature that Dark Energy imprints on the Cosmic Microwave Background through its impact on the time-evolution of gravitational potentials: the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (iSW) effect. Another cosmological background, the Cosmic Infrared Background, is considered for the first time in the study of the iSW effect and demonstrated to be a highly efficient and promising tracer. Changing the perspective on the problem, the use of superstructures for iSW detection is then extensively reviewed: using precise solutions to Einstein’s general relativity equations, the full iSW effect is computed, especially due to the cosmic voids predicted by the theory. Using measurements from the most recent data, it is subsequently shown how the iSW probes the solidity of the cosmological standard model. On the topic of Dark Matter, an original study is presented, showing that temperature measurements of the intergalactic medium shed light on the nature of Dark Matter particles, providing the tightest constraints on their decay properties	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7589166-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4230260-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165370-1>
Topological phase transitions in Calabi-Yau compactifications of M-theory ¤ We construct five-dimensional gauged supergravity actions which describe flop and conifold transitions in M-theory compactified on Calabi-Yau threefolds. While the vector multiplet sector is determined exactly, we use the unitary Wolf spaces to model the universal hypermultiplet together with N charged hypermultiplets corresponding to winding states of M2-branes. After specifying the hypermultiplet sector the actions are uniquely determined by M-theory. As an application we consider five-dimensional Kasner cosmologies. Including the dynamics of the winding modes, we find smooth cosmological solutions which undergo flop and conifold transitions. Instead of the usual runaway behavior the scalar fields of these solutions generically stabilize in the transition region where they oscillate around the transition locus. The scalar potential thereby induces short episodes of accelerated expansion in the space-time.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224277-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164859-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4440893-6>
Mineralogical characterization of Fe-driven alteration in smectites ¤ The main objective of this research was to enhance the understanding of the interactions of bentonite with iron in the near field of a HLW-repository. One target was to investigate natural Fe-rich bentonites as a possible analogue. Another topic was to recognize the mineralogical interaction of bentonite with iron powder simulating the contact of bentonite with steel containers (thermodynamic approach). An additional objective was to explore the idea that bentonites have a specific dissolution potential (kinetic approach). In order to take the thermodynamic approach, compacted MX80 bentonite and Friedland clay were used as starting materials for clay/iron interaction experiments in percolation systems (Clay/Iron-ratio = 0.1). The natural processes were studied by examining a tropical weathering profile of serpentinized diabase from the Thanh Hoa province of Vietnam. The kinetic approach was taken by investigating a series of well characterized bentonites, 9 from API-standard series, 12 from the BGR-collection and 4 others, all of them saturated with deionized water (liquid/solid-ratio = 10/1) and NaCl 1N solution (liquid/solid-ratio = 4/1) for 30 days, followed by exposing the soft gels to mechanical agitation by overhead shaking corresponding to two energy levels (20 rpm and 60 rpm).

Menschenrechtsschutz in der internationalen Gesellschaft : extraterritoriale Staatenpflichten und Responsibility to Protect ¤ BEGIN: The idea of an international responsibility to protect, which implies that the international community or individual states should exercise graded responsibilities to protect basic human rights, remains disputed in contemporary international society. By analysing the debates about protection from mass atrocities and from human rights violations in a globalised world economy, this study discusses the problem of a fragmented human rights regime. Against this backdrop, it demonstrates the possibility of linking different concepts of protection in order to overcome the isolated implementation of different concepts of human rights protection. At the same time, this study introduces additional primary institutions of international society, thereby contributing to the English School of IR. Dr. rer. pol. Daniel Peters is a lecturer in Fundamental Rights and Security Studies at the Federal University of Applied Administrative Science, department of Federal Police, in Lübeck.

Judicial Protection in the Framework of European Banking Supervision ¤ Effective judicial protection is a fundamental element of any constitutional order. Felix Kazimierski examines the legal protection afforded by the host of new measures in Europe's restructured system of banking supervision and makes practical suggestions for improvement. The structure of banking supervision in the European Union has been fundamentally changed as a result of the last financial crisis. Central competences are now located at the European level. Felix Kazimierski comprehensively examines the possibilities of legal protection of the involved actors, in particular the supervised credit institutions. In this context, various questions arise, which are partly due to fundamental problems of European procedural law, such as the delimitation of competences in this complex multi-level system or the protection against the partly atypical forms of action of banking supervision. The author addresses not only the legal but also the actual problems regarding the protection against measures of the supervisory authorities and shows practical solution proposals in conclusion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4801271-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048835-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004450-6>
3D-facies and reservoir modelling of the Buntsandstein reservoirs of the northwestern Thuringian Syncline ¤ An integration of stratigraphic, sedimentological and structural characteristics of the Lower Triassic in the northwestern Thuringian Syncline (Thüringer Becken) has been performed. A stratigraphic-sedimentological model has been created for the Middle Buntsandstein Subgroup (Volpriehausen, Detfurth, Hardegsen and Solling Formation) and the structural model has been built from the top of the Zechstein Group to the top of the Middle Buntsandstein Subgroup. By integrating all available surface and subsurface information (regional geology, core logs, sample descriptions, electric log and structural interpretation) in a 3D-model using the software Irap RMS 2009 and KINGDOM suite version 8.2 allows to create a sedimentogical-stratigraphic-structural model. The Middle Buntsandstein Subgroup of the northwestern Thuringian Syncline consists of about fifteen (15) fining upward cycles that provide a high resolution lithostratigraphic framework. The cycles apparently reflect climate fluctuations between wet and dry periods driven by Milankovitch variations in solar irradiation. The cycles can be well correlated across the studied area. The successions of the Middle Buntsandstein are mainly characterized by continental clastic deposits reflecting the interaction of eolian, fluvial and lacustrine environments. Their total thickness varies between 130 and 230 m. In the Thuringian Syncline, NNE-SSW tensional and transtensional stresses acted during the Buntsandstein deposition creating subsidence patterns, uplifted areas as well as a regional angular unconformity. The main structural element in the study area is the Schlotheimer Graben.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4381343-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016568-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4254198-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121648-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057956-6>
Geochemical characterization of tea leaves (Camellia sinensis) and soils for provenance studies based on compositional data analysis ¤ Provenance studies on tea (Camellia sinensis) are an important tool to reconstruct the origin of tea products. This thesis explores the potential of using solely the ionome (main and trace element concentrations) of tea shoot tips for provenance studies. The emphasize of the thesis is to find element subcompositions which are robust in respect to the various parameters of tea cultivation and production, such as the area, their soils, soil fertilizer and applications of foliar sprays, tea cultivars, plucking/harvesting techniques, manufacturing or leaf grade of the processed tea.

Towards self-assembled metamaterials ¤ How far can we push chemical self-assembly? This is one of the 25 biggest questions science is facing over the next quarter century, as reported by the Science journal in 2005. The idea of self-assembly is to fabricate synthetic structures or materials from the bottom-up. Up to date a huge class of distinct structures was successfully demonstrated to be fabricated by self-assembly. One important scientific area that exerts the ideas of self-assembly arose from the fusion of the fields of colloidal nanochemistry and nanooptics. There, the focus is on the fabrication of bottom-up nanophotonic structures with a tailored optical response. Very interesting are self-assembled metamaterials (MMs). They promise to widen the possibilities on how to control the propagation of light to an extraordinary degree. Concerning self-assembled MMs the precise spatial arrangement of its unit cells across larger dimensions is not possible in most cases; leading essentially to amorphous structures. Such self-assembled MMs require novel analytical means to describe their optical properties and innovative designs of functional elements that possess a desired near- and far-field response. The first goal of this thesis is the introduction and development of a feasible theoretical description of amorphous MMs. Once the theory is established the second goal is on experimental realizations of self-assembled MMs. Therefore, the focus of this thesis is on self-assembled MMs and the question on how far they can be pushed to obtain artificial materials with an extraordinary optical response.

Need for Reform for an Efficiency-Oriented Collective Perception of Online Rights in Musical Works ¤ BEGIN: The ‘Collecting Societies Directive’ has allowed German legislators to aim at creating a uni-form level of regulation in terms of the multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online use at the European level for the first time. In light of a so far nationally determined practice of collective licensing and the unsuccessful regulation policy of the EU in the past, the question arises of whether this new legal framework is an adequate response to structural economic inefficiencies within collecting societies’ system of rights management.In this study, Paul Rhode examines this harmonised regulation in the field of online music in the form of its transposition into German law, the VGG, taking into account the foundations of competition economics and new information technologies. On this basis, he detects a remaining factual and legal need for reform to create an efficient collective rights management system, which is currently experiencing an unprecedented transition phase due to globalisation and digitalisation. With the Collecting Societies Directive, the legislator has attempted for the first time to create a uniform level of regulation in terms of the multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online use at the European level. In light of a traditionally nationally determined practice of rights perception and an unsuccessful EU regulation policy in the past, the question arises of whether this new legal framework is an adequate response to previously structurally determined economic inefficiencies in the system of collective rights perception by collecting societies. Paul Rhode examines this harmonised regulation in the online music field in the form of its transposition into German law, the VGG, on the basis of knowledge from competition economics and taking into account new information technologies. From this, he derives a remaining normative and factual need for reform for an efficiency-oriented rights perception, which is located in a historical phase of upheaval due to digitalisation and globalisation.

Antibacterial Mg-Ag biodegradable alloys ¤ The use of magnesium alloys as degradable metals for biomedical applications is topic of ongoing research. As a further aspect, the demand for multifunctional materials is increasing. Hence, binary Mg-Ag alloys were designed to combine the favourable properties of magnesium with the wellknown antibacterial property of silver. In this study, three Mg-Ag alloys, Mg2Ag, Mg4Ag and Mg6Ag which contain 1.87%, 3.82% and 6.00% silver by weight respectively were casted and processed with solution and aging heat treatment. Afterwards, the samples were investigated in vitro for metallographic, mechanical, corrosive, cytocompatible and antibacterial properties. The metallurgical analysis and phase identification showed that all alloys contained Mg4Ag as the dominant second phase. The mechanical properties of the Mg-Ag alloys were dramatically improved in several parameters especially after heat treatment. Corrosion tests revealed that after heat treatment, content of silver reduced the corrosion rate and exhibited less susceptibility to pitting corrosion than pure magnesium. Mg(OH)2 and MgO presented as main magnesium corrosion products while AgCl was found as the primary silver corrosion product. Immersion tests demonstrated that content of silver did not significantly shift the pH, osmolality and magnesium ion release in the environment. Cultivation and cytotoxicity tests with both primary cells and cell lines revealed that Mg-Ag alloys induce no negative effect on cells and show minor cytotoxicity. Antibacterial testing in a dynamic bioreactor system proved the alloys to reduce the viability of two common pathogenic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. In summary, biodegradable Mg-Ag alloys are cytocompatible biomaterials with adjustable mechanical and corrosion properties while having sound antibacterial ability.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5>

European Advertising Regulation Systems: A Case Study of Gender-Discriminatory Commercial Advertising ¤ In the current debate on gender-appropriate and non-discriminatory commercial communication, this study takes a comparative legal look at the different legal and self-regulatory instruments of the European advertising regulation systems. With the inclusion of social science, cognitive psychology and communication theory, the study not only examines the existing national regulations in their respective cultural context, but also considers new European developments, social influencing factors and possible harmonization approaches in the highly controversial field of gender-discriminatory commercial advertising.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065541-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020547-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012472-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201190-5>
Isogeometric and CAD-based methods for shape and topology optimization: Sensitivity analysis, Bézier elements and phase-field approaches ¤ BEGIN: The Finite Element Method (FEM) is widely used in engineering for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) over complex geometries. To this end, it is required to provide the FEM software with a geometric model that is typically constructed in a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software. However, FEM and CAD use different approaches for the mathematical description of the geometry. Thus, it is required to generate a mesh, which is suitable for FEM, based on the CAD model. Nonetheless, this procedure is not a trivial task and it can be time consuming. This issue becomes more significant for solving shape and topology optimization problems, which consist in evolving the geometry iteratively. Therefore, the computational cost associated to the mesh generation process is increased exponentially for this type of applications. The main goal of this work is to investigate the integration of CAD and CAE in shape and topology optimization. To this end, numerical tools that close the gap between design and analysis are presented. The specific objectives of this work are listed below: • Automatize the sensitivity analysis in an isogeometric framework for applications in shape optimization. Applications for linear elasticity are considered. • A methodology is developed for providing a direct link between the CAD model and the analysis mesh. In consequence, the sensitivity analysis can be performed in terms of the design variables located in the design model. • The last objective is to develop an isogeometric method for shape and topological optimization. This method should take advantage of using Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) with higher continuity as basis functions. Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) is a framework designed to integrate the design and analysis in engineering problems. The fundamental idea of IGA is to use the same basis functions for modeling the geometry, usually NURBS, for the approximation of the solution fields. The advantage of integrating design and analysis is two-fold. First, the analysis stage is more accurate since the system of PDEs is not solved using an approximated geometry, but the exact CAD model. Moreover, providing a direct link between the design and analysis discretizations makes possible the implementation of efficient sensitivity analysis methods. Second, the computational time is significantly reduced because the mesh generation process can be avoided. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7662388-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4329076-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017233-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069794-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7718401-4>

Possibilities and Limits of Modern Regional Development in the Regions of the Russian North at the Example of the Murmansk Oblast ¤ Located on the Kola Peninsula, Murmansk region was the first territorial unit with a polar climate that is equipped with significant mining structures worldwide, to satisfy the demand of young Soviet Union for raw materials. Due to the importance of the found items here (apatite, nonferrous metals, iron, mica, rare earths) numerous cities and settlements have been established in this climatically very difficult region. From 1920 to 1990 the population grew by 50 times to approx. 1.2 million. Beyond its importance as a supplier of raw materials the region became a traffic junction for soviet foreign trade and supply of Siberian mining sites and also a base for strong military forces, especially the Northern fleet (including nuclear submarines with ICBMs) and structures of Strategic air defense. Although economic profile and importance to the mother country could be obtained after collapse of the Soviet Union, there are serious socio-economic problems, whose greatest consequence is a compared to Russian average extreme population loss (1990 - 2014 approx. 33%). With the objective of evaluating future opportunities and risks, the present research describes the current socio-economical structures of the Murmansk region and their integration into administrative, fiscal and economic hierarchies of Russia. The structures, processes, and based on these conclusions are exemplary for most of the other regions of the Russian "Far North".

Harnack inequalities and applications for stochastic equations ¤ In this thesis, we mainly study Wang's Harnack inequalities and their applications for the transition semigroups associated with stochastic equations. Among the stochastic equations, we consider finite dimensional stochastic differential equations with irregular drifts; infinite dimensional (semi-)linear stochastic partial differential equations with Gaussian or Lévy noise; multivalued stochastic differential equations in finite dimension and multivalued stochastic evolution equations in Banach spaces. The applications of Harnack inequalities include the study of regularizing properties like strong Feller property, heat kernel estimates and hyperboundedness etc. for the transition semigroups. The main method we used to establish Harnack inequalities is measure transformation. There are two aspects: image measure transformation and Girsanov transformation (combined with a coupling argument). The latter method was introduced by Arnaudon et al. in 2006. By simple image measure transformation (e.g. use the Cameron-Martin formula in Gaussian case), we prove an optimal Harnack inequality for the Gaussian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. This is an improvement of the Harnack inequality obtained by Röckner and Wang in 2003. Moreover, we prove that this inequality is equivalent with the strong Feller property of the Gaussian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. By coupling and Girsanov transformation we obtain a Harnack inequality for Lévy driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The drift in the Girsanov transformation is a null control of some linear system. By optimizing over all null controls, we obtain a Harnack inequality which is of the same form as the Harnack inequality for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes driven by Wiener processes. This Harnack inequality also generalizes and improves the one obtained by Röckner and Wang in 2003 ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057621-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4759619-3>
Influence of physiological growth parameters on duckweed (Lemnaceae) in a re-circulating and vertical cultivation system ¤ Duckweeds (Lemnaceae) are the fastest-growing angiosperms on earth. Five different genera, compromising 36 species of these floating freshwater plants, are distributed around the world. They are highly interesting for different fields of application due to their fast growth rate and biomass production, their high nutritional value and their variability of nutritional composition, which can be influenced by cultivation conditions. For industrial purposes, large amounts of duckweed with a certain quality are required at any time of the year. Therefore, a standardized production process with a focus on plant physiological growth parameters is needed. For this dissertation, the effect of the nutrient medium, especially the nitrate-N to ammonium-N ratio and nutrient concentration, on the relative growth rates (RGRs) and crude protein contents (CPCs) of two duckweed species (Lemna minor and Wolffiella hyalina) was investigated under non-axenic cultivation conditions. Furthermore, the effect of different light intensities and spectral distributions on RGR, CPC and chlorophyll a content was investigated using a small-scale indoor vertical farm under non-sterile cultivation conditions. Based on these results and experiences with the previously used cultivation systems, a large-scale Indoor Vertical Farm was developed. It consists of nine vertically stacked production basins (1.95 x 1.45 x 0.1 m), resulting in a total production area of ca. 25.5 m2. The nutrient solution is re-circulating within the system and the nutrients are dosed automatically based on the electrical conductivity. Most abiotic growth parameters are controllable and adjustable. During a 40-day production phase a total of 35.6 kg of fresh L. minor biomass was harvested, which corresponds to ca. 900 g per day.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026308-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189221-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1037044266> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171097-6>
Social Capital Brought to Language: A Meaning-Theoretical Perspective on a Social-Scientific Concept and Theory Problem ¤ The term 'social capital' has become a buzzword with a huge, already diffuse spectrum of application. This should give reason for conceptual and theoretical vigilance. What – in concrete - is the object when 'social capital' is mentioned? This question has not been systematically dealt with and even less responsed in a satisfactory degree, although there are many contributions to the discussion of the term. The problem is labelled in the social sciences, but has not been resolved in the context of the specific social-scientific framework. This book takes the neglected metalinguistic perspective. Thus it advances the scientific maturity of the 'social capital' debate and contributes to the establishment of a well-founded system in social science terms. It brings up social capital by combining an epistemological and ontological analysis and thus finally develops clarification of the concept	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005248-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4510173-5>
The role of politics in the allocation of multilateral aid ¤ This dissertation studies the role of politics in the conformation of IFIs. Each of its three chapters explores the rootedness of politics in every key component of IFIs: mission, structure, and policy. Chapter 1 takes the mission of the IFI as a starting point to understand the diffusion of political favoritism in its lending decisions. The foundation of IFIs often responds to the desire of the main sponsor to spread its area of influence and this is reflected in the mission. Here, the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) is taken as an example. The IsDB is an RDB initiated with the support of King Faisal Bin Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia and restricted to countries with significant Muslim populations. The analysis explores to what extent IsDB lending follows the interests of Saudi Arabia in the Islamic world based on religious affinity. Chapter 2 focuses on the structure of IFIs as facilitators of political favors. The number of voting shares is generally assigned to each member according to their capital contributions and it is the most important feature in the structure of IFIs because it provides institutional control to large stakeholders. This chapter considers the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to identify the effect of the preference heterogeneity of influential members on the ease of approving politically motivated loans. And lastly, chapter 3 observes how IFIs adjust their policies to cope with the conflicting interests of other actors. Credit conditionality is the main policy instrument of IFIs to improve aid effectiveness but it can also serve to maintain an area of influence.

I Only Have One Time, World-Time. ¤ It is a widespread belief that Husserl’s conception of time obstructs the way to understanding world-time in a heideggerian sense. Unfolding world-time as one of the main topics of the last phases of Husserl’s analyses of time shall refute this criticism. The process of concretization of the transcendental ego also expresses the silent concretization of the world of phenomenology, and these concretizations lead to the topic of world-time. The study assumes that Husserl’s phenomenology undergoes a process of concretization with its peak in the theme of world-time.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045660-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067461-7>
On the Structural Composition and Dynamics of Saccharide/Protein Mixtures in Solution and in the Solid State ¤ In this thesis the influence of saccharides on proteins is investigated. Therefore the aggregation process of saccharides and proteins in solution is systematically investigated in dependence of the experimental conditions. The method of field-gradient NMR was used to measure the self diffusion coefficient. The results are interpreted in connection with the literature data. Furthermore the influence of a solid Trehalose matrix on the molecular dynamics of the cold-shock protein Csp was investigated. Several solid-state NMR experiments were used for the investigation. By comparing the molecular dynamics of the protein in dependence of the properties of the surrounding matrix (water content, crystalline or glassy Trehalose) one can find out information about the distribution of water molecules in the system. solid-state NMR; molecular dynamic; glassy Trehalose; diffusion; field-gradient NMR; aggregation process; protein; dehydration	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4168405-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4359683-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4529007-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7519977-4>

From unstructured to structured : context-based named entity mining from text ¤ With recent advances in the area of information extraction, automatically extracting structured information from a vast amount of unstructured textual data becomes an important task, which is infeasible for humans to capture all information manually. Named entities (e.g., persons, organizations, and locations), which are crucial components in texts, are usually the subjects of structured information from textual documents. Therefore, the task of named entity mining receives much attention. It consists of three major subtasks, which are named entity recognition, named entity linking, and relation extraction. These three tasks build up an entire pipeline of a named entity mining system, where each of them has its challenges and can be employed for further applications. As a fundamental task in the natural language processing domain, studies on named entity recognition have a long history, and many existing approaches produce reliable results. The task is aiming to extract mentions of named entities in text and identify their types. [...]	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4546354-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4728093-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4192516-6>
Noncommutative Stationary Processes ¤ Quantum probability and the theory of operator algebras are both concerned with the study of noncommutative dynamics.

High power ultra-short pulse lasers based on fiber driven OPCPA ¤ Ultrashort laser pulses enable fundamental studies on small length and time scales. Additionally, high pulse energies allows the access to new regimes of light matter interaction and the investigation of nanometer scale structures on attosecond time scales by XUV pulses produced via high harmonic generation (HHG). Unfortunately, the XUV photon flux is typically very low. Hence, high power and high repetition rate driving laser sources are required in order to improve the performance of current studies and to open the way for new exiting applications, such as seeding of free electron lasers. Regrettably, conventional (Ti:Sa) laser technology is limited in output power due to the thermo optical effects in the amplifier crystals. The objective of this thesis is the development of a new power scalable laser concept merging OPCPA technology with state-of-the-art high power fiber lasers. Based on modeling of the optical parametric amplifier, important requirements on the OPCPA pump are found which are adopted in choice and development of the pump laser later. Furthermore, the geometry of the optical parametric amplifier is optimized for ultra-broadband amplification. Gain narrowing and saturation effects are investigated in order to achieve high conversion efficiency. In addition, parasitic nonlinear effects, such as second harmonic generation of signal and idler wave, are studied and configurations are found which effectively avoid these unwanted effects.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4264163-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4260327-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4222149-3>
Light-driven diffusioosmosis : the manipulation of colloids using azobenzene containing surfactant ¤ The emergence of microfluidics created the need for precise and remote control of micron-sized objects. I demonstrate how light-sensitive motion can be induced at the micrometer scale by a simple addition of a photosensitive surfactant, which makes it possible to trigger hydrophobicity with light. With point-like laser irradiation, radial inward and outward hydrodynamic surface flows are remotely switched on and off. In this way, ensembles of microparticles can be moved toward or away from the irradiation center. Particle motion is analyzed according to varying parameters, such as surfactant and salt concentration, illumination condition, surface hydrophobicity, and surface structure. The physical origin of this process is the so-called light-driven diffusioosmosis (LDDO), a phenomenon that was discovered in the framework of this thesis and is described experimentally and theoretically in this work. To give a brief explanation, a focused light irradiation induces a local photoisomerization that creates a concentration gradient at the…	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4803438-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043973-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112704-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128790-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175378-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057472-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143803-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012277-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164695-2>

The derived flow equations are solved via pseudo-spectral methods. As they allow to resolve the full field dependence of the effective potential and provide highly accurate results, these numerical methods are very powerful but have hardly been used in the FRG context. We show their benefits using several examples. Moreover, we apply the pseudo-spectral methods to explore the phase diagram of a bosonic model with two coupled order parameters and to clarify the nature of a possible metastability of the Higgs-Yukawa potential.In the phase diagram of systems with two competing order parameters, fixed points govern multicritical behavior. Such systems are often discussed in the context of condensed matter. Considering the phase diagram of the bosonic model between two and three dimensions, we discover additional fixed points besides the well-known ones from studies in three dimensions. Interestingly, our findings suggest that in certain regions of the phase diagram, two universality classes coexist. To our knowledge, this is the first bosonic model where coexisting (multi-)criticalities are found. Also, the absence of nontrivial fixed points can have a physical meaning, such as in the electroweak sector of the standard model which suffers from the triviality problem. The electroweak transition giving rise to the Higgs mechanism is dominated by the Gaussian fixed point. Due to the low Higgs mass, perturbative calculations suggest a metastable potential. However, the existence of the lower Higgs-mass bound eventually is interrelated with the maximal ultraviolet extension of the standard model. A relaxation of the lower bound would mean that the standard model may be still valid to even higher scales. Within a simple Higgs-Yukawa model, we discuss the origin of metastabilities and mechanisms, which relax the Higgs-mass bound, including higher field operators.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177773-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4297710-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4496040-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132888-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4331341-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154496-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151966-8>
X-ray near-field holography : beyond idealized assumptions of the probe ¤ All images are flawed, no matter how good your lenses, mirrors etc. are. Especially in the hard X-ray regime it is challenging to manufacture high quality optics due to the weak interaction of multi-keV photons with matter. This is a tremendous challenge for obtaining high resolution quantitative X-ray microscopy images. In recent years lensless phase contrast imaging has become an alternative to classical absorption-based imaging methods. Without any optics, the image is formed only by the free space propagation of the wave field. The actual image has to be formed posteriori by numerical ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178318-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1117717453> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145435-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039238-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4739877-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4611588-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025643-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4316555-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154950-8>
Ecosystem transpiration from eddy covariance ¤ Transpiration is an integral part of the earth system, not only because plant water use is the dominant path by which water flows from the soil to the atmosphere, but also because water loss from leaves is intrinsically connected to CO2 uptake and provides a key link between global carbon and water cycles. Transpiration, while well studied at the scale of plants and leaves, remains difficult to quantify at the ecosystem, regional, and global scales. Differentiating between water vapor which has passed through plants, and is thus biologically controlled, and water vapor which is evaporated from surfaces without active control from plants through stomatal regulation is extremely challenging at the ecosystem scale with heterogeneous landscapes containing diverse plant species accessing soil water reserves at varying depths. One potential solution to characterizing transpiration on broader scales is to use eddy covariance to estimate ecosystem transpiration. Eddy covariance has been widely utilized to measure water, carbon, and energy fluxes, with synthesis initiative such as FLUXNET collating hundreds of sites around the world. However, methods for partitioning the total ecosystem water flux (evapotranspiration, ET) measured by eddy covariance systems into the individual components, i.e. transpiration (T) and abiotic evaporation (E), are needed. The work presented here demonstrates the viability and utility of ecosystem scale estimates of transpiration from eddy covariance datasets via data driven methodologies. Identifying key strengths and uncertainties in the method, such as the uncertainty in the magnitude of transpiration but strength in spatial and temporal patterns, better outlines future directions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189218-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4304141-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197017-2>
Time-Symmetry Breaking in Turbulent Multi-Particle Dispersion ¤ In fluid dynamics, the term turbulence usually describes a special state of a continuous medium in which many interacting degrees of freedom are excited. Turbulent flows therefore exhibit strong temporal and spatial fluctuations in velocity, pressure and other flow properties. This behavior can be found in the atmospheric flows that determine our weather and climate, water flows in rivers and oceans, and even in the coffee we drink and the air we breathe. One of the interesting phenomena observed in turbulent flows is their time irreversibility. When milk is stirred into coffee, for example...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1076338992> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117265-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1148978801>

Structure of Nucleon Excited States from Lattice QCD ¤ Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) describes the interactions between elementary quarks and gluons as they compose the nucleons at the heart of atomic structure. The interactions give rise to complexity that can only be examined via numerical simulations on supercomputers. This work provides an introduction to the numerical simulations of lattice QCD and establishes new formalisms relevant to understanding the structure of nucleons and their excited states. The research opens with an examination of the non-trivial QCD vacuum and the emergence of “centre domains.” The focus then turns to establishing a novel Parity-Expanded Variational Analysis (PEVA) technique solving the important problem of isolating baryon states moving with finite momentum. This seminal work provides a foundation for future calculations of baryon properties. Implementation of the PEVA formalism discloses important systematic errors in conventional calculations and reveals the structure of nucleon excited states from the first principles of QCD for the first time Introduction -- Background -- Centre Clusters in the Yang-Mills Vacuum -- Parity Expanded Variational Analysis -- Form Factors of the Proton and Neutron -- Elastic Form Factors of Nucleon Excitations -- Conclusion -- Bibliography -- Index	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042777-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128082-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4602703-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142423-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144076-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062355-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4609891-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4226961-1>
Central bank independence and the legacy of the German past ¤ The 2008 financial crisis led to more and more frequent political attacks on central banks. The recent spotlight on central bank independence is reminiscent of the fiery debates amongst Germany's political elites in 1949 on the same issue; debates that were sparked by the establishment of West Germany in that year. Simon Mee shows how, with the establishment of West Germany's central bank - today's Deutsche Bundesbank - the country's monetary history became a political football, as central bankers, politicians, industrialists and trade unionists all vied for influence over the legal provisions that set out the remit of the future monetary authority. The author reveals how a specific version of inter-war history, one that stresses the lessons learned from Germany's periods of inflation, was weaponised and attached to a political, contemporary argument for an independent central bank. The book challenges assumptions around the evolution of central bank independence with continued relevance today	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019889-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4751640-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
Influence of the pore structure on the catalytic performance of Rh-supported Zr-MOFs in the hydroformylation of olefins ¤ Zirconium-based metal-organic frameworks (Zr-MOFs) of different pore sizes and structure were synthesized and used for the preparation of the Rh-supported catalysts. The catalytic performance was studied in the hydroformylation of olefins to the corresponding aldehydes. A series of n-alk-1-enes of different chain length and bulky olefins with different size was used to study the influence of the pore size and structure. The results show that the Zr-MOF-based catalysts are very active and show high aldehyde selectivity.<eng>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190954-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4433743-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029919-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160908-6>
Data Protection Law Violations as Abuse of Dominant Position: The Facebook Case before the Federal Cartel Office ¤ BEGIN: The German Federal Cartel Office's decision stating that Facebook violated antitrust law by breaching the Data Protection Law is highly controversial. Is it possible to ground an abuse of market dominance on Data Protection Law violations?The author examines the formal, substantive and doctrinal issues of this legal question. By determining the scope and system of antitrust law, she establishes a number of criteria for deciding whether non-Antitrust Law breaches may justify an abuse of market power by use of unreasonable contractual terms. The monograph also addresses and evaluates the competence-related problems deriving from two different authorities examining the same Data Protection Law violations.The author concludes that non-antitrust law breaches may constitute an abuse of market power under circumstances present in the case of Data Protection Law, but that cartel authorities in Europe lack the competence to determine a breach of the GDPR themselves.

Self-adaptive data quality : automating duplicate detection ¤ Carrying out business processes successfully is closely linked to the quality of the data inventory in an organization. Lacks in data quality lead to problems: Incorrect address data prevents (timely) shipments to customers. Erroneous orders lead to returns and thus to unnecessary effort. Wrong pricing forces companies to miss out on revenues or to impair customer satisfaction. If orders or customer records cannot be retrieved, complaint management takes longer. Due to erroneous inventories, too few or too much supplies might be reordered. A special problem with data quality and the reason for many of the issues mentioned above are duplicates in databases. Duplicates are different representations of same real-world objects in a dataset. However, these representations differ from each other and are for that reason hard to match by a computer. Moreover, the number of required comparisons to find those duplicates grows with the square of the dataset size. To cleanse the data, these duplicates must be detected and removed. Duplicate detection is a very laborious process. To achieve satisfactory results, appropriate software must be created and configured (similarity measures, partitioning keys, thresholds, etc.). Both requires much manual effort and experience. - This thesis addresses automation of parameter selection for duplicate detection and presents several novel approaches that eliminate the need for human experience in parts of the duplicate detection process. - [...]	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1036653315> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139496-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011152-0>
Application of Supercritical Fluids for Separation Technology ¤ BEGIN: This work deals with different measurement techniques to determine high pressure phase equilibrium data, especially with a supercritical component as one component in the mixture. Carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide are primarily used as supercritical components. Both gases are used in a wide range of applications in industry. In this work, different systems were measured with different devices and under different conditions. But the focus of the experimental part of this work was the set-up and new commissioning of an apparatus for measuring high pressure phase equilibrium data. The apparatus consists of two cells which operate on different methods. In the theoretical part of this thesis various calculations are carried out for the description of the phase equilibrium behavior with a supercritical component. <dt.> END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186602-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160095-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017690-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132145-5>
Stable Vinyl Cations ¤ In the present thesis the synthesis and characterization of new beta,beta'-disilylsubstituted vinyl cations are described. These vinyl cations are prepared by hydride transfer reactions of alkynylsilanes with trityl TPFPB at room temperature. The first experimental molecular structure of a alpha-cyclopropyl substituted vinyl cation was present. The molecular structure of the alpha-cyclopropyl substituted vinyl cation illustrates the structural consequences of the interactions in the vinyl cation with both, the strained C-C bonds of the cyclopropyl unit and with the sigma-bonds of the beta-silyl substituents. NMR and IR investigations indicate the extent of sigma-delocalization. IR investigations of using salts of alpha-alkyl and alpha-aryl-beta,beta'-disilylsubstituted vinyl cations demonstrated a systematic dependency of the position of the ny(C=C+) band from the occurrence and degree of the beta-silyl hyperconjugation in these vinyl cations. In alpha-silyl- and alpha-germyl-beta,beta'-disilylsubstituted vinyl cations a degenerated rearrangement was verified, which is without precedence in carbocation chemistry.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188347-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170383-2>
Structure and composition of bacterial communities in the rhizosphere and root of Hypericum species ¤ The research on the secondary metabolites of the plant genus Hypericum has significantly increased during the past decades due to increasing interest in hypericin and hyperforin, which have anti-depressant effect. Although specific bacterial taxa are able to elicit hypericin and pseudo-hypericin production in H. perforatum in vitro, the impact of the entire rhizosphere and root bacterial communities in situ on the secondary metabolites production has not been fully investigated. This study provides novel insights on the potential link between bacterial communities of Hypericum and the production of hypericin and hyperforin, which has not been reported so far, in semi-natural habitat (botanical garden) and in a strictly controlled greenhouse experiment. The rhizosphere and root bacterial communities of several Hypericum species were investigated using Illumina short-read sequencing targeting the V3 region of 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Both total (DNA-based) and active (RNA-based) bacterial communities were inspected. The results on the controlled greenhouse experiment revealed that habitat was the strongest driver of the bacterial community of Hypericum, which was followed by soil substrate and plant species. Moreover, the plant species had a strong impact on the rhizosphere and root bacterial communities whereas bulk soil bacterial communities were governed by soil substrate. Approximately 1-2 % active bacterial taxa were identified in bulk soil, the rhizosphere, and inside the roots of Hypericum plants. The active bacterial taxa that are plant species-specific were also identified, which might perform functions that are relevant to the ecological roles of the host plant. These include members of Rhizobiaceae and Entotheonellaceae in H. perforatum, Sandracinaceae and Reyranella in H. olympicum, and Gemmataceae and Streptomyces in H. balearicum. The results warrant further study to determine the specific roles that the active bacteria carry in the rhizosphere or roots of their corresponding host-plant. Furthermore, two novel members of the family Rhodospirillaceae were successfully isolated from the rhizosphere of H. perforatum and were further characterized.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049846-3>
The Cauchy problem for the linearised Einstein equation and the Goursat problem for wave equations ¤ In this thesis, we study two initial value problems arising in general relativity. The first is the Cauchy problem for the linearised Einstein equation on general globally hyperbolic spacetimes, with smooth and distributional initial data. We extend well-known results by showing that given a solution to the linearised constraint equations of arbitrary real Sobolev regularity, there is a globally defined solution, which is unique up to addition of gauge solutions. Two solutions are considered equivalent if they differ by a gauge solution. Our main result is that the equivalence class of solutions depends continuously on the corresponding equivalence class of initial data. We also solve the linearised constraint equations in certain cases and show that there exist arbitrarily irregular (non-gauge) solutions to the linearised Einstein equation on Minkowski spacetime and Kasner spacetime. In the second part, we study the Goursat problem (the characteristic Cauchy problem) for wave equations. We specify initial data on a smooth compact [...]	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147404-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157961-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013941-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065315-8>
A methodology for characterization, modeling and mitigation of single event transient effects in CMOS standard combinational cells ¤ With the downscaling of CMOS technologies, the radiation-induced Single Event Transient (SET) effects in combinational logic have become a critical reliability issue for modern integrated circuits (ICs) intended for operation under harsh radiation conditions. The SET pulses generated in combinational logic may propagate through the circuit and eventually result in soft errors. It has thus become an imperative to address the SET effects in the early phases of the radiation-hard IC design. In general, the soft error mitigation solutions should accommodate both static and dynamic measures to ensure the optimal utilization of available resources. An efficient soft-error-aware design should address synergistically three main aspects: (i) characterization and modeling of soft errors, (ii) multi-level soft error mitigation, and (iii) online soft error monitoring. Although significant results have been achieved, the effectiveness of SET characterization methods, accuracy of predictive SET models, and efficiency of SET mitigation measures are ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4373773-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1156425328> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027242-4>
Playing Dystopia : nightmarish worlds in video games and the player's aesthetic response ¤ Video games today permeate our everyday existence. They immerse players in fascinating game-worlds and exciting experiences, often inviting them in various ways to reflect on the enacted events. Gerald Farca explores the genre of dystopian video games and the player's aesthetic response to their nightmarish game-worlds. Players, he argues, will gradually come to see similarities between the virtual dystopia and their own 'offline' environment, thus learning to stay wary of social and political developments. In his analysis, Farca draws from a variety of research fields, such as literary theory and game studies, combining them into a coherent theory of aesthetic response to dystopian games.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7661649-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063465-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4010457-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4202262-9>
International forest policy by international and transnational organizations : Case studies of the World Bank and forest certification organizations in Argentina and Armenia ¤ In recent decades, globalization and internationalization led to an increase in the number of international regimes attempting to influence national behaviour over many different issues. By using the case of the international forest regime complex this thesis seeks to evaluate how an international organization such as the World Bank and private institutions of forest certification influence domestic forest policy. The cases of Argentina and Armenia were selected as examples of developing countries open to international influences with weak forest sectors that went through a recent administrative restructuring. In so doing this dissertation seeks to answer how do international and transnational organizations influence domestic forest policies? The results show that: the influence of the World Bank in Argentina and Armenia pushed the forest sector towards deregulation; state bureaucracies play an important role in the implementation of transnational regimes at the national level; the political system of federal countries provides multiple institutional access points for policy change that international and transnational regimes try to use in order to influence the domestic level, consequently changing the power balance of the domestic networks.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123218-5>
The fungal focus on broad-scale metagenomics ¤ The fungal kingdom is omnipresent in a multitude of ecosystems across the earth's biosphere. In this dissertation, the fungal abundance was analyzed in a broad-scale way to determine general and specific patterns. Starting with a case study of the human gut and simulations modeling the metabolic profile of fungi, a user-friendly web server was developed allowing to study all publically available fungal cohorts. Finally, a meta-study was conducted to find general patterns across soil, aquatic and host-associated environments. This facilitated insights into what happens to the fungal community in disrupted environments, e.g., after antibiotics treatment or fire events to artificially turn an ecosystem towards a more resilient state using microbial editing. Most fungi were unique to a particular environment. No single inter-kingdom co-abundance between any bacterial and fungal genus was found in all three environments. However, a major fraction of fungal dissimilarity could be explained by just a few bacterial genera. Most of them were generalists, which were highly prevalent in all three environments. They are potential candidates for microbial editing because they probably play a key role in maintaining the structure of the ecosystem. The dysbalance was much longer-lasting for fungi compared to the bacterial microbiome. Unlike the taxonomic profile, changes to the functional metabolic profile were less severe. Future studies are needed to refine fungal patterns in less explored environments. In summary, both the biotic and the abiotic contexts are required to describe and predict fungal abundance patterns.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046076-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1111812888> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4611085-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1160786313>
Identification, Assessment, and Control of Risk Culture: An Empirical Study ¤ BEGIN: Events such as the financial crisis in 2008/09 and the Volkswagen scandal about diesel engines in 2015 show that the existence of a risk management system does not sufficiently protect companies from risks. An inadequate corporate risk culture is often used to explain the causes of such crises. The aim of this study is to create access to a more targeted approach to risk culture. This is achieved through a methodical combination of conceptual developments and semi-structured interviews with companies from different industries and ownership structures. To start with, the author develops a definition of risk culture, identifies its constituent elements and derives a risk culture framework from these elements. In doing so, she identifies both ways of assessing risk culture and risk culture control mechanisms. Among other things, her findings point to the central role of top and middle management in this regard and reveal a variety of risk culture control mechanisms. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121590-4>

Einsteins's opponents : the public controversy about the theory of relativity in the 1920s ¤ The research to date on the opponents of the theory of relativity is characterized by a strong focus on individual protagonists, particularly Lenard, Stark, Gehrcke, and Weyland, and specific events, particularly the presentations at the Philharmonic and the dispute in Bad Nauheim. In addition, this phenomenon is discussed primarily from the perspective of what it meant for Einstein to be confronted with attacks on his science and on himself as a person. In this book, however, the central question is what it meant for the persons who understood themselves as Einstein's opponents to be confronted with the theory of relativity-- "This detailed account of the controversy surrounding the publication of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity explores the ferocious popular and academic opposition which at one time encircled one of the most important scientific breakthroughs of the twentieth century. Based on extensive archival research, this fascinating discourse includes a compelling and entertaining examination of the contemporary literature created by Einstein's detractors.

Price and product-mix decisions under different cost systems ¤ Philipp Plank analyses the question, what drives the quality of cost-systems and is the quality of cost-systems directly and at best positively related to the firms' performance. In other words, is it worth investing in complex cost allocation systems or are there environmental and/or production settings in which less enhanced systems perform adequately. Using simulations, a benchmark firm (first-best solution) perfectly allocating cost to products is compared to firms implementing heuristic cost-allocation schemes (second-best solution) to identify the profit gap resulting from decisions based on limited information. Into this discussion, the idea of cost-stickiness is integrated, thereby indicating a new planning approach.

Transnational Black Dialogues : Re-Imagining Slavery in the Twenty-First Century ¤ Markus Nehl focuses on black authors who, from a 21st-century perspective, revisit slavery in the U.S., Ghana, South Africa, Canada and Jamaica. Nehl's provocative readings of Toni Morrison's A Mercy, Saidiya Hartman's Lose Your Mother, Yvette Christiansë's Unconfessed, Lawrence Hill's The Book of Negroes and Marlon James' The Book of Night Women delineate how these texts engage in a fruitful dialogue with African diaspora theory about the complex relation between the local and transnational and the enduring effects of slavery.

Membership in the Investment Corporation: Critical Evaluation and Impact on General Stock Corporation Law ¤ As a reaction to the rational apathy of small investors, German legislators introduced a concept of asymmetric membership of joint-stock companies with a massive imbalance in power between the extremely powerful enterprise shareholders and their weaker counterparts, investment shareholders. This concept deviates radically from the ordinary membership structure of German stock corporations. Stefan Blenk comprehensively analyses the ways of protecting the weak minority shareholders from excessive majority power and adapts the legislative concept of asymmetric membership to the requirements of the minority. Considering the general validity of his adapted concept of asymmetric membership, the author recommends the adoption of the central innovations of such a concept into general company law, that is, the deletion of the principle of mandatory law and the introduction of non-voting investment shareholders.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164094-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7628730-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/105847359X>
Impact of gallium on the defect landscape of sulfur-based chalcopyrite solar cells ¤ The open circuit voltage of solar cells based on Cu(In,Ga)S2 is limited by recombination losses via interface defect states. An increase of the open circuit voltage can be achieved by increasing the Ga content. However, little is known about the effect of Ga on the energy bands in sulfur-based chalcopyrites. In this work Cu(In,Ga)S2 solar cells with different Ga depth profiles are investigated by means of electro-optical methods with regard to the influence of Ga on the device and defect parameters. The results provide information about the influence of Ga on the energy bands of Cu(In,Ga)S2 solar cells. Furthermore, the characteristics of signatures evaluated by means of thermal admittance spectroscopy are compared to those of the signatures N1 and N2 that are known from Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells. This allows for further classification of the observed signatures.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4251278-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155859-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161400-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4150833-6>
Fugitive borders : black Canadian cross-border literature at mid-nineteenth century ¤ Fugitive Borders explores a new archive of 19th-century autobiographical writing by black authors in North America. For that purpose, Nele Sawallisch examines four different texts written by formerly enslaved men in the 1850s that emerged in or around the historical region of Canada West (now known as Ontario) and that defy the genre conventions of the classic slave narrative. Instead, these texts demonstrate originality in expressing complex, often ambivalent attitudes towards the so-called Canadian Promised Land and contribute to a form of textual community-building across national borders. In the context of emerging national discourses before Canada's Confederation in 1867, they offer alternatives to the hegemonic narrative of the white settler nation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116433-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035964-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143683-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4367340-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4285966-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138609-7>

Protocol conformance checking of component-based systems and service-oriented architectures ¤ component-based software engineering; protocol conformance; reliable component composition; SOA; web services; model checking; process rewrite systems; abstract behavior; static analysis; workflow validation This work developed a procedure that allows for the fully automatic verification of component protocols (e.g. business processes) of component software (particularly also SOA). In the protocols, it is specified which calls (e.g. order, repetitions) of the offered component interfaces are allowed. For protocol checking, component abstractions are used. Here, it was first possible to use a representation that can represent unbounded parallelism and unbounded recursion. For verification, an automatic procedure was defined. This ensures applicability during software development, e.g. the component character is also retained during verification. Furthermore, it is ensured that the software behavior is conservatively captured. Consequently, any existing protocol violation can be found. An important contribution was made to the review of software at the time of creation, so that it can be checked for errors before delivery.

Hybrid filters and multi-scale models ¤ This thesis is concerned with Data Assimilation, the process of combining model predictions with observations. So called filters are of special interest. One is inter- ested in computing the probability distribution of the state of a physical process in the future, given (possibly) imperfect measurements. This is done using Bayes’ rule. The first part focuses on hybrid filters, that bridge between the two main groups of filters: ensemble Kalman filters (EnKF) and particle filters. The first are a group of very stable and computationally cheap algorithms, but they request certain strong assumptions. Particle filters on the other hand are more generally applicable, but computationally expensive and as such not always suitable for high dimensional systems. Therefore it exists a need to combine both groups to benefit from the advantages of each. This can be achieved by splitting the likelihood function, when assimilating a new observation and treating one part of it with an EnKF and the other part with a particle filter. The second part ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1246234939>
The Patent Injunction Claim: History, Scope, and Reform ¤ The question of possible limitations to injunctive relief under patent law has once again become the focus of public attention. The core of the discussion is whether the enforcement of injunctive relief in its current form can lead to unjustified hardship for infringers and third parties. As a result of the most recent debate, the German lawmaker added a proportionality defence in the 2nd PatModG. Against this backdrop, the author examines the current concept of injunctive relief in patent law, its history, scope and reform in order to develop a practice-oriented solution for resolving dysfunctional case constellations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136774-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173539-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048806-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078579-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191765-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137659-6>
Nature as Contradiction : The Human-Nature Relationship in the Controversy over Green Genetic Engineering ¤ Green genetic engineering is one of the most controversial technologies in recent history. On the basis of a qualitative content analysis of German position papers criticising this technology, this book clarifies three questions: Why is the controversy so vehement and emotional? Why is there no prospect of a compromise on this matter? And what ideas of the relationship between humans and nature play a role in the dispute?‘Nature’ is omnipresent and dazzling, but how is this term used in current social debates? What concrete interpretations is ‘nature’ associated with?This study understands the controversy over green genetic engineering as an exemplary controversy that exposes fundamental aspects of the modern age and its relationship to nature.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045599-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4318394-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006791-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071722-7>

The near infrared activity of Sagittarius A* ¤ The meaning of my thesis was to obtain new insights about the supermassive Black Hole in the center of our Milky Way and its accretion flow. The non-thermal radio, X-ray, and near-infrared source Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is the electro-magnetic manifestation of the Black Hole. Sgr A* is a unique source to study the accretion onto a very massive compact object as it is the closest galactic nucleus. For this work I conducted observations as well as theoretical computations. The near-infrared camera CONICA in combination with the adaptive optics device NAOS at ESO's Very Large Telescope in Chile were used for the observations. The goal of our group was in particular to find further evidence for a quasi-periodic signal of ~17 minutes in radiation outbursts from Sgr A* that has been reported for the first time in 2003. The radiation outbursts - most often termed `flares' - are periods of ~50 - 130 minutes in which the flux of Sgr A* in the near-infrared rises up to a factor of ten. The quasi-periodic sub-structure thereby manifests itself as sub-flares with a constant separation superimposed on the larger, underlying flare. In 2005 and 2006 we were able to detect a significant periodicity, hence the previous findings are supported ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053793-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210359-9>

Information Intermediaries: Responsibility and Liability ¤ Regulatory approaches to internet intermediaries are currently subject to radical change. Aiming at an adequate reflection of their role in society, Alexander Schiff examines the appropriateness of traditional liability shields for third-party content and carves out potential for their reform. The question of the responsibility of service providers for illegal content is about as old as the internet itself – at least if one takes into account the period when it advanced to the technology of the masses. In order to protect innovation capabilities, many legal systems have issued more or less far-reaching liability privileges for user content since the mid-1990s. 25 years later, however, the social and economic framework conditions are completely different. Nevertheless, the law established at the time is often still in effect today. Alexander Schiff examines the rules on liability privileges in the EU, places them in the context of their US-American role models, and subjects their appropriateness to a critical review. In a phase of upheaval of legal access to information intermediaries, he shows reform perspectives that reflect their special social significance.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022901-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177276-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1217662863> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4406690-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308416-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7616549-8>

Underwater image restoration : super-resolution and deblurring via sparse representation and denoising by means of marine snow removal ¤ Underwater imaging has been widely used as a tool in many fields, however, a major issue is the quality of the resulting images/videos. Due to the light's interaction with water and its constituents, the acquired underwater images/videos often suffer from a significant amount of scatter (blur, haze) and noise. In the light of these issues, this thesis considers problems of low-resolution, blurred and noisy underwater images and proposes several approaches to improve the quality of such images/video frames.

Distribution functions of rotating galaxies : an integral field spectroscopy perspective ¤ The work done during the PhD studies has been focused on measurements of distribution functions of rotating galaxies using integral field spectroscopy observations. Throughout the main body of research presented here we have been using CALIFA (Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area) survey stellar velocity fields to obtain robust measurements of circular velocities for rotating galaxies of all morphological types. A crucial part of the work was enabled by well-defined CALIFA sample selection criteria: it enabled reconstructing sample-independent distributions of galaxy properties. In Chapter 2, we measure the distribution in absolute magnitude - circular velocity space for a well-defined sample of 199 rotating CALIFA galaxies using their stellar kinematics. Our aim in this analysis is to avoid subjective selection criteria and to take volume and large-scale structure factors into account. Using stellar velocity fields instead of gas emission line kinematics allows including rapidly rotating early type galaxies.

About sisters and starlets : Bsister and MIKC*-type MADS-box genes in rice development ¤ I investigate the function and evolution of different rice MIKC-type MADS-box genes, which due to their high variety and significance in plant development are excellent objects to study the outcome of gene duplications. Bsister MADS-box genes are known for their predominant role in plant female organ development. The rice Bsister gene OsMADS29 confers the ‘canonical’ Bsister function in rice. With a detailed comparative meta-analysis of all available Bsister gene expression patterns I underline the significance of OsMADS29-like genes within grass ovule and seed development. These genes are all very strongly and more or less exclusively expressed during ovule and/or seed development thus resembling eudicot and gymnosperm Bsister gene expression patterns. I further performed a detailed analysis of the rice gene OsMADS30 showing that it is a non-canonical Bsister gene: it has a comparatively weak and broad expression and T-DNA-insertion lines show no aberrant seed phenotype. I further demonstrated that OsMADS30 evolved under relaxed purifying selection and has a 3’ region that strongly deviates from other grass Bsister genes, including closely related OsMADS30 orthologs from wild rice species. This is due to the recent insertion of a hitherto unknown transposable element. T-DNA insertion lines of OsMADS30 show diminished vegetative growth, which might be first evidence for a neo-functionalization of OsMADS30. I also studied MIKC*-type MADS-domain proteins that function in pollen development: OsMADS62, OsMADS63 and OsMADS68. I demonstrate that they bind not as homodimers but only as heterodimers to DNA. This thesis contributes to a deeper understanding of the developmental and evolutionary significance of various rice MADS-box genes. Eventually it shows how fundamentally different the results of gene duplications even within the same gene family can turn out.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049271-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4365090-9>
May '68 : shaping political generations ¤ Much as in other locations around the world, civil uprising, particularly rooted in the activism of young people and students, plagued France during May of 1968. Massive strikes and occupations succeeded in paralyzing France’s economy and bringing the country to the verge of a leftist revolution.

Impact of aquifer heterogeneity on subsurface flow and salt transport at different scales : from a method determine parameters of heterogeneous permeability at local scale to a large-scale model for the sedimentary basin of Thuringia ¤ More than 70% of the German population rely on groundwater as their daily drinking water supply. Hence, the understanding of processes like fluid flow and solute transport in porous media are of broad relevance. However, subsurface hydrology faces two problems. On the one hand, information about the subsurface structure and hydraulic properties is scarce. On the other hand, many aquifer parameters like the permeability which controls the flow velocity, are heterogeneously distributed in space. This thesis is dedicated to the question of how aquifer heterogeneity impacts on subsurface flow and transport processes at different scales. We first present a large-scale numerical model of the Thuringian basin in order to investigate the mechanisms of saltwater transport. The results underline the fact that permeability and its heterogeneous spatial distribution are decisive factors for the evolving flow and salt patterns. Our results show that the correlation structure and the degree of heterogeneity (variance) impact significantly on the amount of dissolved salt and the location where salt reaches near-surface regions. Thermally induced convection is not present. However, variations in fluid density due to dissolved salt can lead to significant changes in the distribution and amount of salt in the Thuringian Basin. We further focus on a method to determine the statistical parameters which describe the heterogeneous spatial distribution of permeability by analyzing well flow at local scale. This is of interest, because pumping tests are a widely used tool to infer on porous medium characteristics. We derive an analytical solution which describes the drawdown of a steady state pumping test in 3D heterogeneous anisotropic media by making use of upscaling theory. By combining the analytical solution with an inverse estimation strategy we determine the statistical parameters, like mean permeability, variance and correlation length from on-site pumping tests.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185932-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057696-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022375-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055202-0>
Spectroscopy and photochemistry of transition metal complexes : a quantum chemical study ¤ Transition metal complexes possess unique chemical, photoredox and spectroscopical properties that makes them promising candidates as light harvesting antennae or photocatalytic centers in many photochemical devices, such as e.g. Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes in dye sensitized solar cells. The knowledge of the photochemical properties of these complexes is therefore of paramount importance to optimize their performance in these devices. To this aim, the computation of excited states and photochemical properties can provide useful hints to guide molecular design strategies. Unfortunately, the description of electronic excited states is still far from routine, as compared to ground state studies, and even more that of systems containing metal atoms. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131837-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193388-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170370-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4645624-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056138-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047979-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142423-2>
Fast and accurate supertrees : towards large scale phylogenies ¤ Phylogenetics is the study of evolutionary relationships between biological entities; phylogenetic trees (phylogenies) are a visualization of these evolutionary relationships. Accurate approaches to reconstruct hylogenies from sequence data usually result in NPhard optimization problems, hence local search heuristics have to be applied in practice. These methods are highly accurate and fast enough as long as the input data is not too large. Divide-and-conquer techniques are a promising approach to boost scalability and accuracy of those local search heuristics on very large datasets. A divide-and-conquer method breaks down a large phylogenetic problem into smaller sub-problems that are computationally easier to solve. The sub-problems (overlapping trees) are then combined using a supertree method. Supertree methods merge a set of overlapping phylogenetic trees into a supertree containing all taxa of the input trees. The challenge in supertree reconstruction is the way of dealing with conflicting information in the input trees. Many different algorithms for different objective functions have been suggested to resolve these conflicts. In particular, there are methods that encode the source trees in a matrix and the supertree is constructed applying a local search heuristic to optimize the respective objective function. The most widely used supertree methods use such local search heuristics. However, to really improve the scalability of accurate tree reconstruction by divide-and-conquer approaches, accurate polynomial time methods are needed for the supertree reconstruction step. In this work, we present approaches for accurate polynomial time supertree reconstruction in particular Bad Clade Deletion (BCD), a novel heuristic supertree algorithm with polynomial running time. BCD uses minimum cuts to greedily delete a locally minimal number of columns from a matrix representation to make it compatible. Different from local search heuristics, it guarantees to return the directed perfect phylogeny for the input matrix, corresponding to the parent tree of the input trees if one exists. BCD can take support values of the source trees into account without an increase in complexity. We show how reliable clades can be used to restrict the search space for BCD and how those clades can be collected from the input data using the Greedy Strict Consensus Merger. Finally, we introduce a beam search extension for the BCD algorithm that keeps alive a constant number of partial solutions in each top-down iteration phase. The guaranteed worst-case running time of BCD with beam search extension is still polynomial. We present an exact and a randomized subroutine to generate suboptimal partial solutions. In our thorough evaluation on several simulated and biological datasets against a representative set of supertree methods we found that BCD is more accurate than the most accurate supertree methods when using support values and search space restriction on simulated data. Simultaneously BCD is faster than any other evaluated method. The beam search approach improved the accuracy of BCD on all evaluated datasets at the cost of speed. We found that BCD supertrees can boost maximum likelihood tree reconstruction when used as starting tree. Further, BCD could handle large scale datasets where local search heuristics did not converge in reasonable time. Due to its combination of speed, accuracy, and the ability to reconstruct the parent tree if one exists, BCD is a promising approach to enable outstanding scalability of divide-and-conquer approaches.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4611085-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076110-1>
Thermal Processing of Communal Sewage Sludge and Other Biogenic Waste Materials ¤ BEGIN: At the Carl-von-Ossietzky University of Oldenburg a thermal process has been developed to reuse communal sewage sludge. The thermal process applied consists of a pyrolytic step working at temperatures of 600ʿC which yields oils. These oils may be used as chemical feed stock. Solid residues are gasified in a steam gasification working at temperatures around 900ʿC. To find out if this process can be applied to other waste material, waste wood and used linoleum have been processed in the same way but at a pyrolysis temperature of 500ʿC. To stabilise the resulting oils from pyrolysis a catalyst has been used to crack the hot pyrolysis vapours at temperatures of 450ʿC. The feed and resulting solid products were investigated with energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence. Fluidized bed technique was applied for the pyrolysis and the gasification. The hot gases were filtered with a sintered metal disc. The efficiency of the hot gas filtration could be verified by the fact that many elements were quantitatively retained in solid residues. <engl.> An der Universität Oldenburg ist in etlichen Arbeiten im Labormaßstab an der Entwicklung eines Verfahrens zur Verwertung kommunaler Klärschlämme gearbeitet worden.

Partitioning of atmospheric nitrogen under long-term reduced atmospheric deposition conditions in a Norway spruce forest ecosystem ¤ In the past century, anthropogenic activities have increased N input drastically to terrestrial ecosystems and influenced the global N cycle. Especially temperate forest ecosystems are affected in their productivity, species composition, soil chemistry and water quality. N input to forest ecosystems is retained in trees and soil. Excessive N is leached out or released as gases. The retention of N input in soils is mainly influenced by the stability of soil organic matter (SOM). Many forests in central Europe and North America have been subjected to N saturation, i.e. excessive N appeared as nitrate in the leachate below the rooting zone. Reduction of atmospheric N emission and consequent atmospheric N deposition is proposed to be the only practical long-term solution to improve N-saturated forest ecosystems. However, responses of N-saturated forest ecosystems to reduced atmospheric N deposition have been seldom investigated. In the present study, atmospheric deposition was manipulated through roof constructions below the canopy of a mature Norway spruce forest on the Solling plateau in central Germany. A £^(5)N tracer field and a density fractionation laboratory experiment were conducted in the present study to investigate the influence of long-term reduced atmospheric N deposition on the partitioning of atmospheric N in different forest ecosystem compartments as well as on the partitioning of atmospheric N retained in the soil in different SOM pools.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4282537-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183276-0>
Mapping vegetation types in a savanna ecosystem in Namibia : concepts for integrated land cover assessments ¤ The characterisation and evaluation of biodiversity and land-cover in Southern Africa&rsquo;s Savannas is a major prerequisite for suitable and sustainable land management and conservation purposes. However, mechanisms for frequent update of the status and trends of biodiversity and land change processes are still missing. The knowledge of the spatial distribution of vegetation types is an important information source for all social benefit areas. Remote sensing techniques are essential tools for mapping and monitoring of land-cover. The development and evaluation of concepts&rsquo; for integrated land-cover assessments attracted increased interest in the remote sensing community since evolving standards for the characterisation of land-cover enable an easier access and inter-comparability of earth observation data. Regarding the complexity of the savanna biome in terms of the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the vegetation structure and rainfall variability, the main research needs are addressing the assessment of the capabilities and limitations of using satellite data for land-cover and vegetation mapping purposes. While integrating Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series data for mapping vegetation types in Namibia, the temporal characteristics of semi-arid life-forms types were used for the classification of vegetation types in Namibia. The Random Forest framework was applied and evaluated for classifying vegetation types using MODIS time series metrics as input features. The study region comprised the Kalahari in the north-eastern communal lands of Namibia.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4601495-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043216-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179145-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187461-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128583-9>
Expanding the virosphere : advanced genomic classification ¤ The virosphere comprises all known and unknown viruses in our ecosystems. Advanced sequencing technologies in combination with metagenomic analysis have become a key tool for exploring this global diversity of viruses. However, discovery of novel viruses and comparative analyses are often based on small sequence fragments or lack biological context, which restricts a proper classification. In this study advanced genomic methods were used that included comprehensive knowledge of viral genomes along with supporting biological metadata in order to identify and classify viruses at different levels of genetic relationships. In a first example, the genetic background of vaccine-induced rabies cases was revealed by analyzing and comparing the genetic diversity of viral populations. Furthermore, the fundament for a taxonomic reclassification of orthopoxviruses was established on basis of a wide scale genomic analysis. In addition, novel neurotropic mamastroviruses from sheep and cattle were classified as members of a single species that provided evidence of interspecies transmission. Finally, two putative novel species of alphaherpesviruses and orthopoxviruses were identified. These examples are based on field cases that provide substantial corresponding clinical metadata and information of host-pathogen interactions.

Nitrogen-doped and porous carbons towards new energy storage mechanisms for supercapacitors with high energy density ¤ Supercapacitors are electrochemical energy storage devices with rapid charge/discharge rate and long cycle life. Their biggest challenge is the inferior energy density compared to other electrochemical energy storage devices such as batteries. Being the most widely spread type of supercapacitors, electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) store energy by electrosorption of electrolyte ions on the surface of charged electrodes. As a more recent development, Na-ion capacitors (NICs) are expected to be a more promising tactic to tackle the inferior energy density due to their higher-capacity electrodes and larger operating voltage. The charges are simultaneously stored by ion adsorption on the capacitive-type cathode surface and via faradic process in the battery-type anode, respectively. Porous carbon electrodes are of great importance in these devices, but the paramount problems are the facile synthetic routes for high-performance carbons and the lack of fundamental understanding of the energy storage mechanisms.

Hydro- and biogeochemical investigations of lake sediments in the Kenyan Rift Valley ¤ The lakes in the Kenyan Rift Valley offer the unique opportunity to study a wide range of hydrochemical environmental conditions, ranging from freshwater to highly saline and alkaline lakes. Because little is known about the hydro- and biogeochemical conditions in the underlying lake sediments, it was the aim of this study to extend the already existing data sets with data from porewater and biomarker analyses. Additionally, reduced sulphur compounds and sulphate reduction rates in the sediment were determined. The new data was used to examine the anthropogenic and microbial influence on the lakes sediments as well as the influence of the water chemistry on the degradation and preservation of organic matter in the sediment column. The lakes discussed in this study are: Logipi, Eight (a small crater lake in the region of Kangirinyang), Baringo, Bogoria, Naivasha, Oloiden, and Sonachi. The biomarker compositions were similar in all studied lake sediments; nevertheless, there were some differences between the saline and freshwater lake...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072678-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180608-6>
Methods for mobile robot localization using architectural floor plans ¤ BEGIN Abstract: In the near future, mobile robots are envisioned to autonomously operate in many complex scenarios such as assembly lines, warehouses, or domestic environments for assisting or even replacing people in repetitive and tedious tasks. In this context, robot localization is a crucial technology for every mobile vehicle to be fully operational. Localization methods commonly rely on accurate maps that are built fusing sensory measurements collected with the sensor modality on board the robot. To build those maps, robots have to be teleoperated through the entire area where they are required to operate, which in turn results in increased deployment time and costs for robot manufacturers, or additional effort for customers. In addition, map representations such as occupancy grids, can be hard to interpret for inexperienced operators. To overcome these drawbacks, in this dissertation we investigate methods for mobile robot localization using 2D architectural floor plans. In this thesis, we first propose a robust LiDAR-based system that uses architectural floor plans as map for localization. During operation, the robot builds and maintains an accurate representation of the environment while keeping it aligned to the floor plan. This allows the robot to cope with occlusion produced by obstacles and large structures that are not represented in the floor plan and which can significantly affect localization methods that only compare the current LiDAR measurements with the floor plan. Second, we propose a monocular camera-based localization system. Instead of creating map of the environment during navigation, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network to estimate room layout edges from single monocular images. To track the robot pose, we use Monte Carlo Localization and compare the estimated layout with a 3D model inferred from the 2D floor plan. The methods proposed in this dissertation have been evaluated using real-world datasets in order to assess their robustness and accuracy as well as their computational performance. The experiments show that the methods can be used in complex scenarios, such industrial and service applications END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167607-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7569134-6>
Tempi of Movement - Modes of Feeling: Expressivity, Merry Emotions, and Screwball Comedy ¤ What is the connection between the tempo of audiovisual images and the audience's emotional experience? Examining the screwball comedy of the 30s and 40s, this study looks at comedy and hilarity as temporal structures. Exchanges of blows, puns, and verbal acrobatics are embedded in a complex composition of voices, facial expressions, gestures, and visual constructions. The audience experiences and enjoys combat and rage as an elegant pas de deux. Through this perspective, the relationship between language expression, acting, and film image is fundamentally questioned. Merry audience enjoyment is less bound to narrative actions than to aesthetically expressive orchestrations, rhythms, and embodied meanings.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4382429-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127324-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006311-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019702-5>

Numerical studies of higher-dimensional localized black holes and holographic Weyl semimetals ¤ In our everyday lives, we experience three spatial dimensions and a fourth dimension of time. Neverthe-less, several intricate problems of modern physics may be mastered with the introduction of additional dimensions, including the hierarchy problem and the unification of the fundamental forces. Furthermore, dualities between certain strongly coupled quantum field theories and particular gravitational theories in higher dimensions were conjectured based on string theory, which generically comes with the premise of extra dimensions. Specifically, the AdS/CFT correspondence or rather gauge/gravity duality motivated the study of a wide variety of higher dimensional gravitational theories with additional matter. The first part of this thesis covers the numerical construction of localized black holes in five, six and ten dimensional Kaluza-Klein theories. We focus on static, asymptotically flat vacuum solutions of Einstein’s field equations with one periodic compact dimension. Our study concentrates on the critical regime, where the poles of the localized black holes are about to merge. We utilize a well adapted multi-domain pseudo-spectral scheme for obtaining high accuracy results and investigate the phase diagram of the localized solutions far beyond previous results. A spiral phase space structure is found for the five and six dimensional setups which matches to the results that were recently obtained for non-uniform black strings. On the contrary, the phase space structure of the ten dimensional configuration exhibits no spiraling behavior of the thermodynamical quantities. These critical exponents were extracted from the numerical data of the aforementioned configurations and show an excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions. In the second part of this thesis, the AdS/CFT correspondence is employed for studying strongly coupled Weyl semimetals. More concretely, we numerically investigate the effects of inhomogenities within a holographic Weyl semimetal by using a pseudo-spectral scheme, including interfaces of Weyl semimetals and the impact of time independent disorder. When studying interfaces between different Weyl semimetal phases, we observe the appearance of an electric current, that is restricted to the interface in the presence of an electric chemical potential. The related integrated current is universal in the sense that it only depends on the topology of the phases. These results may shed some light on anomalous transport for inhomogeneous magnetic fields. As another point, we study the effects of time independent one-dimensional disorder on the holographic Weyl semimetal quantum phase transition (QPT), with a particular focus on the quantum critical region. We observe the smearing of the sharp QPT linked to the appearance of rare regions where the order parameter is locally non-zero. We discuss the role of the disorder correlation and we compare our results to expectations from condensed matter theory at weak coupling. We also analyze the interplay of finite temperature and disorder.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4338132-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025643-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195351-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224276-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4158819-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4202326-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174149-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053793-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7752120-1>
Novel cyclic α-phosphino-α-amino acids and α-phosphonium glycolates, P,O ̄ligands and nickel complexes : syntheses, structural characterization, properties and use in catalysis ¤ Novel heterocyclic alpha-phosphinoamino acids, by structural relationship named 3-phosphaprolines, were obtained by cyclocondensation of 2-phenylphosphinoethylamines with glyoxylic, pyruvic or phenylglyoxylic acid at room temperature in diethylether. The reactions proceed via primary attack of the P-lone electron pair, as shown by the synthesis of phosphonium glycolates from tertiary phosphines and glyoxylic acid, and addition of PH at the carbonyl group. The ring closure proceeds by replacement of the hydroxy by the amino group and is kinetically controlled. NMR monitoring of the phosphaprolines in CD3OD over several days indicates changes of the diastereoisomer ratios leading to higher contents of the more stable trans-diastereoisomers. The zwitterionic compounds are soluble in part in CD3OD, DMF or DMSO, are somewhat sensitive to air in solution and may undergo hydrolysis with larger amounts of water. The structures are proved by multinuclear NMR spectra and two crystal structure analyses. Suitable phosphaprolines as well phosphonium glycolates and Ni(COD)2 allow to generate precatalysts, activated by NaH for the oligomerisation of ethylene to mainly linear products with methyl and vinyl end groups. Some additional investigations with phosphinophenolates, another type of P-C-C-O- ligands, were performed for comparison. Precatalysts prepared from 2-phosphinophenolesters and Ni(COD)2 at room temperature were characterized by multinuclear NMR but decomposed on ...

Hunter self-monitoring and wildlife governance in an industrial forestry concession in the Republic of Congo : context, behaviour change, and wildlife monitoring ¤ The hunting of wild animals is widespread in the Congo basin. It is an important component of food and livelihood in rural areas, but is not sustainable. In this thesis, different aspects of hunting in an industrial forest concession in Congo are investigated. Using Social Network Analysis, we investigate who is involved in the governance of wildlife, how, and why. Using a behavioural economics experiment, we test whether self-monitoring can lead to a more sustainable use of resources. A comparison of indicators calculated from hunting trips, snare trapping and a camera trapping survey shows that they are correlated between methods and with hunting pressure, and that they respond to the decline of large species threatened by hunting. Hunters are excluded from managing the resource they exploit. Their integration could be beneficial for managing wildlife, by making behaviour more sustainable and providing important data on populations.

Development of deep learning applications for the automated extraction of chemical information from scientific literature ¤ This dissertation focuses on developing deep learning applications for extracting chemical information from scientific literature, particularly targeting the automated recognition of molecular structures in images. DECIMER Segmentation, a novel application, employs a Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (MRCNN) model to segment chemical structures in documents, aided by a mask expansion algorithm, marking a significant advancement in processing chemical literature. The Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) tool DECIMER Image Transformer uses an encoder-decoder architecture to convert chemical structure depictions into the machine-readable SMILES format. The model has been trained on over 450 million pairs of images and SMILES representations. Its ability to interpret various depiction styles, including hand-drawn structures, sets a new standard in OCSR. To artificially generate large and diverse OCSR training datasets using multiple cheminformatics toolkits, RanDepict was developed. The diversification of training data ensures robust model generalisation across different chemical structure depictions. A unique dataset of hand-drawn molecule images was created to evaluate the model's performance in interpreting these challenging depictions. This dataset further contributes to the understanding of automated structure recognition from diverse styles. The integration of these technologies led to the creation of DECIMER.ai, an open-source web application that combines segmentation and interpretation tools, allowing users to extract and process chemical information from literature efficiently. The work concludes with a discussion on the significance of open data in advancing molecular informatics, highlighting the potential to broader chemical research domains. By adhering to FAIR data standards and open-source principles, the tools developed for this dissertation are designed for adaptability and future development within the community.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040936-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167869-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145448-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193754-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4290091-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1064023886>
Consideration of non-statutory security and conduct rules : application of Art. 17 Rome II Regulation on the example of cross-border prospectus liability law ¤ BEGIN: This study develops a consistent concept for the application of the special conflicts law rule of Art. 17 of the Rome II Regulation. The concept developed is subjected to a case study in cross-border prospectus liability law. The work is the first to demonstrate that Art. 17 of Rome II can be used to take into account the law of the marketplace in a methodologically convincing manner, and it thus makes a contribution not only to general private international law but also to international capital markets law.In particular, economic reasons demand a link to the marketplace where securities have been issued. However, according to the current legal situation, the different residence rights of the investors have to be applied. As a consequence, the applicable law is fragmented from the issuer’s point of view (mosaic principle). This inappropriate situation can be corrected with the help of Art. 17 of Rome II, and the study’s findings can be extended to other fields of law.END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132213-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031772-9>

From Bilateral Arbitration and Investment Courts to a Multilateral Investment Court: Options for the Institutionalization of Investor-State Dispute Settlement ¤ A new Multilateral Investment Court (MIC) is to be the answer to criticism, particularly voiced in recent years in context with CETA and TTIP, of international investment protection law in general and of ad hoc arbitration between investors and states in particular. Key points of such a permanent court are its strictly constitutional design, which includes the highest requirements for the judicial appointment procedure as well as personal integrity, independence and qualification of the judges. A possible cost reduction for all parties concerned, as well as aspects of transparency, the uniformity of jurisprudence and an effective enforceability of the decisions are also considered. The present study on MIC feasibility is to contribute to a broader discussion of design possibilities of such a new international specialised court for issues of investment protection.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4238208-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121346-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130775-6>
Infrared and Mass Spectrometer System for Dynamic Measurement of Motor Exhaust ¤ Due to growing individual transport in industrial countries and associated increase in pollutant emissions, legislature toughens emission standards regularly. Automakers are therefor challenged to develop ever more efficient low-emission vehicles to take account of the public climate debate and effects of pollutants on humans and nature. Conventional exhaust gas measurement systems are limited when it comes to measuring gases other than O2, CO2, CO, NOX and total-HC or when high measurement frequencies are of the essence to resolve transient processes. Additional specialized single component measurement systems increase the already high complexity of conventional exhaust emission measurement devices. Topic of this work was the study of all aspects of a mobile, versatile and dynamic exhaust gas measurement system, which integrates the multi component measurement systems mass spectrometer and Fourier-Transform infrared spectrometer. Analyzers were specifically modified and optimized for this application, a common sampling system was designed, and a corresponding software structure was realized. Methods were researched for the optimal adjustment of the system to different applications and for increasing system stability as well as minimizing calibration effort by measuring combustion products like CO2 and H2O and other components with both analyzers in parallel. Additionally Argon is used as some kind of internal standard to adjust and stabilize the mass spectrometer. Measurements in the laboratory and on gasoline and diesel engines show, that limited and non-limited as well as other exhaust gas components can be detected in concentrations down to 1 ppm and with up to 20 Hz. As exemplary applications the measurement of all main exhaust gas components, the differentiation of hydro carbons, the behavior of nitrogen oxides and ammonia on a SCR catalytic converter, the detection of hydrogen in gasoline engine exhaust and the determination of exhaust mass flow rate using Helium as tracer gas are demonstrated. This work shows the advantages of the hybrid measurement system over conventional exhaust emission measurement devices. Higher measurement frequency and much broader spectrum of detectable gas components open a very wide field of application. Lower calibration effort and compact design allow an efficient operation on a regular basis. It can be advantageous deployed to solve current and future problems in exhaust gas measurement as well as outside this field of application.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169043-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161702-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000123-4>
Breaking the diffraction limit : Experiment and theory on sub-diffraction limited focusing and imaging realised in the THz frequency regime ¤ Summary: This thesis investigates the diffraction limit of light and studies theoretically and experimentally different strategies to overcome this limit. The diffraction limit states that it is not possible to create an image of an object with a resolution smaller than half the wavelength. The basal reason for this effect is the loss of information when light is emitted or scattered by an object and reconstructed by a classical optical system. There are already many ways to obtain images with subwavelength resolution, for example by measuring the near field of an object, or by adding information regarding, for instance, the location (STED).In this work, however, is not about measuring methods, but fundamentally the interaction of light with matter. Therefore, a terahertz near-field microscope is used which is able to measure electric field distributions with a resolution far below the diffraction limit.First, the diffraction-limited focusing of light in free space is investigated. These results are used to determine the Gouy phase of strongly focused, linearly and radially polarised terahertz radiation. Hereby, not only the transverse, but also the longitudinal component are investigated. Subsequently, two material systems are introduced which allow for focusing light below the diffraction limit and to generate images whose resolution are far below the diffraction limit.The first system is a plasmonic lens. It consists of a circular electrically conductive disc, along the edge of which surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are excited, when illuminated with radially polarised radiation. These SPPs propagate in phase towards the centre of the disc and interfere constructively so that a maximum is generated at the centre. This maximum, described by a Bessel function of the 0th order is independent of any numerical aperture, thus allowing the focusing below the diffraction limit. By adding rings around the central disc, with a spacing corresponding to the circular Bragg condition, the intensity of certain frequencies can be increased.The second system is a metamaterial, which is referred to as wire medium. It consists of an array of very narrow metal wires that are embedded in a host. Such a structure exhibits a strong optical anisotropy. Therefore, it has very interesting optical properties that allow to convert evanescent waves into propagating waves, to transport and reconstruct them on the image plane of the wire medium	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4312216-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547278-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4259168-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174845-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4346673-4>
Memory limitations in sentence comprehension : a structural-based complexity metric of processing difficulty ¤ This dissertation addresses the question of how linguistic structures can be represented in working memory. We propose a memory-based computational model that derives offline and online complexity profiles in terms of a top-down parser for minimalist grammars (Stabler, 2011). The complexity metric reflects the amount of time an item is stored in memory. The presented architecture links grammatical representations stored in memory directly to the cognitive behavior by deriving predictions about sentence processing difficulty. Results from five different sentence comprehension experiments were used to evaluate the model's assumptions about memory limitations. The predictions of the complexity metric were compared to the locality (integration and storage) cost metric of Dependency Locality Theory (Gibson, 2000). Both metrics make comparable offline and online predictions for four of the five phenomena. The key difference between the two metrics is that the proposed complexity metric accounts for the structural complexity of intervening material. In contrast, DLT's integration cost metric considers the number of discourse referents, not the syntactic structural complexity. We conclude that the syntactic analysis plays a significant role in memory requirements of parsing. An incremental top-down parser based on a grammar formalism easily computes offline and online complexity profiles, which can be used to derive predictions about sentence processing difficulty.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035843-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4431524-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4300621-8>
On the Writing Instruction of Pre-service German Teachers in the Practical Phase: An Explorative Case Study on the Changes of Subject Matter Content Knowledge and Pedagogical Content Knowledge ¤ During their school internship student teachers gain their first long term practical teaching experiences at school. So far it is unclear how their theoretical knowledge gained during their studies at university is transformed through the internship. This gap is especially evident in the domain of writing classes. In order to investigate the development of their subject matter content knowledge and paedagogical content knowledge empirically, the writing classes of nine student German teachers are documented during their internship and set into relation with qualitative interviews and the connection of the knowledge stocks by the students through concept maps. Possible changes in the knowledge of the students, which could be affected by the internship, can thus be reconstructed. The results suggest that the previously unsystematically existing knowledge, which is activated during the internship, partly becomes more differentiated and systematized by the practical experiences in school. In this way one of the potentials of practical experience in the teacher education is shown.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123176-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053534-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011975-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053284-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131946-1>
Orbital Dynamics in the Gravitational Field of Small Bodies ¤ Introduction -- SSSB Model and equations of motion -- Stability of equilibrium points and the local behavior of orbits -- Topology and stability of large-scale periodic orbits -- Resonant orbit near the equatorial plane -- Free motion of a particle close to the surface of SSSBs -- Conclusions and future directions. This prizewinning PhD thesis presents a general discussion of the orbital motion close to solar system small bodies (SSSBs), which induce non-central asymmetric gravitational fields in their neighborhoods. It introduces the methods of qualitative theory in nonlinear dynamics to the study of local/global behaviors around SSSBs. Detailed mechanical models are employed throughout this dissertation, and specific numeric techniques are developed to compensate for the difficulties of directly analyzing. Applying this method, several target systems, like asteroid 216 Kleopatra, are explored in great detail, and the results prove to be both revealing and pervasive for a large group of SSSBs.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072014-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177065-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174799-9>
Development of an Embedding Theory for the Calculation of Energetic Properties of Adsorbates on Metal Surfaces ¤ In this thesis a completely self consistent embedded cluster scheme has been developed. The theory allows the treatment of a cluster with ab initio methods (MP-n, CASSCF, CI) while a metallic environment is described via an embedding operator within Density Functional Theory (DFT). While previous applications within this theory used a partially self consistent embedding operator, in this work the derivation of a completely self consistent embedding scheme is presented. The theory is applied to the calculation of the adsorption energy of a CO molecule on a Pd(111) surface. The results are in very good agreement with experimental adsorption energies. The calculated binding energy of E=-1.63eV using the Moller-Plesset perturbation theory differs the experimental value by E=0.09eV.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145565-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164521-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151344-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141062-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174856-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4246521-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4258514-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141453-6>
Hidden Order and Exotic Superconductivity in the Heavy-Fermion Compound URu2Si2 ¤ In this thesis, the author investigates hidden-order phase transition at T0 = 17.5 K in the heavy-fermion URu2Si2. The four-fold rotational symmetry breaking in the hidden order phase, which imposes a strong constraint on the theoretical model, is observed through the magnetic torque measurement. The translationally invariant phase with broken rotational symmetry is interpreted as meaning that the hidden-order phase is an electronic “nematic” phase. The observation of such nematicity in URu2Si2 indicates a ubiquitous nature among the strongly correlated electron systems. The author also studies the superconducting state of URu2Si2 below Tc = 1.4 K, which coexists with the hidden-order phase. A peculiar vortex penetration in the superconducting state is found, which may be related to the rotational symmetry breaking in the hidden-order phase. The author also identifies a vortex lattice melting transition. This transport study provides essential clues to the underlying issue of quasiparticle dynamics as to whether a quasiparticle Bloch state is realized in the periodic vortex lattice	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187186-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4329751-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252866-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058651-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268288-5>
Corporate Governance and Corporate Success: An Empirical Analysis of the Relationship between Leadership, Control, and Incentive Structures and Business Development of German Banks ¤ In the aftermath of the recent financial crisis, the international banking system attracted much attention by researchers and regulators. Since poor bank governance is seen as a major cause of the recent crisis, a deeper understanding is needed how banks are governed and how bank governance is associated with performance and risk taking. This report deals with two important yet less extensively examined aspects of corporate governance in banks: executive team expertise and non-executive compensation schemes. Both aspects are analyzed in two separate empirical studies, respectively. The analyses are based on two unique data sets: a hand-collected data set on the biographical background of board members and confidential payroll data for non-executive bank employees provided by an international consulting company. The results indicate that both aspects of corporate governance matter. Higher executive team expertise is associated with superior bank outcomes regarding performance, risk and efficiency. Compensation analyses show strong variation in compensation schemes between banks and bank divisions. Moreover, the results indicate that strong incentives in capital market divisions induced excessively high risks in the capital market segments in the run up to the crisis, while this nexus cannot be observed for more moderate bonus schemes in the crisis period.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4419850-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125011-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032950-1>
High resolution multi-wavelength study of active galaxies ¤ This PhD thesis presents a study of active galaxies carried out from cm- to mm-wavelengths with high angular resolution. The mechanism of the activity in these objects is supposed to be strongly correlated with the accretion of matter onto a super-massive black hole in their centres. One approach to increase the understanding of these highly interesting sources is to observe and analyse the molecular gas. The characteristics of its distribution and dynamics are indispensible diagnostic tools to investigate the accretion processes at different angular scales. A second approach is the study of emission originating in the direct vicinity of the black hole, such as non-thermal radio emission. To account for different activity levels, five objects were chosen ranging from nearby, Low Luminosity Active Galaxies (LLAGs; NGC3718 at z=0.003 and NGC1068 at z=0.004) to higher redshifted, High LAGs (HLAGs; HE1029-1831 at z=0.039, 3C48 at z=0.367, and Q0957+561 at z=1.414). The first two sources are part of the NU(clei of)-GA(laxy) project, that aims at analysing the distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas at high angular resolution/sensitivity in a sample of 30 nearby LLAGs. HE1029-1831 is part of a complementary sample of nearby HLAGs with similar aims. All sources were observed in carbon-monoxide (CO), known to be a good molecular gas tracer, with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) providing high sensitivity and high angular resolution. CO emission was detected in all five galaxies. In NGC3718, the molecular gas disk, having roughly two hundred million solar masses, is highly warped.

Adopting new ideas and objects across Europe during the later 3rd millennium BC (c. 2600-2000 BC) ¤ This book deals with the question how communities across Europe during the later 3rd millennium BC adopt and transform the Bell Beaker phenomenon differently. By looking at these processes of change from the perspective of settlements and settlement material culture, an interpretation is given to the development of this phenomenon that is alternative to the currently prevailing migration models. Instead, the author uses social theories on the spread of innovations, the development and functioning of communication networks and the social technologies involved in the production of material culture in his arguments. For the first time, settlements from various regions of Europe are studied at the same level and compared using modern research methods such as aoristic frequency distributions, the Bayesian modelling of radiocarbon dates and network analyses. Temporal and spatial variability in the regional processes that lead to the adoption (and rejection!) of Bell Beaker innovations are described in detail. The regional variability in communication between settlements, and the exchange of ideas and objects and mobility of people are combined with sociological network theories on the spread and adoption of novel ideas. Regional differences in the production of pottery are reviewed by both quantitative and qualitative methods. Finally, a Bell Beaker network is described in which various processes of innovation adoption and subsequent re-invention, developing communication networks and different forms of mobility take part.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157634-2>
Extraction studies of suberin from bark and synthesis of lignin Isocyanate-Free Polyurethanes: byproducts of the beech wood industry ¤ Abstract: The aim of this dissertation was to characterize extracts from European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and to obtain and to utilize the extracts to produce bio-based Non-Isocyanate Polyurethane (NIPU) copolymers. In the course of the first part of this study, extracts were collected from the bark by successive Soxhlet extraction with dichloro methane (DCM), methanol and water. Then the natural polyester suberin was extracted with a rather low yield (3.7 ±0.9 wt.%) from the remaining extract-free bark by methanolysis. The extracts and the predominantly aliphatic suberin monomers were investigated using the analytical methods of Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Fourier-Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectroscopy, UltraViolet–Visible spectroscopy, Elemental Analysis, Thermal Gravimetric Analysis and Differential Scanning Calorimetry.

Mathematical modeling and computer simulation of mitotic transition control mechanisms ¤ BEGIN The eukaryotic cell cycle is a tightly regulated sequence of processes leading from cell growth over DNA replication to the physical division of the mother into two daughter cells, each containing a complete set of chromosomes and organelles. Transition from one process to the next is guided by a number of crucial surveillance mechanisms, the so called cell cycle checkpoints. Dis-regulation of the cell cycle through checkpoint malfunction can lead to developmental defects and contribute to the development or progression of tumors. The cell cycle checkpoints are complex biochemical signal transduction networks, and their elaborate spatiotemporal dynamics are challenging to understand intuitively. Mathematical modeling and computer simulation can help to decrypt the underlying principles. This thesis approaches two important mitotic checkpoints with mathematical modeling and simulation. The highly conserved spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) guards the transition from meta- to anaphase, preventing premature chromosome segregation to the spindle poles. In contrast to SAC, the spindle position checkpoint (SPOC) ensures that during asymmetric cell division in budding yeast mitotic exit does not occur until the spindle is properly aligned with the cell polarity axis. Although there are no known homologs, there is indication that functionally similar checkpoints exist also in animal cells. First, a detailed analysis of the kinetic consequences of localization of SAC key components to the kinetochores is presented. Second, a truly minimal, though physically meaningful kinetic model of the small Ras-linke GTPase Tem1 is established to develop the first detailed model of the SPOC. Both analyses provide valuable insights into mitotic transition control on a systems level and demonstrate that mathematical modeling, despite all unavoidable abstraction, constitutes a powerful tool for investigation of the dynamic properties of complex biological systems.

Legitimation, Legitimacy, and European Human Dignity: A Contribution to the Discussion on the European Right to Democracy ¤ This work provides an interdisciplinary approach with the aim of supporting European legitimacy during the ongoing process of European integration. From a legal perspective, it analyses the concept of output legitimacy, borrowed from the field of political science, and contrasts it with the rule of law. The genuine European subjective rights, then, constitute the foundation of European legitimacy by rule of law. This work concludes by offering a theoretical development of the European integration process – how long will European legitimacy last? To provide for this event of its end, a right to European democracy is deduced on the basis of the European ideal of human dignity.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038654-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011413-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035043-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114382-6>
The Liability for Chance in Civil Law: A Dogmatic Delimitation to Liability for Random Damages ¤ Why should a person be liable for circumstances that are beyond his control? The work by Alexander Seitz focuses on this question. Starting from an introduction to the concept of chance and the dogmatic foundations of the principle of fault, he analyses the provisions of this form of liability in the German Civil Code. This analysis reveals the diversity of this form of liability. The author examines the dogmatic differences between the liability for Acts of God and the liability for random damages in the context of the principles of causality and fault. Furthermore, the author assesses the effectiveness of the establishment of a liability for Acts of God as an instrument of the legislator to control behaviour.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068050-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068129-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194193-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187978-8>

Investigations on the phylogenetic diversity of urease producing bacteria in soil, the inhibition of urea active transportation and metabolizing in Bacillus megaterium DSM 90 ¤ Bacillus megaterium; Microbial urease; Urea transportation; Urease inhibition; Phylogenetic diversity of bacteria in soil; T-RFLP; Phosphoric amide; Bacterial urease isolation and purification. In this study, the effects of selected phosphoric amide compounds on soil-dwelling urease-producing bacterial communities and on the physiology of B. megaterium DSM90 urease were investigated. By conventional and metagenomic approaches, the composition of the microbial community in the soil was investigated. The results showed that the type and concentration of the used phosphoric amide compounds played an important role in changing and shaping this microbial community. The studies of the active transport of urea into the cell interior of B. megaterium DSM90 showed that most of the investigated compounds strongly inhibited urea uptake not only by suppressing the active transporters. The bacterial urease of B. megaterium DSM90 was isolated and purified by various downstream procedures. The characterization of the inhibition of urease by the used phosphoramid compounds showed that all tested compounds non-competitively inhibit urease with a KI value of less than 0.02 nM.

Global dynamics of magnetic reconnection in VINETA II ¤ Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental plasma process where a change in field line connectivity occurs in a current sheet at the boundary between regions of opposing magnetic fields. In this process, energy stored in the magnetic field is converted into kinetic and thermal energy, which provides a source of plasma heating and energetic particles. Magnetic reconnection plays a key role in many space and laboratory plasma phenomena, e.g. solar flares, Earth's magnetopause dynamics and instabilities in tokamaks. A new linear device (VINETA II) has been designed for the study of the fundamental physical processes involved in magnetic reconnection. The plasma parameters are such that magnetic reconnection occurs in a collision-dominated regime. A plasma gun creates a localized current sheet, and magnetic reconnection is driven by modulating the plasma current and the magnetic field structure. The plasma current is shown to flow in response to a combination of an externally induced electric field and electrostatic fields in the plasma, and is highly affected by axial sheath boundary conditions. Further, the current is changed by an additional axial magnetic field (guide field), and the current sheet geometry was demonstrated to be set by a combination of magnetic mapping and cross-field plasma diffusion. With increasing distance from the plasma gun, magnetic mapping results in an increase of the current sheet length and a decrease of the width. The control parameter is the ratio of ...

Improved rapid assessment of earthquake hazard safety of existing buildings using a hierarchical Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Model ¤ Although it is impractical to avert subsequent natural disasters, advances in simulation science and seismological studies make it possible to lessen the catastrophic damage. There currently exists in many urban areas a large number of structures, which are prone to damage by earthquakes. These were constructed without the guidance of a national seismic code, either before it existed or before it was enforced. For instance, in Istanbul, Turkey, as a high seismic area, around 90% of buildings are substandard, which can be generalized into other earthquake-prone regions in Turkey. The reliability of this building stock resulting from earthquake-induced collapse is currently uncertain. Nonetheless, it is also not feasible to perform a detailed seismic vulnerability analysis on each building as a solution to the scenario, as it will be too complicated and expensive. This indicates the necessity of a reliable, rapid, and computationally easy method for seismic vulnerability assessment, commonly known as Rapid Visual Screening (RVS). In RVS methodology, an observational survey of buildings is performed, and according to the data collected during the visual inspection, a structural score is calculated without performing any structural calculations to determine the expected damage of a building and whether the building needs detailed assessment. Although this method might save time and resources due to the subjective/qualitative judgments of experts who performed the inspection, the evaluation process is dominated by vagueness and uncertainties, where the vagueness can be handled adequately through the fuzzy set theory but do not cover all sort of uncertainties due to its crisp membership functions. In this study, a novel method of rapid visual hazard safety assessment of buildings against earthquake is introduced in which an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2FLS) is used to cover uncertainties. In addition, the proposed method provides the possibility to evaluate the earthquake risk of the building by considering factors related to the building importance and exposure. A smartphone app prototype of the method has been introduced. For validation of the proposed method, two case studies have been selected, and the result of the analysis presents the robust efficiency of the proposed method.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113456-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4341284-1>
Development of whole cell-based biosensor in 3D environment for nanoparticles cytotoxicity detection ¤ The emergence of human-based models is incontestably required for the study of complex physiological pathways and validation of reliable in vitro methods as alternative for in vivo studies in experimental animals for toxicity assessment. With this objective, three dimensional environments for human cells were developed and tested using three different types of hydrogels including transglutaminase-crosslinked gelatin, collagen type I and growth-factor depleted Matrigel. Cells grown in Matrigel exhibited the greatest cell proliferation and spheroid diameter. Moreover, urea and albumin analysis indicated that the created system allows the immortalized liver cell line (HepG2) to re-establish normal hepatocyte-like properties which are not observed under the conditions of conventional cell cultures. This study presents a reproducible technology for production of complex-shaped liver multicellular spheroids as a system which improves the predictive value of cell-based assays for safety and risk assessment. The time- and dose-dependent toxicity of nanoparticles demonstrates higher cytotoxic effects when HepG2 cells grown as monolayer than embedded in hydrogels. The experimental setup provided evidence that cell environment has significant influence on cell sensitivity and that liver spheroids are useful and novel tools to examine NP dosing effect even at the level of in vitro studies. Moreover, the created cell-based biosensor responds optimally to bioactive analytes, has a fast response time, offers label-free experimentation and simple procedures. Besides, the developed NF-κB_HepG2 cells enable detect cytotoxicity of variety nanoparticles with different chemical composition, size, tendency of agglomeration or cytotoxic potential and other stimuli which activate NF-κB signaling (e.g. heavy metals), in very early stage, before cell death, in short time even after 2 h time exposure as opposed to widely used commercially available cell-based assays like MTT, XTT Alamar Blue or LDH. Successful modification of HepG2 cells resulted in generation of novel NF-κB_HepG2 sensor cells with extracellular reporter protein (human secreted alkaline phosphatase) and its application in cytotoxicity of nanomaterials detection has not been investigated before. The developed NF-κB_hepG2 cells may also provide a useful tool to study distinct molecular mechanisms of inflammation and cellular stress using low exposure concentrations of cell irritants. The presented sensor based on human cells in three dimensional milieu provides a novel application for nanoparticles screening that joins the complex in vitro model imitating living tissue with high throughput analytical methods. This system can be applied to a wide diversity of potentially hostile compounds in basic screening to provide initial warning of adverse effects and trigger subsequent analysis and remedial actions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067547-6>
New enhanced sensitivity infrared laser spectroscopy techniques applied to reactive plasmas and trace gas detection ¤ Infrared laser absorption spectroscopy (IRLAS) employing both tuneable diode and quantum cascade lasers (TDLs, QCLs) has been applied with both high sensitivity and high time resolution to plasma diagnostics and trace gas measurements. TDLAS combined with a conventional White type multiple pass cell was used to detect up to 13 constituent molecular species in low pressure Ar/H2/N2/O2 and Ar/CH4/N2/O2 microwave discharges, among them the main products such as H2O, NH3, NO and CO, HCN respectively. The hydroxyl radical has been measured in the mid infrared (MIR) spectral range in-situ in both plasmas yielding number densities of between 10^11 ... 10^12 cm^-3. Strong indications of surface dominated formation of either NH3 or N2O and NO were found in the H2-N2-O2 system.

Methods and frameworks for GeoSpatioTemporal data analytics ¤ In the era of social networks, internet of things and location-based services, many online services produce a huge amount of data that have valuable objective information, such as geographic coordinates and date time. These characteristics (parameters) in the combination with a textual parameter bring the challenge for the discovery of geospatiotemporal knowledge. This challenge requires efficient methods for clustering and pattern mining in spatial, temporal and textual spaces. In this thesis, we address the challenge of providing methods and frameworks for geospatiotemporal data analytics. As an initial step, we address the challenges of geospatial data processing: data gathering, normalization, geolocation, and storage. That initial step is the basement to tackle the next challenge -- geospatial clustering challenge. The first step of this challenge is to design the method for online clustering of georeferenced data. This algorithm can be used as a server-side clustering algorithm for online maps that visualize massive ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4206012-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123037-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070044-6>
Convex Integration Applied to the Multi-Dimensional Compressible Euler Equations ¤ This book applies the convex integration method to multi-dimensional compressible Euler equations in the barotropic case as well as the full system with temperature. The convex integration technique, originally developed in the context of differential inclusions, was applied in the groundbreaking work of De Lellis and Székelyhidi to the incompressible Euler equations, leading to infinitely many solutions. This theory was later refined to prove non-uniqueness of solutions of the compressible Euler system, too. These non-uniqueness results all use an ansatz which reduces the equations to a kind of incompressible system to which a slight modification of the incompressible theory can be applied. This book presents, for the first time, a generalization of the De Lellis–Székelyhidi approach to the setting of compressible Euler equations. The structure of this book is as follows: after providing an accessible introduction to the subject, including the essentials of hyperbolic conservation laws, the idea of convex integration in the compressible framework is developed. The main result proves that under a certain assumption there exist infinitely many solutions to an abstract initial boundary value problem for the Euler system. Next some applications of this theorem are discussed, in particular concerning the Riemann problem. Finally there is a survey of some related results. This self-contained book is suitable for both beginners in the field of hyperbolic conservation laws as well as for advanced readers who already know about convex integration in the incompressible framework.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4219070-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019339-1>

Composition of IGF2BP1-containing Ribonucleoprotein Complexes ¤ The post-transcriptional control of the gene regulation of mRNA is essentially controlled by specific Ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) in which regulatory factors such as RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and various classes of RNAs, e.g. miRNAs, are involved. In this context, the RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 influences the stabilization of MYC-mRNA by protecting it from endonucleolytic degradation. It also regulates ACTB-mRNA translation and subcellular sorting of this transcript. By regulating different target transcripts, IGF2BP1 as an oncofetal protein promotes mesenchymal cell properties such as polarity, proliferation and migration during embryogenesis and tumor formation. These regulatory processes are assumed to be interactions with other factors, in particular RBPs. However, it has not yet been fully clarified which RBPs IGF2BP1 interacts with within the RNP and to what extent these interactions influence the expression of the target genes. insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein; β-actin; c-myc; RNA-binding protein; Ribonucleoprotein complex; heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197603-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1152035274>
The Indigenous Movement in Ecuador: Discourse and Decoloniality ¤ The Indigenous Peoples Movement, despite its enormous diversity, is an important social player in Ecuadorian Society. Since the transitional period between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s, it has established a discourse which combines identity with class position and is structured around the political terms indigenous sovereignty, nationality, territoriality, plural nationality, interculturality, and »the good life«.Philipp Altmann shows how this discourse stands in opposition to the colonial structuring of society and its effects - such as discrimination and inequality - and is therefore to be understood as decolonial.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026718-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012475-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4566658-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055707-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4519498-1>
Glass fiber lightguides with functional interfaces ¤ Optical fibers have transformed many areas of modern life, from the way we communicate across the globe, to the way we detect and treat diseases. Exploitation into new application fields relies on the technological challenge to provide optical functional elements to glass fibers. This thesis assesses novel ways to provide functional interfaces to glass fibers lightguides. To equip the inside of such fibers with optically active species, first a modified rod-in-tube approach was investigated. Here, cylindrical glass rods were coated from liquid phase and assembled to preforms by encapsulating them into a glass tube. As functionalities, rare earth elements and noble metal nanoparticles were selected and successfully incorporated into fibers. Such fibers showed the characteristic photoluminescence of the rare earths, as well as localized-surface plasmon resonance related effects from the noble metal particles at the functionalized interface. In a second part, the deformation of this noble metal nanoparticles to rotational-ellipsoids during the fiber drawing process was investigated. Such fibers showed an optical anisotrop response to light. The ellipticity of the nanoparticles was discussed with respect to particle size and choice of noble metal, to understand how the optical properties of such fibers can be controlled. In a third part, the effect of silver on the photoluminescence of Eu3+ was investigated. Here, sol-gel derived co-doped coatings were developed that showed strong luminescence enhancement. In these coatings Eu3+ could be excited with non-resonant wavelenghts in a broad spectral range below 400 nm. The lateral surface of a glass fiber was functionalized with this coating, which could be used to transform guided UV light into luminescent-based side-emission with the characteristic Eu3+ emission bands.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4333369-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167589-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4146360-2>
Variational Source Conditions, Quadratic Inverse Problems, Sparsity Promoting Regularization : New Results in Modern Theory of Inverse Problems and an Application in Laser Optics ¤ The book collects and contributes new results on the theory and practice of ill-posed inverse problems. Different notions of ill-posedness in Banach spaces for linear and nonlinear inverse problems are discussed not only in standard settings but also in situations up to now not covered by the literature. Especially, ill-posedness of linear operators with uncomplemented null spaces is examined. Tools for convergence rate analysis of regularization methods are extended to a wider field of applicability. It is shown that the tool known as variational source condition always yields convergence rate results. A theory for nonlinear inverse problems with quadratic structure is developed as well as corresponding regularization methods. The new methods are applied to a difficult inverse problem from laser optics. Sparsity promoting regularization is examined in detail from a Banach space point of view.

Cognitive Spacetime : a Contribution to Human-Centered Adaptivity in E-Learning ¤ The rise of so-called artificial intelligence has made people believe that computers may some day be congenial with human beings. In the past computers were regarded as effective but soulless and unintelligent assistants to free humans from routine tasks. Computers were supposed to perform time-consuming but mechanical calculations. Today's computers are universal machines that can execute an almost unlimited variety of software. The increase of processing speed allows us to implement complex software which does not seem to have much in common with past computing machinery. In the field of education this awakened the desire to build algorithms which didactically support learners or even emulate human-like tutors. However, despite the apparent complexity of today's software, algorithms are step-by-step procedures which in their core are purely mechanical. So before introducing just another approach for technology-enhanced learning let me reconsider a seemingly naive but fundamental question. Given the nature of how computers work on the machine-level, can we emulate human-like tutors with computers? I believe that we can not because human beings are in possession of abilities which can not be implemented with algorithms due to their mechanical kernel and the formal systems on which algorithms are built. However, there exists a concept with which we can implement a mutual human-machine interaction that enables computers to at least adapt themselves to a learner. The result of this is what we call "adaptive systems". In this work, I present a method based on spatio-temporal data structures and algorithms which enable us to build technically simple but artificially intelligent self-adapting systems. Such systems can be utilized for technology enhanced learning but also for other fields related to human-machine interaction.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201713-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033447-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125909-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4727098-6>

Climate governance and urban planning : implementing low-carbon development patterns ¤ Urban planning as a discipline is deeply integral to implementing a low-carbon future. This book fosters an understanding for the rules-in-use that govern urban planning and influence the ability to implement low-carbon development patterns. Drawing on the theoretical foundations of the climate governance and urban planning literatures, the book provides a context to understand plan implementation challenges and obstacles in metropolitan areas. A particular planning challenge in metropolitan regions is examined in depth as an example to understand the polycentric nature of taking climate actions: The challenge to implement transit-connected urban centers. As metropolitan regions across the globe seek to reduce emissions from transportation, many levels of governments have developed ambitious climate action plans that make land use and transportation recommendations in order to reduce vehicle miles traveled. Many have recommended low-carbon development patterns which are characterized by intensified and diversified uses around rapid transit stations. However, the implementation of these recommendations is done within the context of different	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182775-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056754-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7532090-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547705-1>
Bank erosion in alluvial rivers with non-cohesive soil in unsteady flow ¤ So far the theory of bank failure in non-cohesive soils is limited to the avalanche of loose, not compacted, fully saturated discrete grains, applicable mainly to gravel banks. However, the present field investigation indicated that undercutting of the riverbank, slip failure of the submerged zone of the bank, as well as cantilever failure of the overhang are the dominant processes in non-cohesive dense (sandy) soils under unsteady flow conditions. These processes have been modelled in the present work by an innovative method, which has been validated by field measurements. The results showed that the method enhanced the simulation accuracy up to six times in comparison to the earlier methods.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5>
Mobile cartography : adaptive visualisation of geographic information on mobile devices ¤ The progresses in the fields of mobile Internet and positioning methods have lead to a plethora of new possibilities for cartography in mobile usage environments. However, principles of web mapping cannot simply be transferred to the mobile environment. Likewise the availability of Location Based Services (LBS) has made it possible to develop mobile map services, yet LBS themselves are mainly driven by technology and only concerned with location-related issues, thus have rather limited meaning for the usability study. This work has introduced a new and comprehensive conceptual framework of mobile cartography, thus established an instrument for the design of useful and usable geovisualisation services. The research enriches and extends cartographic theory and methods in the field of geographic information communication in mobile environments and adaptive methods for cartographic visualisation. It established new concepts for mobile cartography and showed the differences, but also the similarities towards traditional cartography and web cartography. The main focus is on the elaboration of adaptive methods for visualisation of geographic information for mobile usage, i.e. on mobile devices. Adaptation takes place in the components such as the mobile user, his/her activities with associated goals, as well as the situation they are placed in. The usage scenarios described were helpful for the implementation of a rudimentary, prototypical adaptive geovisualisation service for mobile users. The service for the example of point symbol maps was implemented based on open-standard formats and served as a proof of concept. It basically demonstrates how a mobile client can send as Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) encoded context parameters to a web service. The service handles the user demand by sending a request for the required geospatial data and maybe additional filters to a Web Feature Server. The result, a Geography Markup Language (GML) document is transformed through an Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT) into a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) document. Further adaptations of the SVG document can be effected by manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM). Finally, the web service returns the result as a SVG map back to the client. A few examples generated with this geovisualisation service demonstrate the potential of map adaptation to mobile user activities	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4737525-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188417-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4745787-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4247928-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4694120-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4429674-5>

An adaptive communication model for mobile agents in highly dynamic networks based on forming flexible regions via swarming behaviour ¤ In the last decade, mobile agent technology has been considered as one of the most active research fields in computer science. Mobile agents are software agents which run on behalf of their owner to fulfil jobs that have been ordered (ZK02). They have the ability to migrate from location to location in the network, they can temporarily save their work state at the time of migrating and then restore their tasks when arriving at the new location. Their outstanding characteristics are to be autonomous, reactive, opportunistic, and goal-oriented. Those characteristics are suitable for distributed applications, such as resource allocation (TYI99), network management (MT99), remote supervision (CMCV02), e-commerce (BGP05), health care systems (Mor06), to name but a few.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011150-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4150934-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4775650-0>
Time-series-based reconstruction and analysis of complex networks : methods for quantitative comparison of dynamic processes ¤ The following problems have been addressed in this work: (1) Uni-variate and multi-variate time series analysis of traffic data (measured and simulated) and social media usage data. (2) Study design for interdisciplinary computational science: Common studies on social online media are affected by a strong selection bias. Studies on massive online data can be improved if comparable reference data is available. We consider Wikipedia as a potential source for context networks to identify trends and contextual bias. (3) Detrending of raw media usage data: Development of new normalization methods for media usage analysis allows integrated analysis of different communication channels and comparison of dynamic systems faraway from equilibrium. (4) Integration of multiple facets of complex systems: Generalization and integration of existing network reconstruction methods for a unified framework for analysis of large complex systems research. time series analysis; Event synchronization; Detrended fluctuation analysis; Correlation analysis; Functional networks; Dynamic networks; Wikipedia; Social networks; Complex systems; Phase transitions	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067486-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171529-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155667-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055762-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4150934-1>
Poiesis of the 'Social': Achim von Arnim's Early Poetics to the Heidelberg Romanticism (1800-1808) ¤ Around 1800, the 'social' world achieved a new status as a subject area in its own right. Since then, different poetics of the 'social' have made claims about ways of shaping human interaction through art. This study focuses on the epistemological prerequisites and the processes of formation of one of the first manifestations of the poetics of the 'social' in the early works of Achim von Arnim. --	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046449-0>
Trust and Contract: Risk Allocation in Case of Initial Impossibility ¤ Damages in relation to unfulfillable contracts have long been a key research area in German contract law. Josef Wittmann develops a new theory of liability focusing on the creditor’s trust in the performance of the contract. Liability in case of initial impossibility pursuant to Section 311a(2) BGB has been a focal point of contract law research since the introduction of the norm through the reform of the law of obligations. Josef Wittmann analyzes the basis of liability of the provision and develops a new theory of liability, which raises the creditor's expectation of performance as the point of reference for liability. At the same time, the author contradicts the alleged hegemony of the fault principle in German performance disruption law and establishes trust liability as the second track of secondary liability alongside liability for fault. Based on these insights, the investigation of risk allocation in case of initial impossibility follows the path of theory-guided legal research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126505-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188091-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197889-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138417-9>
Active Metal Mirrors for Applications in Satellite-Based Observation ¤ Satellite-based optical instrumentation suffers from static and low-frequency aberrations due to manufacturing of the optical components itself, thermally induced deformations, transport conditions or changes in gravity. For future space telescopes with primary mirrors larger than two meters, an active correction of these errors is strictly necessary. The present work shows the development of design guidelines for active metal mirrors for a long-term stable correction of static aberrations in satellite-based telescopes. The basis for this is the concept of a deformable mirror whose surface can be manipulated in a targeted manner by forces acting perpendicular to it. First, a model is developed with which the design parameters of the mirror substrate can be optimized with regard to the specific aberrations that should be corrected. The focus of this model are the optimization of the mechanical geometry and the position and distribution of the forces coupling into the mirror substrate. Through changes of the geometry, the actuator influence on the mirror surface and hence the compensation ability could be optimized. It is shown that the process of single-point diamond turning, which is used for the fabrication of passive metal optics, could be extended to fabricate high-quality active metal mirrors for space. Within this work, the final processing of the optical surface of a fully assembled deformable mirror is demonstrated. Using a prototype mirror, both the long-term stability as well as the compensation for application typical aberrations were experimentally proven. The present work shows that in consideration of the developed design guidelines, active metal mirrors – whose implementation improves the performance of future satellite-based telescopes - can be manufactured.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7540587-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140357-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4285929-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4260287-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043650-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056203-7>
On the Relationship between Pedagogy and Politics in Schleiermacher ¤ It was clear to Schleiermacher that, long before each modern democratic state, whose self-understanding is based on their citizens being able to participate in them politically, is able to develop, the provision of democratic institutions alone is not enough. Historically, the development of inner stability in modern democratic states can only occur if a public education system, which caters equally to the needs of all the people living in them, is established nationwide. As a new addition to the system of education, which was originally conceived as a purely private concept, the particular contribution of public education has been to initiate a process of political education stemming from schools.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046526-3>
Dynamic Positioning as an Aspect in the Early Ship Design Phase ¤ Due to the expansion of offshore wind power generation new types of ships are needed. In this context, the capability of the dynamic positioning gains in importance as a new elementary design aspect. In the present work, two methods are presented to benchmark the ability to keep the vessel's position in the early design stage of ships. In order to improve the calculations interaction effects are taken into account, which have been studied by using model tests. For the expansion of offshore wind energy generation new ship types are needed. In this context, the capability of dynamic positioning as a new elementary design aspect has gained in importance.

One-dimensional stochastic differential equations without drift with time-dependent coefficients ¤ The paper investigates weak solutions of one-dimensional stochastic differential equations without drift but time-dependent coefficients. As in the preceding literature, this is done by means of an equivalent equation for time-changed Wiener processes. One-to-one relations between the equations regarding existence and uniqueness are presented. A new existence theorem is proved by monotone approximation of pure solutions. Furthermore, extreme solutions are investigated, turning out as pure in general and interesting for the problem of uniqueness in law.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131068-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057621-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151257-1>
Modelling continental rift dynamics ¤ Continental rift systems open up unique possibilities to study the geodynamic system of our planet: geodynamic localization processes are imprinted in the morphology of the rift by governing the time-dependent activity of faults, the topographic evolution of the rift or by controlling whether a rift is symmetric or asymmetric. Since lithospheric necking localizes strain towards the rift centre, deformation structures of previous rift phases are often well preserved and passive margins, the end product of continental rifting, retain key information about the tectonic history from rift inception to continental rupture. Current understanding of continental rift evolution is based on combining observations from active rifts with data collected at rifted margins. Connecting these isolated data sets is often accomplished in a conceptual way and leaves room for subjective interpretation. Geodynamic forward models, however, have the potential to link individual data sets in a quantitative manner, using additional constraints from rock mechanics and rheology, which allows to transcend previous conceptual models of rift evolution. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4619283-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178145-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020212-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4313194-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170297-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046317-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4451364-1>
Green industry through industry 4.0? : expected and observed effects of digitalisation in industry for environmental sustainability ¤ Digitalisation in industry – also called “Industry 4.0” – is seen by numerous actors as an opportunity to reduce the environmental impact of the industrial sector. The scientific assessments of the effects of digitalisation in industry on environmental sustainability, however, are ambivalent. This cumulative dissertation uses three empirical studies to examine the expected and observed effects of digitalisation in industry on environmental sustainability. The aim of this dissertation is to identify opportunities and risks of digitalisation at different system levels and to derive options for action in politics and industry for a more sustainable design of digitalisation in industry. I use an interdisciplinary, socio-technical approach and look at selected countries of the Global South (Study 1) and the example of China (all studies). In the first study (section 2, joint work with Marcel Matthess), I use qualitative content analysis to examine digital and industrial policies from seven different countries in Africa and Asia for expectations regarding the impact of digitalisation on sustainability and compare these with the potentials of digitalisation for sustainability in the respective country contexts.

On implementation aspects of decode and forward and compress and forward relay protocols ¤ In this work, the common relay protocols Decode-and-Forward and Compress-and-Forward (CF) are investigated from a practical point of view: This involves on the one hand the impact of imperfections like channel and carrier phase stimation errors and on the other hand, the question of how to implement relay protocol specific signal processing like quantization for CF which is modeled in information theory simply by additive quantizer noise. To evaluate the performance, achievable rates are determined either numerically with the help of the Max-Flow Min-Cut theorem or by link level simulations.

Enabling Big Data security analytics for advanced network attack detection ¤ The last years have shown an increasing sophistication of attacks against enterprises. Traditional security solutions like firewalls, anti-virus systems and generally Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are no longer sufficient to protect an enterprise against these advanced attacks. One popular approach to tackle this issue is to collect and analyze events generated across the IT landscape of an enterprise. This task is achieved by the utilization of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. However, the majority of the currently existing SIEM solutions is not capable of handling the massive volume of data and the diversity of event representations. Even if these solutions can collect the data at a central place, they are neither able to extract all relevant information from the events nor correlate events across various sources. Hence, only rather simple attacks are detected, whereas complex attacks, consisting of multiple stages, remain undetected. Undoubtedly, security operators of large enterprises are faced with a ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4706627-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4802620-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011144-1>
Isomerization of allylic alcohols to the ketones catalyzed by first-row transition metal pincer complexes ¤ This thesis mainly describes the isomerization of allylic and homo-allylic alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds in the presence of inexpensive transition metal complexes.

The Deployment of the Bundeswehr Abroad 1990–2015: A Discourse-Linguistic Investigation Based on Argumentations ¤ This volume examines discussions surrounding the legitimacy of the Bundeswehr’s deployments abroad by looking at 2,773 newspaper texts. The study analyzes the use and mentions of prototypical arguments and characterizes their discursive actors. It sketches the trajectory taken by discourse between 1990 and 2015, describing both socially accepted and contentious knowledge in a subject area that has mostly been overlooked by linguistics so far. Based on a corpus (2,773 texts from taz, FR, SZ, FAZ, Welt), this discourse-linguistic study examines the discussion surrounding the legitimacy of the Bundeswehr’s deployments abroad. It identifies relevant arguments, quantifies their use and mention, characterizes discursive actors based on their arguments, and sketches the trajectory of the discourse. This historically explanatory and understanding, inductive and heuristic argumentation-analytical language use analysis sees in the tradition of the Düsseldorf School, a crucial access point to the description of cognitive, affective, and volitive dispositions of a societal collectivity. By identifying prototypical arguments, it simultaneously takes into account the argumentative inventory, the essential actors, and continuities and breaks in the use and mention of arguments and the appearance of these actors. On the theoretical basis of constructivist language use research, descriptive statements are made about socially accepted and contentious knowledge in the period from 1990 to 2015 in a discourse-linguistically largely unexplored field of research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194747-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114599-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068999-2>

Quality Discourse Production School: An Example of the Quality Seal of Production School of the German Association of Production Schools e.

Moreover, pedagogical settings and quality assurance concepts at production schools are often insufficient. Using the example of the quality seal of Bundesverband Produktionsschulen e.V. (German association of production schools), the dissertation examines the means production schools as institutions have at hand to prove the quality of their support of disadvantaged persons and, at the same time, position themselves within the German educational landscape. The examined approaches to educational quality are essential for establishing production schools as an alternative to other forms of vocational training, particularly with respect to young refugees as an education group.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4219057-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4441296-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4009736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4296661-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4310416-2>

Analysis of supramolecular assemblies of NE81, the first lamin protein in a non-metazoan organism ¤ Nuclear lamins are nucleus-specific intermediate filaments forming a network located at the inner nuclear membrane of the nuclear envelope. They form the nuclear lamina together with proteins of the inner nuclear membrane regulating nuclear shape and gene expression, among others. The amoebozoan Dictyostelium NE81 protein is a suitable candidate for an evolutionary conserved lamin protein in this non-metazoan organism. It shares the domain organization of metazoan lamins and is fulfilling major lamin functions in Dictyostelium. Moreover, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (feSEM) images of NE81 expressed on Xenopus oocytes nuclei revealed filamentous structures with an overall appearance highly reminiscent to that of metazoan Xenopus lamin B2. For the classification as a lamin-like or a bona fide lamin protein, a better understanding of the supramolecular NE81 structure was necessary. Yet, NE81 carrying a large N-terminal GFP-tag turned out as unsuitable source for protein isolation and characterization; GFP-NE81 expressed in Dictyostelium NE81 knock-out cells exhibited an abnormal distribution, which is an indicator for an inaccurate assembly of GFP-tagged NE81.

A history of fear : British apocalyptic fiction, 1895 - 2011 ¤ Summary: The idea of the end of the world has a long tradition in the history of civilization. Secularized speculations about the end of the world have been a part of public discourse in Britain ever since the 19th century. This study investigates fiction about the potential end of humankind, written and produced by British writers and filmmakers from the 1890s to the beginning of the 21st century. Martin Hermann argues that British apocalyptic fiction is deeply embedded in the cultural context of its respective era. Applying ideas from Michel Foucault’s The Archaeology of Knowledge and analyzing works by H. G. Wells, John Wyndham, John Brunner, Stephen Baxter and other, less remembered authors of speculative fiction, Hermann traces a history of fear in British culture, identifying the discursive formations that have shaped the apocalyptic discourse in Britain over the last 120 years. He contends that these formations run alongside the great historical divides of the 20th and 21st century.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014777-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112551-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035964-5>
Genetic basis and adaptive significance of repeated scent loss in selfing Capsella species ¤ Floral scent is an important way for plants to communicate with insects, but scent emission has been lost or strongly reduced during the transition from pollinator-mediated outbreeding to selfing. The shift from outcrossing to selfing is not only accompanied by scent loss, but also by a reduction in other pollinator-attracting traits like petal size and can be observed multiple times among angiosperms. These changes are summarized by the term selfing syndrome and represent one of the most prominent examples of convergent evolution within the plant kingdom. In this work the genus Capsella was used as a model to study convergent evolution in two closely related selfers with separate transitions to self-fertilization. Compared to their outbreeding ancestor C. grandiflora, the emission of benzaldehyde as main compound of floral scent is lacking or strongly reduced in the selfing species C. rubella and C. orientalis. In C. rubella the loss of benzaldehyde was caused by mutations to cinnamate:CoA ligase CNL1, but the biochemical basis and...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4699715-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4205897-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308832-6>
On the Need for Reform of Traffic Accident Flight (§ 142 StGB) ¤ The investigation deals with the accident flight Paragraph § 142 of the German StGB (criminal code). It examines the questions of "if" and the "how" of reform, this means the practical embodiment in detail. This includes putting the existing accident flight paragraph to the test in general terms. In the sense of a foundation, the historical roots of traffic accident flight need to be worked out. Then, it is necessary to engage with the protective purpose of the offense in order to finally clarify the question of the constitutionality of the provision in relation to the principle of "nemo tenetur se ipsum accusare", where at this point an ordering of the duties prescribed in § 142 StGB is to be made. Furthermore, it is of particular interest to present the reform proposals that have been controversially discussed for years, the criminological aspects, and a comparative law look at European countries. Against this background, it is necessary to consider the "Tätige Reue" (express remorse) introduced by the legislator with the 6th Criminal Law Reform Act in § 142 StGB, paragraph 4, in terms of the application requirements and legal consequences, in order to then examine the practicability and efficiency of the "Tätige Reue" through a study and evaluation of its own. All aspects will then lead to own proposals regarding the framework conditions and possibilities of reforming the provision of § 142 StGB.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115716-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138692-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059107-4>

The H I Lyman [alpha] opacity at redshift 2.7 ≤ z ≤ 3.6 ¤ Most of the baryonic matter in the Universe resides in a diffuse gaseous phase in-between galaxies consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium. This intergalactic medium (IGM) is distributed in large-scale filaments as part of the overall cosmic web. The luminous extragalactic objects that we can observe today, such as galaxies and quasars, are surrounded by the IGM in the most dense regions within the cosmic web. The radiation of these objects contributes to the so-called ultraviolet background (UVB) which keeps the IGM highly ionized ever since the epoch of reionization. Measuring the amount of absorption due to intergalactic neutral hydrogen (HI) against extragalactic background sources is a very useful tool to constrain the energy input of ionizing sources into the IGM. Observations suggest that the HI Lyman-alpha effective optical depth, τ_eff, decreases with decreasing redshift, which is primarily due to the expansion of the Universe. However, some studies find a smaller value of the effective optical depth than expected at the sp...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064784-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4382334-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4629834-4>
Approaching N = 1 Super-Yang-Mills theory with improved lattice actions ¤ Investigations of the non-perturbative effects of N=1 Super-Yang-Mills theory on the lattice are demanding. The lattice breaks translation invariance to a discrete subgroup and consequently also supersymmetry. With a fine-tuning of the Wilson fermions to a critical point, it can be achieved that supersymmetry (as well as chiral symmetry) are restored in the continuum limit. This thesis is intended to contribute to weaken the associated restrictions. Unbroken supersymmetry in the continuum arranges the bound states in supermultiplets. When susy is broken, for example by the lattice discretization, then the mass-degeneracy ends. Based on this observation, we tried to modify the fermionic lattice action to minimize the mass difference of states within a supermultiplet and thus the supersymmetry breaking. The first extension of the Wilson Dirac operator was a clover term. It is known from the Symanzik improvement program that a proper choice of the coefficient reduces the lattice discretization artifacts to the order O(a²) in the lattice spacing. There are several possibilities to determine this coefficient and we compared them with a heuristic parameter scan. As an alternative, we added a twisted mass term to the Wilson Dirac operator. When the difference of the untwisted mass parameter to its critical value corresponds to the value of the parity-breaking mass, then the two mesonic partners a-η and a-f approach at finite lattice spacing the same mass. After we observed this improvement of the supermultiplet in the numerical data, we also found an analytical proof. Additionally we investigated the eigenvalues of the free Dirac operator with twists in the mass term and the Wilson term. There we found an O(a) improvement when those two terms are orthogonal to each other. With the 45°-mass-twisted Wilson Dirac operator, we performed simulations on a 16^3x32 lattice and analyzed all states of the Veneziano-Yankielowicz and Farrar-Gabadadze-Schwetz supermultiplets.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190409-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157374-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169025-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128574-8>

Strategies to cope with risks of uncertain water supply in spate irrigation systems ¤ Flood-based irrigation, particularly spate irrigation, relies on variable flood scenarios occurring every year. Management of spate flood for spate irrigation must cope with the variability and uncertainty of water supply. Coping with water supply risks is often the only way to harness the opportunities for a productive use of water in arid environment. Integrating and strengthening community responses into irrigation policies and improvement plans could ensure sustainable and productive spate irrigated systems that can achieve food security for the poor population. This research analyses and evaluates risks and coping strategies developed by farming communities in the Gash spate irrigation system in Sudan, Eastern Africa. The research has synthesized different coping strategies developed by farmers, water user associations and water managers to cope with low, high and untimely flood risks. The research provides different frameworks that can assist with the identification of risk sources, pathways and propagation as well as evaluation of locally developed strategies at field, secondary and intake systems. The findings of this study contribute to the scarce knowledge on spate irrigation systems and provide scientifically sound and evidence-based insights to aid informed policy and decision making to improve productivity and sustainability of the spate irrigation systems	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145122-3>
Long-term irradiation effects on reactor-pressure vessel steels : investigations on the nanometer scale ¤ BEGIN Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS); Atom-Probe Tomography (APT); Long-Term Irradiation Effects; Low-Cu Reactor-Pressure Vessel Steel (RPV); Neutrons; Flux Effects; Late-Blooming Effect; Mn-Ni-Enriched Clusters The exposure of reactor pressure vessel (RPV) steels to neutron irradiation gives rise to a degradation of the mechanical properties caused by nanostructural changes. Two long-term irradiation effects are investigated in this thesis: Flux effects (FE) and the late-blooming effect. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and atom-probe tomography (APT) have been applied as characterization method. The investigations on FE show that clusters forming upon high-flux irradiation are smaller and tend to have a higher number density compared to low-flux irradiations at a given neutron fluence. The findings can be explained by a model combining irradiation-enhanced diffusion with deterministic growth. The SANS investigations on the LBE show that the existence of such an effect depends on the irradiation conditions. The APT results indicate that Cu-free clusters are responsible for the observation of LBE. A two-path mechanistic model of cluster formation rationalizes these findings.

The Media Publicity of Judicial Proceedings and its Limits ¤ BEGIN: The study analyses how the opposing legal interests can be balanced in the reporting on judicial proceedings and case law as well as in the opinions expressed by judges in the media, and to what extent a communicative approach to judicial public relations can complement the balance achieved within the framework of the regulatory approach. In doing so, constitutional theory and, for a better understanding of the potential effects on the media, above all communication science findings will be used. The relevant case law of the European Court of Human Rights is taken into account as well as current legal developments in England and France.

Dealing with religious difference in kindergarten : an ethnographic study in religiously affiliated institutions ¤ In kindergartens children of different religions and with different religious attitudes meet, play and learn together. How do kindergartens deal with religious differences and how do children address this topic? The ethnographic study reported in this book explores this question in two kindergartens, one run by a Catholic, the other by an Islamic organization. The results illustrate how important it is to handle religious difference attentively. In order to reduce structural discrimination, the author considers how a culture of recognition can be developed, with religious difference being given the attention it requires. This book provides a valuable contribution to a difference-sensitive interaction in educational institutions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4664707-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4378168-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030581-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4609243-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4296178-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4367581-5>
The Principle of the Republic: The Emergence of the Political in the Mode of the Practice of Law ¤ BEGIN: The current general decline of the political order highlights the fact that political integration is needed, and Western democracies are no exception in this respect any more. In contrast to liberal approaches, which assume political sense is a limited resource, republics include a principle that produces such sense. The title of this work refers to a starting point for political good sense, as discovered by Alex de Tocqueville within a trial by jury process. The most important result of presenting the problem using Hobbes, Schmitt, Arendt and Rawls in the first chapter and the reconstruction of the conditions under which ancient democracy emerged, followed by an examination of Plato, Aristotle and Cicero in the third chapter, was the insight that Tocqueville’s discovery fulfils the decisive conditions for the birth of collective political action in the public sphere: the opportunity to experience political sense as one’s own discovery and an inspirational moment without further derivation. Gegenüber liberalen Ansätzen, die politischen Gemeinsinn als prekäre Ressource verstehen, enthält die Republik ein Prinzip, das diesen hervorbringt. Das Prinzip im Titel der Arbeit steht für einen Anfang. Einen solchen hat Alex de Tocqueville für das politische Handeln im Rahmen einer modernen Rechtsfindungspraxis ausfindig gemacht. Die Problemdarstellung mit Hilfe von Hobbes, Schmitt, Arendt und Rawls im ersten, sowie die Rekonstruktion der Entstehungsbedingungen der antiken Demokratie mit der anschließenden Befragung der klassischen Theoretiker Platon, Aristoteles und Cicero im dritten Kapitel bestätigen: die Quelle des Franzosen erfüllt die entscheidende Autoritätsbedingung für die Entstehung gemeinschaftlichen Handelns im öffentlichen Raum – d.h. die Möglichkeit, Gemeinsinn als eine eigene Entdeckung, als einen inspirativen, nicht weiter ableitbaren Moment selbst zu erfahren.

Cycle-related solar vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) variability ¤ Various studies have shown that the Sun was in an extremely inactive state during the prolonged minimum of the cycle 23 compared to other recent minima. Following these studies, in this thesis work, it was tried to have a closer look at the variability of the quiet Sun network and internetwork radiance between the last two solar minima. The aim of this dissertation is to find out whether there is a change in the radiance properties of the upper chromosphere and transition region (at some specific wavelengths of the VUV spectrum), over the last solar cycle.

On the exact simulation of (skew) Brownian diffusions with discontinuous drift ¤ This thesis is focused on the study and the exact simulation of two classes of real-valued Brownian diffusions: multi-skew Brownian motions with constant drift and Brownian diffusions whose drift admits a finite number of jumps. The skew Brownian motion was introduced in the sixties by Itô and McKean, who constructed it from the reflected Brownian motion, flipping its excursions from the origin with a given probability. Such a process behaves as the original one except at the point 0, which plays the role of a semipermeable barrier. More generally, a skew diffusion with several semipermeable barriers, called multi-skew diffusion, is a diffusion everywhere except when it reaches one of the barriers, where it is partially reflected with a probability depending on that particular barrier. Clearly, a multi-skew diffusion can be characterized either as solution of a stochastic differential equation involving weighted local times (these terms providing the semi-permeability) or by its infinitesimal generator as Markov process.

Criminal Procedure Investigative Measures and Testimony Refusal Rights : On the Accessoriness of Sections 81c(3), 95(2)(2), 97, 100d(5), 100g(4), 160a StPO to Testimony Refusal Rights ¤ There are many provisions in the Code of Criminal Procedure that restrict investigative measures by referring to the rights to refuse to testify. Anne Schneider examines to what extent these rules comply with the objective for granting the rights to refuse to testify by making use of the approach of legislative theory. She identifies the different interests at stake and thus potential objectives before investigating the boundaries set by law of a higher order for the drafting of legislation. Because her subsequent analysis of the lex lata shows that none of the potential objectives are able to fully explain it, she accordingly proposes new rules for all investigative measures that waive the accessoriness to the rights to refuse to testify.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7793148-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070924-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125497-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116635-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4247482-6>
Improving RDF data with data mining ¤ Linked Open Data (LOD) comprises very many and often large public data sets and knowledge bases. Those datasets are mostly presented in the RDF triple structure of subject, predicate, and object, where each triple represents a statement or fact. Unfortunately, the heterogeneity of available open data requires significant integration steps before it can be used in applications. Meta information, such as ontological definitions and exact range definitions of predicates, are desirable and ideally provided by an ontology. However in the context of LOD, ontologies are often incomplete or simply not available. Thus, it is useful to automatically generate meta information, such as ontological dependencies, range definitions, and topical classifications. Association rule mining, which was originally applied for sales analysis on transactional databases, is a promising and novel technique to explore such data. We designed an adaptation of this technique for min-ing Rdf data and introduce the concept of “mining configurations”, which allows us …	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040936-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058765-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4737512-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7863462-3>
Ground States of the Two-Dimensional Electron System at Half-Filling under Hydrostatic Pressure ¤ Chapter 1 Introduction -- Chapter 2 The Quantum Hall Nematic Phase -- Chapter 3 Low Temperature Measurement Techniques -- Chapter 4 The Quantum Hall Effect and Hydrostatic Pressure -- Chapter 5 The Fractional Quantum Hall State-to-Nematic Phase Transition Under Hydrostatic Pressure -- Chapter 6 Universality of the Fractional Quantum Hall State-to-Nematic Phase Transition at Half-Filling in the Second Landau Level -- Chapter 7 Origin of the Fractional Quantum Hall State-to-Nematic Phase Transition in the Second Landau Level -- References This thesis presents the discovery of a surprising phase transition between a topological and a broken symmetry phase. Phase transitions between broken symmetry phases involve a change in symmetry and those between topological phases require a change in topological order; in rare cases, however, transitions may occur between these two broad classes of phases in which the vanishing of the topological order is accompanied by the emergence of a broken symmetry. This thesis describes observations of such a special phase transition in the two-dimensional electron gas confined in the GaAs/AlGaAs structures. When tuned by hydrostatic pressure, the ν = 5/2 and ν = 7/2 fractional quantum Hall states, believed to be prototypical non-Abelian topological phases of the Pfaffian universality class, give way to an electronic nematic phase. Remarkably, the fractional quantum Hall states involved are due to pairing of emergent particles called composite fermions. The findings reported here, therefore, provide an interesting example of competition of pairing and nematicity. This thesis provides an introduction to quantum Hall physics of the two-dimensional electron gas, contains details of the high pressure experiments, and offers a discussion of the ramifications and of the origins of the newly reported phase transition	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123378-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151870-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113982-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4204014-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134801-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/113303408X> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019155-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171428-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4321721-7>
Flash memories : economic principles of performance, cost and reliability optimization ¤ The subject of this book is to introduce a model-based quantitative performance indicator methodology applicable for performance, cost and reliability optimization of non-volatile memories. The complex example of flash memories is used to introduce and apply the methodology. It has been developed by the author based on an industrial 2-bit to 4-bit per cell flash development project. For the first time, design and cost aspects of 3D integration of flash memory are treated in this book. Cell, array, performance and reliability effects of flash memories are introduced and analyzed. Key performance parameters are derived to handle the flash complexity. A performance and array memory model is developed and a set of performance indicators characterizing architecture, cost and durability is defined. Flash memories are selected to apply the Performance Indicator Methodology to quantify design and technology innovation. A graphical representation based on trend lines is introduced to support a requirement based product development process. The Performance Indicator methodology is applied to demonstrate the importance of hidden memory parameters for a successful product and system development roadmap. Flash Memories offers an opportunity to enhance your understanding of product development key topics such as: Reliability optimization of flash memories is all about threshold voltage margin understanding and definition; Product performance parameter are analyzed in-depth in all aspects in relation to the threshold voltage operation window; Technical characteristics are translated into quantitative performance indicators; Performance indicators are applied to identify and quantify product and technology innovation within adjacent areas to fulfill the application requirements with an overall cost optimized solution; Cost, density, performance and durability values are combined into a common factor performance indicator - which fulfills the application requirements ENDE	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167271-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4518714-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059245-5>
Studies on the Prediction of Lubricating Grease Properties by Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship ¤ This dissertation consists of QSPR studies (quantitative structure property relationship) for the prediction of lubricating grease properties. The aim was to find correlations between the structural properties of the lubricating greases and their various physical properties and to develop a model for predictions based on them. The resulting COSMO-LUB (Conductor-like screening model-lubricants) model can be used for qualitative and quantitative statements on the behavior of the lubricating grease systems and it allows experimental data to be inter- and extrapolated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135391-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151179-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4205429-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179812-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165343-9>
Non-performing loans : determinants, default, divestiture ¤ Based on the recent European regulatory policies on non-performing loans (NPL), the dissertation ‘Non-Performing Loans: Determinants—Default—Divestiture’ presents four stand-alone research papers on the determinants, default and divestiture of NPL, which explore the effectiveness of the proposed restructuring mechanisms. To begin with, determinants of the situation described by the term NPL are diligently examined, with the author employing a systematic literature review at the levels of macroeconomics, banks and loans. Subsequently, three empirical research studies are devoted to an analysis of security pricing in reaction to NPL divestiture activity in the European equity and debt capital market. The results offer the banking industry as well as the EU and its member states a nuanced idea of how to deal with large amounts of risky assets in times of constantly changing economic circumstances. Diese Arbeit nimmt die aktuellen Leitlinien der Europäischen Aufsichtsbehörden zum Umgang mit notleidenden Krediten (NPL) zum Anlass, die Wirksamkeit der bereits genutzten und darin vorgeschlagenen Mechanismen anhand von vier wissenschaftlichen Studien zu beleuchten. Im Rahmen eines systematischen Literaturüberblicks werden zunächst die Determinanten der mit dem Terminus NPL beschriebenen Situation auf makroökonomischer, Bank- und Kreditebene untersucht. Im Anschluss betrachten drei empirische Analysen die Marktreaktionen auf Abwicklungsankündigungen notleidender Assets im Europäischen Aktien- und Fremdkapitalmarkt. Die Ergebnisse präsentieren der Bankenindustrie sowie dem Leitliniengeber und seinen Mitgliedstaaten einen nuancierten Impuls, wie in Zeiten sich stetig ändernder ökonomischer Rahmenbedingungen mit einem hohen Bestand an notleidenden Vermögenswerten umgegangen werden kann.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140532-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032923-9>

Hoen -- Analysis of value added : size, growth, multipliers, and spillovers / Alex R. Hoen. - Trade theories predict and explain the consequences of economic integration. Generally, they show that freer international trade leads to specialisation, technological convergence and faster economic growth. This study compares the conclusions of the trade theories with empirical observations of economic changes in the European Union. These empirical analyses show that the main conclusions also hold empirically. However, many detailed empirical observations often contrast the theoretical expectation. Hence, although the trade theories do predict the general changes correctly, they are not capable of predicting the more specific empirical outcomes. The empirical analyses use intercountry input-output tables in constant prices with 6 EU countries (Germany, France, Italy, The Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark) of the years 1970, 1975, 1980 and 1985.These data prove to be a valuable contribution to analysing the economic effects of international integration, since they provide a consistent database that can be used to analyse many economic aspects, such as technology, specialisation, intra-industry trade, economic growth, sectoral distribution, and direct and indirect effects.

Analysis and Evaluation of Possible Tracking Systems for the Labeling of Electricity ¤ Mitte 2004 trat die EU-Richtlinie zum Elektrizitätsbinnenmarkt in Kraft. Diese Richtlinie beinhaltet auch Bestimmungen zur Stromkennzeichnung, d. h. zur Übermittlung von Informationen zur Produktionsqualität von Strom, wie beispielsweise Energieträger und Emissionen, an die Verbraucher. Entscheidend für eine solche Kennzeichnung ist ein zuverlässiges Nachweisverfahren, mit dessen Hilfe die entsprechenden Informationen von der Erzeugung zum Verbraucher transportiert werden können. Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wird nach einer grundlegenden Einführung in das Thema 'Stromkennzeichnung' zunächst detailliert analysiert, welche prinzipiellen Optionen für ein solches Tracking-System bestehen und wo diese mit welchem Erfolg bereits angewendet werden. Zentrales Ergebnis der Arbeit ist ein Modell eines Nachweisverfahrens für Deutschland, das nicht nur den gesetzlichen Vorgaben entspricht, sondern auch die Bedürfnisse des Marktes berücksichtigt.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4227582-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152233-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066409-0>
Integration through Law ¤ BEGIN: How does law contribute to the cohesion of political communities? A legal idea that embodies freedom, dignity and democracy makes »integration through law« appear as a self-preservation technique of the political order. Yet legal-theoretical analysis shows that law can only stabilize politics, not replace it. Ob as Rule of Law, constitutionalism or as the core of a European legal community: the idea of law as a binding, »cultural force« (Walter Hallstein) runs through the history of Western constitutionalism. In this context, law is supposed to embody political ideals of individual freedom, dignity, and democracy; »integration through law« appears as a self-preservation technique of the political order. But what actual contribution does law make to the existence and preservation of a community? And does it even have the power to create one in Europe? Eva Ricarda Lautsch takes these questions as a starting point and examines the potential and limits of political legitimacy through legality. Different legal-theoretical perspectives not only provide insight into the great expectations of the integrative function of law, but also show its limits.

On aspects of chemical processes in surface modification plasma processes ¤ The current work is focused on the study of two surface modification plasma processes, (i) the active screen plasma nitriding (ASPN) and nitrocarburizing (ASPNC) for the hardening of ferrous surfaces and (ii) the microwave plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition (MW-PACVD) for the synthesis of single crystal and doped diamond. Conventional and active screen plasma nitriding processes have been investigated in a cylindrical, industrial scale ASPN reactor with a volume of about 1 m3, using low-pressure pulsed dc H2-N2 plasmas with admixtures of CH4 or CO2. The experiments were carried out (i) with the plasma at an internal model probe, (ii) with the plasma at the active screen (floated model probe) and (iii) with the plasma at the active screen and an additional plasma at the biased model probe. For deeper insights in ASPN and ASPNC processes, a laboratory scale plasma nitriding monitoring reactor, PLANIMOR, has been constructed. The main feature of this reactor is the linear configuration of the electrode setup combined with a tubular glass vessel, overcoming the experimental disadvantages of cylindrical laboratory scale ASPN reactors. With the help of infrared laser absorption spectroscopy (IRLAS) the rotational temperature of the stable molecules in the gas phase and the concentrations of the precursor, CH4, and the reaction products (NH3, HCN, C2H2, C2H4, CO, CH3) could be determined in both reactors, depending on the plasma power, the gas mixture, the plasma at the model ...

The major secondary metabolites accumulating in response to pathogen infection in potato are hydroxycinnamic acid amides (HCAAs). In addition to their function as antimicrobial compounds, HCAAs are required for the reinforcement of the plant cell wall. The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana is also producing HCAAs after pathogen challenge, but the potato enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of HCAAs are different from those of A. thaliana. A gene was identified, which encodes an agmatine N4-coumaroyl transferase and in addition a highly coexpressed MATE (multidrug and toxic compound extrusion) transporter which is required for export of the HCAA p-coumaroylagmatine in A. thaliana. LC-MS studies revealed that there is less p-coumaroylagmatine at the surface of potato leaves in contrast to A. thaliana leaves. The aim was to produce potato plants with altered HCAA profiles to study the influence of these compounds on the interaction of potato and P. infestans.

In addition to their function as antimicrobial compounds, HCAAs are required for the reinforcement of the plant cell wall. The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana is also producing HCAAs after pathogen challenge, but the potato enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of HCAAs are different from those of A. thaliana. A gene was identified, which encodes an agmatine N4-coumaroyl transferase and in addition a highly coexpressed MATE (multidrug and toxic compound extrusion) transporter which is required for export of the HCAA p-coumaroylagmatine in A. thaliana. LC-MS studies revealed that there is less p-coumaroylagmatine at the surface of potato leaves in contrast to A. thaliana leaves. The aim was to produce potato plants with altered HCAA profiles to study the influence of these compounds on the interaction of potato and P. infestans.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4277191-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4429645-9>

The e-invariant and transfer map ¤ BEGIN Abstract: In this thesis, we study a refined Borel regulator from algebraic K-theory of complex numbers to topological K-theory with coefficients in C/Z, which is constructed by Karoubi, Jones and Westbury. <br><br>We investigate the homotopy properties of this regulator and its relation with the xi-invariant of flat vector bundles. We prove that their construction is equivalent to the one given by Atiyah, Patodi and Singer, and explain how this regulator generalizes the Adams e-invariant. The possible homotopy-theoretic constructions of this regulator are also discussed. In particular, we show that there is a unique infinite loop space map from algebraic K-theory of complex numbers to topological K-theory with coefficients in C/Z whose induced homomorphism between homotopy groups is the same as this regulator. The result implies an index theorem analogous to the Bismut-Lott index theorem END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141839-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4334283-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120861-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161489-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012255-4>
Cooperative compliance : a new approach to managing taxpayer relations ¤ This book analyses the concept of cooperative compliance, a relatively new style of cooperation between corporate taxpayers and tax authorities. The growing burden of tax compliance and the inadequate resources provided by tax authorities forced the introduction of a different form of cooperation based on mutual trust, transparency and understanding, while relying on tax risk management. This alternative approach first appeared independently in Australia, Ireland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States in the early 2000s. Since then, the concept has been implemented in one form or another in over 20 jurisdictions worldwide. The OECD took the lead on systematizing the concept and in 2008 published a study in which the concept - initially referred to as "enhanced relationship" - was introduced. A few years on, cooperative compliance is envisioned as a powerful tool to increase the effectiveness of the tax collection process and influence taxpayer behaviour, especially in the post-BEPS environment	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116614-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4442497-8>
Cross-border mergers with third-country involvement: legal requirements for the merger of German capital companies with companies from third countries ¤ Cross-border mergers after the German Transformation Act have been controversial since the entry into force of this Act. To date, only mergers of German corporations with those from other EU/EEA countries are regulated. The author deals with the question of whether and how such mergers are possible with non-EU/EEA companies. In doing so, substantive law as well as collision law aspects of national and cross-border mergers are examined. The conclusion is that cross-border mergers with non-EU/EEA companies are legally permissible insofar as they comply with the ground rules and increased protection principles of the Transformation Act. The latter especially derive from §§ 122a and the following of the Transformation Act. To fulfil the requirements of such mergers, these regulations need to be applied by analogy selectively. The consequence is a consensual overall process. This book is especially directed to legal practice and offers a solution to the question stated above. Cross-border conversions have been controversial since the entry into force of the UmwG. To date, only mergers of German capital companies with those from other EU/EEA countries are regulated. The author deals with the question of whether and how such mergers are possible with companies from third countries. In doing so, substantive law as well as collision law aspects of national and cross-border mergers are examined. He concludes that cross-border mergers with companies from third countries are legally permissible, provided they comply with the principles and increased protection principles of the UmwG. The latter especially derive from §§ 122a ff. UmwG. In order to meet the requirements of such cases, at least the selective analogous application of these provisions and compliance with a consensual overall process are required. The work is especially directed to legal practice and offers a substantive legal solution to the question posed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129472-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4227349-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4204817-5>

Charge carrier recombination and open circuit voltage in organic solar cells : from bilayer-model systems to hybrid multi-junctions ¤ Tremendous progress in the development of thin film solar cell techniques has been made over the last decade. The field of organic solar cells is constantly developing, new material classes like Perowskite solar cells are emerging and different types of hybrid organic/inorganic material combinations are being investigated for their physical properties and their applicability in thin film electronics. Besides typical single-junction architectures for solar cells, multi-junction concepts are also being investigated as they enable the overcoming of theoretical limitations of a single-junction. In multi-junction devices each sub-cell operates in different wavelength regimes and should exhibit optimized band-gap energies. It is exactly this tunability of the band-gap energy that renders organic solar cell materials interesting candidates for multi-junction applications. Nevertheless, only few attempts have been made to combine inorganic and organic solar cells in series connected multi-junction architectures.

Terahertz metamaterials : from fundamental coupling mechanisms to new terahertz metasurfaces and functional emitters ¤ Abstract: The central topic of this thesis is the investigation of a new kind of optical materials, so called metamaterials. These artificially created materials consist of periodically arranged sub-wavelength sized resonant structures. Their optical properties can be designed by changing the form, size or arrangement of the sub-structures. The resonator's interaction among each other and with an incident light-field is investigated experimentally in the terahertz regime of the electromagnetic spectrum. In the first part of this thesis the fundamental electromagnetic interaction between one type of sub-structure, a single Split-Ring resonator, is investigated in two dimensional arrays.Then the complexity of interaction was increased by adding a second Split-Ring inside each unit cell, which results in the formation of a particular kind of resonance, a so called Fano resonance. The line-shape of this sharp asymmetrically shaped resonance was then controlled by the separation between the two resonators.In the third part a new type of optical materials is presented, a wave vector selective surface. This ultra thin structured surface can filter out waves, which arrive under oblique incident on the surface, operating effectively as a tunnel vision filter. In the last part a novel method is presented to excite resonant structures on semiconductor substrates using visible light. As one example this technique is than used as an inverse near-field microscope, to map the electromagnetic near-fields of those resonators with sub-wavelength resolution	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4346673-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547278-8>
Sequential change point analysis based on weighted moving averages ¤ The aim of sequential change-point analysis is to provide adequate methods for detecting structural breaks in stochastic processes. This work is concerned with non-parametric procedures, which are based on weighted moving averages. We discuss known control-charts and also introduce new procedures. The main results of this work, namely the PWMA-Test (polynomially weighted moving average) and the FWMA-Test (fractionally weighted moving average), are generalizations of the CUSUM-Test. Furthermore, we derive the limiting distributions of the conditional stopping-times for the MOSUM-Test. The latter result is utilized to provide asymptotic confidence intervals for the location of a change-point.

Trade and climate policies : the role of market structure, strategic behaviour, and the supply side of carbon ¤ Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time. It is a global problem that has to be understood in the context of a globalising world with an increasing amount of goods being traded. This dissertation focuses on the interrelation between international trade and climate policies. It contributes to the literature from two perspectives: a demand side view by means of theoretical modelling, and a supply side view using numerical simulation. The first part of this dissertation uses general equilibrium trade models to analyse the effect of trade liberalisation on the environment. It shows that a trade-induced reallocation of production factors towards the most productive firms can explain part of sector-level changes in emission intensities. Moreover, if environmental policy is used strategically to substitute for trade policy, general equilibrium effects on firms’ markups need to be considered. The findings highlight that firm behaviour, factor reallocation across firms, and market structure all play a vital role for the impact of trade on the environment. The second part of this dissertation turns to the supply side of fossil fuels—the major source of greenhouse gas emissions. It shows that fossil fuels are globally abundant despite uncertainties in local supply, for instance of unconventional natural gas. It is hence not a physical scarcity that solves the problem of climate change. Accordingly, climate policy has to target the use of fossil fuels. While the use of natural gas may be consistent with the transformation towards a low carbon energy system, the phase-out of coal is integral for climate change mitigation. By means of numerical simulations, the relation between climate policy and the international trade in natural gas and steam coal is investigated. Moreover, this dissertation analyses to what extent major steam coal exporters have a self-interest in restricting their supply.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4023222-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547705-1>

Molecular biological analysis of the chemical defense system in leaf beetle larvae (Coleoptera: Chrysomelina) : in vivo validation of enzymes and transport proteins at essential interfaces of the defensive metabolism by RNA interference ¤ The chemical defense of leaf beetle larvae represents a complex system of intercellular transport processes and enzymatic conversions, which often begins already in the secondary metabolism of the plant and ends in the deterrence of a predator, or the inhibition of microbial pathogens. This functions are realized mainly through defensive secretions, which is produced in nine pairs of accessory defense glands in the larval back and is presented as droplets on dorsal papillae in the event of an attack. In earlier work, a highly selective transport system for the chemical precursor and the biosynthetic principles for the generation of the bioactive allomones has been identified. Since usage of plant secondary metabolites for defensive purposes is a quite distributed feature in arthropods, knowledge about the functionality of the system in these beetles, also helps understand other systems. The aim of the thesis was to use the recently generated transcriptome databases of selected species of the subtribe of Chrysomelina, to reveal the molecular base of transport and biosynthesis, which was mainly unknown so far. By establishing and using RNA interference on our model systems Phaedon cochleariae (Fabr.) and Chrysomela populi (L.), proteins from the fat body, the glandular membrane and secreted ones were targeted. By the essential integration of adequate controls for each target transcript and a corresponding analysis strategy, investigating the generated “loss-of-function” phenotypes, transcripts could be identified responsible for certain steps in the defense metabolism. Due to the ongoing sequencing of closely related species, a comparable approach could be done relatively quickly. With the knowledge of the molecular base of the altered defense biochemistry of other species, new insights into the evolution and speciation of the leaf beetles could be obtained.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133941-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014988-2>

The properties of hydrophobically modified water soluble polymers in water and at surfaces ¤ Poly(glycerol methacrylate); Atom transfer radical polymerization; Semitelechelics; Self-association; Hydrogen bond; Chirality; Self-assembled monolayers; Protein adsorption; Cell adhesion Poly(glycerolmethacrylate); radical polymerization under atom transfer; Semitelechele; Self-association; Hydrogen bond; Chirality; self-assembled monolayers; Protein adsorption; Cell adhesion Novel poly(glycerol methacrylate) (PGMA)-based hydrophobically modified water soluble semitelechelics have been synthesized by combination of atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and/or copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition reaction. Perfluoroalkyl end capped PGMA exhibits a different association behavior in aqueous solution compared to the corresponding PEO semitelechelic due to the hydrogen bonding effect on PGMA segment. The protein adsorption and cell adhesion as a function of the polymer chirality was investigated on racemic or enantiopure chiral PGMA(rac), PGMA(R), and PGMA(S) self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). Enantiopure SAMs based on PGMA(R) or PGMA(S) show a larger reduction in bovine serum albumin (BSA) adsorption and THP-1 cell adhesion than PGMA(rac)-modified surfaces. The higher water content of SAMs formed by enantiopure PGMA(S) and PGMA(R) compared to PGMA(rac) SAMs is the decisive reason for the reduced BSA adsorption and cell adhesion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4325747-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4273707-2>
Trading zones of digital history ¤ Digital history is commonly argued to be positioned between the traditionally historical and the computational or digital. By studying digital history collaborations and the establishment of the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History, Kemman examines how digital history will impact historical scholarship. His analysis shows that digital history does not occupy a singular position between the digital and the historical. Instead, historians continuously move across this dimension, choosing or finding themselves in different positions as they construct different trading zones through cross-disciplinary engagement, negotiation of research goals and individual interests.

Econometric studies on flexible modeling of developing countries in growth analysis ¤ Over the last four decades, several methods for selecting the smoothing parameter, generally called the bandwidth, have been introduced in kernel regression. They differ quite a bit, and although there already exist more selection methods than for any other regression smoother we can still see coming up new ones. Given the need of automatic data-driven bandwidth selectors for applied statistics, this review is intended to explain and compare these methods. The Africa-Dummy has been identified and different explanations for its appearance have been published. In this paper, the issue of the empirical identification of the Africa-Dummy is addressed. We introduce a fixed effects regression model to identify the Africa-Dummy in one regression step so that its correlations to other coefficients can be estimated. A semiparametric extension of this model checks whether the Africa-Dummy is a result of misspecification of the functional structure. Furthermore, we show that sub-Saharan African countries have a positive return to the population growth and when adding interaction effects, the Africa-Dummy is even positive. Moreover, we show that the Africa-Dummy changes dramatically over time and the punishment for sub-Saharan African countries decreases incrementally since the mid-nineties. According to the Augmented Solow Growth model, it was even insignificant since the end-nineties ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043212-9>
Polynomial supertree methods in phylogenomics : algorithms, simulations and software ¤ One of the objectives in modern biology, especially phylogenetics, is to build larger clades of the Tree of Life. Large-scale phylogenetic analysis involves several serious challenges. The aim of this thesis is to contribute to some of the open problems in this context. In computational phylogenetics, supertree methods provide a way to reconstruct larger clades of the Tree of Life. We present a novel polynomial time approach for the computation of supertrees called FlipCut supertree. Our method combines the computation of minimum cuts from graph-based methods with a matrix representation method, namely Minimum Flip Supertrees. Here, the input trees are encoded in a 0/1/?-matrix. We present a heuristic to search for a minimum set of 0/1-flips such that the resulting matrix admits a directed perfect phylogeny. In contrast to other polynomial time approaches, our results can be interpreted in the sense that we try to minimize a global objective function, namely the number of flips in the input matrix. We extend our approach by using edge weights to weight the columns of the 0/1/?-matrix. In order to compare our new FlipCut supertree method with other recent polynomial supertree methods and matrix representation methods, we present a large scale simulation study using two different data sets. Our findings illustrate the trade-off between accuracy and running time in supertree construction, as well as the pros and cons of different supertree approaches. Furthermore, we present EPoS, a modular software framework for phylogenetic analysis and visualization. It fills the gap between command line-based algorithmic packages and visual tools without sufficient support for computational methods. By combining a powerful graphical user interface with a plugin system that allows simple integration of new algorithms, visualizations and data structures, we created a framework that is easy to use, to extend and that covers all important steps of a phylogenetic analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4611085-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174591-7>
Analyzing political communication with digital trace data : the role of twitter messages in social science research ¤ This book offers a framework for the analysis of political communication in election campaigns based on digital trace data that documents political behavior, interests and opinions. The author investigates the data-generating processes leading users to interact with digital services in politically relevant contexts. These interactions produce digital traces, which in turn can be analyzed to draw inferences on political events or the phenomena that give rise to them. Various factors mediate the image of political reality emerging from digital trace data, such as the users of digital services' political interests, attitudes or attention to politics. In order to arrive at valid inferences about the political reality on the basis of digital trace data, these mediating factors have to be accounted for. The author presents this interpretative framework in a detailed analysis of Twitter messages referring to politics in the context of the 2009 federal elections in Germany. This book will appeal to scholars interested in the field of political communication, as well as practitioners active in the political arena.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4009016-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134262-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7660487-1>
A decision support model for waste management in support of developing low carbon, eco region : case studies of densely populated kampung setllements in urban areas in Jakarta ¤ Due to the various types of waste disposal, treatment, utilization and technologies, decision support model for waste management is needed to assist planners and decision makers in finding most suitable way to manage municipal solid waste efficiently. Many planners and decision makers in the area of municipal solid waste have a lack of thorough understanding of the complex chains of waste management system. Therefore the impact for the environment quality and the public health can only be judged at the rudimentary level. However, most existing models are primarily focusing on cost or environmental analysis. Only few consider other crucial factors such as the demographic condition, the characteristics of urban form and urban infrastructure, land transformation aspects due to urban development. Consequently, such models often meet difficulties to cope with cultural requirement. Based on those reasons, a decision support model to set up alternatives of most appropriate technology for sustainable waste management towards a low carbon eco-city on a regional basis is developed in this PhD study. The Low Carbon- and Eco-Region, in particular the contribution of waste management sector, is a vision of living in low rate of carbon generation, using fewer natural resources, and encouraging energy recovery and/or waste reduction at source by improving the used material quality (up-cycling). This decision support model is constructed mainly based on the cultural requirement and local context of a region and synergize the geographic, environmental, social capital and economics aspects in order to fulfill the needs of the respective region and its society. The method employed in this model is not solely a new developed model, but also an advanced model in material flow analysis (STAN), and life cycle assessment on solid waste system (EASEWASTE) and Geographic Information System (GIS). At the same time the model also assists the stakeholders in improving the environmental quality and the public health by promoting waste separation at source and reducing the greenhouse gas emission potential from waste sector.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5>
The mediatization of the O.J. Simpson case: from reality television to filmic adaptation ¤ F. Scott Fitzgerald once said: "Show me a hero, and I'll write you a tragedy." In the 1990s, nobody fell deeper than O.J. Simpson. Once considered a national treasure, the athlete was accused of brutally slaying his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ronald Goldman on June 12, 1994. Within days, the media and public developed an unprecedented obsession with the story, turning a murder investigation and trial into a sensationalized reality show. Tatjana Neubauer examines the mediatization, deliberate manipulation, and the simplification of popular criminal trials for profit on television. She shows that TV conflated legal proceedings into entertainment programming by commodifying events, people, and places.

Molecular fundamentals of foam fractionation ¤ Foam fractionation of surfactant and protein solutions is a process dedicated to separate surface active molecules from each other due to their differences in surface activities. The process is based on forming bubbles in a certain mixed solution followed by detachment and rising of bubbles through a certain volume of this solution, and consequently on the formation of a foam layer on top of the solution column. Therefore, systematic analysis of this whole process comprises of at first investigations dedicated to the formation and growth of single bubbles in solutions, which is equivalent to the main principles of the well-known bubble pressure tensiometry. The second stage of the fractionation process includes the detachment of a single bubble from a pore or capillary tip and its rising in a respective aqueous solution. The third and final stage of the process is the formation and stabilization of the foam created by these bubbles, which contains the adsorption layers formed at the growing bubble surface, carried up and gets modified...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116373-4>
Bond debt governance : a comparative analysis of different solutions to financial distress of corporate bond debtors ¤ Bond debt financing is a two-edged sword. Solvent debtors have the chance to attract numerous potential investors with an easily tradeable and flexible investment opportunity. In financial distress, information, coordination, and cooperation problems provide a hotbed for opportunistic strategies. This book explores the relation between debtors and bond creditors. Restructuring and insolvency procedures provided by the state are compared to private and contractual solutions functioning with institutions such as covenants, bond trustee, creditor committee, and collective action clauses. Restrictions on private contractual solutions – importantly, the voting prohibition in the US – as well as private circumvention strategies (i.e. exit consent and consent payments) are discussed critically. The author argues that private procedures before and outside of insolvency are best suited to achieve value-maximisation. The focus is on US and English law, complemented by a short analysis of German law.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161620-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078605-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4214276-3>
Measuring the Burden of Disease and Returns to Education in Rural West Africa : The Collection and Analysis of Mortality, Morbidity, and Socio-Economic Data in the Nouna Health District in Burkina Faso ¤ The success of health economics and its guidance for health policy heavily rests on the availability of reliable empirical evidence on the demographic, economic, and epidemiological environment, on behavioral relationships, and on the impact of policy interventions. For Sub-Saharan Africa, especially the epidemiological situation is unclear, since comprehensive systems of mortality and health statistics are often absent. -- The economic analysis of health naturally places a special focus on the interrelation between health and economic well-being: the overall disease burden decreases when a country grows richer, and the share of communicable diseases decreases in the process of economic development, whereas the share of non-communicable diseases increases. In those parts of Sub-Saharan Africa that are mainly dominated by traditional subsistence farming, however, it is difficult to examine questions of income and health for simple fundamental reasons. A vital prerequisite for an empirical investigation is the thorough and accurate measurement of income. Yet, both the measurement of the burden of disease and the measurement of income are research tasks that are far from being fulfilled for Sub-Saharan Africa. A further issue that is related with economic well-being and health is education. For poor rural regions predominated by traditional subsistence farming it is far from clear whether investments in human capital are worthwhile. -- The present study addresses this research gap by producing empirical evidence on the measurement of the burden of disease, the structure of income, and returns to education in rural West Africa. Concretely it deals with the collection and analysis of mortality, morbidity, and socio-economic data in the Nouna Health District in the North-West of Burkina Faso. The study was accepted as a doctoral thesis at the University of Heidelberg.

Applicability and Exclusion of the German Company Pensions Act for Pension Commitments of Board Members ¤ The employment law provisions of the German Company Pensions Act also apply to pension commitments for board members, unless these individuals are to be classified as “entrepreneurs”. The resulting limitations for deviating contractual agreements are controversial.The thesis examines the conditions under which board members with company shares should be excluded from the scope of the German Company Pensions Act. The author shows that the “addition solution” practiced for decades by the German Federal Court of Justice is materially wrong, and that exclusion is justified only if stricter requirements are met. The thesis further raises the question of whether it is possible to contractually deviate from the provisions of the German Company Pensions Act to the disadvantage of board members who are principally protected by this act. Considering the jurisprudence developed for this purpose, the author eventually elaborates on the legally permissible scope for such deviations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069375-2>
Disentangling the chemodynamical history of the Milky Way disc with asteroseismology and spectroscopy ¤ Galaxies are among the most complex systems that can currently be modelled with a computer. A realistic simulation must take into account cosmology and gravitation as well as effects of plasma, nuclear, and particle physics that occur on very different time, length, and energy scales. The Milky Way is the ideal test bench for such simulations, because we can observe millions of its individual stars whose kinematics and chemical composition are records of the evolution of our Galaxy. Thanks to the advent of multi-object spectroscopic surveys, we can systematically study stellar populations in a much larger volume of the Milky Way. While the wealth of new data will certainly revolutionise our picture of the formation and evolution of our Galaxy and galaxies in general, the big-data era of Galactic astronomy also confronts us with new observational, theoretical, and computational challenges.

Electronic and structural properties of LaNiO₃-based heterostructures ¤ This thesis explores an amazing family of oxide compounds - the nickelates - known for their metal-to-insulator transition and, in the case of LaNiO3, to be a possible building block for designing a synthetic high Tc superconductor. Competition between various fascinating phases makes these materials very sensitive to external parameters and it is thus possible to dramatically tune their properties. This work on ultrathin LaNiO3 and the solid solution Nd1-xLaxNiO3 has important implications for the search for superconductivity in this class of materials Introduction -- Perovskite Oxides -- Thin Film Physics -- The Nickelates -- Experimental Techniques -- Quantifying Octahedral Distortions in Perovskites -- Ultrathin LaNiO3 -- The Nd1−xLaxNiO3 Solid Solution -- Conclusions and Perspectives -- Bibliography	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166759-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058651-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210733-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178306-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4215608-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130672-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123378-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176916-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136176-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4371101-7>
The Legal Nature of § 110 BGB ¤ Daniel Rodi investigates the ever topical question of the legal nature of § 110 in Germany's Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch. He comes to the conclusion that the regulation is to be classified as a statutorily invoked effectiveness from which diverse concrete inferences arise. § 110 BGB, the so-called Pocket Money Paragraph, has been the subject of increased scientific attention in recent years, particularly in the context of advancing digitalization. Naturally, there is a lack of discussion in the specialized literature on the fundamental question of the legal dogmatic characterization of § 110 BGB, which, however, forms the basis for a well-founded answer to detail questions. This gap is closed by Daniel Rodi with his comprehensive investigation into the legal nature of § 110 BGB. He comes to the conclusion that § 110 BGB neither concerns a special form of the consent required by §§ 107, 108 BGB, nor does it represent a comparable partial capacity regulation under §§ 112, 113 BGB, but rather is to be classified as an independent statutory effectiveness provision. From this, diverse concrete consequences arise, not least in the context of the conflict-of-laws connection of § 110 BGB.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039417-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128412-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059092-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048795-7>
The Thing-Liability Relationship: On the Legal Relationship of the Owner to the Culpable Possessor, Book Owner or Disturber ¤ BEGIN: The boundary between the law of obligations and property law becomes especially apparent in the relationship between possessor and owner. How can the owner's claim for damages be brought into line with the conflicting priorities of the law of obligations and property law? Johann H. Kim studies this using the concept of the legal relationship. Der bösgläubige Besitzer ist dem Eigentümer nach Maßgabe der §§ 989, 990 BGB zum Schadensersatz verpflichtet. Daraus folgt, dass den bösgläubigen Besitzer gegenüber dem Eigentümer eine Pflicht trifft. Johann H. Kim arbeitet heraus, dass diese Pflicht nicht in der Vindikation ihre Grundlage hat, sondern in einem eigenständigen – dinglichen – Schuldverhältnis. Die Konstruktion des dinglichen Schuldverhältnisses greift gleichermaßen im Verhältnis zwischen dem bösgläubigen Bucheigentümer und dem wahren Eigentümer. Schließlich stellt der Autor die Frage, ob auch im Verhältnis zwischen Eigentümer und Störer ein dingliches Schuldverhältnis besteht.

A Single Trapped Rydberg Ion ¤ Systems of trapped ions and systems of ultracold Rydberg atoms are used at the forefront of quantum physics research and they make strong contenders as platforms for quantum technologies. Trapped Rydberg ions are a new hybrid technology envisaged to have both the exquisite control of trapped ion systems and the strong interactions of Rydberg atoms. In this work a single trapped Rydberg ion is experimentally investigated. A trapped strontium ion is excited to Rydberg states using two ultraviolet lasers. Effects of the strong trapping electric fields on the highly-sensitive Rydberg ion are studied. After mitigating unwanted trap effects, the ion is coherently excited to Rydberg states and a quantum gate is demonstrated. This thesis lays much of the experimental groundwork for research using this novel system Introduction -- Properties of Strontium Rydberg Ions -- Experimental Setup -- Two-Photon Rydberg Excitation -- Ion Loss by Double Ionisation -- Trap Effects -- Coherent Excitation of Rydberg States -- Summary and Outlook	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4705961-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186741-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135908-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027597-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183772-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134801-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178785-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4246725-1>

A low-noise front-end for an X-band particle deflector at DESY ¤ In this thesis, a low-level RF (LLRF) system for the novel polarizable transverse deflecting structure PolariX TDS is developed, installed, and commissioned at the FLASHForward beamline at DESY. The PolariX TDS operates in the X-band at 12 GHz and requires an LLRF system capable of measuring and processing signals in this frequency band. Using an approach to reuse the existing S-band LLRF system that can process signals at 3 GHz, new hardware is being developed that converts RF signals between 12 GHz and 3 GHz. The underlying components of this conversion hardware are RF mixers, filters, amplifiers, and frequency multipliers. Various candidates for all these components are characterized and compared in terms of their electrical characteristics. Since the final system performance depends heavily on the phase noise, the main focus of the characterization will be on this. With the components selected, printed circuit boards are designed, simulated, produced and packaged in hermetically sealed housings before being mounted in 19" modules. After completion, the modules are also characterized in the laboratory. As a final step, the prototype of the PolariX TDS will be installed in the FLASHForward beamline together with the developed LLRF system. After successful commissioning, first measurements will be performed in the running accelerator. To analyze the short-term behavior, possible procedures to eliminate the long-term effects will be discussed. The actuator chain, consisting of LLRF system, klystron and its preamplifier, is measured and characterized. The results show some discrepancy between expected and measured values and an analysis of possible sources of the problem is performed. Beam-based measurements are used to analyze the relation between the RF and the beam in terms of phase and amplitude noise. These measurements show good performance of the overall system in terms of short term phase stability in general. However, small deviations from the expected behavior are seen, analyzed, and procedures to correct them are proposed. Analyses of the long-term behavior show a large difference between the RF and beam-based measurements, which causes are still subject of research. Although not as important as the phase noise, the amplitude noise is also investigated and similar to the long term behavior, the measured RF shows better performance than the beam based measurements.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176824-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014360-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4770009-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4338603-9>

Modeling Schedule Reliability in Production ¤ Schedule reliability is one of the most important logistic targets in operations management. Many companies struggle to control their schedule reliability systematically. Whether a production facility is able to complete its jobs on time depends on the backlog and the sequence deviations within the production flow. This work models schedule reliability as a function of its influencing variables. The model helps to detect the sources of low schedule reliability and provides starting points to increase it. Schedule reliability is one of the most important logistic targets in production. Many companies find it difficult, however, to systematically control their schedule reliability. Whether a production facility completes its orders on time depends on the backlog and sequence deviations. The model developed in this work models schedule reliability in dependence on its influencing factors and detects the causes of inadequate schedule reliability, enabling targeted changes for its improvement.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5>
Improved flood risk assessment : new data sources and methods for flood risk modelling ¤ Rivers have always flooded their floodplains. Over 2.5 billion people worldwide have been affected by flooding in recent decades. The economic damage is also considerable, averaging 100 billion US dollars per year. There is no doubt that damage and other negative effects of floods can be avoided. However, this has a price: financially and politically. Costs and benefits can be estimated through risk assessments. Questions about the location and frequency of floods, about the objects that could be affected and their vulnerability are of importance for flood risk managers, insurance companies and politicians. Thus, both variables and factors from the fields of hydrology and sociol-economics play a role with multi-layered connections. One example are dikes along a river, which on the one hand contain floods, but on the other hand, by narrowing the natural floodplains, accelerate the flood discharge and increase the danger of flooding for the residents downstream. Such larger connections must be included in the assessment of flood risk. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4220751-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131972-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025289-9>
Unraveling property-performance relationships in CO2 hydrogenation over iron-based catalysts ¤ This thesis deals with the development of iron-based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to higher hydrocarbons and understanding of fundamentals relevant for activity and selectivity. The most decisive factors affecting activity and selectivity were identified by statistical approaches.

Transport and biological activity in chaotic open flows : a numerical study in idealized oceanic flows ¤ The interplay between hydrodynamic motion and nutrient availability influences the distribution of plankton that makes up the basis of the aquatic food web. Horizontal stirring by mesoscale structures like vortices and wakes redistributes nutrients and enhances primary production, and can also initiate plankton blooms and affect the competition and coexistence of different plankton species. Vertical upwelling in connection with and Ekman flow and strong mesoscale activity occurs in the region the Canary Islands in the Atlantic ocean. The residence time of the plankton species in the structures in the wake is determined by the chaotic saddle, the vorticity and other nonlinear effects in the flow. The long residence times in the vicinity of the island and the hydrodynamic forcing and confinement of plankton in the vortices initiate localized plankton blooms.

Functionality of Culture in the World Society: Inter-Culturality in the Everyday Discourse of Students ¤ Instead of asking what culture is, the book shifts the focus to the question of the functionality of culture. The theory of the world society (Luhmann) as a starting point makes a perspective shift in dealing with questions of foreignness in the global world necessary and proves to be beneficial for dealing with pedagogical challenges. In addition to meta-theoretical considerations, the topic of inter-culture is explored in the everyday discourse of students. The book shows how reality in the world society is situated in the reconstruction of students' orientation to action.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123440-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4519498-1>

Theoretical Study on Correlation Effects in Topological Matter ¤ BEGIN: Introduction -- Interacting Dirac fermions in (3+1) dimensions -- Tilted Dirac cones in two dimensions -- Generalized Hund's rule for two-atom systems -- Interacting topological crystalline insulators -- Conclusions and prospects. This thesis elucidates electron correlation effects in topological matter whose electronic states hold nontrivial topological properties robust against small perturbations. In addition to a comprehensive introduction to topological matter, this thesis provides a new perspective on correlated topological matter. The book comprises three subjects, in which electron correlations in different forms are considered. The first focuses on Coulomb interactions for massless Dirac fermions. Using a perturbative approach, the author reveals emergent Lorentz invariance in a low-energy limit and discusses how to probe the Lorentz invariance experimentally. The second subject aims to show a principle for synthesizing topological insulators with common, light elements. The interplay between the spin–orbit interaction and electron correlation is considered, and Hund's rule and electron filling are consequently found to play a key role for a strong spin–orbit interaction important for topological insulators. The last subject is classification of topological crystalline insulators in the presence of electron correlation. Unlike non-interacting topological insulators, such two- and three-dimensional correlated insulators with mirror symmetry are demonstrated to be characterized, respectively, by the Z4 and Z8 group by using the bosonization technique and a geometrical consideration.

Cross-formalism resource discovery in smart environments ¤ Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming progressively colloquial to media. However, when there are trillions of resources out there, how can we spontaneously specify the resource we need? Therefore, one of the main research questions is the device and service discovery. Many standard web services descriptions are used to describe not only web services but also physical devices. These devices are encapsulated under the web service communication layer to make them available on the Internet. This technique enables automatic discovery, configuration, and execution of resources in dynamic environments. Thus, we focus on the resource description language that allows semantic annotation. Nevertheless, there is no single standard formalism to describe resources. It is more tactful to handle multiple description formalisms simultaneously. This thesis presents a cross-formalism resource discovery technique which utilizes the user context and resource’s context to improve the recommendation of resources. The discovery process should not be restricted to single resource description formalism. Moreover, the matching algorithm should be user-aware and environmentally adaptive, i.e. depending on the user’s current situation, rather than limit to keyword-based search. This thesis explains the implementation detail and shows the evaluation of each implemented module. We aimed to prove that the quality of the result is improved significantly compared to conventional discovery techniques. To demonstrate the usability of the proposed method, we deploy it in MERCURY. MERCURY is a platform that allows both businesses to engage with their customers and end users to create custom-made applications. Within the context of MERCURY, registration, assembling, and execution of resources need the automatic resource discovery. Since the implementation of this work is designed to be a standalone service, there is no restriction to use it under the domain of MERCURY.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154995-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7713781-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1027189210>

Microglia differentiation and cell therapy ¤ Microglia Therapy: Diseases like Alzheimer or Multiple Sclerosis have been linked to a continuous deterioration of the resident microglia cell population. The brain, like other organs, also suffers from age related inflammation (“inflamm-aging”) and chronic activation of microglia. A cell therapy could aim to replace deteriorated microglia or to regulate the excessive activation of microglia in age. We wanted to differentiate microglia from adult stem cells (Paper 1 and 2) and to proof their function (phagocytosis, oxidative burst, migration). Then, we planned to transplant their progenitors and the differentiated microglia (Paper 3 and additional data). We also wanted to transplant mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) since MSC are known to regulate inflammation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4301913-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4665329-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121138-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4516953-6>
The dynamics of Chinese regional development : market nature, state nurture ¤ This book surveys the competing, or sometimes complementary, roles of the state and the market in shaping China's pattern of regional development during the Communist era. The uneven pace of industrialisation across China's provinces during its economic transition raises numerous questions regarding spatial patterns of industrial development in a developing, transitional economy. Jane Golley's book answers questions such as: Why have inter-regional inequalities in industrial development come to exist? Why are they tending to increase? How have regional policies and reform strategies impacted on these trends? How, if at all, can these trends be reversed? A comparative economic systems analysis of the Mao and Deng eras, combined with theoretical and empirical evidence of the disequilibrium nature of regional development, depicts the recent trend of rising inequality across China as being both inevitable and ongoing. The central government's 'Western Development Strategy' is assessed in this context. The most novel contribution of the book is the development of a framework for thinking about regional development and policy, which combines two distinct approaches - 'new' economic geography and comparative economic systems analysis - which can be used to understand patterns of regional development anywhere in the world. The application of this framework to regional development during the Mao and Deng eras provides a uniquely holistic and easy-to-read coverage of the topic. The Dynamics of Chinese Regional Development will appeal to undergraduate and postgraduate students of the Chinese economy. The book will also find an audience in scholars and researchers of Chinese and Asian studies more generally as well as students and scholars of economics, political economy and regional science	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049040-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9>
The changing nature of economic value : indigenous forest garden values in Kalimanatan, Indonesia ¤ This book deals with economic values in the broader context of science and in the specific context of natural and social systems. The aim of this book is to explain and contribute to solving the divergence between value in economic theory and in social reality, in particular the reality of indigenous Dayak societies in Kalimantan, Indonesien. An economic theory that does not account for the many goods and services provided by the environment - termed bad economics by Schumacher (1993) - is commonly believed to be the cause of environmental deterioration. Various valuation techniques have been developed in order to close this gap and to come up with a total economic value of ecosystems. The idea of Schumacher's critique and its reception is to correct the balance sheets with an improved system of valuation and accounting.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4601495-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032589-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017949-7>
Chemo-kinematic constraints on Milky Way models from the spectroscopic surveys SEGUE & RAVE ¤ The Milky Way is only one out of billions of galaxies in the universe. However, it is a special galaxy because it allows to explore the main mechanisms involved in its evolution and formation history by unpicking the system star-by-star. Especially, the chemical fingerprints of its stars provide clues and evidence of past events in the Galaxy’s lifetime. These information help not only to decipher the current structure and building blocks of the Milky Way, but to learn more about the general formation process of galaxies. In the past decade a multitude of stellar spectroscopic Galactic surveys have scanned millions of stars far beyond the rim of the solar neighbourhood. The obtained spectroscopic information provide unprecedented insights to the chemo-dynamics of the Milky Way. In addition analytic models and numerical simulations of the Milky Way provide necessary descriptions and predictions suited for comparison with observations in order to decode the physical properties that underlie the complex system of the Galaxy.

Entanglement Between Noncomplementary Parts of Many-Body Systems ¤ This thesis investigates the structure and behaviour of entanglement, the purely quantum mechanical part of correlations, in many-body systems, employing both numerical and analytical techniques at the interface of condensed matter theory and quantum information theory. Entanglement can be seen as a precious resource which, for example, enables the noiseless and instant transmission of quantum information, provided the communicating parties share a sufficient "amount" of it. Furthermore, measures of entanglement of a quantum mechanical state are perceived as useful probes of collective properties of many-body systems. For instance, certain measures are capable of detecting and classifying ground-state phases and, particularly, transition (or critical) points separating such phases. Chapters 2 and 3 focus on entanglement in many-body systems and its use as a potential resource for communication protocols. They address the questions of how a substantial amount of entanglement can be established between distant subsystems, and how efficiently this entanglement could be "harvested" by way of measurements. The subsequent chapters 4 and 5 are devoted to universality of entanglement between large collections of particles undergoing a quantum phase transition, where, despite the enormous complexity of these systems, collective properties including entanglement no longer depend crucially on the microscopic details.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063491-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4409616-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4300046-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4263231-6>

Search for New Phenomena in Top-Antitop Quarks Final States with Additional Heavy-Flavour Jets with the ATLAS Detector ¤ BEGIN Introduction -- The ATLAS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider -- Reconstruction of physics objects -- Data and Event simulations -- Signal and background modeling -- Optimisations of heavy object tagging and event categorisation -- Analysis strategy -- Systematic uncertainties -- Statistical analysis -- Results -- Discussion -- Prospect -- Conclusion This book reports on the search for a new heavy particle, the Vector-Like Top quark (VLT), in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The signal process is the pair production of VLT decaying into a Higgs boson and top quark (TT→Ht+X, X=Ht, Wb, Zt). The signal events result in top–antitop quarks final states with additional heavy flavour jets. The book summarises the analysis of the data collected with the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016. In order to better differentiate between signals and backgrounds, exclusive taggers of top quark and Higgs boson were developed and optimised for VLT signals. These efforts improved the sensitivity by roughly 30%, compared to the previous analysis. The analysis outcomes yield the strongest constraints on parameter space in various BSM theoretical models.

Upstream Securities and Merger Buy-out: A Capital Preservation Law Investigation of a Company Acquisition using an Acquisition Vehicle ¤ Literature and jurisprudence have always been in dispute with the classification of upstream securitys and mergers in terms of the command of preservation of capital. These operations also become virulent, particularly in the context of acquisition-financing using an acquisitionvehicle. The author takes on the task of putting present dogmatics to the test and striving for a comprehensive law assessment in terms of the preservation of capital of an acquisition process. Particular attention is paid on identifying any liability-risks for investors. The concern of this work is to cut a path through the thicket of dogmatics and jurisprudence. The capital preservation law classification of upstream securities and mergers has been a subject of dispute between literature and jurisprudence for a long time. These operations also become virulent, especially in the context of acquisition financing using an acquisition vehicle. The author takes it upon themselves to put existing dogmatics to the test and strive for a comprehensive capital preservation law assessment of an acquisition process, which is sometimes lacking in its entirety. A particular emphasis is placed on highlighting any liability risks for investors.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129472-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252432-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029567-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4205916-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032945-8>
Homogeneous and heterogeneous CuAAC-systems for self-healing and stress-sensing applications ¤ “click” chemistry; CuAAC; copper(I)-ligands; homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts; chelation-assisted; mechanochemistry; self-healing polymers; autonomous sensing; low-temperature crosslinking; copper(I)-catalysis Multivalent components, equipped with the newest generation of “click” type moiety, suitable for the chelation-assisted copper(I)-alkyne/azide cycloaddition (ca-CuAAC), were investigated in respect to their crosslinking efficiency, addressing autonomous self-healing (SH) of growing microcracks at low temperatures (< 20 °C) via fast network formation reactions. The crosslinking activity at 5 - 10 °C was verified for both, a low and a high molecular weight approach (monitored via DSC and melt-rheology), using picolyl azide modified components. Optimized conditions were established by applying homogeneous or heterogeneous Cu(I)-catalysts. A fluorogenic SH response in turn of scratches was accomplished by incorporation of ca-CuAAC suiting components to a scaffolding matrix. An autonomous sensing tool was designed by taking advantage of a Cu(I)-mechanocatalyst, leading to a fluorogenic “click” response within a material triggered upon compression. „Klick“ Chemie; CuAAC; Kupferliganden; Homogene und heterogene Katalysatoren; Unterstützende Chelatierung; Mechanochemie; Selbstheilende Polymere; Autonome Sensoren; Niedrigtemperatur-Vernetzung; Kupfer(I)-Katalyse Multivalente Verbindungen wurden mit der neuesten „Klick“ Generation ausgestattet und hinsichtlich ihrer Vernetzungseffizienz in der ca-CuAAC untersucht. Eine effiziente Netzwerkbildung in autonomen Selbstheilungs- (SH)-Systemen sollte somit auch bei niedrigen Temperaturen (< 20 °C) die Ausbreitung von Mikrorissen durch Versiegelung verhindern können. Die bei 5 - 10 °C ablaufenden Vernetzungsreaktionen von Picolylazid modifizierten Verbindungen wurden sowohl für ein niedermolekulares als auch ein hochmolekulares System (mittels DSC und Schmelz-Rheologie) nachgewiesen. Für optimale Bedingungen wurden homogene und heterogene Cu(I)-Katalysatoren genutzt. Eine fluorogene SH durch Kratzbeanspruchung konnte durch Einbettung der entsprechenden Komponenten in eine umgebende Matrix erzielt werden. Mit Hilfe eines Cu(I)-Mechanokatalysators konnte ein autonomer Schadenssensor entwickelt werden, welcher eine fluorogene “Klick” Reaktion im Material in Folge von Kompression bewirkt.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1153741164> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7700321-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4295813-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029921-1>
Valorization of biobased furfurals by catalytic oxidative esterification ¤ The two benchmark biobased chemicals, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and furfuraldehyde were successfully oxidized by newly developed bimetallic catalysts in batch and in flow conditions.

The Political Economy of the Argentine Agro-Food System ¤ The production, processing and distribution of groceries are the material expression of each and every concrete historical social order and thus always reflect relations of power and domination. In recent years, discussions on the global agro-food system have focused on the dominance of large retailers and the ‘supermarketisation’ of the Global South. The actions of multinational retailers especially are often blamed for the system’s negative effects on small-scale local producers and retailers. This study of the Argentine agro-food system claims that an analysis of the impact of large-scale retailers must take the extent to which they are embedded in a socio-economic and political environment into account. Therefore, their success can only be explained by linking it to Argentine government policies, the global exchange regime and consumers’ positive reception of the so-called modern shopping experience.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039275-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4395694-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115586-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114379-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6>
Advanced light microscopy to resolve spatio-temporal and spatio-morphological infection processes in vitro and in vivo ¤ Virology, Microscopy, Rabies virus, SARS-CoV-2, Coxiella burnetii, Light sheet fluorescence microscopy, Tissue Optical Clearing, Live-cell imaging, Nervous system, Respiratory tract, Coxiella burnetii, SARS-CoV-2, light microscopy, light sheet fluorescence microscopy, live-cell imaging, nervous system, rabies virus, respiratory tract, tissue optical clearing, virology Technological advances in light microscopy have always gone hand in hand with unprecedented biological insight. For microbiology, light microscopy even played a founding role in the conception of the entire discipline. The ability to observe pathogens that would otherwise evade human observation makes it a critical necessity and an indispensable tool to infectious disease research. Thus, the aim of this thesis was to optimize, extend, and functionally apply advanced light microscopy techniques to elucidate spatio-temporal and spatio-morphological components of bacterial and viral infection in vitro and in vivo. Pathogens are in a constant arms race with the host’s immune system. By finding ways to circumvent host-mediated immune responses, they try to evade elimination and facilitate their own propagation. The first study (publication I) demonstrated that the obligate intracellular pathogen Coxiella burnetii is not just able to infect natural killer (NK) cells, but is actually capable of surviving the harsh degradative conditions in the cytotoxic lymphocyte’s granules. Using live-cell imaging of reporter-expressing Coxiella burnetii, the transient NK cell passage was closely monitored to provide detailed spatio-temporal information on this dynamic process in support of a range of static analyses. Bacterial release from NK cells was pinpointed to a time frame between 24 to 48 hours post-infection and the duration of release to about 15 minutes. The second approach ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068903-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252060-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4276382-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067547-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041643-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/113919884X> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1206288906>
Mechanical stimulation of in-vitro tissue growth using magnetic beads ¤ Cells and tissues are sensitive to mechanical forces applied to them. In particular, bone forming cells and connective tissues, composed of cells embedded in fibrous extracellular matrix (ECM), are continuously remodeled in response to the loads they bear. The mechanoresponses of cells embedded in tissue include proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, internal signaling between cells, and formation and resorption of tissue. Experimental in-vitro systems of various designs have demonstrated that forces affect tissue growth, maturation and mineralization. However, the results depended on different parameters such as the type and magnitude of the force applied in each study. Some experiments demonstrated that applied forces increase cell proliferation and inhibit cell maturation rate, while other studies found the opposite effect. When the effect of different magnitudes of forces was compared, some studies showed that higher forces resulted in a cell proliferation increase or differentiation decrease, while other studies observed the ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190674-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032651-2>
An Efficient Approach to Translation between Service Protocols through Modeling of Behavioral Differences ¤ For developers, the integration of service protocols into applications is still a tedious and time-consuming task. This problem can be solved by programming software that converts one protocol to another. Thereby, design-patterns, data transformation technologies or manual coding are used to integrate these protocols. Also, several model-driven solutions can be used that focus on the formal description of protocols to automatically generate converters. This thesis describes a model-driven approach that has been designed to convert service protocols into each other. The approach focuses on the modeling of the differences between protocols. The differences in the communication behavior are described using patterns, while the state of a service can be described using decision trees. The evaluation contains an analysis of the processing times of the patterns as well as a comparison with other model-driven approaches. <engl.> Die Integration von Service-Protokollen in Applikationen ist noch immer eine aufwändige und zeitintensive Aufgabe für Entwickler.

American history in transition : from religion to science ¤ In American History in Transition Yoshinari Yamaguchi provides fresh insights into early efforts in American history writing, ranging from Jeremy Belknap's Massachusetts Historical Society to Emma Willard's geographic history and Francis Parkman's history of deep time to Henry Adams's thermodynamic history. Although not a well-organized set of professional researchers, these historians shared the same concern: the problems of temporalization and secularization in history writing. As the time-honored framework of sacred history was gradually outdated, American historians at that time turned to individual facts as possible evidence for a new generalization, and tried different 'scientific' theories to give coherency to their writings. History writing was in its transitional phase, shifting from religion to science, deduction to induction, and static to dynamic worldview	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020531-9>
Hadron Structure in Electroweak Precision Measurements ¤ This thesis examines the γZ box contribution to the weak charge of the proton. Here, by combining recent parity-violating electron-deuteron scattering data with our current understanding of parton distribution functions, the author shows that one can limit this model dependence. The resulting construction is a robust model of the γγ and γZ structure functions that can also be used to study a variety of low-energy phenomena. Two such cases are discussed in this work, namely, the nucleon’s electromagnetic polarizabilities and quark-hadron duality. By using phenomenological information to constrain the input structure functions, this important but previously poorly understood radiative correction is determined at the kinematics of the parity-violating experiment, QWEAK, to a degree of precision more than twice that of the previous best estimate. A detailed investigation into available parametrizations of the electromagnetic and interference cross-sections indicates that earlier analyses suffered from the inability to correctly quantify their model dependence.

Mid-infrared photonic devices for stellar interferometry ¤ Multi-scan ultrafast laser inscription at a wavelength of λ = 1026 nm induces a positive refractive index change gallium lanthanum sulfide (GLS). It can be used to produce single mode waveguides for mid-infrared wavelengths. Simulations of the GLS structure show GaS4 tetrahedra and LaS8 polyhedra. The direct comparison of Raman spectra reveals a structural change of the waveguide from the bulk. The laser parameters have a crucial influence on the spectra. This indicates a change in La coordination and a reorientation of the structural units, which results in a local densification and partial crystallization. Structural investigations with mode field diameter measurements, SEM and polarimetry proved these assumptions. Annealing of GLS aiming at the relaxation of stress induced birefringence showed that a material relaxation is accompanied by a smaller difference between bulk and achievable waveguide refractive index. Stresses induced by the laser writing have an influence on the properties of waveguides written within their range. Birefringence control and loss reduction by changing the propagation constant of closely spaced waveguides can improve the performance of integrated optics components for interferometric beam combination. A symmetrization of a 7-waveguide and a 23-waveguide zig-zag array has been achieved for waveguide arrays up to 22 mm length. A new 4-telescope discrete beam combiner with 23 parallel waveguides with zig-zag geometry was manufactured and interferometrically characterized for 6 baselines. It turns out to be comparable to the performance of already used interferometer instruments. Also the ABCD beam combination scheme was tested in a 2-telescope configuration. The Raman response function of a waveguide in GLS was measured by fitting the spectral broadening and Raman signal heights for different input laser powers and compared to pulse propagation simulations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252995-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166759-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155888-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4267405-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4243979-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4337335-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184024-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139080-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057342-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200157-2>
Functional renormalization and ultracold quantum gases ¤ Modern techniques from quantum field theory are applied in this work to the description of ultracold quantum gases. This leads to a unified description of many phenomena including superfluidity for bosons and fermions, classical and quantum phase transitions, different dimensions, thermodynamic properties and few-body phenomena as bound state formation or the Efimov effect. The non-perturbative treatment with renormalization group flow equations can account for all known limiting cases by solving one single equation. It improves previous results quantitatively and brings qualitatively new insights. As an example, new quantum phase transitions are found for fermions with three spin states. Ultracold atomic gases can be seen as an interesting model for features of high energy physics and for condensed matter theory. The research reported in this thesis helps to solve the difficult complexity problem in modern theoretical physics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128419-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4755839-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047984-5>
Possibilities and Limits of Microscopic Cremation Investigation ¤ The Dissertation concerns the possibilities of the microscopical investigation (light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy) on human cremations. The main goals were the specification of the age-at-death estimation of the individual as well as the diagnosis of possible changes due to pathological processes and their distinction from heat-induced changes. Different prehistoric cremations from several regions (eastern Turkey, Germany, Czech and Slovak Republic) have been compared, dating from the mesopotamian Bronze Age up to the Iron Age and Roman Age.

Hybrid nanolayer architectures for ultrafast acousto-plasmonics in soft matter ¤ The goal of the presented work is to explore the interaction between gold nanorods (GNRs) and hyper-sound waves. For the generation of the hyper-sound I have used Azobenzene-containing polymer transducers. Multilayer polymer structures with well-defined thicknesses and smooth interfaces were built via layer-by-layer deposition. Anionic polyelectrolytes with Azobenzene side groups (PAzo) were alternated with cationic polymer PAH, for the creation of transducer films. PSS/PAH multilayer were built for spacer layers, which do not absorb in the visible light range. The properties of the PAzo/PAH film as a transducer are carefully characterized by static and transient optical spectroscopy. The optical and mechanical properties of the transducer are studied on the picosecond time scale. In particular the relative change of the refractive index of the photo-excited and expanded PAH/PAzo is Δn/n = - 2.6*10‐4.

Integration of Fuel Cell Systems into Marine Systems ¤ BEGIN: The high temperature polymer electrolyte (HT-PEM) fuel cell technology is investigated with regard to its suitability for the electrical energy supply of marine systems. For this purpose, the dynamic and stationary behavior of a pilot fuel cell system is analyzed. For model calibration, experiments are carried out on a methanol reformer, which supplies synthesis gas for the HT-PEM fuel cell stack. A thermodynamic model of the fuel cell system (evaporator, methanol reformer, cell stack) with automation is created and operational parameters are simulated. Results between a diesel generator and an HT-PEM power supply are compared. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160270-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175165-6>
All inkjet printed piezoelectric polymer actuators for microfluidic lab-on-a-chip systems ¤ Printing technologies for the fabrication of electronic components have emerged in recent years and have attracted interest due to their capabilities of cost-effective material deposition and their suitability for large-area coatings. In this thesis, the benefits of inkjet printing technologies are used to manufacture piezoelectric actuators that are suitable for integration in polymer-based, disposable microfluidic lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems. Based on analytical models of actuator behavior, piezoelectric actuators with poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) as the active material are inkjet printed and characterized in detail for the first time here. The thermal treatment applied to the P(VDF-TrFE) films exhibits a significant influence on device performance and morphology. Annealing at temperatures between 110 and 140 °C yields distinct piezoelectric behavior. These findings are employed to demonstrate the function of a membrane pump with an inkjet printed actuator with pump rates up to 130 µL/min, which is suitable for applications in LOC systems. Compared to the state-of-the-art, the manufacturing approach introduced here as well as the established knowledge about the behavior of inkjet printed P(VDF-TrFE) actuators are novel. The low processing temperatures and the use of digital printing technologies lead to cost-effective processing compared to conventional, lithography- and vacuum-based manufacturing approaches. Different from most current micropumps, an additional assembly step is not required, which would be necessary when an actuator is manufactured separately and then attached to the pump membrane. Furthermore, the manufacturing approach and design introduced here are compatible with processes and materials that are used in LOC systems. They allow a cost-effective integration of further functionalities, leading to a higher degree of integration and thus smarter systems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7658522-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4568836-9>

Metal-related mineral assemblages as probes into protoplanetary gas-solid interactions ¤ Micro- to nanometer-sized metal-volatile related inclusions have been investigated by a combined SEM-FIB-TEM approach within primitive meteorites Acfer 094 and QUE 97990. Acfer 094 contains polycrystalline sulfide-oxide assemblages with concentric character that, in some cases contain relict metal within their center. It was possible to constrain the formation scenario of these assemblages to a most likely solar nebula scenario, taking place prior to Acfer 094s’ parent body accretion. A probable formation scenario could be the reaction of primitive metal condensates with nebular gases such as H2S and H2O. It was possible to detect carlsbergite (CrN) inclusions within metal in QUE 97990 as well as roaldite (Fe4N) in Acfer 094. The crystallographic orientation relationships between metal and nitride confirm a formation of nitride from the metal, which indicates that at least the observed nitrides in Acfer 094 and QUE 97990 are the products of metal-gas interactions independent of sulfide-formation. Metal (Fe/Ni,Co,Cr) – H2/H2S experiments have been performed in order to verify the conclusions drawn from the results on natural samples. The experimentally produced samples were studied by a combined SEM-FIB-TEM approach as well. The experiments were performed at several temperatures (250 °C, 350 °C, and 550 °C) under solar nebula pressure conditions (10 mbar total pressure). The results from the highest temperature experimental run (550°C) are in good agreement with the observations made in Acfer 094, based both on chemical behavior of main (Fe, Ni) and minor (Co, Cr) elements as well as texture.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4351499-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171929-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4233970-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184024-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038950-9>
Transition to synchrony in finite Kuramoto ensembles ¤ Synchronization – the adjustment of rhythms among coupled self-oscillatory systems – is a fascinating dynamical phenomenon found in many biological, social, and technical systems. The present thesis deals with synchronization in finite ensembles of weakly coupled self-sustained oscillators with distributed frequencies. The standard model for the description of this collective phenomenon is the Kuramoto model – partly due to its analytical tractability in the thermodynamic limit of infinitely many oscillators. Similar to a phase transition in the thermodynamic limit, an order parameter indicates the transition from incoherence to a partially synchronized state. In the latter, a part of the oscillators rotates at a common frequency. In the finite case, fluctuations occur, originating from the quenched noise of the finite natural frequency sample ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063491-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1167883853> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132140-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139923-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132814-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130847-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130671-5>

Colloid mobility controlling processes in single fractures : a bottom-up approach ¤ Rock fractures can serve as water conducting structures for fluid flow and mass transport within the Earth’s crust. Large apertures, which enable high flow velocities, and a rock matrix with several orders of magnitude lower permeability, are accountable that those structures serve as preferential conduits for solutes and colloids. The mechanistic understanding of fundamental transport and retention processes is essential to make reliable predictions of the fate of solutes and colloids in the subsurface. This comprehensive topic is of paramount importance in many areas of geo-engineering, for example disposal of nuclear waste in deep geological formations, enhanced geothermal systems, CO2 sequestration, gas and oil industry, and contaminant transport in groundwater systems. This cumulative Ph.D. thesis deals with the investigation of the impact of flow channel geometry on solute and colloid transport through natural rough fractures. The bottom-up approach used in this thesis helped to investigate separately the mechanisms and the processes on mass transport (solute and colloids) in four steps. All experiments in this thesis were conducted under hydraulic and chemical settings establishing laminar flow and overall unfavorable colloid attachment conditions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4198409-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057696-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4480861-6>
Wounds and words : childhood and family trauma in romantic and postmodern fiction ¤ Biographical note: Christa Schönfelder teaches English literature at the University of Zurich. Her research interests include Romanticism, postmodern fiction, trauma theory, and gender studies. Trauma has become a hotly contested topic in literary studies. But interest in trauma is not new; its roots extend to the Romantic period, when novelists and the first psychiatrists influenced each others' investigations of the »wounded mind«. This book looks back to these early attempts to understand trauma, reading a selection of Romantic novels in dialogue with Romantic and contemporary psychiatry. It then carries that dialogue forward to postmodern fiction, examining further how empirical approaches can deepen our theorizations of trauma. Within an interdisciplinary framework, this study reveals fresh insights into the poetics, politics, and ethics of trauma fiction.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123181-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114170-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014777-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4578384-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050479-7>
Synthesis and Characterization of FeMFI Catalyst Systems ¤ FeMFI are materials in which the iron species occupies cation positions in a ZSM-5 zeolite or substitutes framework aluminum atoms. In this thesis, different options to synthesis FeMFI with iron as framework atoms are verified experimentally and the technical feasibility and potential application of FeMFI as a catalyst is tested and discussed. Using a modification of the hydrothermal synthesis of A. Bruckner successful synthesis of different FeMFI-5-catalysts was achieved and the influence of different synthesis parameters such as chemical composition, synthesis temperature and duration of the synthesis on the characteristics of the materials were verified. In addition, to the usual characterization of zeolites as catalysts, methods like SEM, X-ray scanning techniques and IR, also methods, which yield qualitative and quantitative information about the different iron species were employed. Another aim was to produce a closed and stabile crusty film of zeolites on the surface of finemeshed metal substrates. In the final stage of the present work, studies of the reaction process using the coated materials were carried out. It was confirmed that in situ FeMFI synthesis is suitable for the production of composite catalysts. As FeMFI are materials in which iron species are either fixed in the pore structure of the zeolite ZSM-5 on cation positions or substitute framework aluminum atoms. It was possible to prepare FeMFI catalysts using a modified hydrothermal synthesis according to A. Bruckner and to verify the influence of different synthesis parameters on the appearance of the materials. In addition to the usual methods used for the characterization of zeolitic catalysts, such as REM, XRD and IR, methods were used that are capable of distinguishing and qualitatively and quantitatively identifying the different iron species (Mössbauer spectroscopy, ICP-MS). The post-treatment of certain FeMFI catalysts at high temperatures can lead to the partial decomposition of existing iron particles. As another goal, a closed and crusty film of zeolites should be produced on the surface of structured steel meshes. It was confirmed that in situ FeMFI synthesis is suitable for the production of composite catalysts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029921-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160950-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4293230-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067660-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151629-1>
Modification of the electrochemical properties of graphite-based polyaniline composite for supercapacitor application ¤ BEGIN Summary Combination of PANI and the cost-effective graphite can obtain composites with good electrochemical performance. For the synthesis method of in-situ polymerization of aniline in presence of GNP, the type and content of oxidant can affect the electrochemical properties of PANI/GNP composites. Besides, the addition of excess dopant can influence the electrochemical properties of a PANI-dominated system. The two eco-friendly reduction ways, namely polymerization of dopamine and adding TA, both produced graphite with good dispersion stability and enhanced interaction with PANI. But the reduction effect of dopamine polymerization was weak, and the non-conductivity of PDA has negative effect on the electrochemical performance of the composites. Using the environmental friendly TA is an effective and facile way to produce cost-effective PANI/graphite composites for supercapacitor purpose. Comparing the two types of graphite, rGO showed lower conductivity and more defects in the carbonaceous structure compared to GNP. In my study, the PANI/(GNP-TA) (1:0.1) composites, which was prepared by using APS as oxidant and without dopant, exhibited the highest capacitive ability. In a three-electrode testing system, the PANI/(GNP-TA) composite showed a high specific capacitance of 351.2 F g-1 at 10 mV s-1. The corresponding two-electrode solid-state supercapacitor device exhibited a promising energy density of 2.3 Wh kg-1 at 0.5 A g-1, which was comparable to the commercially available supercapacitors (around 5 Wh kg-1). But for application the rate capability of the composite needs to be enhanced, in order to maintain the good capacitive performance at high current density ENDE	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4320651-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4701310-2>

Behavioral patterns of individuals and groups during co-located collaboration on large, high-resolution displays ¤ Collaboration among multiple users on large screens leads to complicated behavior patterns and group dynamics. To gain a deeper understanding of collaboration on vertical, large, high-resolution screens, this dissertation builds on previous research and gains novel insights through new observational studies. Among other things, the collected results reveal new patterns of collaborative coupling, suggest that territorial behavior is less critical than shown in previous research, and demonstrate that workspace awareness can also negatively affect the effectiveness of individual users.<eng>	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129694-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4288972-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4561503-2>

Core-shell upconversion nanoparticles - investigation of dopant intermixing and surface modification ¤ Frequency upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are inorganic nanocrystals capable to up-convert incident photons of the near-infrared electromagnetic spectrum (NIR) into higher energy photons. These photons are re-emitted in the range of the visible (Vis) and even ultraviolet (UV) light. The frequency upconversion process (UC) is realized with nanocrystals doped with trivalent lanthanoid ions (Ln(III)). The Ln(III) ions provide the electronic (excited) states forming a ladder-like electronic structure for the Ln(III) electrons in the nanocrystals. The absorption of at least two low energy photons by the nanoparticle and the subsequent energy transfer to one Ln(III) ion leads to the promotion of one Ln(III) electron into higher excited electronic states. One high energy photon will be emitted during the radiative relaxation of the electron in the excited state back into the electronic ground state of the Ln(III) ion. The excited state electron is the result of the previous absorption of at least two low energy photons.

Special Types of Counterclaims : Non-Connected Counterclaims and Counterclaims with Third-Party Reference : An Examination of the Criteria Catalogues Introduced by the BGH Case Law ¤ BEGIN: This highly significant work in terms of litigation practice critically examines the case law of Germany’s highest courts with regard to third-party counterclaims. In particular, it discusses the recognition of third-party counterclaims as an independent institution of procedural law. This work solves the problems that arise in this respect, above all the question of local jurisdiction, using the existing legally regulated instruments of procedural law. Due to the actual lack of the presupposed loophole in the regulations, it therefore calls into question both the analogous application of § 33 of Germany’s civil procedure code (Zivilprozessordnung) and the judicial development of the law in this area. The work, which also has practical significance in everyday court proceedings, critically examines the case law of the highest courts with regard to third-party counterclaims. In particular, the recognition of third-party counterclaims as an independent institution of procedural law is discussed. The emerging problem, above all the question of local jurisdiction, is solved using the existing legally regulated means of procedural law. Therefore, the analogous application of § 33 ZPO and also the judicial development of the law in this area are called into question due to the lack of but presupposed regulatory loophole.

Natural product biosynthesis in the genus Herpetosiphon : a genomics and chemistry-guided evaluation ¤ A previous study revealed the presence of a diterpene synthase in H. aurantiacus DSM 785. Feeding experiments with isotope-labeled glucose led to the discovery of its possible metabolic product herpetopanone. In addition, chemical analysis allowed the discovery of five known products from Herpetosiphon spp. including two diketopiperazines, futalosine and its derivative, as well as N-acetyl-tryptophan. In order to increase species richness and reveal metabolic diverse of the genus Herpetosiphon, three unclassified Herpetosiphon spp. and a Herpetosiphon giganteus bacterium from DSMZ were subjected to a phylogenetic analysis. Based on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data it was concluded that Herpetosiphon sp. Hp g472 represents a novel species of the genus Herpetosiphon. In addition, an emended description of H. giganteus was proposed in this study. All bacteria in the genus Herpetosiphon are capable of predation. Genome mining of Herpetosiphon spp. revealed that they harbor a high number of biosynthetic gene clusters. Up to now, three new compounds were reported from the type species H. aurantiacus DSM 785, but the genomic potential for natural product biosynthesis is much larger. The phylum Chloroflexi is one of the deepest bacterial lineages and consists of species with various phenotypes and genotypes. Terpene synthases, especially phytoene synthases, are widely distributed in this phylum. In addition, Ktedonobacter racemifer from the genus Ktedonobacter has the ability to produce resistomycin analogs based on genome analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326022-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4264758-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006902-3>

Institutions and entrepreneurship ¤ Based on five research papers, the dissertation "Institutions and Entrepreneurship" analyzes institutional influences on entrepreneurship, as well as determinants and effects of institutional change. In particular, the effects of implicit institutions, i.e. societal norms and values, on the occupational choice of becoming an entrepreneur, are investigated. Using the German history of separation and reunification as quasi-natural experiment, the thesis finds that the East Germans' preference structure significantly differs from the preference structure of the West German control group, thus constituting an obstacle to entrepreneurship in East Germany. The thesis shows that these differences in the implicit institutions result from the Socialist Regime in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), and investigates various channels by which those institutions where formed. Particularly, the dissertation identifies the effects of education and schooling in the GDR on the formation of entrepreneurial preferences. Moreover, the thesis evaluates the effectiveness of several measures of entrepreneurship education at German universities. In a diff-in-diff framework, the analysis finds significant differences in the effects of the introduction of chairs for entrepreneurship, the participation in the publicly funded EXIST-program, and the simultaneous application of both measures, on students' attitude towards entrepreneurship as occupational alternative. Eventually, the dissertation takes a more general view on institutional change an identifies effects of the introduction of the Internet on voting behavior. Using a distance-based Instrumental Variables approach, the thesis shows that the introduction of the Internet significantly decreased voter turnout in Germany. However, it is rather the established parties that could benefit from the new medium, while small and particularly fringe parties tend to lose vote shares due to the introduction of the Internet.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133767-0>
Experimental and semi-analytical multiscale approaches for the characterization of the elastic and viscoelastic behavior of polymer-modified cement-based materials ¤ Polymer-modified cement concrete (PCC) is a heterogeneous building material with a hierarchically organized microstructure. Therefore, continuum micromechanics-based multiscale models represent a promising method to estimate the mechanical properties. By means of a bottom-up approach, homogenized properties at the macroscopic scale are derived considering microstructural characteristics. The extension of existing multiscale models for the application to PCC is the main objective of this work. For that, cross-scale experimental studies are required. Both macroscopic and microscopic mechanical tests are performed to characterize the elastic and viscoelastic properties of different PCC. The comparison between experiment and model prediction illustrates the success of the modeling approach.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131028-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4416235-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195439-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014159-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4519047-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063621-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4205811-9>

Morpho-syntactic patterns in spoken Korean English ¤ The language contact situation in Korea -- Theorizing English in South Korea -- Methodology and participants -- Morpho-syntactic patterns of spoken English in Korea -- Discussion. "Morpho-Syntactic Patterns in Spoken Korean English presents fundamental research on the use of English by South Korean speakers. Despite the extraordinary and vibrant status of the English language in South Korean society (demonstrated, for example, by the notion of English Fever), research on the forms of English in the South Korean context has been sadly neglected in the study of World Englishes. This monograph is the first to provide a rich and contextualized description of the Korean English morpho-syntactic repertoire. It draws on the specifically compiled Spoken Korean English (SPOKE) corpus to shed light on Korean uses of plural marking, articles, pronouns, prepositions, and verbs in spoken English, and demonstrates that English is indeed the language of those who use it.

Women's right to the city : the family as a dispositive in urban settlements in Mexico ¤ This work analyses how women connected their political claims for housing with ‘the family’ as a political category in the configuration of urban spaces in Sinaloa, Mexico, during the mid-1970s and 1980s. Women challenged and reinforced the cultural and political significance of their subordination, while trying to fulfil their urgent housing needs, obtain a piece of land for their children and legalise their ownership of land. This co-generative relationship between women’s political participation and the family as a political category shows that the family was a crucial aspect of varying intensity and significance in the development of settlements. Women’s political involvement took place throughout their entire struggle to access housing: seizing land, organising new settlements and obtaining legal possession of their plots. Hence, women’s individual and collective experiences reveal a dynamic process of them becoming political subjects based on their claim for a piece of land for their families.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071428-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063234-9>

Impact of specialised sugar beet crop rotations on soil fertility parameters and on yield and yield stability of sugar beet ¤ This study examines the extent to which specialised sugar beet crop rotations influence soil fertility as well as yield and yield stability. Soil organic matter and soil structure were analysed in crop rotation trials, humus balances as well as soil compaction risks were calculated and yield data was evaluated. From the results, the following can be concluded: (i) Changing sugar beet cultivation methods reduce the soil organic matter content to a lesser extent than previously assumed. (ii) Cultivating sugar beet does not increase soil compaction risk of the entire crop rotation provided that the harvesting methods protect the soil and the soil is not driven when soil water content is >80 % of field capacity. (iii) In specialised sugar beet crop rotations, integrating favourable complementary crops such as alfalfa can counteract a significant yield loss and lower yield stability.

The Game Picture Book: Aesthetic Forms and Opportunities for Early Childhood Development ¤ The game picture book is a collective term for all those manifestations of the picture book market, going beyond the conventional picture book to look at and read, making moving, playful and discovering forms of book use possible. The work aims, on both theoretical-analytical and methodical-empirical level, to create a first approach to the scientific development of the hitherto little-explored area of the game picture book game. This includes a definitional clarification as well as a detailed investigation of the various manifestations of this genre. The work focuses on those picture books that prompt to motor activities such as drawing, turning, flipping, or playing, and offer exercise- and gaming effects and thereby support, accompany and expand the narrative story or the theme of the picture book. For the selected and in the work described and analyzed game picture books differentiated criteria were developed. The analysis of the different manifestations of the game picture books works out the characteristic features, different mechanisms and peculiarities of this sort of book, and relates them to their aesthetic learning potential for children. The obtained realizations of the work show, that a game picture book is not only an intermediate form between picture book and toys, but also represents a complex literary object between art, book and toys, between stories, factual issues, and moved didactic and pedagogical requirements. Behind the various manifestations of the game picture book a considerable potential of pictorial, sculptural and kinetic forms of design, which offers a variety of aesthetic experience and learning opportunities, can be seen.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006604-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031081-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4395663-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056458-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4345598-0>

Generation of turbulence by means of active grids for wind turbine investigations ¤ Wind energy is an important part of the energy transformation. Fundamental research and further development of wind turbines are therefore essential. To perform reliable investigations, realistic flows in the wind tunnel are required. In this work, a new method for generating large scale turbulent flows in the wind tunnel by means of active grids is developed. It was shown that the structures that can be imprinted by active grids depend on the reduced frequency. The generated flows undergo a transition downstream and form a fully developed turbulence far behind the active grid. In combination with a dynamic speed variation of the wind tunnel fans, very large Reynolds numbers and integral length scales can be achieved. The dynamics of a model turbine under these inflows can be determined for the entire operating range by using the Langevin approach. This provides a method for the systematic investigation of wind turbines under realistic conditions in a wind tunnel.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058076-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189940-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117265-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128839-7>
New Approaches to System-Biological Investigation of Mitochondria and Metabolism in Animal Cell Cultures ¤ Metabolomic analysis constitutes a crucial step for understanding cellular functions at a genomic level. In particular for systems biology studies, e.g. to describe the interplay of metabolic reactions and their dynamics, a reliable metabolomic analysis under physiological or in vivo conditions is required. While genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data can be obtained with high accuracy nowadays, the determination of metabolic profiles and fluxes still proves to be complicated. On the one hand, this is due to the fast turnover rates, the interaction between various metabolic pathways, and the chemical diversity of metabolites. On the other hand, the compartmentalization of metabolism in mammalian cells poses a huge challenge because of the dynamic range of metabolite concentration within the cytosol and the mitochondria. To overcome these limitations of metabolomic analysis, attempts have been made in this work to achieve a fast and efficient separation of the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments by using new technological approaches in both macro and microscales. Due to its significant value, the well-known industrial cell line CHO-K1 was used as a model organism within this research project. To investigate the isolation of mitochondria in macroscale, different cell disruption methods were modified and tested. The efficiency and sensitivity of each were determined by the measure of mitochondrial yield and the integrity of isolated mitochondria. Here, the highest yields of intact mitochondria were obtained using ultrasound for cell disruption and subsequent differential centrifugation. In addition to the large-scale procedures, a microfluidic device for metabolic analysis, providing a complete sample preparation (including cell disruption) within seconds, was developed in project cooperation. In this work, a prototype of the Lab-on-a-Chip (LoaC) was successfully integrated into a bioreactor and operated for a period of 18 h. Continuous sampling was carried out by applying overpressure onto the bioreactor. Besides dynamic pulse experiments, this microchip-bioreactor system implemented an efficient separation of cells and extracellular media. Moreover, a selective cell lysis using digitonin and a subsequent separation of released cytosol from the remaining cellular and mitochondrial compartments was realised on-chip. Thus, this integrated microfluidic system provides high potential to overcome the limitations of analyses concerning compartmentalized metabolism. In the last part of this work, CHO-K1 cells were cultivated in a controlled small-scale bioreactor in order to perform systems biology studies. Therefore, detailed analyses of extracellular metabolites using LC-MS were performed under batch and continuous cultivation conditions. In addition, the mitochondrial structure and distribution of mitochondrial proteins were studied using confocal and high resolution STED microscopy. Furthermore, the relative level of enzymes involved in metabolic reactions was measured intracellularly by using the in-cell ELISA technology. To investigate the dependence of metabolic reactions on different cell cycle phases, the cultivation of synchronized cells was performed. For this purpose, cells from heterogeneous populations were enriched in the G1- and S-phase, respectively, using the centrifugal elutriation method. The synchrony during batch cultivation was determined flow cytometrically by analysing the DNA content and the cell size distribution. In addition, the cell count was observed continuously due to the effective integration of an at-line microscope. Metabolomic and microscopic studies of synchronized cells were performed during cultivation and the resultant data were compared to that obtained during cultivation of heterogeneous cell populations. The cell cycle dependency of metabolism was shown by the increased consumption rates of glucose and glutamine within the S-phase and the shifted increased lactate production during G1-phase, amongst others.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4272013-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4803438-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057699-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124939-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4464875-3>
Investigations on the Diversity and Function of Antibiotics in the Ecosystem of Leaf Cutting Ants ¤ Leaf cutting ants are member of a multitrophic system. They are cultivating the garden fungus Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, which serves them as major food source. This mutualistic symbiosis is threatened by several pathogens. The ants are therefore defending their colony by removing any suspicious material from the fungus garden into waste chambers and additionally by using chemical arms. Beside their own antimicrobial metabolites, symbiotic Actinomyces are supporting this survival conflict with their antibiotics. It became evident, that complex microbial communities are part of the whole live style of leaf cutting ants. Beside their mutualistic role, the involved microorganisms pursue selfish interests by using secondary metabolites to hinder other competing symbionts of the leaf cutting ants. A new method to easily identify microbial chemicals involved in leaf cutting ants&rsquo; ecosystems has been established. Antimycins, actinomycins and valinomycins were identified. The potential of some of these antibiotics to shape the complex microbial communities present in the ants&rsquo; nest has been tested. Beside pathogens also Actinomyces-symbionts and the garden fungus were inhibited. For the first time it was possible to directly detect known antibiotics in the waste material and on the cuticle of Acromyrmex ants. A plasmid for future investigations on the uptake of Actinomyces by leaf cutting ants has been constructed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183507-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201084-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136029-1>
Intakte polare Lipide : Möglichkeit und Grenzen ihrer Verwendung zur Analyse mikrobieller Gemeinschaften : chances and limitations of their application to the analysis of microbial communities ¤ This thesis covers a broad spectrum of investigations regarding methodical problems, developments and applicability of the analysis of intact polar lipids (IPLs) as biomarkers for microbial life. Moreover, possibilities for the use and application of IPLs in the field of organic geochemistry are investigated. After a brief introduction, existing methods for the separation of IPLs were tested and further attempts to improve these methods were carried out and evaluated. The subsequent chapter deals with the general question of the stability of IPLs in the natural environment after cell death. Furthermore, a study of the changes in IPL and fatty acid composition of a strain of a deep sea bacterium affiliated to Desulfovibrio indonensiensis as a function of incubation pressure and temperature is presented. The last part of this thesis investigates the microbial community in hypersaline Lake Tyrrell (Victoria, Australia). In the framework of this doctoral thesis, fundamental questions regarding the analytics and use of intact polar lipids (IPL) as biomarkers for living microorganisms were pursued. The work consists of four parts, in which different aspects of the use of IPL are treated. Firstly, the methods used for the analysis of IPL are checked and investigations into their improvement are carried out. The second part of the work deals with the fundamental question of the stability of intact polar lipids after the death of microorganisms.

Magnetic order and coupling phenomena : a study of magnetic structure and magnetization reversal processes in rare-earth-transition-metal based alloys and heterostructures ¤ This thesis presents recent developments in magnetic coupling phenomena of ferrimagnetic rare-earth transition-metal Tb-Fe alloys and coupled systems consisting of ferri-/ferromagnetic heterostructures. Taking advantage of the tunability of the exchange coupling between ferrimagnetic and ferromagnetic layers by means of stoichiometry of the Tb-Fe layer, the variable number of repetitions in the Co/Pt multilayer as well as the thickness of an interlayer spacer, it is demonstrated that large perpendicular unidirectional anisotropy can be induced at room temperature. This robust perpendicular exchange bias at room temperature opens up a path towards applications in spintronics	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4163649-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078494-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136925-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154107-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123378-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035035-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4244347-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132099-2>

Magneto-transport Properties of Skyrmions and Chiral Spin Structures in MnSi ¤ This book provides extensive and novel insights into transport phenomena in MnSi, paving the way for applying the topology and chirality of spin textures to the development of spintronics devices. In particular, it describes in detail the key measurements, e.g. magnetoresistance and nonlinear electronic transport, and multiple material-fabrication techniques based on molecular beam epitaxy, ion-beam microfabrication and micromagnetic simulation. The book also reviews key aspects of B20-type MnSi chiral magnets, which host magnetic skyrmions, nanoscale objects formed by helical spatial spin structures. Readers are then introduced to cutting-edge findings on the material. Furthermore, by reviewing the author’s successful experiments, the book provides readers with a valuable update on the latest achievements in the measurement and fabrication of magnetic materials in spintronics Introduction -- Experimental Method -- Planar Hall Eﬀect in MnSi -- Electrical Magnetochiral Eﬀect in Mnsi -- Current-Induced Dynamics of Skyrmion Strings Investigated by Nonreciprocal Hall Eﬀect -- Transport Properties and Stability of Skyrmions in Mnsi Thin ﬁlms -- Conclusion	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4296737-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185932-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4524559-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7755384-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4023028-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182307-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4316087-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274371-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1137028114> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4221121-9>
Structuring of Zinc Oxide Thin Films using a Dual Laser Beam Setup under Utilization of Excited-State Absorption ¤ The present work demonstrates the ns-laser pulse assisted excited state absoption (ESA)-based processing of Zinc(II)-oxide thin films with a layer thickness of 50 – 300 nm on crystallographically differently oriented quartz-, as well as crystalline sapphire-, and amorphous fused silica substrates using a dual laser beam setup. The goal was to achieve an ablation efficiency improvement compared to single-beam ablation by decreasing the required pulse fluences. For the ESA-based ablation, the optical excitation with radiation of a laser with photon energies Ep above the optical band gap energy EBL was used to excite electrons into the conduction band (LB), which then partially relax into defect-levels. This allows the transient single-photon absorption of radiation of a second spatially and temporally aligned laser pulse with Ep < EBL, exciting electrons to the LB from these defect-levels. By utilizing different ESA-wavelengths in the visible spectrum with λESA = 410 – 600 nm, λESA = 450 nm was determined as the most effective wavelength for the ESA-based ablation due to the increased Ep, allowing the absorption from an increased number of suitable defect-levels. To quantify the efficiency improvements, a model was developed to allow for a comparison with single-beam ablation by determining the pulse fluence dependent size of the ablated structures. For a more detailed analysis of the ESA-based dual-beam process and to determine optimal processing parameters, a second model was developed to describe the temporal process and the impact of the temperature increase by the pump-pulse. In addition to ablation of variable ablation depths, the ablation quality was improved by decreasing resolidified molten structures and an ablation was achieved even with a temporal pulse delay in the μs-range.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190864-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034610-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139082-9>
A Comparative Study on Parent-Child Interaction in Children with Cleft Lip and Palate and Children with Migraine ¤ BEGIN \\nPatients with a cleft lip and palate are confronted with manifold strains from birth due to their malformation and the associated functional and aesthetic impairments. The aim of this study was therefore to compare families with one child with a cleft lip and palate as an example with families with a child with migraine with regard to the relationships between special characteristics of family interaction on the one hand and behavioral problems and special personality traits of the children on the other. In order to investigate the interaction behavior in families with a child with a cleft lip and palate, the children were confronted with a performance-oriented task in the form of a puzzle. Each child got the task to solve a puzzle half with the mother and the other with the father within 15 minutes. Parent-child interactions of 15 families with one child with a cleft lip and palate were recorded and compared with the parent-child interactions of 20 families with one child with migraine. In order to investigate possible behavioral problems and particular personality traits, the children of both groups had to complete four questionnaires on specific disorder areas in the child's age. The study suggests that children with a cleft lip and palate, unlike children with migraine, are better able to deal with their impairment than previously thought. Within the families with a child with a cleft lip and palate, difficulties in the disease are not so much in the foreground, perhaps even become more trivialized than in families with a child with migraine. The type of parent-child interaction in families with a child with a cleft lip and palate can be associated with the disease processing of the parents, even for individually different reasons, and represent a kind of psychosocial compensation of the children with an cleft lip and palate in the family environment. \\nEND	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039179-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066880-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030550-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075995-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014516-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062872-3>
Confident metabolite structure annotation with COSMIC ¤ Small molecules are key to biomarker discovery, drug development, toxicity screenings of ecosystems like rivers and lakes, and many more important research areas in multiple life sciences. Elucidating the exact structure of these metabolites is often crucial in determining their functionality, however, confident annotation of these structures remains a major challenge. To analyse samples of small molecules occurring in nature, mass spectrometry is the currently predominant technique. While mass spectrometry is used to measure the mass of a compound, tandem mass spectrometry can be used to additionally measure the mass of its fragments. The resulting spectral data however is highly non-trivial to interpret. This bottleneck accelerates the development of computational tools to annotate metabolite structures from mass spectrometry data, which enables rapid, large-scale structure annotation independent from spectral libraries. These tools return some proportion of incorrect annotations, which can vastly outnumber correct annotations. Scientists using these tools need to be able to differentiate correct from incorrect annotations. We develop an E-value computation that is based on proxy decoys drawn from the PubChem database and show that this E-value score outperforms the current CSI:FingerID hit score for the task of separating correct from incorrect annotations. To further improve on this, we develop a Percolator inspired machine learning approach, where we train linear support vector machines for this separation task. The confidence score outperforms the original CSI:FingerID hit score, the E-value score and all other tools that participated in the CASMI 2016 contest by a wide margin. Arguably, our confidence score enables confident structure annotation for a relevant portion of a dataset for the first time. We then show the power of this COSMIC workflow by annotating novel bile acid conjugate structures never reported before in a mouse fecal dataset.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4611085-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037882-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1138059420>
Cognitive processing in behavior-based perception of autonomous off-road vehicles ¤ This work addresses the environmental recognition of autonomous off-road vehicles. Algorithms, like deep learning, offer impressive performance regarding the classification and segmentation of a scene. However, context changes, scene variabilities, or disturbances pose significant challenges to these approaches and cause perception failures. A challenge is achieving the universal applicability of perception algorithms. Usually, an algorithm fails in particular situations due to unconsidered circumstances in the design phase, and complexity prevents fully considering all details. Accordingly, this thesis aims to increase the perception s robustness through context and data incorporation. Furthermore, it derives concepts for transferring methods to other robots and scenes. A hint that such a task is achievable provides human cognition, which is remarkably skillful and adjusts to arbitrary situations. Biologically motivated perception and cognitive research indicate how an achievable perception design might function, leading to guidelines for artificial perception conception. The paradigm of behavior-based systems suits these criteria due to modularity, reactivity, and robustness. It allows realizing robust and transferable perception and control systems. Consequently, the thesis proposes a novel and reconfigurable behavior-based top-down and bottom-up perception approach. Quality assessment for data filtering and deviation control is a central aspect, resulting in improved perception and data fusion results. Attentional processing allows for selecting data based on attractiveness, task, environmental context, and history. Further, context assessment of classification results enables reasoning according to the robot s memories and knowledge. Validation uses five demonstrator vehicles operating in diverse environments and fulfilling distinct tasks. Here, a robust performance was achievable, and perception adjusted well to the tested scenes and hardware layouts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7714938-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4261462-4>
Search for Scalar Top Quarks and Higgsino-Like Neutralinos : SUSY Hunting With a “Soft” Lepton at the LHC ¤ BEGIN: Introduction -- The LHC And The ATLAS Experiment -- Data And Monte Carlo Simulation -- Particle Reconstruction -- Event Selections -- Background Estimation -- Results -- Conclusions. This book reports a search for theoretically natural supersymmetry (SUSY) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The data collected with the ATLAS detector in 2012 corresponding to 20 /fb of an integrated luminosity have been analyzed for stop pair production in proton–proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in the scenario of the higgsino-like neutralino. The author focuses on stop decaying into a bottom quark and chargino. In the scenario of the higgsino-like neutralino, the mass difference between charginos and neutralinos (Δm) is expected to be small, and observable final-state particles are likely to have low-momentum (soft). The author develops a dedicated analysis with a soft lepton as a probe of particles from chargino decay, which suppresses the large amount of backgrounds. As a result of the analysis, no significant SUSY signal is observed. The 95% confidence-level exclusion limits are set to masses of stop and neutralino assuming Δm = 20 GeV. The region with ΔM (the mass difference between stop and neutralino) < 70 GeV is excluded for the first time at stop mass of less than 210 GeV. The author also excludes the signals with ΔM > 120 GeV up to 600 GeV of stop mass with neutralino mass of less than 280 GeV. The author clearly shows very few remaining parameter spaces for light stop (e.g., topology of stop decay is extremely similar to the SM top quark) by combining his results and previous ATLAS analyses. His results provide a strong constraint to searches for new physics in the future.

Light-induced transformations in biomembranes ¤ Cellular membranes constantly experience remodeling, as exemplified by morphological changes during endo- and exocytosis. Regulation of membrane morphology is essential for these processes. In this work, we attempt to establish a regulation path based on the use of photoswitches exhibiting conformational changes in model membranes, namely, giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). The mechanism of the changes in the GUVs’ morphology caused by isomerization of the photosensitive molecules has been previously explored but still remains elusive. We examine the morphological reshaping of GUVs in the presence of the photoswitch o-tetrafluoroazobenzene (F-azo) and show that the mechanism behind the resulting morphological changes involves both an increase in the membrane area and generation of a positive spontaneous curvature. First, we characterize the partitioning of F-azo in a single-component membrane using both experimental and computational approaches. The partition coefficient calculated from molecular dynamic simulations agrees with ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4203814-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4206141-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4590995-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4343954-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268828-0>

Longitudinally Polarised Terahertz Radiation for Relativistic Particle Acceleration ¤ INTRODUCTION -- Literature Review -- Background Theory -- Experimental Apparatus -- Radiation Propagation Simulation -- ALICE Energy Modulation Induced by Terahertz Reaction (AEMITR) -- Generation of Longitudinally Polarised Terahertz Radiation with a Photoconductive Antenna -- Generation of Longitudinally Polarised Terahertz Radiation in Non-Linear Optical Crystals -- Conclusions and Future Work This book elaborates on the acceleration of charged particles with ultrafast terahertz electromagnetic radiation. It paves the way for new, and improves many aspects of current, accelerator applications. These include providing shorter electron bunches for ultrafast time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy, enabling complex longitudinal profiles to be imparted onto charged particle bunches and significantly improving the ability to synchronise an accelerator to an external laser. The author has developed new sources of terahertz radiation with attractive properties for accelerator-based applications. These include a radially biased large-area photoconductive antenna (PCA) that provided the largest longitudinally polarised terahertz electric field component ever measured from a PCA. This radially biased PCA was used in conjunction with an energy recovery linear accelerator for electron acceleration experiments at the Daresbury Laboratory. To achieve even higher longitudinally polarised terahertz electric field strengths, and to be able to temporally tune the terahertz radiation, the author investigated generation within non-linear optical crystals. He developed a novel generation scheme employing a matched pair of polarity inverted magnesium-oxide doped stoichiometric lithium niobate crystals, which made it possible to generate longitudinally polarised single-cycle terahertz radiation with an electric field amplitude an order of magnitude larger than existing sources END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014413-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4168152-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014297-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4168538-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129534-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4346673-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4601119-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059318-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167928-3>
Security of Supply through Capacity Mechanisms: An Economic-Legal Analysis ¤ Is the Energy-only-market functioning or are regulatory “capacity mechanisms“ needed to secure generation adequacy? The author answers the questions regarding the If and How of capacity mechanisms by analysing both the possible market-failures of the electricity market and the national and European regulatory framework for generation adequacy.The work proves the efficiency gains of optimized Energy-only-markets and pleads strongly for a coordinated approach to secure generation adequacy by using the internal electricity market. Different capacity mechanisms are analysed in the light of the European Directives (e.g. 2009/72/EC) and the limitations established by Art. 34 TFEU (free movement principle) together with Art. 107 I TFEU (prohibition of State Aid). The author further illustrates the strategic reserve approach under German energy law (Sect. 13 et seq. EnWG), aspects of competition law and finally the possibilities of a stronger European cooperation in the light of Art. 194 TFEU.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014228-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188718-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014736-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135492-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152243-6>
Quantum Dots for Quantum Information Processing: Controlling and Exploiting the Quantum Dot Environment ¤ This thesis offers a comprehensive introduction to surface acoustic waves in the quantum regime. It addresses two of the most significant technological challenges in developing a scalable quantum information processor based on spins in quantum dots: (i) decoherence of the electronic spin qubit due to the surrounding nuclear spin bath, and (ii) long-range spin-spin coupling between remote qubits. Electron spins confined in quantum dots (QDs) are among the leading contenders for implementing quantum information processing. To this end, the author pursues novel strategies that turn the unavoidable coupling to the solid-state environment (in particular, nuclear spins and phonons) into a valuable asset rather than a liability.

Ocean acidification in the Baltic Sea : involved processes, metrology of pH in brackish waters, and calcification under fluctuating conditions ¤ Globally, ocean acidification presents a threat to marine ecosystems. In the Baltic Sea, this process could so far not be quantified, partly due to a lack of appropriate pH observations. This study unravels a positive alkalinity trend in the Baltic Sea over the past two decades that counteracted acidification. Further, state-of-the-art spectrophotometric pH measurements in brackish waters are enabled by characterizing pH buffer solutions and the indicator dye m-Cresol purple at low salinities. Finally, pH fluctuations and their implications for benthic ecosystems are examined. Global gefährdet die Ozeanversauerung marine Ökosysteme. In der Ostsee konnte dieser Prozess bisher mangels aussagekräftiger pH-Messungen nicht quantifiziert werden. Diese Arbeit beleuchtet einen langfristigen Anstieg der Ostsee-Alkalinität über die vergangen zwei Dekaden, welcher der Versauerung entgegenwirkte. Weiterhin wird die spektrophotometrische pH-Messmethode für Brackwasser eingeführt, indem pH-Pufferlösungen und der Farbstoff m-Kresolpurpur für niedrige Salzgehalte charakterisiert werden. Abschließend werden pH-Fluktuationen und deren Bedeutung für benthische Ökosysteme untersucht.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4290182-0>
The Janus-faced role of secreted sphingomyelinase and its inhibition in host response ¤ The increase in acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) activity has been implicated in the severity of disease and its fatal outcome. In sepsis, aSMase activity has been shown to continuously increase throughout the continuum from SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) to severe sepsis. The inhibition of this enzyme with desipramine, a low molecular weight inhibitor, presents promising results in cystic fibrosis patients. We therefore addressed the question of whether secreted aSMase is involved in host response to infection, which is reflected in humoral and functional parameters of immune activation. We identified a dual function of this enzyme in host response where the activity of aSMase is essential during the early phase of host response with respect to bacterial elimination, yet the continuous increase in aSMase activity and ceramide generation presents with detrimental effects in the late phase of host response. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4181014-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4273127-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182244-4>

Microeconometric analyses on economic consequences of selective migration ¤ This volume was prepared by Jens Ruhose while he was working at the Ifo Institute. It was completed in December 2014 and accepted as a doctoral thesis by the Department of Economics at the University of Munich. It includes four self-contained chapters that contribute to the understanding of the performance of migrants in the host society and the impact of migrants on the citizens of these societies. Given a large increase in the migrant population of many developed countries in recent decades, it is important to know both how migrants integrate into the destination countries and how immigration affects natives. Beside the motivation of the topic, the introduction in Chapter 1 of the volume summarizes three studies of the author that deal with explanations for migrant selection and the importance of migrant selection to labor force quality. Chapter 2 quantifies non-pecuniary migration costs that are incurred due to selective migration along cultural traits. Chapter 3 discusses whether early performance-based tracking of children into different school types impede migrant integration. Chapters 4 and 5 cover the effect of immigration on the host societies by showing that growing up in high immigration area increases intergenerational income mobility among natives and by showing that immigration may, under specific circumstances, increase crime.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013960-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039225-9>

Fluorescent Dissolved Organic Matter (FDOM) in Coastal Seas: Characterization, Biogeochemical Processes, and the Possibility of In Situ Monitoring ¤ Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a major player in global biogeochemical cycles. Here, DOM was studied for the first time with optical and molecular methods in a subterranean estuary (STE) and it was compared to a surface estuary, both in Florida, USA. I hypothesized that STEs are important sources of DOM to the coastal ocean. I developed novel statistical tools for multivariate data interpretation. As a main result, I could show that coastal sediments are major sources of DOM to the coastal ocean. In the surface estuary, mixing of fresh- and seawater was the main driver for DOM concentration and composition, while in the STE microbial processing dominated over mixing. By statistically combining the results from ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry (Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, FT-ICR-MS), fluorescence spectroscopy and other chemical water analysis, I identified major DOM sources in the two estuarine systems. Furthermore, I proposed novel optical monitoring tools for in situ continuous monitoring in coastal systems. <engl.> Das gelöste organische Material (DOM) der Meere ist eine wichtige Komponente globaler Stoffkreisläufe. In dieser Arbeit wurde zum ersten Mal DOM in einem unterirdischen Ästuar (STE) mit optischen und molekularen Methoden untersucht.

Ich stellte die Hypothese auf, dass STEs wichtige Quellen von DOM in Küstengebieten sind. Ich entwickelte neuartige statistische Methoden zur multivariaten Dateninterpretation.

Ruthenium(II) Terpyridyl complexes featuring donor and acceptor moieties ¤ In the last decades, tremendous research has been focused on the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy (i.e., photocatalysis). Hereby, scientists tried to mimic the fundamental processes in natural photosynthesis (i.e., light-harvesting, photoinduced charge separation, charge accumulation and multielectron catalysis), in order to prepare artificial photosynthetic devices. The thesis describes the synthesis and characterization of photoactive assemblies based on ruthenium(II) 2,2':6',2''-terpyridyl complexes that are capable of light-harvesting and photoinduced charge separation. It is shown that the remarkable customizability of terpyridine ligands in 4'-position and readily coordination to ruthenium centers enables a rapid access to highly functionalized complexes. The latter are equipped with organosulfurs as electron donors and fullerenes or polyoxometalates as electron acceptors and the donor-acceptor distance was varied by incorporation of spacer units. The systems can be considered as linear molecular triads with the complex as central light absorbing photosensitizer. Upon visible light excitation, two electron transfer processes involving the donor and acceptor units are observed and result in a long-ranged charge separated state. The lifetime of the charge separation increases with the donor-acceptor distance and is multiple times higher than the lifetime of the excited state, which reflects the effectivity of the photosensitizer. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that light-harvesting antennae systems can be obtained via linkage of iridium(III) and ruthenium(II) complexes. The dinuclear complexes feature enhanced absorptivity and in addition, the light which is absorbed by iridium complex is efficiently transferred to the ruthenium complex.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4386873-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4266702-1>
Premature mortality in the German Baltic Sea region now and then : patterns and trends from a regional and historical perspective ¤ This doctoral thesis examines the trends and patterns of premature mortality in the German Baltic Sea region in past and present. Based on demographic methods, it shows that the crucial determinants have changed over the course of the epidemiologic transition. Nutrition and sanitation were decisive factors in the 19th century, which led to significant variations in infant mortality by social class. Today, the access to adequate health care and risk-relevant behavior play a more important role in the region, with men in the eastern part showing the highest rates of avoidable mortality.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178901-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057312-6>
Mikropolare Zweiphasenmodelle : Formulation based on the Theory of Porous Media ¤ In the presented work, a theoretical description of multi-phase materials is presented. Basis is the Theory of Porous Media, which is extended by elements of the micropolar theory in order to take into account the influence of the microstructur. The kinematics according to finite deformations and the governing balance relations are discussed. The attention is focused on the extensions according to the independent rotations which arise in the framework of the micropolar theory. Furthermore, from the master balance equation the structure of the individual balances for the constituents is derived and related to the balance equations of the mixture as a whole. For a two-phase material consisting of elastic porous skeleton and a viscous pore-fluid thermodynamical consistent constitutive relations are derived from the evaluation of the entropy prinicple. Specially, an evolution equation for the volume fraction is introduced. This is of interest because this equation does not follow from kinematical considerations in the case of compressible constituents. Finally, to become more concrete, the solid skeleton is assumed to be elastic and a strain energy functions is given. Furthermore, according to a dimensional analysis, the extra stresses of the fluid are neglected with respect to the drag force. Some numerical examples show the evidence of the proposed model and of the included effects.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131028-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132732-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4216838-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046811-2>
Outdoor cultivation of Chlorella vulgaris : assessment of yield influencing parameters and application as biogas substrate ¤ Microalgae offer a great potential as feedstock for a variety of high-value products and biofuels. The production of microalgae biomass requires, however, high efforts and consequentially large-scale outdoor production facilities are still a rarity today. The aim of this investigation is therefore to set-up and to operate an outdoor, high-density microalgae culture to monitor, analyse, and interpret the complex processes that unfold in the system. The research addresses important aspects including productivity and composition of microalgae cultivated outdoors and the effect of flue gas on microalgae growth. Moreover, the potential of biogas production from microalgae as a promising processing option is evaluated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006780-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4453251-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4277897-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145600-2>
Spectroscopic investigation of charge carrier dynamics in carbon nitride photocatalysts ¤ In this thesis, we focus is on the investigation of charge carrier dynamics in carbon nitride materials (PCNs) on time scales ranging from femtoseconds to microseconds by transient absorption and time-resolved emission spectroscopy. This work aims to tackle the major problems that limit the photocatalytic performance of bare PCNs, i.e., insufficient visible-light absorption, rapid charge carrier recombination, low specific surface area and poor dispersion in solvents. Therefore, three carbon nitride examples (R-CNx, {Mo3}-CNx, and K,Na-PHI) are introduced to extend our understanding in four directions:1) the impact of azo-moieties formed after high-temperature heat treatment on charge carrier dynamics; 2) charge carrier dynamics upon the incorporation of cocatalyst; 3) the interplay between surface functional groups and charge carrier dynamics; 4) the variation of charge carrier dynamics in the presence of chemical quenchers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174509-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056138-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4393572-2>
Fluid-Structure Interaction in the Energy Finite Element Method ¤ The energy finite element method EFEM is used for modelling of high frequency dynamic behaviour of vibro-acoustic structures. The focus in this dissertation is to extend the applicability of the EFEM to more complex models including fluid-structure-interaction. Therefor the EFEM has been analyzed numerically and validated to complex structure used in the ship industry. These has been done for light and heavy fluids to analyze the effects onto the structure.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017233-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4052019-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4314754-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179359-6>
The contractual right of self-execution : an examination at the example of the software development contract ¤ BEGIN: The book examines the legal framework and technical boundaries of the customer’s right to remove software defects at the developer’s cost. Although the execution of software development projects is often problematic, the statutory right of self-execution is rarely used in a software development context. This is usually due to legal concerns or technical issues. Against this background, the author examines the tensions between the customer’s right of self-execution according to Section 637 German Civil Code and the developer’s copyright in the software according to Section 69a et sqq. German Copyright Act. The results may be relevant not only to the technical feasibility of the right of self-execution but also to the drafting of software development contracts.

Charge Dynamics in 122 Iron-Based Superconductors ¤ This thesis combines highly accurate optical spectroscopy data on the recently discovered iron-based high-temperature superconductors with an incisive theoretical analysis. Three outstanding results are reported: (1) The superconductivity-induced modification of the far-infrared conductivity of an iron arsenide with minimal chemical disorder is quantitatively described by means of a strong-coupling theory for spin fluctuation mediated Cooper pairing. The formalism developed in this thesis also describes prior spectroscopic data on more disordered compounds. (2) The same materials exhibit a sharp superconductivity-induced anomaly for photon energies around 2.5 eV, two orders of magnitude larger than the superconducting energy gap. The author provides a qualitative interpretation of this unprecedented observation, which is based on the multiband nature of the superconducting state. (3) The thesis also develops a comprehensive description of a superconducting, yet optically transparent iron chalcogenide compound. The author shows that this highly unusual behavior can be explained as a result of the nanoscopic coexistence of insulating and superconducting phases, and he uses a combination of two complementary experimental methods - scanning near-field optical microscopy and low-energy muon spin rotation - to directly image the phase coexistence and quantitatively determine the phase composition. These data have important implications for the interpretation of data from other experimental probes	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184140-2>
New silicon nanocrystal materials for photovoltaic applications ¤ This Ph.D. thesis addresses the deposition, characterization and improvement of Si nanocrystal layers embedded in a SiC matrix (Si NC/SiC) as future absorber material for top cells of an all-Si tandem solar cell. The required enlargement of the Si NC bandgap is aimed to achieve with the help of quantum confinement (QC). No unambiguous evidence of QC in Si NC/SiC samples were presented in the literature up to now. Even though this also was not possible during this Ph.D. thesis, some necessary preconditions for QC were successfully complied, which are a better understanding and control of the crystallization mechanism, size control of the Si NC and defect passivation. The deposition of amorphous SixC1-x:H layers was conducted by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. During the annealing step subsequent to layer deposition, H effusion, formation of Si NC, and crystallization of the SiC matrix occurs. All Si NC/SiC samples were subjected to a comprehensive structural and optical characterization. The application of grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared and Raman measurements to Si NC/SiC thin films were significantly improved during this work. The Si NC size control is an indispensable precondition for quantum confinement. For this purpose, two routes were proposed in this work. The Si NC size is shown to increase with increasing Si content of the SixC1-x:H layers. Thus, the Si NC size can be adjusted by adjusting the Si content. The advantage of this method is the fact that single layers can be deposited instead of multilayers (ML). The disadvantage is the uncontrollability of the Si NC spacing and the wide size distribution. The second route is with the help of a ML structure. Usually, Si NC/SiC ML structures show strong intermixing during the annealing step and are therefore not suitable for Si NC size control. In this work it is shown that the ML structure can be hindered from intermixing by oxygen incorporation during deposition.

Boundaries and belonging in the Greek community of Georgia ¤ BEGIN Georgia’s Greek minority defies conventional accounts of how language relates to national and religious identification. With two heritage languages, ‘Turkish’ Urum and Pontic ‘Greek’, its members are recognised as Greeks in Georgia but not always in Greece. Carefully following interviewees as they navigate intricate constellations of belonging amid the tidemarks of the Soviet past, this book offers new insights into conversational sense-making and explores the (un)making of boundaries as a complex, dynamic and context-dependent process. Concha Maria Höfler’s sensitive analysis will be equally valuable to linguistic ethnographers, border scholars and to anyone studying nationalism and identification in the post-Soviet space and beyond. Mit „türkischem“ Urum, pontischem „Griechisch“ und orthodox-christlichem Glauben unterläuft Georgiens griechische Minderheit gängige Erwartungen an das Verhältnis von Sprache und (nationaler) Identität. In Georgien als griechisch anerkannt, in Griechenland jedoch nicht unbedingt, bewegen sie sich in einem spannungsreichen Geflecht sozialer Konstellationen und (un)möglicher Zugehörigkeiten, geprägt von Spuren der sowjetischen Vergangenheit. In einer sorgfältigen ethnografisch informierten Konversationsanalyse untersucht die Autorin die Aushandlung komplexer sozialer Grenzen, Zugehörigkeiten und Positionierungen im Gespräch. Grenzziehungen und -auflösungen erweisen sich dabei als dynamische und kontextabhängige Prozesse. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022046-1>
Scenarios for Energy-Autonomous Mobility at the Example of the Lake Constance Region ¤ Using the example of the Lake Constance region, the thesis discusses whether and under what conditions the transport energy demand of a region can be completely covered by domestic, renewable sources. Several scenarios are being developed for this. It can be shown that a complete decarbonization of the transport system is possible if the necessary framework conditions are created in the next 5 to 10 years at the latest. Covering the transport energy demand with renewable energy sources from the region also appears possible under very favorable framework conditions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062954-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194332-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187835-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068598-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1123737371> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076605-6>
Ion-nanostructure interaction : comparing simulation and experiment towards surface structuring using nanoparticles ¤ Nanotechnology is a buzzword in context of the proceeding miniaturization of devices and their components. Nanoparticles (NPs) can nowadays easily be synthesized from different material compositions by different chemical and physical processes. However, most of these techniques work close to or at the thermal equilibrium. One subsequent approach to tune materials beyond equilibrium conditions is ion beam irradiation. An important effect of this approach is sputtering. Sputtering is enhanced in NPs compared to their bulk counterparts due to their large surface-to-volume ratio, especially when the ion range matches the NP size. In this work, the sputtering effects of Ar+ and Ga+ ion irradiated Au nanoparticles are investigated in detail by Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and a variety of experiments. The sputtering of Ar+ and Ga+ irradiated Au NPs was investigated as a function of ion energy, NP size and impact parameter by the MC code iradina and MD code parcas. The simulation results are directly compared to experiments using high resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of Au NPs on top of Si, whereat the sputter yields are significantly enhanced compared to the MC simulations. Additionally, the interaction of NPs and substrate were investigated by Rutherford backscatter spectrometry (RBS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). A new MC code was developed to study the redeposition of sputtered atoms of Ga+ irradiated Au NP arrays on neighboring NPs. The redeposition can lead to growth of NPs with diameters of 1 nm in vicinity of ~50 nm NP. These simulations are directly compared to an in situ experiment. Nanostructures, spherical NPs as well as nanowires (NWs) are used as irradiation masks to structure lithium niobate (LNO) using the ion beam enhanced etching (IBEE) technique. The aspect ratio of the obtained structures can be enhanced by a second IBEE step after annealing.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027606-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4342626-8>
Stochastic implied volatility : a factor-based model ¤ This book presents a factor-based model of the stochastic evolution of the implied volatility surface. The model allows for the integrated and consistent pricing and hedging, risk management, and trading of equity index derivatives as well as volatility derivatives. In the first part, the book develops a unifying theory for the analysis of contingent claims under both the real-world measure and the risk-neutral measure in an environment of stochastic implied volatility. On the basis of transaction data, the second part of the book provides extensive statistical analyses on the dynamics of the implied volatility surface of German DAX options and proposes a four-factor model to describe its evolution. The model is validated and tested on market data. The final part deals with potential applications of the model in the fields of exotic option pricing, value at risk, and volatility trading	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057633-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115453-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268390-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017195-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4266833-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4381572-8>
Source studies of small earthquakes in the AlpArray : CMT inversion, seismo-tectonic analysis and methodological developments ¤ Centroid moment tensor inversion can provide insight into ongoing tectonic processes and active faults. In the Alpine mountains (central Europe), challenges result from low signal-to-noise ratios of earthquakes with small to moderate magnitudes and complex wave propagation effects through the heterogeneous crustal structure of the mountain belt. In this thesis, I make use of the temporary installation of the dense AlpArray seismic network (AASN) to establish a work flow to study seismic source processes and enhance the knowledge of the Alpine seismicity. The cumulative thesis comprises four publications on the topics of large seismic networks, seismic source processes in the Alps, their link to tectonics and stress field, and the inclusion of small magnitude earthquakes into studies of active faults. Dealing with hundreds of stations of the dense AASN requires the automated assessment of data and metadata quality. I developed the open source toolbox AutoStatsQ to perform an automated data quality control. Its first application to the ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4603708-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015134-7>

Bifurcation analysis of microscopic follow-the-leader traffic models ¤ Traffic flow is an interesting phenomenon of our modern world. Although we all experience it daily, traffic flow is far from being well understood. It is a life science problem, since drivers do not usually act according to well defined rules. However, the increase of traffic in many areas and the related problems underline the importance of a realistic description of traffic flow or of some of its features. The mathematical modeling of traffic flow has a long tradition. Various approaches can be found in literature. A very common class of traffic models is the macroscopic one, where the traffic flow is described in terms of density and velocity distributions ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7531433-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160648-6>

Assessing, testing, and implementing socio-cultural valuation methods to operationalise ecosystem services in land use management ¤ Ecosystem services (ESs) are defined as the contributions that ecosystems make to human wellbeing and are increasingly being used as an approach to explore the importance of ecosystems for humans through their valuation. Although value plurality has been recognised long before the mainstreaming of ESs research, socio-cultural valuation is still underrepresented in ESs assessments. It is the central goal of this PhD dissertation to explore the ability of socio-cultural valuation methods for the operationalisation of ESs research in land management. To address this, I formulated three research objectives that are briefly outlined below and relate to the three studies conducted during this dissertation. The first objective relates to the assessment of the current role of socio-cultural valuation in ESs research. Human values are central to ESs research yet non-monetary socio-cultural valuation methods have been found underrepresented in the field of ESs science. In regard to the unbalanced consideration of value domains and conceptual uncertainties, I perform a systematic literature review aiming to answer the research question: To what extent have socio-cultural values been addressed in ESs assessments. ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4259046-2>

This thesis presents a study of the scalar sector in the standard model (SM), as well as various searches for an extended scalar sector in theories beyond the SM (BSM). The first part of the thesis details the search for an SM Higgs boson decaying to taus, and produced by gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, or associated production with a vector boson, leading to evidence for decays of the Higgs boson to taus. In turn, the second part highlights several searches for an extended scalar sector, with scalar boson decays to taus. In all of the analyses presented, at least one scalar boson decays to a pair of taus. The results draw on data collected by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector during proton–proton collisions with a center-of-mass energy of 7 or 8 TeV.

Accountability of international organizations and transnational corporations : a comparative analysis ¤ What does accountability of international organisations mean? What does it mean for transnational corporations? How can they be held accountable? This book analyses and compares the accountability frameworks of both types of institutions—their rationales, conceptualisations and mechanisms. To achieve this, it comprehensively examines two select institutions: the United Nations and Siemens. It presents their similarities and differences in detail, compares their accountability mechanisms and critically assesses their conceptualisations of accountability. To understand underlying structures, the book makes use of economic theories. It adopts and refines a procedural understanding of accountability originally developed in international relations and political science. Last but not least, this book examines to what extent accountability has become a legal concept and aims at contributing to the ongoing efforts of conceptualising ‘accountability’.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062547-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075092-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027366-0>
Localization of Bose-Einstein condensates in one-dimensional random potentials ¤ BEGIN Abstract: Within the present thesis, we investigate, analytically and numerically, the expansion of initially strongly confined wave packets in one-dimensional, correlated random potentials. In the first part, we focus on single-particle wave packets, i. e. without considering interactions between particles. At long times, the expansion of the wave packet comes to a halt due to destructive interferences leading to Anderson localization. The resulting stationary density profile has been measured in experiments on Bose-Einstein condensates in one-dimensional random potentials, but existing theories are unable to explain the behaviour of the density profile at the center. To improve this situation, we develop an analytical description for the disorder averaged localized density profile. For this purpose, we employ the diagrammatic method of Berezinskii, which we generalize to the case of wave packets, present an analytical expression of the localization length which is valid for small as well as for high energies and finally, develop a self-consistent Born approximation in order to analytically calculate the energy distribution of our wave packet. By comparison with numerical simulations, we show that our theory describes well the complete localized density profile, not only in the tails but also in the center. In the second part, we discuss the influence of interactions on the spatial expansion of Bose-Einstein condesates in one-dimensional random potentials. We show, by comparison with numerical data, that the quasi stationary state reached at intermediate times can be well described within the theory developed for the non-interacting case, provided that the interactions are taken into account through the choice of an effective initial state END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4402897-0>
