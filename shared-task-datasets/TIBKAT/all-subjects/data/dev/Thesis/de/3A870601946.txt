This thesis is about the establishment and the application of novel methods and tools that are re-lated to the most widely used enzyme class: hydrolases. It covers all fields from the identification to the application of these valuable enzymes with particular focus on lactonases, acylases and proteases. The activity assay introduced in Article I substantially extends the method toolbox for studies on lactonases and acylases that interfere with the bacterial cell-cell communication system. Article II describes a fully automatized robotic platform that represents the next-level tool for the high-throughput enzyme screening in the microtiter plate format. It was used, for instance, for the screening for improved porcine aminoacylase I variants. Diverse aspects of the protease-mediated hydrolysis of non-resistant proteins for the purification of resistant target proteins are highlighted in Article III.
