In the dissertation, own research on the modulation of emotional episodic long-term memory, especially on recognition memory performance and encoding- and retrieval-related event-related potentials (ERPs), is presented. Three ERP studies were conducted. The first study investigated spontaneous remembering of emotional events. In the second experiment, a crossover design for memory recognition studies was tested. The third study explored the noradrenergic influences on emotional memory. Next to discussing the results in the light existing findings and concepts (natural selective attention by Bradley & Lang and neuromodulation hypothesis by McGaugh), the obtained results are put in a broader context of emotional episodic long-term memory and the possible implications for clinical research are indicated.
