This book presents a comprehensive study in the field of advances in medical data science and contains carefully selected articles contributed by experts of information technology. Continuous growth of the amount of medical information and the variety of multimodal content necessitates the demand for a fast and reliable technology able to process data and deliver results in a user-friendly manner at the time and place the information is needed. Computational approaches for understanding human complexity, AI-powered applications in image and signal processing, bioinformatics, sound and motion as activity stimulus, joint activities in biomedical engineering and physiotherapy, disorder in children, selected comparative studies give new meaning to optimization of the functional requirements of the healthcare system for the benefit of the patients. It is an interdisciplinary collection of papers that have both theoretical and applied dimensions. It includes the following research areas: Computational methods for understanding human complexity Image and signal analysis Multidimensional medical data analysis Sound and motion Joint activities in biomedical engineering and physiotherapy This book is a great reference tool for scientists who deal with problems of designing and implementing information processing tools employed in systems that assist the clinicians, radiologists, and physiotherapists in patient diagnosis and treatment. It also serves students in exploring innovations in quantitative medical data analysis, data mining, and artificial intelligence.
