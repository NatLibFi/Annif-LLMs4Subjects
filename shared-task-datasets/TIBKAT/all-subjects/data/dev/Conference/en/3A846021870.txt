Building Information Modelling (BIM) in design, construction and operations
Building Information Modelling (BIM) in Design, Construction, and Operations contains the proceedings of the first in a planned series of conferences dealing with design coordination, construction, maintenance, operation and decommissioning. The book gives details of how BIM tools and techniques have fundamentally altered the manner in which modern construction teams operate, the processes through which designs are evolved, and the relationships between conceptual, detail, construction and life cycle stages. The papers contributed by experts from industry, practice and academia, debate key topics, develop innovative solutions, and predict future trends. The interdisciplinary nature of the contents and the collaborative practices discussed, so important within the built environment, will appeal to those engaged in design, surveying, visualisation, infrastructure, real estate, construction law, insurance, and facilities management. Topics covered include: BIM in Design Coordination; BIM in Construction Operations; BIM and Life Cycle Project Management; BIM and Collaborative Working and Practices; BIM-facilities Management Integration; Interoperability Issues and BIM; BIM-GIS Integration; BIM in Building Operation and Maintenance; BIM and Automation in Construction; BIM Standards; BIM and Sustainability; BIM and Cultural Heritage
