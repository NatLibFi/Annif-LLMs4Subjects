Mathematical Research Today and Tomorrow : Viewpoints of Seven Fields Medalists Lectures given at the Institut d'Estudis Catalans, Barcelona, Spain, June 1991
The Symposium on the Current State and Prospects of Mathematics was held in Barcelona from June 13 to June 18, 1991. Seven invited Fields medalists gavetalks on the development of their respective research fields. The contents of all lectures were collected in the volume, together witha transcription of a round table discussion held during the Symposium. All papers are expository. Some parts include precise technical statements of recent results, but the greater part consists of narrative text addressed to a very broad mathematical public. CONTENTS: R. Thom: Leaving Mathematics for Philosophy.- S. Novikov: Role of Integrable Models in the Development of Mathematics.- S.-T. Yau: The Current State and Prospects of Geometry and Nonlinear Differential Equations.- A. Connes: Noncommutative Geometry.- S. Smale: Theory of Computation.- V.
