Advanced Robot Control : Proceedings of the International Workshop on Nonlinear and Adaptive Control: Issues in Robotics, Grenoble, France, Nov. 21-23, 1990
Research in the area of adaptive control, nonlinear system and other advanced control techniques have been carried out in parallel and rather independently. In the last few years, these techniques have been used to improve robot motion accuracy. The aim of the workshop is to present the most recent contributions in the field of robot control and to compare how these advanced control techniques have been used to solve similar problems. The topics covered include: Adaptation and learning.- Control of systems with nonholonomic constraints (mobile robots).- Robot control in the task space.- Control of flexible robots (joints and structure).- Observer-based control.- Control through kinematic singularities
