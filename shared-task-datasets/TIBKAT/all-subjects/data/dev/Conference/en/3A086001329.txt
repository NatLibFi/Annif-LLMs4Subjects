Annotation This book examines the research and theoretical bases for the creation of a risk-needs management instrument for violent adolescents and young adults. The proposed instrument includes risk indicators beginning pre-natally, pari-natally, at-birth, then through infancy, early childhood, middle childhood and, finally, adolescence. The main purpose of the instrument is to assist case managers responsible for providing positive interventions to families and children, at all childhood and adolescent life stages, in order to reduce the likelihood of violent behaviors. The case intervention strategy is based on the assumption that the earlier resources are provided, the more effective they will be. The data instrument will be structured so that the risk information is gathered cumulatively across age domains and can be used to match specific interventions with particular needs profiles of a family and child, adolescent or young adult. This book is of interest to researchers, policy-makers and government and non-government agency workers who are involved with policies, programs and instruments focused on the prevention of youth and young adult violence. It can be used as an advanced text book in upper level undergraduate courses and graduate courses in psychology, criminology, social work and educational counseling which deal with the child and youth violence, especially its causes and preventive interventions
