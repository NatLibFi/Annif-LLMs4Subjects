Solitons and Chaos
"Solitons and Chaos" is a response to the growing interest in systems exhibiting these two complementary manifestations of nonlinearity. The papers cover a wide range of topics but share common mathematical notions and investigation techniques. An introductory note on eight concepts of integrability has been added as a guide for the uninitiated reader. Both specialists and graduate students will find this update on the state ofthe art useful. Key points: chaos vs. integrability; solitons: theory and applications; dissipative systems; Hamiltonian systems; maps and cascades; direct vs. inverse methods; higher dimensions; Lie groups, Painleve analysis, numerical algorithms; pertubation methods
