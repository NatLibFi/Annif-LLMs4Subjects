Traffic and Granular Flow '11
This book continues the biannual series of conference proceedings, which has become a classical reference resource in traffic and granular research alike. It addresses new developments at the interface between physics, engineering and computational science. Complex systems, where many simple agents, be they vehicles or particles, give rise to surprising and fascinating phenomena.  The contributions collected in these proceedings cover several research fields, all of which deal with transport. Topics include highway, pedestrian and internet traffic, granular matter, biological transport, transport networks, data acquisition, data analysis and technological applications. Different perspectives, i.e. modeling, simulations, experiments and phenomenological observations, are considered.
Part I: Highway and urban vehicular traffic -- Part II: Pedestrian traffic and evacuation dynamics -- Part III: Granular flow -- Part IV: Traffic networks and Intelligent Traffic Systems.
