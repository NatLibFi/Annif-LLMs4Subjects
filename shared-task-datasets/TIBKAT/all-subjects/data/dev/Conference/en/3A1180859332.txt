Satellite altimetry for geodesy, geophysics and oceanography : proceedings of the International Workshop on Satellite Altimetry, a joint workshop of IAG Section III Special Study Group SSG3.186 and IAG Section II, September 8 - 13, 2002, Wuhan, China; [with CD-ROM]
This volume covers a broad range of altimetry applications, including marine gravity and geoid, sea level change, ocean tide modeling, ocean circulations, marine plate tectonics, mesoscale eddies and bathymetry predictions. Virtually all disciplines of earth sciences are touched upon through the technique of satellite altimetry. Readers will find useful data processing techniques and novel applications of satellite altimetry, which otherwise are scattered in journals and special books.
