Innovation, evolution and economic change : new ideas in the tradition of Galbraith
pt. 1. Changing capitalism : shareholders versus managers -- pt. 2. Globalized technostructures : towards a theory of the corrupt corporation -- pt. 3. Chartering the future : innovation, state power and the market system
The book begins with a penetrating analysis of the main features of today's capitalism and in particular the conflict between shareholders and managers. It moves on to focus on the consequences of globalization in the decision-making processes of large corporations and represents an important step in the development of a theory of fraud and corruption within corporations. In the final part, the authors address and explore the consequences of the domination of influential groups over major social and political decisions, on the blurred boundaries between the public and the private sectors and its consequences in the fields of technological regulation and the evolution of public services. In so doing, the authors question the meaning and power of democracy in today's society
