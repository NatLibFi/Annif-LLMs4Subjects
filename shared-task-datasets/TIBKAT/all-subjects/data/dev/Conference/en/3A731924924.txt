Bildbau. Schweizer Architektur im Fokus der Fotografie : [Ausstellung]
This book offers a panorama of the past twenty-five years of Swiss architecture. Iconic buildings that have contributed to the global success of Swiss architecture are presented not in plans and models, but solely in photographs. These enable artistic positions to enter into dialogue with architecture photography. This publication contains exemplary photography, while its analytical section highlights the mediatisation of architecture. What role do images play in architectural design? Which architects prefer which photographers? How is architecture translated into images? This is an exciting examination of how we perceive and document architecture
