Trends in Colloid and Interface Science XV
The 14th Conference of the European Colloid and Interface Society (ECIS 2000) was held in September 2000, in Patras, GREECE. Researchers from the academia and the industrial sector met and presented research work divided in nine thematic sections: molecular interactions in thin films, polymer-surfactant interactions, structure and dynamics at interfaces, biocolloids, colloids in pharmaceutical and biological applications, new trends in colloid and interface science techniques, rheology, self assembly of amphiphiles and measurements in concentrated suspensions. Selected contributions from these thematic areas are presented in the present volume and show the up today achievements of the Colloid and Interface Science
