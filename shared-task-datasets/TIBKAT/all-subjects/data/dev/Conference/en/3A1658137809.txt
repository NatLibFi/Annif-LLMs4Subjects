Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis : Israel Seminar (GAFA) 2014â€“2016
As in the previous Seminar Notes, the current volume reflects general trends in the study of Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis, understood in a broad sense. A classical theme in the Local Theory of Banach Spaces which is well represented in this volume is the identification of lower-dimensional structures in high-dimensional objects. More recent applications of high-dimensionality are manifested by contributions in Random Matrix Theory, Concentration of Measure and Empirical Processes. Naturally, the Gaussian measure plays a central role in many of these topics, and is also studied in this volume; in particular, the recent breakthrough proof of the Gaussian Correlation Conjecture is revisited. The interplay of the theory with Harmonic and Spectral Analysis is also well apparent in several contributions. The classical relation to both the primal and dual Brunn-Minkowski theories is also well represented, and related algebraic structures pertaining to valuations and valent functions are discussed. All contributions are original research papers and were subject to the usual refereeing standards
