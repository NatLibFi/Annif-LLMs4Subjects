Under the direction of Nobel laureate Robert A. Mundell and Paul J. Zak, eminent contributors to Monetary Stability and Economic Growth offer a unique insight into the way that economists analyse the causes of money (mis) management in the US, Latin America, Europe and Japan, and prescribe stabilising reforms. Their lively discussion provides answers to various questions including: How does monetary stability affect economic growth?; How can nations best achieve monetary stability?; hen is monetary union desirable?; Which anchors for monetary stability are likely to be most effective?; How will the euro affect financial markets and the international monetary system?; Is international monetary reform possible, and how can it be achieved?
