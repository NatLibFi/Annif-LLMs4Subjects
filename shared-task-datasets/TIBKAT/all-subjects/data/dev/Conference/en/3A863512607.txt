Migrations in the German lands, 1500-2000
"Migration to, from, and within German-speaking lands has been a dynamic force in Central European history for centuries. Exemplifying some of the most exciting recent research on historical mobility, the essays collected here reconstruct the experiences of vagrants, laborers, religious exiles, refugees, and other migrants during the last five hundred years of German history. With diverse contributions ranging from early modern martyrdom to post-Cold War commemoration efforts, this volume identifies revealing commonalities shared by different eras while also placing the German case within the broader contexts of European and global migration; 'This well-edited, well-written volume represents an important contribution to migration history. Its distinctiveness lies both in its focus on immigration to and within Germany--as opposed to German emigration to other lands--and its unusually broad chronological range, including a welcome emphasis on the early modern period'--James Melton, Emory University." - From publisher's website
