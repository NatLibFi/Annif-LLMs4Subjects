Data Analysis and Information Systems : Statistical and Conceptual Approaches Proceedings of the 19th Annual Conference of the Gesellschaft für Klassifikation e.V. University of Basel, March 8–10, 1995
This volume presents methods for the analysis of quantitative and qualitative data, and for the processing and ordering of symbolic or linguistic information. The 45 papers combine methods from exploratory and inferential statistics with mathematical and numerical approaches, investigate conceptual classification and ordering structures and describe recent developments for knowledge-based information systems. The contributions are grouped into seven chapters: 1. Classification and Clustering, 2. Uncertainty and Fuzziness, 3. Methods of Data Analysis and Applications, 4. Statistical Models and Methods, 5. Bayesian Learning, 6. Conceptual Classification, Knowledge Ordering and Information Systems, 7. Linguistics and Dialectometry
