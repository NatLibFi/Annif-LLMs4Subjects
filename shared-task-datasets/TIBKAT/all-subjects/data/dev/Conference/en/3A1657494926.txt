3rd International Symposium of Space Optical Instruments and Applications : Beijing, China June 26 - 29th 2016
This volume contains selected and expanded contributions presented at the 3rd Symposium on Space Optical Instruments and Applications in Beijing, China June 28 â€“ 29, 2016. This conference series is organised by the Sino-Holland Space Optical Instruments Laboratory, a cooperation platform between China and the Netherlands. The symposium focused on key technological problems of optical instruments and their applications in a space context. It covered the latest developments, experiments and results regarding theory, instrumentation and applications in space optics. The book is split across five topical sections. The first section covers space optical remote sensing system design, the second advanced optical system design, the third remote sensor calibration and measurement. Remote sensing data processing and information extraction is then presented, followed by a final section on remote sensing data applications. .
Space optical remote sensing system design -- Advanced optical system design -- Remote sensor calibration and measurement -- Remote sensing data processing and information extraction -- Remote sensing data applications. .
