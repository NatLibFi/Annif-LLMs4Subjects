Innovation and technological change in Eastern Europe : pathways to industrial recovery
Research suggests that innovation and technological change are crucial for the economic recovery of the former centrally planned countries in Central and Eastern Europe. This book analyses the development of innovation systems and technology policy in this region from various perspectives, demonstrating not only its importance but also its complexity. Included in the book are discussions on: * the process of transforming the innovation systems in Central and Eastern Europe * a comparison of R&D between 'East' and 'West' * gradualism versus 'Big Bang' as the preferable strategy for reform * innovation at the firm level * productivity and competitiveness * the ability to identify and exploit external knowledge in adopting up-to-date technology The authors conclude that rebuilding innovation systems in Central and Eastern Europe will require considerable time, and that there is no 'best practice' or ideal strategy which can be clearly recommended. This book will be warmly welcomed by scholars working in the fields of transition studies, innovation and technology, as well as policy makers involved in designing technology policy in transition economies
