New Trends in HERA Physics 1999 : Proceedings of the Ringberg Workshop Held at Tegernsee, Germany, 30 May â€“ 4 June 1999
Experts on elementary-particle physics, both theorists and experimentalists, met to present their latest results on the various aspects of HERA physics, specifically, the H1 and ZEUS collaborations at HERA and the collaborations at LEP and the Tevatron were presented. The topics included: proton structure function; polarized ep scattering; final states in deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), with special emphasis on jet production at low x, power corrections in DIS, soft particle production, and instanton effects; photon structure function; photoproduction of jets and hadrons; heavy-flavour and charmonium production; elastic and diffractive ep scattering; and new physics at HERA
