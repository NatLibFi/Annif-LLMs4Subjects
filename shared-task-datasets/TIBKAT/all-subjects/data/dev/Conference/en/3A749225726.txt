Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control : Third International Workshop, HSCC 2000 Pittsburgh, PA, USA, March 23-25, 2000 Proceedings
This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control, HSCC 2000, held in Pittsburgh, PA, USA in March 2000. The 32 revised full papers presented together with abstracts of four invited talks were carefully reviewed and selected from a total of 71 papers submitted. The focus of the works presented is on modeling, control, synthesis, design and verification of hybrid systems. Among the application areas covered are control of electromechanical systems, air traffic control, control of automated freeways, and chemical process control
