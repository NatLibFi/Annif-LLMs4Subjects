Software engineering, artificial intelligence, networking and parallel/distributed computing 2022-Winter
This edited book presents scientific results of the 24th ACIS International Winter Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD2022-Summer) which was held on December 7-9, 2022, at Taichung, Taiwan.  The aim of this conference was to bring together researchers and scientists, businessmen and entrepreneurs, teachers, engineers, computer users, and students to discuss the numerous fields of computer science and to share their experiences and exchange new ideas and information in a meaningful way.  The conference organizers selected the best papers from those papers accepted for presentation at the workshop. The papers were chosen based on review scores submitted by members of the program committee and underwent further rigorous rounds of review. From this second round of review, 15 of the most promising papers are then published in this Springer (SCI) book and not the conference proceedings
