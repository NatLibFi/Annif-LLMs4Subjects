The rise of China and India : impacts, prospects and implications
The rise of China and India is rapidly reshaping the world economy, with far-reaching implications for every national and regional government, business community, and individual citizen. Arising from the UNU-WIDER research project 'Southern Engines of Global Growth', this volume explores the foundations of China and India's development experiences and strategies, and how these can provide practical lessons to other economies. It examines the patterns of productivity, international trade and investment inflows, and comparatively analyses the prospects, driving forces and implications of the rise of China and India as economic and political giants. This book is indispensable reading for all interested in development economics and international economics and politics. It also provides valuable lessons for other developing countries in the pursuit of poverty reduction, sustainable growth and innovative development strategies
