The regulation of international financial markets : perspectives for reform
At present primarily governed by market forces with little regulatory interference, international financial relations have become increasingly important for global as well as national economies. Contributors to this volume consider whether this absence of regulation is wise, in the light of recent financial crises. This book accordingly presents a framework for an analysis of the options in regulating international financial markets from the perspective of public international law. The volume will be of interest to scholars and practitioners involved with comparative public law, constitutional economics and financial regulation.
