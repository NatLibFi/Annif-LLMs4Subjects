Distribution logistics : advanced solutions to practical problems ; [... presented at the IWDL 7 in Grainau, Germany, in October 2002]
The complexibility of distribution systems is augmented by various trends: the globalization of the business of most manufacturers, the increasing dynamics of the customer demands and the reverse flows within closed-loop systems. The need for "advanced" planning methods, based on quantitative optimization, increases in practice. The book takes up the challenges of these developments. It presents recent results and case studies of a group of researchers meeting regularly at the IWDL (International Workshop on Distribution Logistics). The topics covered are the design of distribution networks, vehicle routing, warehousing and reverse logistics. It includes a comprehensive review of more than 60 case studies in reverse logistics.
