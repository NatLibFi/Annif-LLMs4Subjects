Advances in condition monitoring of machinery in non-stationary operations : proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Condition Monitoring of Machinery in Non-Stationary Operations, CMMNO'2018, 20-22 June 2018, Santander, Spain
This book is aimed at researchers, industry professionals and students interested in the broad ranges of disciplines related to condition monitoring of machinery working in non-stationary conditions. Each chapter, accepted after a rigorous peer-review process, reports on a selected, original piece of work presented and discussed at the International Conference on Condition Monitoring of Machinery in Non-stationary Operations, CMMNOâ€™2018, held on June 20 - 22, 2018, in Santander, Spain. The book describes both theoretical developments and a number of industrial case studies, which cover different topics, such as: noise and vibrations in machinery, conditioning monitoring in non-stationary operations, vibro-acoustic diagnosis of machinery, signal processing, application of pattern recognition and data mining, monitoring and diagnostic systems, faults detection, dynamics of structures and machinery, and mechatronic machinery diagnostics
