Architecture and collective life
New geography and the planners -- Authority -- The welfare state -- Autonomy and organisation -- Practice and life.
"This book addresses the complex relationship between architecture and public life. It's a study of architecture and urbanism as cultural activity that both reflects and gives shape to our social relations, public institutions and political processes. Written by an international range of contributors the chapters address the intersection of public life and the built environment around the themes of authority and planning, the welfare state, place and identity and autonomy. The book covers a diverse range of material from Foucault's evolving thoughts on space to land-scraping leisure centres in Post-War Belgium. It unpacks concepts such as 'community' and 'collectivity' alongside themes of self-organisation and authorship. Architecture and Collective Life reflects on urban and architectural practice and historical, political and social change. As such this book will be of great interest to students and academics in architecture and urbanism as well as practicing architects"--
