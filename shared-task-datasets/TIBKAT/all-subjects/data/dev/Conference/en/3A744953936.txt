Self-Adaptive Software: Applications : Second International Workshop, IWSAS 2001 Balatonfüred, Hungary, May 17-19, 2001 Revised Papers
The 18 revised full papers presented in this book together with an introductory&nbsp;survey were carefully reviewed and constitute&nbsp;the documentation of the Second International Workshop on Self-adaptive Software, IWSAS 2001, held in Balatonfüred, Hungary in May 2001. Self-adaptive software evaluates its own behavior and changes it when the evaluation indicates that the software does not accomplish what it is intended to do or when better functionality or better performance is possible. The self-adaptive approach in software engineering builds on well known dynamic features familiar to Lisp or Java programmes and aims at improving the robustness of software systems by gradually adding new features of self-adaption or autonomy
