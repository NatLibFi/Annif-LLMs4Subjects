Creation and governance of human genetic research databases : [report of the Workshop on Human Genetic Research Databases - Issues of Privacy and Security, 26 & 27 February 2004, Tokyo, Japan]
Scientists have known for years that complex diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, arise from a combination of lifestyle, environmental, genetic and random factors. Large-scale study of populations may contribute significantly to science's understanding of the complex multi-factorial basis of disease and to improvements in prevention, detection, diagnosis, treatment and cure. As a result of developments in biotechnology and bioinformatics, the opportunity to store and analyse increasingly large amounts of genetic data have rendered possible the creation of large-scale population databases. Genetic research, involving the use of such databases containing human genetic and genomic data, information, and biological samples, is thus becoming increasingly feasible.
