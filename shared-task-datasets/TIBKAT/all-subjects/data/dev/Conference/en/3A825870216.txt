Tribological research and design for engineering systems
These papers represent the proceedings from the 29th Leeds-Lyon Symposium on Tribology, 'Tribological Research and Design for Engineering Systems' which was held in September 2002. Over 130 delegates from 18 countries attended the symposium, and the extensive discussions generated over 150 written questions and responses, which are documented at the end of this proceedings volume. There have been many advances in the field of tribology in recent years, with progress being made in the engineering and interaction of surfaces; micro and nano-tribology; elastohydrodynamics; surface films; surface texture; tribochemistry; wear and life prediction; with both experimental and theoretical contributions. These advances were reviewed, and the impact of this understanding on the fundamentals upon total engineering activity in design, manufacture and machine operation were considered.
