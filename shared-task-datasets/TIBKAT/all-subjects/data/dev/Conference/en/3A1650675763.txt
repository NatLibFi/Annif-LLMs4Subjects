Nanoscale Spectroscopy and Its Applications to Semiconductor Research
Fabrication technologies for nanostructured devices have be- en developed recently, and the electrical and optical pro- perties of such nanostructures are a subject of advanced re- search. This book describes the different approaches to spectroscopic microscopy, i.e., electron beam probe spec- troscopy, spectroscopic photoelectron microscopy, and scan- ning probe spectroscopy. It will be useful as a compact source of reference for the experienced researcher, taking into account at the same time the needs of postgraduate stu- dents and nonspecialist researchers by using a tutorial ap- proach throughout.
