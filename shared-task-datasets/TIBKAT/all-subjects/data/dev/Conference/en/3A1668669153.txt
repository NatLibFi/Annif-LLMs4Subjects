Postcolonialism cross-examined : multidirectional perspectives on imperial and colonial pasts and the neocolonial present
"Taking a strikingly interdisciplinary and global approach, Postcolonialism Cross-Examined reflects on the current status of postcolonial studies and attempts to break through traditional boundaries, creating a truly comparative and genuinely global phenomenon. Drawing together the field of mainstream postcolonial studies with post-Soviet postcolonial studies and studies of the late Ottoman Empire, the contributors in this volume question many of the concepts and assumptions we have become accustomed to in postcolonial studies, creating a fresh new version of the field. Divided into 3 main sections: Defending the Postcolonial Territory; Political Positions in Light of Unchanged Symmetries; Towards a Multidirectional Approach to the Postcolonial, the contributors look at topics such as humanism, nationalism, multiculturalism, nostalgia and the Anthropocene in order to piece together a new, broader vision for postcolonial studies in the twenty-first century." --
