Resistance : subjects, representations, contexts
All around the world and throughout history resistance has played an important role - and it still does. Some strive to raise it to cause change. Some dare not speak of it. Some try to smother it to keep a status quo. The contributions to this volume explore phenomena of resistance in a range of historical and contemporary environments. In so doing, they not only contribute to shaping a comparative view on subjects, representations, and contexts of resistance, but also open up a theoretical dialogue on terms and concepts of resistance both in and across different disciplines. With contributions by Micha Brumlik, Peter McLaren, Gayatri C. Spivak and others
