Lotta Westerh√§ll (Lund) examines the changes initiated by EU law to the Swedish legislation. Ludwik Florek (Warsaw) outlines the given relation on social security between Poland and the EU. Philippe Langlois (Paris) outlines a model on the coordination of employees' pensions. Danny Pieters (Leuven) clarifies the role of third states nationals in the EU coordination regime. Reports and analyses of the book offer insights into scopes of action and structuring prospects.
