Transatlantic democracy in the twentieth century : transfer and transformation
Transatlantic Democracy in the Twentieth Century refers to much more than a US mission in Europe after the two world wars or the re-education of the German populace at the end of the countryâ€™s "Sonderweg." Following the Cold War and the apparent absolute victory of the Western model, the debate over democracy has been reinvigorated by the challenges of post-democracy and populism, thus reshaping our understanding of transatlantic history.
Transatlantic democracy in the 20th century - this concept goes beyond the idea of an American civilizing mission in Europe after two World Wars, and certainly beyond the notion of re-educating Germans, and making them fit for Western institutions after Nazism. As democracy is being contested anew in the beginning of the 21st century, a much more complicated landscape of democracy since 1900 emerges. Transfer was not a one-way-street, and patterns of conflict and transformation affected both American and European political societies. American democracy may not be reduced to a resilient defense of original traditions, while the narrative of German democracy is more than redemption from catastrophe. The essays in this volume contribute to a new history of transatlantic democracy that accounts for its manifold experiences and constant renegotiations, up to the current challenges of American and European populism.
