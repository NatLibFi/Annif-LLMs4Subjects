Electron-Electron Correlation Effects in Low-Dimensional Conductors and Superconductors
This volume presents lectures on new approaches to electron-electron and electron-phonon correlation effects in low-dimensional materials: organic solids, conducting polymers such as polyacetylenes (CH)x, organic and copper-oxide superconductors with high Tc values. Key points: correlation effects in optical spectra, magnetic properties, nonlinear processes, electrons in 1-d and 2-d solids and their molecular components, new approaches to 1-d and 2-d Hubbard models, Peierls model, multi-configurational approach to large systems, calculation of Madelung energy in complex crystals, quantum field model, kink effects in optical spectra of high Tc superconductors. Researchers in the fields of solid state physics and superconductivity will find this collection of papers particularly useful
