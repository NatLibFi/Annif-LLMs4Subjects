Karl Friedrich Schinkel, 1781 - 1841, the drama of architecture : [in conjunction with the exhibition "Karl Friedrich Schinkel, 1781 - 1841: the Drama of Architecture", organized by the Art Institute of Chicago and presented October 29, 1994, through January 2, 1995]
Neoclassicism’s most prominent exponent in Prussia, Karl Friedrich Schinkel is revered today for his reshaping of Berlin as Prussia’s capital, and for catalyzing the Greek Revival in Germany. Most of Berlin’s most famous Neoclassical structures are his doing--the Neue Wache, the Schauspielhaus, the Gendarmenmarkt and the Altes Museum, for example. His Bauakademie of 1836 is even considered by many to foreshadow the austerity and clean lines of German Modernist architecture. But Schinkel is equally revered for his legacy of architectural drawing and unbuilt works, gathered (from the Schinkel archives) herein, making this book the definitive Schinkel primer.
