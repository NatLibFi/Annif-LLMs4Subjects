Brainlesion: glioma, multiple sclerosis, stroke and traumatic brain injuries / Spyridon Bakas, Alessandro Crimi, Ujjwal Baid, Sylwia Malec, Monika Pytlarz, Bhakti Baheti, Maximilian Zenk, Reuben Dorent, editors ; [Part 1]
This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 8th International MICCAI Brainlesion Workshop, BrainLes 2022, as well as the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge, the Brain Tumor Sequence Registration (BraTS-Reg) Challenge, the Cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (CrossMoDA) Challenge, and the Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) Challenge. These were held jointly at the Medical Image Computing for Computer Assisted Intervention Conference, MICCAI 2022, in September 2022. The 46 revised full papers presented in these volumes were selected form 65 submissions.The presented contributions describe the research of computational scientists and clinical researchers working on brain lesions - specifically glioma, multiple sclerosis, cerebral stroke, traumatic brain injuries, vestibular schwannoma, and white matter hyper-intensities of presumed vascular origin
