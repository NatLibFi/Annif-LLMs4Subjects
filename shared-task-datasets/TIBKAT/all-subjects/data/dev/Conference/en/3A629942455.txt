New trends in electrical engineering, automatic control, computing and communication sciences : [extended versions of selected papers presented at the 2008 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control (CCE '2008), which took place in Mexico City, MÃ©xico during 12 - 14 November, 2008]
"The presented collection of contributions is intended for professionals as well as postgraduate students in electrical and control engineering, experts in communication science and for computer scientists. The book also contains a motivating material for researchers in applied mathematics and modern computational engineering. The reader who wishes not only to gain access to the main results in this book but also to follow the formal constructions will require the graduate-level knowledge in the corresponding disciplines. With this prerequisite, an advance course in electrical engineering, automatic control or in communication/computer science can be based upon this monograph. The papers collection can be used as an additional textbook for PhD student majoring in the above areas of engineering and also serves as a substantial reference for researchers."--Back cover
