SPIN Model Checking and Software Verification : 7th International SPIN Workshop, Stanford, CA, USA, August 30 - September 1, 2000. Proceedings
This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 7th International SPIN Workshop, SPIN 2000, held in Stanford, California in August/September 2000. This book is devoted to automata-based explicit-state model checking technologies for the analysis and verification of asynchronous concurrent and distributed systems. The SPIN model checker is one of the most powerful systems of this kind and has attracted a large user community. The 17 revised full papers presented together with three tutorial contributions were carefully reviewed and selected from 31 submissions. The book competently presents the state of the art in SPIN model checking
