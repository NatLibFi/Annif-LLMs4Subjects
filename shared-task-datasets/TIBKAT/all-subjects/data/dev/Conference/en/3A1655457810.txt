Computer Intensive Methods in Statistics
The computer has created new fields in statistics. Numerical and statisticalproblems that were unattackable five to ten years ago can now be computed even on portable personal computers. A computer intensive task is for example the numerical calculation of posterior distributions in Bayesiananalysis. The Bootstrap and image analysis are two other fields spawned by the almost unlimited computing power. It is not only the computing power through that has revolutionized statistics, the graphical interactiveness on modern statistical invironments has given us the possibility for deeper insight into our data. This volume discusses four subjects in computer intensive statistics as follows: - Bayesian Computing - Interfacing Statistics - Image Analysis - Resampling Methods
