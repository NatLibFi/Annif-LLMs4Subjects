Mehrsprachigkeit als Ressource in der Schriftlichkeit
"This volume examines the benefits of competency in one language (typically one's mother tongue) in learning another language (typically a second language). The thesis that multilingualism is a resource for the dissemination of knowledge is elucidated empirically and in an applied perspective. A focus is placed on the issue of literacy, which includes, among other things, writing skills."
