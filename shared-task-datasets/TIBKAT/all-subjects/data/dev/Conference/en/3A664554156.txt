Modern Aspects of the Theory of Partial Differential Equations : [a collection of papers ... a number of them stem from plenary and invited session lectures presented at the 7th International ISAAC Congress which was held at Imperial College London in the period 13â€“18 July 2009]
The book provides a quick overview of a wide range of active research areas in partial differential equations. The book can serve as a useful source of information to mathematicians, scientists and engineers. The volume contains contributions from authors from a large variety of countries on different aspects of partial differential equations, such as evolution equations and estimates for their solutions, control theory, inverse problems, nonlinear equations, elliptic theory on singular domains, numerical approaches.
