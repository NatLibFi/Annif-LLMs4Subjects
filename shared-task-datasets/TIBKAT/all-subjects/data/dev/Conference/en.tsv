On the Move : 90 Years of Hamburg U-Bahn ; Museum of Work ; [Exhibition On the Move, 90 Years of Hamburg U-Bahn from February 15 to September 1, 2002] ¤ This exhibition shows a side of the Hamburg U-Bahn A.G. - the history of the U-Bahn in Hamburg. For 90 years, it has shaped the face of the city. A subway that in Hamburg did not only run and drive in tunnels, but for the most part of the tracks above ground, over bridges, viaducts, dams. An electrically operated means of transport that at the beginning of the century stood out more than any other for the modernity of the metropolis. It appeared at the beginning with spectacular architecture and changed the perception of the city. The users of the U-Bahn had to get used to the tempo of the means of transport, first learn to deal with the narrowness and foreignness on the platforms and in the trains. The other side of the U-Bahn operation are the people who have maintained it daily for 90 years: U-Bahn drivers, switchmen, electricians, workshop workers in the wagon halls and on the track - they are presented in portraits and objects of their work.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078569-5>
Media Law in the Media Upheaval: Young Science on Industrial Property Protection, Copyright, and Media Law ¤ The present volume documents the results and discussion contributions of the first Assistant Conference Green Area, which took place on June 17 and 18, 2016 at the University of Cologne. Media law problems are discussed around the breakthrough into a European digital economy. Young researchers examine different questions and problems that arise with the digitalization of life worlds, such as linking and framing, the practical significance of the new General Data Protection Regulation, the consequences and opportunities of a right to be forgotten, copyright in the digital age, and possibilities for informational self-determination	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062127-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4196910-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074661-6>
Teamwork: Concepts and Experiences - A Group Dynamics Interim Balance ¤ Even more professional, faster, better coordinated and controlled - and even more project-oriented and goal-oriented work. There are only a few organizations and companies that can still avoid this. To achieve the mentioned goals, product boards, management circles, project teams or semi-autonomous working groups are created. Accordingly, teamwork ability is required in almost every job posting. And the trend towards teamwork seems unbroken. Nevertheless, uncertainty prevails in many places about the actual effects of teamwork and the question of the ratio of effort and benefit is repeatedly asked, because: teamwork can be experienced better than described and better described than measured.

Universalistische Moral and cosmopolitan education : the challenge of globalization in the horizon of modern evolutionary research ; [...Conference on the topic "Universalistische Moral and cosmopolitan education" at the end of September 1999 at the University of the Federal Armed Forces in Hamburg...] ¤ Are there universal standards by which education can orient itself, and are people at all able to move appropriately cognitively and emotionally in a world society? These are just some of the questions that are discussed and dealt with in the contributions of the present volume - which originated from a scientific conference in the autumn of 1999 at the University of the Federal Armed Forces in Hamburg. The common starting point is the search for a theory that makes it possible to describe the complex anthropological and sociological phenomena in a globalized society equally well!	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189574-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006650-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033542-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4245398-7>
Under the Linden Tree and before the Emperor: New Perspectives on Court Diversity and Court Landscapes in the Holy Roman Empire ¤ The jurisdiction of the pre-modern era was characterized by a nearly unmanageable multitude of courts of various rulers and social groups. While the reception of Roman law and the introduction of learned jurists increasingly professionalized and institutionalized the administration of justice, new bodies of jurisdiction arose due to the establishment of territorial instances and the founding of new universities. The contributions of this volume discuss content-related and methodological approaches that enable the systematic analysis of pre-modern court diversity and the derivation of generalizable insights from comparative considerations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020342-6>
Night fever : Design and Club Culture : 1960-today ¤ Nightclubs and discotheques are epicenters of pop culture. Since the beginning of the 20th century, avant-garde groups have gathered here, challenging social norms and exploring other levels of reality. Many clubs become total works of art, where interior architecture and furniture design, print graphics and art, light and music, fashion and performance come together in a unique way. With the book Night Fever. Design and Club Culture 1960 – today, a comprehensive overview of the architecture and design history of the nightclub is presented for the first time. Richly illustrated with images of club interiors, posters, flyers, protagonists of nightlife and their fashion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011510-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040802-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072819-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114333-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136649-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151276-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171053-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039792-0>
Forced Labor in National Socialism: Companion Volume to the Exhibition ¤ For the first time, the NS forced labor is documented in its pan-European dimension as a racist societal crime. The exhibition 'Forced Labor in National Socialism' tells the entire history of NS forced labor and its consequences after 1945 for the first time. It shows that forced labor was a mass phenomenon: more than 20 million people had to perform forced labor for Nazi Germany in occupied Europe and the German Reich during World War II. The exhibition highlights how forced labor was part of the racist societal order of the NS state from the beginning: the propagated 'people's community' and the forced labor of the excluded - both belonged together. The volume documents the exhibition in its essential features and presents numerous long unknown historical photos and documents. Additional scientific essays provide a deeper insight into the research on the history of NS forced labor as well as the Weimar 'Gauforum', where the newly opened Museum Forced Labor in National Socialism is located. The sections dealt with are: Acclimation. Violence and exclusion before the war (1933-1939), Radicalization. Forced labor in occupied Europe (from 1939), Mass phenomenon. Forced labor in the German Reich (1942-1945), Liberation. Processing and consequences of forced labor, Damaged justice On May 8, 2024, the 'Museum Forced Labor in National Socialism' will open in the former Gauforum in Weimar under the auspices of the Foundation Memorials Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139439-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041316-0>

Religious Identities in a Globalized World ¤ How do religious communities shape their identity? Under the conditions of migration and an increasingly globalized world, they are increasingly under pressure and in motion. When divergent identities meet, new constellations of encounter and networking emerge. At the same time, the need for demarcation grows. Religion can no longer be thought of as fixed locally, regionally, or even nationally. Content contours shift, new and novel connections emerge, boundaries are questioned, broken, and redefined. The theological and philosophical contributions of this volume ask about religious identities in a globalized world. Authors from all continents discuss various aspects of the topic: from dealing with 'sacred scriptures' to religious learning processes to the relationship between religion and gender. The volume is based on the International Theological Study Days of the Catholic-Theological Faculty in June 2016.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121584-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138430-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4557997-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4354651-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4732948-8>
Evaluating Urban Renewal Successfully ¤ The transformation of cities and regions is today one of the great challenges in Germany. Economic structural breaks, demographic change, the competition of regions in the knowledge society and the requirements of the guiding image of sustainable development are at the same time driving forces and cornerstones of the changes. Since the beginning of the new millennium, urban renewal has been carried out with high public funding and great political presence, first in the east, then also in the west of the Federal Republic. In addition to politics and administration, a large number of residents, companies and associations are affected or involved. But are all activities really goal-oriented? Is the expenditure justified? Does public and private action also produce the desired effects? These questions form the starting point of this book. With it, existing experiences and knowledge from science and practice are presented and brought together to evaluate urban renewal processes. This is intended to support and qualify practical evaluation activities and provide suggestions for further scientific discussion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4700381-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071034-8>
France Yearbook 2016 : Social and Solidarity Economy in France and Europe ¤ Economic significance of the Third Sector -- Forms of social entrepreneurship -- Theories of common-good-oriented economics -- Legal, political, and organizational framework conditions This collection provides an overview of the social and solidarity economy, which is gaining importance not only in France. Comparatively, different aspects of social and solidarity-based economics and its development in France and Europe are highlighted. Different organizational forms and economic models are described, the importance of the sector in individual branches of the economy is shown and discussed, and whether and to what extent it is an alternative economic model. The content Economic significance of the Third Sector Forms of social entrepreneurship Theories of common-good-oriented economics Legal, political, and organizational framework conditions The target groups France researchers with a cultural, social, and political science background France-interested public, media, and administration as well as practitioners dealing with the topic The publisher The dfi is a social science information and research institute.

Lexicographic Innovation - Innovative Lexicography: Bilingual and Multilingual Dictionaries in the Present and Future: Projects, Concepts, Visions ¤ What current challenges and problems does bilingual lexicography face today? How can traditional and currently perhaps already outdated and obsolete themes and phenomena be presented lexicographically in a new and timely manner today? What difficulties does the creation of dictionaries for languages that are unknown to a well-developed dictionary culture face today, or when the field of lexicography for these languages is rather one-sidedly developed? What must a bilingual dictionary accomplish today, and how is the relationship between print and online dictionaries to be seen in this context? Which themes and areas require more attention in the context of lexicographic research in the future? This collection of essays is intended to provide answers to such questions. It brings together contributions to bilingual dictionaries and dictionary projects as well as to selected lexicographic questions for the languages Brazilian/Portuguese, Chinese, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Turkish, and Ukrainian, which are mostly presented with German as the comparative language. It becomes apparent that today not only new requirements are placed on dictionaries (must be placed), but that the editors of dictionaries are already reacting to changing expectations and designing dictionaries differently. Due to the changed usage conditions and expectations, it seems that the conception of new types of dictionaries will be necessary in the future. The current trends also affect lexicography as a linguistic sub-discipline, so that a rethinking or further thinking is also advocated in this research area today.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035548-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120036-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038403-2>
Application and Financing in Public Transport : 3rd and 4th Jena Conferences on Public Transport Law ¤ Personenbeförderungsgesetz, Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 and European State Aid Law form significant legal benchmarks for public transport. The practical application of this legal framework is associated with considerable challenges. This is all the more true as, in recent years, a comprehensive decision-making practice has developed due to divergent application. The conference proceedings show the fundamental legal questions, deal with central problems in detail, and evaluate the legal situation from scientific and practical perspectives.

Person Injury Conference 2019 ¤ The concern of the Institute for Fair Damage Regulation, established in the first half of 2019, is to explore in detail what it means that the perpetrator or the liability insurer behind them must compensate the loss of the claimant as provided for by law. The first training event in Berlin (November 7-8, 2019) aims to bring all parties involved in the regulation of personal injuries up to date and question the persuasiveness of opposing arguments. Current topics to be treated include the permissible use of specialized service providers by liability insurers for the evaluation of evidence and data collection as well as the burden of proof in the liability process. An overview of the case law of the past half year will be provided for four core areas.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045290-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133428-0>

Literature as a Philosophical Model of Knowledge: Literary-Philosophical Discourses in Germany and France ¤ Since antiquity, the relationship between literature and philosophy has been determined in each era in its own way. Particular importance is gained by literature for the project of Enlightenment: Here it becomes relevant as a medium of education and perfectibility of man, especially but in connection with a programmatically becoming correlation of thought and action with the French Revolution of the year 1789. At the same time, a new - strictly rationalistic - concept of science generates from the late 18th century a crisis of philosophical-metaphysical language as well as an increasing separation of the aesthetic and the epistemological discourse. Against this background, the contributions of the volume investigate the constellation of literature and philosophy in Germany and France in the long 19th century. The problem of epistemological and linguistic skepticism and the competition of a specific knowledge of poetry and a specific knowledge of philosophy as well as the resulting possibilities and limits of perception of knowledge are also addressed, as well as questions of the conceptualization of knowledge and epistemic performance, the truth and knowledge claim of poetry, and concepts of the mediality of literature in the sense of the representation or representability of metaphysical problem constellations. With contributions to Charles François Dominique de Villers, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Hölderlin, Heinrich von Kleist, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Heinrich Heine, Gérard de Nerval, Honoré de Balzac, Wilhelm Dilthey, Friedrich Nietzsche, Stéphane Mallarmé, Robert Musil, Paul Valéry, Christian Morgenstern, Frank Kafka, Martin Heidegger u. a.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035964-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113615-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070914-0>

Education and Prevention: Reflections from Theory and Practice on a Much-Debated Connection ¤ This volume discusses various interdisciplinary approaches from science and practice on the connection between education (as a resource for a self-responsible life), crime, and prevention. On the one hand, education is a fundamental prerequisite for leading a self-responsible life. On the other hand, it often fails delinquent youth to utilize education as a resource. They exhibit, in addition to breaks in their formal educational biographies and missing educational qualifications, a large distance to learning and educational offers. What chance can education offer them? What connections can be sketched between education and crime from a preventive perspective? The volume seeks answers to these questions through various approaches from science and practice.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006650-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033178-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076308-0>
The Office: On the Rationalization of the Interior, 1880-1960 ¤ With the second industrial revolution, the service sector begins to grow significantly. At the end of the 19th century, the number of employees in banks, trade, industries, and insurance companies increases. The rationalization of these companies establishes a specialized and at the same time universal space that advances to the operational center of both private economy and public administration: In the office, machines, furniture, and people come together - form and function connect. The contributions of the volume show the office as a space of rationalization and the imaginary, which is still considered 'the real focus of the living space' (Walter Benjamin), as the center of administrative and social life.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012183-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008807-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112443-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4292301-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072819-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033422-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048499-3>
Win, Lose, Transform: European City Regions in Motion ¤ Cities and regions are undergoing a profound transformation. But what new phenomena of spatial development are to be recognized and how can they be interpreted? What are the causes or driving forces? How do they change the space and what impact do they have on society and politics? The change of the European urban system and urban policy is at the center of this volume. If one understands 'development' as a change in relatively stable conditions and 'transformation' as a reaction to a significantly changing context, then a transformation process is currently taking place in German and European city regions. This affects the structures in politics and planning. Against the background of economic, social, and political reactions to the recent globalization push with its widely discussed apparent and invisible effects on the European urban system, contributions from different countries are compiled. The key terms are metropolization, locational competition, and profiling. The authors investigate causes, phenomena, and consequences of transformation processes in the European context. For the cities, the question arises: win, lose, or transform?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4639012-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056763-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058136-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049040-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049043-9>
Humboldt-Forum Berlin : the project - the project ¤ The book provides a comprehensive outline of the Humboldt-Forum project for the first time. It summarizes the current state of the debate and will accompany it in the coming years. So far, the debate about the Humboldt-Forum has been conducted almost exclusively as an architecture and history debate. After the demolition of the Palace of the Republic and the competition decision in favor of Franco Stella's design, the concrete visions and plans for the Humboldt-Forum are now at the center of interest. As an innovative cultural and knowledge center, as a place of recognition and encounter for the world, the Humboldt-Forum is to intertwine publicness and experience - exemplarily for the 21st century - and at the same time confer a central public definition on the urban center of Berlin. On the occasion of the exhibition shown from July 8, 2009 at the Old Museum, in which the future main users, the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation with its State Museums in Berlin, the Central and State Library Berlin and the Humboldt University presented their plans publicly for the first time, Humboldt-Forum Berlin appears at Theater der Zeit. The book will document the integrative idea of the Humboldt-Forum, the project planning of its main users and the results of the architecture competition. Furthermore, it is about illuminating the intellectual challenge of the project and taking up the expectations of the public (from politics, culture, art and science). Even critical voices against the project are heard. Special chapters are devoted to international experiences in presenting world cultures as well as international reference projects for newer cultural buildings.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136102-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170787-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046235-3>
Paths to the New Federal Republic: Political Myths and Collective Self-Images after 1989 ¤ After 1989, the Federal Republic had to redefine its self-image and historical tradition.

Seine Welt wissen : Encyclopedias in the Early Modern Period ; [Catalogue for the exhibition of the University Library Leipzig and the Herzog August Library Wolfenbüttel] ¤ Publisher's text: The old culture of the printed book has been dedicated to the dissemination of knowledge from the very beginning. This is evidenced by the extensive holdings of the Herzog August Library Wolfenbüttel and the University Library Leipzig, which are presented here. The impressively illustrated volume provides the first overview of encyclopedias in the first 250 years of the printing age. These mostly richly illustrated books are understood as >>knowledge machines>>, as contemporary information media, which make phenomena of our everyday life appear in a new light, as if by instinct, by reaching for a dictionary or searching on the internet.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014986-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123412-1>
Stability in the Persian Gulf - Regional and Transatlantic Perspectives : 132. Bergedorfer Roundtable, 2. - 4. December 2005, Dubai, [132. Bergedorfer Protocol] ¤ The interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq have fundamentally changed the balance of power in the Middle East. At the same time, the challenges in the social, economic, and political areas have continued to grow. The conflict over Iran's nuclear program and the escalating violence in Iraq have given the question of regional stability new urgency. In solving it, the conceptions of actors from the Gulf states play a key role. The 132nd Bergedorf Roundtable in Dubai therefore mainly discussed regional approaches. Politicians and experts from the region, the US, and Europe analyzed possible ways to political stability in the Persian Gulf. The role of economic growth and political reforms, as well as the connection between democratization and stabilization, were in the center. It was about the relationship between modernization and identity, secularism and religion, traditional and Western conceptions, and between internal reform and external support. A focus of the discussion were security policy challenges. The American intervention in Iraq and the role of regional, but also external actors such as the US and the EU, India, or China were controversially discussed. Especially the policy of the Iranian government under President Ahmadinejad and the Iranian nuclear program were detailedly illuminated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128497-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116489-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4240956-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124941-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120503-0>
The Promises of Democracy : 25th Scientific Congress of the German Association for Political Science ¤ The „Promises“ of democracy are on everyone's lips: Democracy is a beacon of hope, for which people in authoritarian regimes take to the streets and risk their lives. At the same time, it is a reason for numerous disappointments and disillusionment with politics in existing democracies.In their contributions, the authors ask from a political science perspective how the „democracy“ as a political order form and as a political idea is ordered at the beginning of the 21st century and what conclusions can be drawn from this for future democracy policy.These current contributions are supplemented by a controversial review of German political science as a also biographically secured „democracy science“ in its founding phase.With contributions from:Frank Bandau, Hannah Bethke, Günter C.

Mobilities and Immobilities: People - Ideas - Things - Cultures - Capital ¤ A key factor in understanding globally observed spatial transformations is the development and change of mobilities. This applies to large- and small-scale movements of people, but also of ideas, cultures, things, capital, goods, and information. And even in our hypermobile globalized world, mobility cannot be thought of without immobility. Mobility and immobility are in a close, tension-filled relationship that decisively shapes the social-spatial development and form of cities and regions. So, the most important movement machines, such as mobile phones, computers, airplanes, high-speed trains, etc., require highly complex, spatially fixed, and space-reaching technical infrastructures. New technologies enable virtual mobility at physical immobility. At the same time, virtual mobility has not replaced physical mobility; rather, physical mobility has also increased. These considerations were the occasion for the thematic orientation of the 1st Dortmund Conference on Spatial and Planning Research: Mobilities and Immobilities. This book documents a large part of the contributions to the conference, which was jointly organized by the Faculty of Spatial Planning at the Technical University of Dortmund and the Academy for Spatial Research and Regional Planning - Leibniz Forum for Spatial Sciences - in February 2012. The conference laid the foundation for a series of conferences that serve as a platform for interdisciplinary spatial and planning-related research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068809-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006292-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039785-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076605-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4163275-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4314726-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055768-6>
European Influences on Spatial and Regional Development: An Example of Nature Conservation, Agenda 2000, and Regional Environment ¤ The implementation of the European Bird and Habitat Directives (FFH) into national law, as well as the new European agricultural policy introduced by Agenda 2000, significantly influence spatial development. The directives aim to preserve and restore particularly worthy natural habitats and their species. Large-scale designations of protected areas are required. In the spatial implementation, coordination and procedural questions are significant. With Agenda 2000, the goal is to reorient the existing direct payments for agricultural products in favor of environmental protection and structural measures. In this context, the objectives of the Structural Fund have been reduced from seven to three. Integrated regional development concepts with priority lists for the new funding policy are required. In this context, a comprehensive development of rural areas also plays a role. In view of far-reaching changes in the context of the globalization process, the question of knowledge exchange and effective use of knowledge is also increasingly being asked. An operational approach is presented using the example of business clusters, which highlights vertical and horizontal transaction patterns of knowledge. Equally important for regional development are innovative networks between innovation actors. The intraregional network relationships must also exhibit international relationships if they are to be competitive. The future of the regions depends more strongly than before on the recourse to their own forces.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076605-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049040-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115348-0>

O. M. Ungers : Cosmos of Architecture ; [published on the occasion of the exhibition "O. M. Ungers. Cosmos of Architecture", Neue Nationalgalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, October 27, 2006 to January 7, 2007] ¤ Oswald Mathias Ungers (* 1926) is both one of the most influential architects in Germany and one of the most formative architecture theorists of the 20th century. According to Ungers, a close connection to the visual arts is of fundamental importance for architecture: "Art and architecture have the same roots, are inscribed with the same codes and systems. To separate them means to destroy their value, to extinguish them." Ungers' museum buildings such as the Gallery of Contemporary Art in Hamburg or the Wallraf-Richartz Museum in Cologne, but also his own houses stand as real symbols for his radical commitment to architecture as pure art. - - The present volume illuminates different aspects of this theoretical approach based on Ungers' art collection, his collection of architecture models, his own houses, and his library for the first time and examines the inner connection of his architectural work to art themes	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>
Interests, Values, Responsibility: German Foreign Policy between Nation-State, Europe, and the West: In Memory of Hans-Peter Schwarz ¤ Is German foreign policy since Adenauer's days interest-driven and strategically designed? Or does it follow a convenient moralism and let itself be driven by popular moods? What external policy responsibility comes to the Federal Republic in the face of the EU crisis, the tensions in the transatlantic relationship, and new security policy threats? What are the contours of a realistic and responsible power policy of the Federal Republic? In memory of Hans-Peter Schwarz, the biographer of the two chancellors Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, these questions are critically discussed in 14 pointed essays by renowned historians and political scientists.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003846-4>

Land Use Competitions on Site - Land Use Management as Municipal and Regional Task : Documentation of Contributions to a Regional Seminar of the German Institute for Urban Studies and the Association of the Greater Region of Hanover on May 27 and 28, 1997 in Hanover ¤ Qualitatively and quantitatively efficient land use management, where not only the different land use claims are brought into balance, but also the land and soil are handled sparingly and carefully, with soil sealing being limited to the necessary extent, is a central component of sustainable urban and land development in metropolitan regions. Supported by the Association of the Greater Region of Hanover, which has been in an intensive coordination process with its members from the city of Hanover, the district of Hanover, and many individual municipalities for a long time, the German Institute for Urban Studies organized a seminar on the topic of land use management, which is documented in this publication. From the individual contributions and discussions, it became clear on the one hand how difficult regional land use management is between municipal planning sovereignty and regional overall responsibility. On the other hand, it also became apparent how central regional land use management is for sustainable urban development.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077809-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017396-3>
Conflict Transformation as a Path to Peace: Christian and Islamic Perspectives ¤ Islam and Christianity have frequently legitimized violence in their history, but also given strong peace ethical impulses. The approaches to this are illuminated in this volume from a Christian and Islamic perspective using new concepts of conflict transformation: How can religious resources contribute to constructively dealing with religious, but also social and political conflicts? Where are these resources to be found and how can they be applied? What role can the religious actors and actors, but also the spiritual sources and traditions of the religions as well as their spiritual and communicative practice forms play in conflict transformation?

Surrogacy and Family: Impulses from Law, Theology, and Medicine ¤ The book examines the topic of surrogacy from a broad, interdisciplinary perspective. In Germany, surrogacy is prohibited, while in many other countries it is legal. Many people therefore fulfill their wish for a child through surrogacy abroad. The book takes this as an opportunity to grasp and analyze current findings and impulses from law, theology, sociology, child development psychology, medicine, genetics, and philosophy on this phenomenon. At the center is the question of how the well-being of the child, the interests of the surrogate mothers, and the needs of the prospective parents are reflected in the German legal order, social reality, and ecclesiastical institutions.

Social Aspects of Land Recycling in Cities: Documentation of the 4th German-American Workshop "Social Aspects of Land Recycling" on June 17/18, 2004 in Leipzig ¤ Within the framework of a German-American research cooperation, procedures for dealing with vacant land in the context of land recycling (Brownfield Redevelopment) were discussed in six bilateral workshops. The book documents the 4th workshop, which dealt with the social aspects of land recycling in cities. In the revitalization of vacant land, various social aspects are usually affected. Inner-city vacant land offers a large potential for this purpose, as it is usually well-developed and centrally located. Vacant land is at the same time a focal point for social, ecological, and employment-oriented initiatives in urban renewal areas. The social acceptability of land recycling depends on how far a connection of urban planning and engineering aspects with participatory approaches to a comprehensive urban renewal of the existing stock and urban structures can be achieved. It is about effectively bundling the private economic interest in projects of vacant land revitalization and the public interest in long-term effective social effects in the relevant city districts. Land recycling is therefore no longer an isolated specialist task, but a crucial component of sustainable urban development and must meet the different requirements of spaces, users, uses, and functions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056769-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4007908-9>

Genre and Race: Media Interdependencies of Aesthetics and Politics ¤ Introduction -- (Anti-)Racialized Genre Genealogies -- Politics of Representation -- Genre Adaptations and Passages -- Post- and Decolonial Racism Critique. The category of Race is currently gaining more political visibility, mainly due to the Black-Lives-Matter movement, migration and flight, not least also due to theoretical approaches such as Postcolonial Studies, Critical Race Theory, Intersectionality or Decolonizing Gender Studies. Against this background, it is necessary to critically question media-specific strategies in their diversity and historical development, which have contributed to racist thinking and racist politics and continue to do so. The category of Genre as an ambivalent and complex perception and meaning-creation structure at the interface of production, reception, and aesthetics offers itself particularly to approach media-technological traditions and means that make Race politically effective, serve various ideologies, produce affects, and at the same time also produce resistances or new perspectives and forms of articulation. The book brings together different theoretical and analytical approaches that provide insights into the history of the interdependence of Genre and Race through selected objects, as well as dealing with its international and nationally specific accentuation, where fundamental questions about the relationship between visuality and Race and the epistemological power of the gaze are always in focus.

Times designated : early modern epochal concepts: European history and global present ¤ Cliff notes: Is the Early Modern period a product of the Cold War? How was the concept of Modernity and Antiquity perceived during the time of Louis XIV? Are there global Early Modern periods? - Epoch formation is generally considered one of the central tasks of any disciplinary historiography. Although the term epoché in its proper sense means the threshold between times, the transition, the temporal in-between, epochs appear in current usage as largely epistemically determined, seemingly homogeneous entities in the division of a physically continuous time flow. In this, they function, whether their designations are historically, teleologically, or even only numerically shaped, primarily as practical labels, convenient reference schemes, or even as mere umbrella terms for designating a unity that is often immediately revoked by reference to the simultaneity of the non-simultaneous, yet consistently asserted, if not granted. The consolidation of the Wolfenbüttel working groups on Renaissance and Baroque research into the newly established Early Modern Research Group documents the repeated reflection on the difficult business of designating times.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020531-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138024-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138025-3>
Alles ist nach seiner Art ¤ There are some successful examples of approaching Wagner's monumental 'Ring' tetralogy analytically. In the present book, the result of a Bayreuth scientific symposium, the authors - all acknowledged experts - deal with the main characters of the work, after the editor has given an overview of the most important stations of the Ring interpretation since 1876. The mythological and literary sources of the characters are followed, their dramatic and musical formation is characterized. Of course, their respective significance within the tetralogy is illuminated. It is astonishing to see that the modernity of the work is not only shown in current productions, but also when contemporary socioscientific and psychological questions are posed. Access to the individual characters is of particular value for the music theater enthusiast, who should, however, be quite familiar with the work. Essential for music libraries.

In Sprachwelten über-setzen : Contributions to Economic Communication, Cultural and Language Mediation in DaF and DaZ$d42. Annual Conference of the Association of German as a Foreign and Second Language in Munich 2015 ¤ The present volume comprises the most important contributions of the 42nd Annual Conference of German as a Foreign Language, which took place under the motto DaFür München from 05.03. - 07.03.2015 at the SDI Munich / University of Applied Languages. The thematic spectrum shows a variety of current aspects of teaching and learning German as a first or second foreign language. An important focus is the theme of translation / language mediation, which – in a broad sense – is also dedicated to the title of the volume. Numerous research concepts and practice-oriented approaches that provide a broad scope for multilingualism and current heterogeneity in DaF and DaZ determine the following four thematic focal points and a practice forum from different perspectives: 1. Language mediation / interpreting and translating; 2. Multilingualism in the context of international economic and business communication; 3. Heterogeneity as a challenge and resource in DaF and DaZ; 4. Life worlds in literature and land studies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018424-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016216-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117662-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031883-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061418-9>

Municipal Financial Crisis: Consequences and Solution Approaches ¤ Municipal financial crisis has been accompanying municipalities for a long time - it is not a child of the current financial crisis. The problems lie deeper: in the growing burden of tasks, the personnel-intensive municipal services, the higher demands of citizens on their municipalities and the lagging behind revenues. Although municipalities have a certain tax autonomy (fees, contributions, municipal taxes) - their scope of action is limited by the increasingly intense municipal location competition. In addition to general reform approaches on the state level, municipalities must also make a greater effort to find their own solution approaches to improve their situation. They range from cost-cutting measures to strengthening civic participation to new models that involve citizens in municipal financial decision-making and contribute to relieving municipal budgets through <<sustainable business practices>>. The contributions brought together in this volume are primarily based on a lecture series at the University of Hanover in 2011.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019961-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071675-2>

Service Colloquium on November 10, 2005 at the Technical University of Kaiserslautern ¤ For the fourth time, a service colloquium took place on November 10, 2005 at the TU Kaiserslautern, in which doctoral and postdoctoral students from various departments presented their work for discussion. Once again, it became clear that this is a wide field in terms of content and methodology. The present working paper documents the presentations held. In the service literature, strategic questions of competition have been dealt with relatively rarely so far. Based on the consideration that strategic options for competition are generally transferable to service enterprises, Kai-Michael Dresch's contribution to the question of how modularization can provide approaches for the realization of hybrid competition strategies is pursued. It shows that modularization can be restricted on the one hand due to the interactivity of services, but on the other hand also opens up additional design possibilities. Ubiquitous Computing describes the increasing penetration of everyday life with information technology. Intelligent products and support services emerge, which will have effects on the future collection and processing of information as well as the purchase and use of services. Henrik Fälsch's contribution summarizes the transformation processes of classical services on different levels of service and propagates an increasing importance of additional services along the customer process. Patrick Gerling and Andreas Jonen's contribution is based on the cognitively oriented controlling approach, which has so far dealt mainly with functional and institutional questions. In order to be able to span an instrumental perspective, the cognitive limitations are worked out, which occur in connection with the use of controlling information. These are seen as the starting point for a cognitively oriented design of controlling instruments. In particular, the management of services often leads to high knowledge deficits of the affected managers and thus represents a typical example of the advantage of a cognitively oriented design of instruments. Universities have been given more decision-making power over budget use and institutional orientation in recent times. This can be seen as a need for instruments to support decision-making, which cannot always be covered by traditional instruments due to the special situation of universities. The Balanced University Decision Card presented by Lisa Hubig and Andreas Jonen is intended to support decision-makers in presenting decision situations by structuring the framework and the alternative actions. This is done methodically by anchoring in the widely used business instrument of the Balanced Scorecard. With the help of thinking in perspectives and the use of cause-and-effect chains to illustrate the consequences of choosing an alternative action, the situation is modeled. The potential of the instrument is presented in a case study.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012178-1>
The Body in Early Modern Times : Practices, Rituals, Performance ¤ Cliff Notes: Sociation in Early Modern Times proceeded largely through the arrangement and semiotic loading of human bodies. At the center of the last conference of the Wolfenbüttel Baroque Working Group were body practices across the entire spectrum from instrumental body techniques to sign-performative rituals and stagings. Thus, questions were turned to the historicity of body practices, to the field of tension between normativity and everyday action, to the interplay between the only apparent static of rituals and social dynamics, to the contrast between stabilization and legitimation of social order, as well as the possibilities of irony and subversion. The contributions of the volume emerging from the conference document an interdisciplinary view of relevant aspects of the body in the Baroque and can be assigned to four content sections: body practices in the fields of religion and magic, body practices in the fields of law and politics, body practices in narratives and visualizations, and body practices in the areas of staged performance and stage. The book 'The Body of Early Modern Times' is the last volume of the series Wolfenbüttel Works on Baroque Research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128100-7>
Wolf Biermann : a Lyricist and Songwriter in Germany ¤ Poems, songs, friends and foes - Wolf Biermann has had a lot of everything." Deike Diening, Der Tagesspiegel Wolf Biermann's expulsion from the GDR after the Cologne concert in 1976 meant not only a turning point in his biography, but also in the history of the GDR. Personal and political history intersect in the life and work of the songwriter again and again. This involves central reference points in German cultural history: between East and West, German and Jewish, communism and democracy, politics and art. All of these are complex pairings that challenge historical judgment. The contributions of the book reflect Wolf Biermann's development in the political contexts of the time and also dedicate themselves to the lyricist and musician.

Maintenance and Restoration of Roads and Water Supply Systems from the Roman Republic to Late Antiquity ¤ Roads, bridges, aqueducts and canals are amongst the physical infrastructures that allowed Roman dominance over the Empire, while meeting economic, social and strategic needs. Due to their structural role in the management and control of a territory, they must be examined in view of the “longue durée”, which necessarily raises the issue of their regular maintenance and occasional restoration. By studying the interactions between different political and administrative authorities, but also the involvement of private individuals, be they users or riverside occupants, the papers gathered in this volume highlight the rehabilitation procedures of road and hydraulic facilities, but also the prevention strategies against potentially irreversible damages. To understand the overall legal framework, along with the technical constraints and socio-political modalities of these interventions, a multidisciplinary approach was adopted to foster the dialogue between history, archaeology and Roman law.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126531-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002509-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027145-6>
Politics as linguistically bound knowledge : political language in lifelong learning and political action ¤ The engagement with the various relationships between language and politics is as old as the realization that language is the most important medium for political thinking and acting. However, the relationships between language and politics only became a subject of scientific research in the 20th century, for example in Germany in the course of the confrontation with the language of or in National Socialism. Little has been researched so far on how, to what extent, and with what content the various relationships between language and politics find their way into the language life of the individual, what role they play, and whether and how they undergo changes. The contributions summarize the research that has been conducted so far and explore what further research can be aligned with	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046559-7>

The conference volume contains the three keynote speeches by Axel Börsch-Supan (University of Mannheim), Christian Keuschnigg (University of St. Gallen) and Bernd Raffelhüschen (University of Freiburg). -- Axel Börsch-Supan points out that population aging, in addition to the much-discussed financial gap in the statutory pension insurance, requires action in two further policy areas. Since increasing capital intensity will not be sufficient to boost productivity to the extent that the negative effects of aging on GDP can be compensated, human capital accumulation through education and training must be increased. In addition, the changed age structure will affect the composition of aggregate demand and require a significantly higher sectoral factor mobility to avoid sectoral employment crises. -- Christian Keuschnigg explains in an intertemporal equilibrium model the occurrence of credit rationing and unemployment as a result of search frictions on capital and labor markets. Financial policy measures to promote business start-ups are effective instruments to combat unemployment. -- Bernd Raffelhüschen points out that the social policy reform agenda for pension and health insurance must be expanded, as the basic security through social assistance, housing benefit, unemployment benefit and care allowance is also in need of reform. He develops a blueprint for a basic security reform that is based on two core ideas: subsidiary help to self-help and subsidization of employment instead of idleness. Related reform concepts in international comparison and existing linkages in the German social law system make Raffelhüschen optimistic that his reform proposal is not only economically attractive, but also legally implementable and politically feasible.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126724-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055732-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017182-6>
Designing Learning and Educational Processes : Young Forum Media and Higher Education Development (JFMH13) ¤ Im Fokus vieler Nachwuchsinitiativen steht, das Hineinwachsen in Forschung und Entwicklung der Bildungseinrichtungen zu erleichtern. Zu diesen Initiativen gehört auch das „Junge Forum Medien und Hochschulentwicklung“, das Nachwuchsforschenden sowie -praktikerinnen und -praktikern aus den vier beteiligten Fachgesellschaften (dghd, GMW, GI/FG E-Learning sowie DGfE/Sektion Medienpädagogik) eine Plattform für Diskurs und Austausch zwischen Wissenschaft und Praxis bietet. The documented conference contributions from 2013 are as diverse as formal or informal learning and educational processes with and without media can be. It is discussed, for example, what role design processes take in the context of higher education and media didactics research and how digital technologies practically support learning and educational processes. Some contributions to personnel development and promotion of young researchers in science and higher education frame the #JFMH13 volume.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145462-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006665-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122926-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145467-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160221-3>

Future Forum on Spatial Planning: Joint Congress 2001 by ARL and BBR ¤ Important conditions for the development of space have been profoundly changed in the transition from the industrial society to the service and knowledge society. This includes the globalization of economic processes, the progressive European integration, the expansion of information and communication technologies, as well as decentralization and public-private cooperation-oriented structural changes in the state and society. The new trends in development lead to changed requirements for spatial planning and policy. A re-adjustment of spatial planning and spatial development policy is urgently required. To this end, the Future Forum on Spatial Planning, which was held by the Academy for Spatial Research and Land Planning (ARL) and the Federal Office for Building and Urban Development (BBR) in Bonn in late 2001, should make an important contribution. The book contains the results of the Future Forum. In addition to a location determination, proposals for securing the effectiveness of spatial planning in the face of future challenges are presented.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048590-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120658-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120814-6>
The America of Authors : from Kafka to 09/11 ¤ Since German authors write about America, more precisely: the USA, this happens in an ambivalence of fascination and rejection. But only in the 20th, the >American< century, do the contradictory feelings unfold in a previously unknown breadth. At the same time, however, they are more conscious than before for almost everyone who travels to America - by ship, by air, or even just in their heads. That America is a projection of the European spirit, Paul Valéry has held for his European colleagues. And if Peter Bichsel's >America does not exist< seems like a federal exaggeration to many, so most people could understand Carl Zuckmayer's laconism: >America is different!< But different from what? Different from Europe? Different from what we think? Different from how it sees itself? This book deals with these questions and aspects through various examples from 20th-century German-language literature and journalism, from Karl Rossmann's Kafkaesque arrival in America to the literary processing of September 11, 2001	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001671-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035964-5>
Current GmbH Law: Conference Proceedings ¤ The conference proceedings document the lectures held at the 7th symposium of the Institute for Notarial Law on current GmbH law. There is also a need for political action in many areas of GmbH law even after the MoMiG reform. The goal is to show the reader current problem areas and present political solutions. First, an overview is given of the development of the GmbH in Germany and Europe. This is followed by contributions on the shareholder list and the acquisition of shares in good faith, the reduction of capital, as well as the area of vinking. Further, open questions and problems in the so-called Hin- and Herzahlen are illuminated. At the end, a contribution on capital increase in crisis and insolvency of the company is presented. It is to be hoped that the results of the conference will be well received by the BGH and the legislature. With contributions by: Prof. Dr. Holger Altmeppen; Prof. Dr. Barbara Grunewald; Notary a.D.

Civil Security : Societal Dimensions of Contemporary Security Policies ¤ Terrorism, crime or catastrophes - threats, risks and hazards of diverse origin are increasingly thought of 'on the same line'. This rationality, branded under the slogan 'Civil Security', has advanced to a core concept of security policy strategy. The book takes up questions about the preconditions, meanings and consequences of this security strategy. From different disciplinary perspectives, fundamental aspects of the constitution and change in security awareness, the transformation of the security architecture, as well as the ambivalences of the technologization of security are presented and critically discussed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127888-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116489-1>
Juvenile Multiple and "High-Intensity Offenders" : Developments, Strategies, Concepts ¤ Juvenile multiple and "high-intensity offenders" are a topic that repeatedly provokes public discussions.

Age-Friendly Work : the Demographic Shift in Workforces ¤ The demographic shift is considered one of the greatest challenges of the near future. The consequences of an aging society on work processes are increasingly coming into focus. The politically pursued increase in the employment rate of older people requires the preservation of the working and employability of this group. However, studies show that there are significant deficits on the part of the companies: Only just under a fifth offer measures of occupational health promotion. Older people, especially those who are less qualified, are rarely involved in occupational further education. Also, reservations about the hiring of older employees persist.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000571-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005982-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006292-2>
Vollzug für das 21. Jahrhundert : Symposium anlässlich des 300-jährigen Bestehens der Justizvollzugsanstalt Waldheim ¤ Published on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of Waldheim Prison, this book contains contributions from different authors on topics related to correctional facilities. The subjects discussed range from historical aspects and critical analysis of the efficacy of procedures and practices to whether the deprivation of freedom is still a reasonable sanction. This book will fascinate its readers because it presents the perspectives of different professions at correctional facilities and provides an overview of the debates stemming from different approaches. It becomes apparent that seemingly simple answers are not adequate solutions to this complex matter.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018332-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057808-2>
Intelligent Agents and the Law ¤ The deployment of robots in various areas of life brings a fundamental concern of law to the forefront: the possible clear assignment of responsibility. As a technological innovation, the digitalization of certain processes raises the question of the appropriateness of our liability concepts. If intelligent agents, whether as autonomous cars, prostheses, or irrigation systems, cause damage because they do not correctly take in data, misinterpret, or react inappropriately in autonomous mode, the question arises: Do the people behind the machine bear responsibility? The question of responsibility for intelligent agents is neither new nor limited to legal science. It was already discussed in Roman law and is now a concern of technology assessment. The present volume spans the arc from antiquity to modernity and from basic questions to application in the insurance industry, intelligent traffic, or smart homes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4261462-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177219-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061688-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068129-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4310355-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078176-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022898-8>
The Performance of Philology in the Interpretation of Culture(s) ¤ It is certainly an exciting scientific task to define what culture is, and to think about how one can make this culture a scientific subject. Furthermore, it is a challenge to develop an approach or methodology for how one can research culture. In this undertaking, we must always have in mind that we are talking about two different concepts of culture: once of the culture that represents something inherently human, and once of a culture that is typical for a (language-)community and can be considered a characteristic feature of this community.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125698-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4174271-0>
Administration between Design, Transparency, and Control: Contributions to the Symposium on the Occasion of Ulrich Ramsauer's 70th Birthday ¤ Der vorliegende Band versammelt Beiträge vom Symposium zum 70. Geburtstag von Ulrich Ramsauer, mit dem seine mehr als 40 Jahre währende Tätigkeit auf den Gebieten des öffentlichen Rechts, insbesondere des Umwelt- und Planungsrechts, des Verwaltungsverfahrensrechts und der Verwaltungslehre gewürdigt wurde. In den Beiträgen werden zentrale Probleme der aktuellen verwaltungsrechtlichen Diskussion behandelt: Verfahrensbeschleunigung (Peter Wysk), Öffentlichkeitsbeteiligung (Hans-Joachim Koch) und Europäisierung (Jörg Berkemann). Einleitend gibt Ivo Appel eine gestraffte Einführung in das Konzept der Verwaltungsrechtswissenschaft als Steuerungswissenschaft. Die übergeordnete thematische Verbindung stellt der Beitrag von Jochen Wagner aus philosophischer Perspektive unter dem Titel „Integration durch Freundschaft“ her; er betrachtet damit zugleich die Integration als eine der wichtigsten Staatsaufgaben unserer Zeit. The present volume combines contributions to the symposium on the occasion of Ulrich Ramsauer’s 70th birthday, acknowledging his activity in the fields of public law, especially environmental law and planning regulations, administrative procedural law and public administration, which has lasted more than 40 years. The contributions deal with key issues in the current discussion in administrative law: accelerated proceedings (Peter Wysk), public participation (Hans-Joachim Koch) and Europeanisation (Jörg Berkemann). In his introduction, Ivo Appel presents a short introduction to the concept of administrative legal science as a managing science. The contribution by Jochen Wagner offers an overarching thematic connection from a philosophical perspective, titled “Integration through friendship”. At the same time, he considers integration as one of the essential responsibilities of the state today.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063351-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063359-7>

Domestic utopias : Catalog for the exhibition  ; NGBK Berlin, 15.6. - 28.7.2013 ; [on the occasion of the exhibition Domestic Utopias, New Society for Visual Arts, 14.6.2013 - 28.7.2013] ¤ „The private is political“ was a slogan of the second women's movement in the 1970s, which campaigned worldwide for women's equality in politics and society. There was already a first step in this direction during the French Revolution – but it was not successful at the time. Now the slogan becomes the motto for the exhibition Domestic Utopias of the New Society for Visual Arts (NGBK) in Berlin. „Private“ here means forms of domesticity. The exhibition starts from various housing concepts, some of which were realized and some of which had to be abandoned. Artists deal with architectural designs for these concepts, for example Moira Zoitl with the so-called Frankfurt kitchen of architect Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky. In her work Kitchen Torso — from the reduction of steps, she interprets the pioneer of the built-in kitchen, which was intended to simplify work processes and make kitchens more compact. Space shortage and the resulting isolation of the housewife were major criticisms of the Frankfurt kitchen concept. From Annette Wehrmann, UFO models can be seen in Berlin, including the Reading UFO of 1999. She wanted to create a „moment of disconnection, of withdrawal into oneself“ with these UFOs, as the artist expressed herself at the time. In the Reading UFO, for example, one can engage with partly feminist science fiction literature from the 1970s. Far from the real world, the UFOs should be non-places that leave room for the question of „what if?"	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4483833-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066749-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114333-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077624-4>
Image and Script on "Magical" Artifacts ¤ There exist numerous treatises on powerful, commonly referred to as "magical" texts, for example on shells, gems, and amulets of different cultures. However, the illustration of the aforementioned artifacts often plays only a subordinate role in the analysis. In this context, phenomena of cultural transfer can be traced in both the pictorial representations and the texts themselves. Furthermore, the question arises as to how the relationship between image and text is to be evaluated: Do they stand in an intrinsic relationship and jointly determine the effect of the artifact? Or do they rather offer two "readings" of a single fact? The present volume deals with these and other questions exemplarily on artifacts and handbooks, cross-religiously and cross-culturally, from Late Antiquity to the early modern period and from the entire Mediterranean region. This includes not only gems, papyrus, and Arabic paper amulets, but also manuals with instructions for "magical" actions. With various interpretation and solution approaches, the contributions attempt to approach the question of the tension between magical text and image and to consider this from a trans-cultural perspective.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006568-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144881-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036966-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053297-5>
The Border Region as a Site of Memory : On the Change to a Post-National Culture of Remembrance in Europe ¤ History museums and memorial sites have long conveyed primarily national historical images. In a united Europe, however, the idea of a denationalized collective remembrance is growing. This discrepancy is particularly evident in border regions, where former states with their opposing interpretations of the past competed. By way of example, German, Italian, and Slovenian researchers in this book design a comprehensive panorama of a new democratic culture of remembrance. They show the far-reaching consequences for public remembrance and museum and history education in an international and interdisciplinary perspective.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200793-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4021993-8>
Socialism Debates ; 1: Socialism in the 21st Century? ¤ The growing doubt as to whether a democratic-capitalist system can withstand the climate change and the upcoming transformations in the labor market, brings socialism new acceptance. A good reason to hold debates about how it could look like in the 21st century. The "New Zurich Newspaper", not necessarily suspected of progressive orientation, fears a "New Desire for Socialism". For a new socialist option speaks, that the historically unique economic-ecological crisis has set a societal transformation in motion, which must be used by left forces. A socialism of the 21st century, which reflects its own history and its diverse failures, stands therefore not only for the search for a emergency brake that must stop the climate change and the new wars. But realistic ways out of the epochal economic-ecological crises must be developed. The authors discuss in this volume the following questions: Does socialism in the 21st century have a future? Does it offer solutions for the pressing present problems? Which social forces could carry new socialist projects? Are there approaches for successful socialist politics?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055785-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7>

Psychoanalysis and University: On the Connection of Academic Teaching and Analytic Practice ¤ The relationship between psychoanalysis and university has always been very tense, as well as the training of clinical psychoanalysts in an academic framework. Psychoanalysis has indeed conquered a number of positions at universities, but increasingly difficulty in defending them permanently. The authors of the present volume show that there are still various and international attempts to institutionalize psychoanalysis at the university and to give (becoming) psychoanalysts the opportunity to combine academic with psychoanalytic qualifications. Through their historically founded approaches, they enable a differentiated understanding of both the principal and historically conditioned problems that arise when combining academic research and psychoanalytic theory and practice, and show new solution approaches. In addition, the original text of Freud's Memorandum 'Should psychoanalysis be taught at the university?' is included in the book, which was only available for a long time in a back-translation from Hungarian and English.

Garden futures : designing with nature ¤ Gardens have always been places of relaxation, enjoyment, and production. As expressions of identities, dreams, and visions, they have deep cultural roots and great symbolic significance. If the garden has been increasingly in the focus of social interest in recent years, then not only as a romantic refuge, but also as a testing ground for ideas of the future.

Milieu – Revisited : Strategies of Qualitative Milieu Analysis ¤ The book provides a systematic approach to research strategies and methods that can be used to conduct qualitative milieu analyses. In addition to the conceptual contributions, the exemplary studies provide an overview of the current practice of qualitative research on milieus. The content of this book is based on questions that first emerged in the debate on the concept of milieu in connection with inequality and social structure research in the 1980s: How can inequalities between, for example, ethnic groups and genders be defined and treated in the most meaningful way? Should they be referred to as horizontal in contrast to vertical inequalities and what significance do these designations have again? Must "new" inequality-relevant manifestations announce or announce the spatial metaphor? Should they be replaced by alternative, also spatial metaphors such as from center and periphery? Can they be analyzed as a superficial phenomenon of class antagonism or are they to be considered as a secondary phenomenon of new social divisions?

The Forced Paradise of Aging? : Questions for a Critical Gerontology ; [Conference of the Section Age(s) and Society of the German Society for Sociology (DGS) on the topic The Forced Paradise of Aging? Questions for a Critical Gerontology, July 8 and 9, 2005 at the Vienna University of Economics and Business] ¤ This book is dedicated to the questions that are currently being raised in social gerontology, when it comes to determining its scientific status and the political relevance of its research. Its subject, aging, has become a public issue to an unprecedented extent, receiving a multifaceted and contradictory treatment. A mix of idealization and devaluation, of utilitarian optimism and deficit anxiety runs through the many discussions and publications on aging. The social gerontology itself is not left untouched by the breaks and contradictions in the societal assessments. Especially not when it addresses the questions of benefits and costs, privileges and disadvantages, opportunities and risks. Compared to the first edition, further developments, additions, and new topics and methods have been incorporated, in which the heterogeneity of the entire subject matter has become even more apparent.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142059-7>

Quality of University Education: Course and Results of a Colloquium at the University of Kassel ¤ At the University of Kassel, a total of 26 projects have been established, each dealing with different themes, methods, and forms of innovation, improvement, and evaluation of teaching and teaching research. The goal of the colloquium 'Quality of University Education', which is documented in the present volume, was to bring together the participants of these projects and provide them with a forum for opinion and experience exchange, for discussion with other interested and experienced people inside and outside the University of Kassel, and not least to determine their own position in a rather confusing university landscape. Contributions: - Introduction - Gorzka, Gabriele: Opening and welcome to the colloquium 'Quality of Teaching'. - Oehler, Christoph: On the current debate about the quality of university education (see individual contribution). - Winkler, Helmut: Quality of university education - What is it?. - Paschke, Egon: The quality of teaching. - Preisser, Ruediger: Teaching course criteria as the first step in evaluating teaching at the Technical University of Berlin. - Webler, Wolff-Dietrich: Evaluation of teaching: practical experiences and methodological guidelines. - Winkler, Helmut: Overview of the projects in the promotion program for the improvement of teaching and teaching research at the GhK. - Baldauf, Beate/Oehler, Christoph/Winkler, Helmut/Gruenig, Baerbel: Reports from the working groups. - Mayer, Evelies: Expectations and proposals of the Hessian State Government for the improvement of the quality of university education (see individual contribution). - Winkler, Helmut: Summary of the plenary discussion with the Hessian Minister of Science.

A World Without God? : Religion and Ethics in State, School and Society ¤ The religions have it hard in the world today, but the world has it hard with the religions too. On the one hand, the process of secularization is advancing, on the other hand, religious fundamentalism is increasing. Against this backdrop, discussions about religion and ethics in state, school, and society are taking place everywhere. Although the topic affects all countries and cultures, it is discussed by each individually. There is hardly any European or global discussion. In the present volume, models from secularist-oriented France and confessionally-shaped Germany are compared and, in doing so, questions are asked about common European perspectives. The practice of LER instruction (Life Help - Ethics - Religion) in Brandenburg, which is mainly rejected in West Germany, looks different from the French model of the secular school without religious instruction compared to the Bavarian model of a strictly confessionally-shaped school with crucifixes in the classroom. Potsdam seems to be closer to Paris than to Munich.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056618-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030702-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015604-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049422-6>
Aachen Expert Days 2018: Faultless and yet defective: Additional irregularities, tolerable or to be eliminated defects ¤ The 44th Aachen Expert Days deal with the topic: "Additional irregularities, tolerable or to be eliminated defects". In buildings erected under time and cost pressure in manual single-piece production, deviations from the specified requirements cannot be ruled out. There is no zero tolerance, both in manual single-piece production and in industrial production. Which deviations are "in the nature of the work" unavoidable, still contractually justifiable and therefore tolerable? Which are to be classified as no longer tolerable? How can planners and executors orient themselves when contract contents are only determined "by interpretation" in retrospect? The activity of the expert at the interface between law and technology is an important part of the overall legal assessment. Therefore, contributions from the fields of wood construction, concrete surfaces, plaster and natural stone are also dealt with, as well as legal aspects. A lecture deals with the hitherto underestimated environmental impacts of defect elimination, which can significantly impair sustainability. In the current topic, the problems surrounding the commercial depreciation are taken up and technical procedures discussed. Is it even a technical topic or only an unrealistic wishful thinking? Important innovations in building technical regulations - an overview -- Additional irregularities and tolerability from a legal point of view; Cost statements in court expert opinions -- Trivialities - reduction - performance; subjective value properties, radiation factors, reduction in case of impossibility, unreasonableness or disproportionality -- Tolerance limits: Are matching as a basis for evaluating optical properties suitable? -- Moisture in roof insulation materials - Report from research -- Roof coverings: Unevenness in seam widths, material thicknesses, flatness, slopes and appearance -- Wood surfaces: Cracks, branches, discoloration and machining marks -- Coverings from natural stone, tiles, paving: New manufacturing techniques and increased consumer expectations -- Plaster, coatings: Unevenness, importance of gaps in the filling of joints, spots, cavities, blooming, peeling, cracks -- Reinforced concrete components: flawless after production, transport and assembly? -- Exposed concrete: Temporal changes in appearance; feasibility of optical target ideas -- Commercial depreciation: technical and legal contradictions -- Commercial depreciation: Usual in rectifications - Legal considerations -- Commercial depreciation: Technical procedures? -- Commercial depreciation: (Not) a topic for property valuation -- Reduction in case of preservation or exchange? Considerations under sustainability aspects -- Blessing and curse of quality classes in regulations; Variant formation -- Mold in building components: Insulation of interior spaces - Report from research	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004821-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004923-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004854-8>
What Europe Do We Want? : Solidarity in Politics : The 19th Hannah-Arendt Days 2016 ¤ At least since the financial crisis of 2007/08, the European Union has also been in a crisis of solidarity – austerity policy, Brexit, and the closure of EU external borders are clear symptoms of this. What are the challenges of European politics, and how could a future European community look like? These questions were controversially discussed at the 19th Hannah-Arendt Days in Hanover. The analyses of problems and proposals presented there are now collected in this volume. The contributions by Marianne Kneuer, Hans-Jürgen Urban, Friedhelm Hengsbach, Ulrike Guérot, etc. are based on Hannah Arendt's 'Thinking Without a Parapet' and also include utopian ideas, for example, for a European republic beyond national states. Following Arendt's book On Revolution and her considerations on Vita activa, in which the determination of politics as communal action in freedom is at the center, the authors of the anthology formulate concepts for a politics of genuine togetherness. Instead of being an economic and monetary union, as hoped, Europe should be designed in such a way that it actually deserves the name Solidarity Community: a solidary European community that understands itself not as 'United States of Europe', but as a European republic.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046514-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128238-3>

Handwerk becomes modern : from manufacturing at Bauhaus ¤ It must have been quite loud and dusty in the workshops at Bauhaus Dessau. Here, hammers were struck, planes were planed, saws were sawed, and looms were woven. The publication Handwerk wird modern. From manufacturing at Bauhaus, Bauhaus is questioned from the perspective of craftsmanship. There was no concept that was more fiercely debated. The workshops were transition spaces: between factory and craft business, between free experiment and industrial piecework. From this field of tension, Bauhaus tried to redefine craftsmanship as a utopia, but also in coexistence with industrial culture. How current these debates are again today, contemporary design theorists and practitioners position themselves and provide new insights into the understanding of craftsmanship in the 21st century	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130303-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4023299-2>
Lifelong Learning and Educational Biographical Research: Concepts and Research in the European Discourse ¤ Lifelong learning has established itself as an educational policy concept in the most important European states over the past few years. That the basic research on lifelong learning processes has by no means kept pace with this, but rather requires a multitude of research efforts and discussions, has become apparent through the different perspectives on learning processes over a lifetime in European contexts. In addition, a look at the different conditions of lifelong learning under a biographical theoretical perspective in various European states is interesting. This publication expands the research perspective of biographical research to a European level and combines the educational policy concept of 'Lifelong Learning' with basic theoretical research approaches.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132300-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134373-6>
Children - Bodies - Identities : Theoretical and Empirical Approaches to Cultural Practice and Social Change ¤ In today's societies, child identities and body practices multiply.

University Economics - Analyses of Internal Control Problems and Macroeconomic Effects ¤ The number and variety of economic problems in the higher education sector have increased significantly in recent years - not least due to dwindling resources. This was the occasion for the Educational Economic Committee to deal with higher education economic issues at its 27th annual conference, which took place in March 2002 at the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena. The contributions of this conference are compiled in the present volume. The essays are dedicated to internal organizational, personnel policy or production theoretical problems of the university, on the other hand, the macroeconomic consequences of alternative financing systems of a complete university system are considered. In this, not only theoretical considerations are presented, but also comprehensive empirical studies that clearly emphasize the importance of the presented higher education economic problems and solution approaches.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134590-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4231998-5>
Future Tasks of Wastewater Disposal in Rural Areas: Symposium on October 9, 2003 in Weimar ¤ Foreword In Thuringia, there are approximately 200,000 small sewage treatment plants, most of which are in very poor structural condition.

Chances and Risks of Smart Cams in Public Space ¤ The conference proceedings address technical, legal, and political issues of the increasing penetration of urban life by various image capture techniques for the first time comprehensively. In addition to surveillance cameras from security authorities, private Smart Cams carried by individuals are emerging, which are often unnoticed and ready to capture at any time, attached to clothing or glasses, behind windshields or in drones. The volume contains scientific contributions to the individual techniques, the motivations of users, and the rights of those unintentionally captured. The conference debate on user interests and personality protection, including proposals for conflict resolution, is also documented. Since the conference was conducted jointly by the ChaRiSma project funded by the BMBF and the Data Protection Advisory Board of the Deutsche Bahn Group, security concerns play a central role as a motive for camera use. In addition to legal and political decision-makers, developers of data protection-friendly technology are also addressed. With contributions from: Prof. Dr. oec.

Atem. Gestalterische, ökologische und soziale Dimensionen ¤ During breathing - in the process of constant exchange and crossing of boundaries between the organism and its environment - air as an «immaterial» material becomes active. For the first time, this anthology brings together studies on breath from the perspective of the arts and humanities, as well as experimental scientific and design practices. Focusing on the period from 1900 to the present day, the publication covers an era during which air has become a precarious medium: whether in the context of climate change or global pandemic, space technology or gas warfare, air is now co-created and manipulated by humans. Against this backdrop, breath appears as an elusive yet vital substance that reveals the interconnections between the physical, symbolic, technological and social realms	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003404-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157139-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055916-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114333-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130887-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043207-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201477-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112611-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033422-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049716-1>
Gerechte Medizin? : Analyses and Impulses from Theory and Practice ¤ Justice issues in the healthcare sector are gaining increased urgency in the light of rising medical costs, an ageing society as well as the tides of migration that have been increasing recently. How can we allocate scarce medical resources as justly as possible, and what role do traditional concepts of justice play in this context? Who should be responsible for that? How can decisions regarding the allocation be ethically justified?The contributions to this volume explore these and similar questions from the perspectives of medicine, health economics and ethics, and provide concrete insights into various fields of medical practice. It becomes apparent that the problem of scarce resources cannot be solved by rationalisation measures alone in the future. We must therefore think in the broadest terms about not only the ‘ethics of waste avoidance’, but also the ‘ethics of rationing’.With contributions byEva Czermak, Gebhard Falzberger, Peter G.

Foreign women - women in foreign lands : studies on foreignness and gender in the Hebrew Bible and the Ancient Near East in the first millennium BCE ¤ International scholars from various disciplines and methodological approaches investigate gender-specific constructions of foreignness in the Old Testament, Egypt, and Mesopotamia. They show that when combined, foreignness and gender can take on very different forms. The contributions of this volume investigate specific questions, individual female figures, and individual phenomena as model cases. The collection is a preliminary and basic work for further study of gender-specific concepts of foreignness/strangeness in the ancient Mediterranean cultures of the first millennium BCE. The volume presents a collection of papers read during three workshops held in Leipzig (2016), Jerusalem (2017), and Vienna (2018). International scholars from different disciplines and methodological approaches explored gender-specific constructions of foreignness/strangeness in the Old Testament, Egypt, and Mesopotamia from their particular perspectives. They showed that when combined, strangeness/foreignness and gender can take on very different forms. Various processes of the »othering« of women are of importance, which differ from the »othering« of men. The contributions investigate specific questions, individual female figures and individual phenomena as model cases. The basic question was when, where, how and for what purpose the categories of foreignness and gender were connected and activated in literary tradition. The collection is a preliminary and basic work for further study of gender-specific concepts of foreignness/strangeness in the ancient Mediterranean cultures of the first millennium BCE.Survey of contentsLars Allolio-Näcke: How to Become an Alien (Woman)? – Sara Japhet: Marriage with Foreign Women: Yes or No? – Nili Wazana: Rahab, the Unlikely Foreign Woman of Jericho (Joshua 2) – Marianne Grohmann: The Philistine Woman from Timnah in Judges 14:1–15:8 – Angelika Berlejung: Solomon's Soulmate: The Queen of Sheba as Foreign Woman – Daniel Bodi: When Yhwh's Wife, Jerusalem, Became a Strange Woman: Inversion of Values in Ezekiel 16 in Light of Ištar Cult – From Spouse to Brothel Boss (ʾiššâ zônâ šallāṭet) – Stefan Fischer: Foreign Women in the Book of Proverbs – Jan Dietrich: The Image of the Foreign Woman in Proverbs 1–9 – Hans-Peter Mathys: Phoenicians and Money Bags.

From the Sound of Images ¤ Interaction, approach, and exchange between visual art and music run like a red thread through the 20th century. Images do not sound, music eludes visibility, and yet both derive essential impulses and innovations from each other. Abstract painting, which brought liberation from color and form, led many artists like composers to proceed (polyphony at Klee); in the famous artist friendship between Schoenberg and Kandinsky, there is talk of "color hearing," but already Runge and Schwind built their images in the 19th century according to the model of the sonata first movement form. The author follows the lines of connection and interfaces between the two arts, keywords such as "color light music," "sound sculpture," "plastic sound," "graphic music" etc. are to be mentioned. The text is the revised and streamlined version of a lavish exhibition catalog (Music in the Art of the 20th Century, Staatsgalerie Stuttgart 1985) and is perfectly suited as an introduction to this complex topic.

Reform of the Healthcare System — or: In Which Healthcare System Do We Want to Live? : A Disputation ¤ In the context of overall societal relationships, the monetary problems of statutory health insurance exert a great pressure on the healthcare system in its internal order and structure, its areas of care, functional methods, and professions. Therefore, the internal structures of the healthcare system with its numerous institutions, but also the effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of the services provided are in the focus of critical consideration.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115716-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020775-4>
Urban Land Management in City and Region : Urban Agriculture, Urban Gardening and Agribusiness ¤ Neighborhood gardens and intercultural gardens, planted tree disks and facades with fruit for self-harvesting, temporary vegetable beds on vacant lots and blooming street islands are interpreted as expressions of a new urban agriculture. Not only orchards and fields on the outskirts of the city, but also self-harvesting fields and the use of temporary forests as short-rotation plantations are now part of the productive urban landscapes described as agricultural and horticultural used urban and regional green spaces. Agriculture and horticulture in the city seem to be in vogue, and the number of new projects is growing continuously. But also in the specialist discussions, numerous contributions deal with innovative approaches for a sustainable and future-proof urban development with the phenomenon of urban gardening and urban agriculture. This volume considers the relevance of the topic for the future viability of cities and urban regions on the basis of current research results and practice examples. New challenges are identified for the municipal handling of agriculture and gardens.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056754-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056730-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4259046-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4007389-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048590-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4653294-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056723-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063234-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4264353-3>
Interfaces (in) of Media Economics ¤ The digital world is characterized by interfaces. In the form of user interfaces or interface systems, these are often of a technical nature. However, social interfaces also exist between individuals via internet services when looking at social media. Decision-making processes such as media selection, for example, on video-on-demand platforms are shaped by media psychological aspects. Media economics as a scientific discipline addresses these changed framework conditions and fields of research. Therefore, interdisciplinary work is intensified with communication science, advertising communication, and journalism. The 22 contributions in this conference volume offer a current snapshot of the research field of media economics and media management	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4623124-9>
Paul Schmitthenner 1884 - 1972 : [this catalog book appears on the occasion of the exhibition "Beauty rests in order. Paul Schmitthenner 1884 - 1972" from August 16 to November 9, 2003] ¤ As a design teacher of the Stuttgart School, Paul Schmitthenner was one of the leading architects of his time between the world wars. His settlements with virtuosically staged cityscapes - Staaken near Berlin (1914-17), Plaue near Brandenburg, Ooswinkel near Baden-Baden - make it forgotten that standardized floor plans and building components were used for the first time here. The characteristics of the residential buildings that established his reputation were regional sensitivity, material justice, subtle room sequences, and masterful details. The Schmitthenner house, which played with the memory of Goethe's garden house in Weimar, significantly shaped the ideal of stylishly restrained living culture. Paul Schmitthenner was not a friend of modern avant-garde, as it manifested itself in the Weißenhofsiedlung in Stuttgart. After he identified himself with the Third Reich in 1933, he later became an opponent of Nazi state architecture and made no secret of it in public. His repeatedly printed lecture 'The Gentle Law in Architecture' (1941) reminded us of the secret of measure and number in body and space, of which modern art knows nothing more in its boundlessness.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>
Spaces of Action and Remembrance: The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria and National Socialism ¤ Did churches have spaces for action during the NS time, how were they used and where was there voluntary adaptation? The volume explores the church's behavioral spectrum under the NS dictatorship. Using the example of the Bavarian state church under National Socialism, the contributions compare, on the one hand, the attitudes of church protagonists, church leadership personnel, and the actions of bishops. On the other hand, they investigate the different action variants of individual church communities. Thus, a comprehensive picture emerges that shows the boundaries and spaces of church action. Furthermore, the volume brings the church's handling of its own role in National Socialism into focus and reconstructs the historical development of church memory since the end of the war.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073444-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041316-0>
Genus - Sexus - Gender ¤ This volume brings together the latest empirical research on the connections between grammatical gender, natural gender, and the social category of gender. This trio operates on various levels: lexically and semantically, morphologically, syntactically, pragmatically, and in texts and discourse. These categories prove to be deeply entrenched within the German lexis and grammar. They reflect old orders of gender but also how they have transformed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1186727241> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124912-4>

Autonomous Systems and Work: Perspectives, Challenges, and Limits of Artificial Intelligence in the Workplace ¤ Intelligent planning systems and smart robots: In the future, autonomous systems based on the principles of artificial intelligence will also gain a foothold in the world of work. This raises not only new questions about the consequences for jobs and qualifications - the actual application possibilities of these systems and the resulting labor policy and ethical problems are still unclear. This volume makes an interdisciplinary contribution to the ongoing discourse.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002641-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033447-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143713-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002805-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1072179776>
European Spa Towns and Fashion Resorts of the 19th Century: International Expert Meeting of the German National Committee of ICOMOS, the State Office for the Preservation of Monuments Baden-Württemberg at the Regional Government Stuttgart and the City of Baden-Baden Baden-Baden, 25-27 November 2010 ¤ World resorts as World Heritage? - In the 19th century, there are a handful of places in Europe that develop into communication centers for an international clientele: nobles and citizens, industrialists and artists, the healthy and the sick seek these places annually for several weeks and months and shape social life with their demands and interests: spa houses, casinos, music pavilions, grand hotels, villas, society baths, horse racing tracks, sports fields, mountain railways - all of this emerges in the exchange relationship between supply and demand. Access is available to everyone who can afford it. - - In November 2010, the German National Committee of ICOMOS, together with the State Office for the Preservation of Monuments Baden-Württemberg and the City of Baden-Baden, held an international expert meeting in Baden-Baden, which dealt with the profile and significance of these internationally shaped spa towns. The occasion was provided by the thinking of several spa towns in Europe about an application for inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage List. With the event, an initial impulse for a joint application was to be given. - - In seventeen contributions, which are documented in this volume, answers were sought to various questions: What do the spa towns say about the social conditions and changes in the 19th century? To what extent do they anticipate the Europe of the 20th century? Are there the same phenomena at the same time at different locations? Where are the differences? Is there a typical physiognomy of the spa towns? What is the relationship between intangible and tangible cultural heritage?

The Fantastic Film : History and Function in the Media Society ¤ Klappentext: The Fantastic is not only a thematic area in the texts and films of the genre, but always also refers to specific properties and possibilities of the medium, not least of the film, and acquires its own medial qualities. The book shows at central examples, how in the medium of the Fantastic, problem potential of the time is grasped, processed and worked on in a specifically way, especially questions about the reality of man and the experienceability of his world.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126326-1>
Streitfall Zweisprachigkeit : [... gathers selected contributions to a conference that took place in October 2007 ... at the University of Hamburg] ¤ The question of whether bilingualism of migrants is a positive, individual as well as socially useful competence is controversial. The conference offers a forum for interdisciplinary and international exchange on the latest research results on this question - and thus also on the objectification of the debates on the 'Streitfall Zweisprachigkeit'.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068227-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123440-6>

The Plan Trilogy accompanies the beginning of the truly 'urban' century: Since 2007, for the first time in history, more people live in cities than in the countryside. At the same time, we observe a new drive of 'city-making': Urbanism is increasingly taking place in indeterminate processes and in self-organization. Urbanism 'from below', initiatives like 'City from Below' and other open networks are today the driving forces.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115645-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056795-3>
Agglomerations - Situation and Perspectives : 8th Young Forum of the ARL, June 1-3, 2005 in Gelsenkirchen ¤ Agglomeration areas have long been considered centers of economic, political, and cultural life. This is particularly true for Germany, which, with a population density of 231 inhabitants per square kilometer, ranks among the most densely populated European countries. Currently, spatial planning policy, spatial planning, and spatial research are facing special and diverse challenges in the agglomeration areas. The combination of deindustrialization, demographic and social change, and regional structural change leads to strong upheavals in this type of space, which, in terms of their effects and the resulting action requirements, are still discussed too little. Against this background, the Young Forum 2005 of the Academy for Spatial Research and Land Planning dealt with the situation and perspectives of the federal German agglomeration areas at its conference from June 1 to 3, 2005 in Gelsenkirchen. In addition to basic questions, four thematic areas were particularly addressed:	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069106-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056730-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164789-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129504-3>
Resilience for the VUCA World: Developing Individual and Organizational Resilience ¤ VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity) determines our environment, in both private and corporate contexts. Crises are on the agenda, so that crisis anticipation, adaptation, regeneration from, and learning from the crisis are becoming increasingly important for a successful life and work design. This crisis competence is called resilience. Coaches, executives, and entrepreneurs receive a comprehensive overview of approaches to resilience in this anthology. The content: • Holistic approaches to individual and organizational resilience • VUCA world as a constant of future working worlds • Measurement of resilience strength of individuals, teams, and organizations • Neurobiological and medical foundations of resilience • Individual resilience strengthening • Practical examples of resilience promotion The target groups Coaches, consultants, executives The editor Prof. Dr. Jutta Heller is a coach, author, and consultant for individual and organizational resilience. She has been self-employed for over 25 years and has been training resilience consultants since 2015. Her main focus is on companies to support the development of resilience for individuals, teams, and the entire organization. She was the initiator and organizer of the Erdinger Coaching Congress of the University of Applied Management from 2014 to 2017.

The tertiarization of the economy is advancing dynamically in the highly developed industrial nations. At the same time, the competition intensity is increasing in increasingly global service markets. The marketing science is therefore increasingly facing the challenges of service marketing. Since 1991, marketing researchers from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland have been dealing with topics of service research in the framework of an annual workshop. The present volume documents the contributions to the 12th Service Workshop, which was held in March 2007 by the Institute for Marketing and Service Research at the University of Rostock. The authors approach the current research questions of service marketing from different perspectives. All contributions are characterized, however, by the fact that the presented concepts and solution proposals offer a wide range of suggestions for further research, but also for science-interested practice beyond the respective branches.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037589-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012178-1>

Crimes of the Wehrmacht : Dimensions of the War of Annihilation 1941 - 1944 ¤ The war of the Soviet Union differed from all wars of European modernity, also from those that the German Wehrmacht led during the Second World War in other countries. It was a war that targeted not only another army, but also parts of the civilian population. The Jewish population was to be murdered, non-Jewish civilians were to be decimated by hunger and terror and employed for forced labor. This criminal conduct did not arise from the escalation of the war situation, but was already part of the war plans. For what happened concretely during the German occupation in the East, the war plans were, however, only a determining factor. Furthermore, each individual case was shaped by concrete action conditions, determined by current influences and influenced by the behavior and action patterns of the actors.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033151-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076906-9>
Alternative Concepts of Social Security ¤ The present volume contains the papers presented at the annual conference of the Committee on Social Policy in 1997. Hans Jürgen Rösner deals with the structural and organizational principles of social security. As functions that have to fulfill a new paradigm, integration, consensus promotion, risk insurance, productivity promotion, and the survival ability of the security system are highlighted. Roland Eisen is concerned with alternatives of care insurance. The models of private voluntary insurance, private compulsory insurance, state social insurance, and social assistance are discussed. In addition, the author assigns them the solutions chosen in 12 member states of the European Union. A more in-depth comparison of the German, English, and Danish systems follows. Johannes Schwarze examines the American and German old-age security system with regard to the level of security, old-age poverty, and income distribution. The institutional comparison shows that the American old-age security system is strongly oriented towards avoiding old-age poverty, while the German system aims at securing living standards over a broad income range. However, the empirical comparison of the income situation of the elderly population shows that the German system better fulfills both the goal of poverty avoidance and the goal of securing living standards in old age. Richard Hauser analyzes concepts of minimum security for the elderly in twelve EU member states. Based on a systematization of the regulations existing in the countries, institutionally based hypotheses about their effectiveness are formulated. The empirical analysis based on data from the Luxembourg Income Study Project, however, shows that poverty in old age occurs in all countries despite the diverse minimum regulations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001479-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001420-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120509-1>

Enterprise of Mercy : Identity and Change in Social Service Provision ; Frameworks - Perspectives - Best Practice Examples ¤ Cliffnotes: The structural change in the voluntary welfare sector has reached the institutions of social service provision. They are increasingly reorganizing themselves and redefining their external relationships. At the same time, a wave of management professionalization has set in. This collection presents concrete examples of the efforts of social service organizations and welfare associations to meet these challenges. Based on these projects, the authors ask about the value of concepts such as vision, communication, efficiency, or dynamics. Furthermore, the book contains the demand to also modernize one's own ideas of management. The book, which arose on the occasion of the 125th anniversary of the Liebenau Foundation (Disability and Elderly Care), is a benefit for all executives in the voluntary welfare sector, as it presents perspectives for learning- and change-capable organizations through case examples and pleads for a new 'culture of service'. In addition to practitioners, scholars from theology, welfare research, and management science are heard in the book.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037278-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077579-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055710-8>
Health - Ethics - Economics: Economic and Moral-Economic Perspectives of the Healthcare System ¤ In the shadow of highly encouraging medical and medical-technical progress, the healthcare system is exposed to growing financial burdens. In the face of the emerging development of technical, demographic, and not least legal framework conditions, dramatic conflicts over the dwindling funds are foreseeable. Despite the obvious inefficiencies of the existing system, economists' proposals for improvement have so far been implemented only to a limited extent; some even meet with unanimous rejection from doctors, ethicists, and experts from other disciplines. -- Some of the objections presented can be easily refuted: While medical care (unlike	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066439-9>

Economic Areas of the Future : Development of Areas for Knowledge-Intensive Companies ; Documentation of a Specialist Conference of the German Institute for Urbanistics and the City of Heidelberg on January 24 and 25, 2013 in Heidelberg ¤ In the last few decades, the spectrum of company locations has expanded significantly against the backdrop of the structural change described at the beginning. It goes far beyond the traditional image of production-oriented areas, which is associated with the term industrial areas. In particular, the area offers for knowledge-intensive companies were the focus of the specialist conference Economic Areas of the Future, whose contributions are documented in this volume. The following guiding questions were discussed at the event: Which location factors are important for knowledge-intensive companies, what role can spatial proximity play in a increasingly globalized world? What strategies and approaches are there to develop areas for knowledge-intensive companies? How can impulses from universities and research institutions be used for area development? How can conversion areas be used for the development of locations for knowledge-intensive companies?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077832-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4803997-4>
Quality of Life in Old Age: Gerontological and Ethical Perspectives on Aging and Dementia ¤ In the ethical discourses on successful aging, questions about the good life and corresponding quality of life are at the center of interest. Interdisciplinary gerontological research examines how, in social communication processes, both widely accepted and controversially discussed models and evaluations of life in old age are formed. These conceptions of quality of life in old age also have an impact on the handling of ethical conflicts in medicine and care. Therefore, this volume integrates the gerontological and medical-ethical questions and deepens this interconnection exemplarily by the example of dealing with dementia.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071757-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001446-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015602-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011404-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034922-6>

Legislation as a Means of Perestroika: Wish and Reality ¤ The contributions of the collective volume analyze the legislative activity on different legal fields within the framework of the Soviet reform from a legal, economic, and political/social science perspective; the focus is on the legal novelties of 1988/89. In particular, the authors deal with the complex of business law (company law, labor law, cooperative law, foreign trade law), with the striving for "more democracy" (constitutional and electoral law amendments), with the development of "socialist rule of law" (judicial reform proposals) as well as with the transformation of social law in the sense of a "strong social policy". The volume concludes with a balance of the development of law in the Soviet Union.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193962-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020682-8>

The German Empire in Controversy ¤ The volume provides an important contribution to the ongoing debates about the German Empire (1871-1918). Renowned experts on the German Empire from international backgrounds provide an overview of the current state of research and raise new, guiding questions. The book is aligned along four axes, marking the themes and problems that have been the focus of controversies about the Empire in recent years: the location of the Empire in German history; the relationship between society, politics, and culture; forms of military violence with their focus on World War I, and finally the transnational entanglement of Germany in the age of the	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020531-9>
The East Germans in the Media : the Image of the Others after 1990. [... Project Workshop in December 2007 at the Institute for History of the University of Vienna ...] ¤ Media shape opinions. This applies in particular to German reunification and the social process of reunification after 1990. The need for mutual information was just as great as the curiosity on both sides - but traditional identities and new conflict situations created in West German media at the same time a wide space for questionable media attributions to the East Germans. The authors of this collective volume investigate in six contributions on an empirical basis how the East Germans are represented in the media of the old Federal Republic and the united Germany and what effects this has on those thus constructed. It is thus at the same time a building block for a German-German perception history after the end of the two-state system.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037877-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127240-7>

Apostle of Beauty ¤ He could almost be called a polymath: as a scholar who was curious, educated, and successful in many fields. Born in Partenkirchen in 1845, Max Schultze spent his working life between 1872 and 1912 as the architect of the House of Thurn and Taxis in Regensburg and created something grand, lasting, and above all sustainable. Schloss St. Emmeram owes him its current appearance. The essence of his work leads us further into various fields and different themes. In fact, his activities in photography, painting, drawing, but also in homeland and nature conservation were 'only' hobbies. His complex work, however, shows a professional, a busy artist, a versatile interested and active person who approached all his occupations with the same enthusiasm. Approximately 100 years after the death of Max Schultze, the exhibition in Regensburg and the exhibition catalog extensively illuminate his life. More than 40 authors from the fields of science, nature conservation, photography, etc. have compiled their research results. Much has come to light, been acquired, and numerous archival materials have been examined and evaluated. This diverse work represents a time that was characterized by conservatism and yet stood for a new beginning like no other. Max Schultze was a child of this exciting, innovative, and torn era	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132718-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037220-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115348-0>
Education, Training and Gender: Masculinities in Focus of Gender Studies; [Annual Conference 2009 of the Commission 'Pedagogical Anthropology' in the German Society for Educational Science] ¤ The educational science has taken up the theoretical discussions, which in other humanities and social sciences disciplines have been led about the difference between 'sex' and 'gender', about the radical deconstruction of Judith Butler and about questions of performativity and intersectionality, and has connected to them. 'Doing gender' has led to studies that reconstruct the construction of gender through practices. In parallel, an explicit masculinity research has developed in recent years, which has organized itself in interdisciplinary working relationships and strongly follows the theoretical work of Connell, but also Bourdieu's concept of 'masculine habitus'. In the framework of educational science, works on male socialization, on unbounded masculinity and on fatherhood have emerged. The present volume deals with the connection between education, training and gender in interdisciplinary perspectives, in which, in addition to educational science, sociology and literary science are represented.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4482930-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044302-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123701-8>
Blind for History? : Arab Encounters with National Socialism ¤ In this volume, a circle of experts expresses itself comprehensively in ten contributions for the first time on the encounter of the Arab world with National Socialism. This also includes the forgotten stories of North African colonial soldiers who served as "cannon fodder" in the fight against Nazi Germany, critical Arab evaluations of National Socialism, or the fates of Arabs and Muslims who died in German concentration and prisoner-of-war camps. British journalist Robert Fisk called the Arabs "blind to history" a few years ago when it came to their relationship with National Socialism and its crimes against the Jews. But being "blind to history" would also mean not asking the question of contemporary Arab perspectives on this time. The fragments of the common history of Arabs and Jews with National Socialism are also massively instrumentalized in the political conflict on both sides today.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041316-0>
Traffic Development in Urban Regions: Effects of Spatial and Economic Trends; Action Approaches; Documentation of a Seminar of the German Institute for Urban Studies on June 26 and 27, 1996 in Berlin ¤ The publication documents the presentations of the seminar, with which the German Institute for Urban Studies opened a series of events under the motto "Science and Municipal Practice in Dialogue". In the seminar, first research results from the joint project "Ecologically Compatible Mobility" were presented and discussed. The presented results were linked to the presentation and discussion of approaches by the responsible actors from a series of cities and from the economy. In the center were not only current and future trends in the influencing factors of the traffic phenomenon such as spatial structures and economic-technical structural change. Rather, it went further to primarily assess strategies and measures for ecologically compatible mobility.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056783-7>

Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Hans Joachim Iwand – Critical Theologians in Service of the Church ¤ Contributions by Lüpke: Dr. Johannes von Lüpke is Professor of Systematic Theology at the Kirchliche Hochschule Wuppertal/Bethel. Contributions by Tietz: Dr. theol. Christiane Tietz is Professor of Systematic Theology at the Institute for Hermeneutics and Religious Philosophy at the University of Zurich and Chair of the German-speaking Section of the International Bonhoeffer Society. Hans Joachim Iwand (1899–1960) and Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906–1945) are among the most significant evangelical theologians of the 20th century. Their life paths show interesting connections: Both engaged critically with the theology and (church-) politics of their time and committed themselves to the Confessing Church. The present collection of essays, which originated from a symposium held by the Hans Iwand Foundation in Dortmund in 2014, examines similarities and differences in biographical terms as well as in terms of theological themes that determined the life's work of Iwand and Bonhoeffer. This is not only a historical comparison of theology, but the goal is also to deepen the insight into the peculiarity of their theological thinking and to derive impulses from it that will challenge and help us theologically today. The topics treated include the commitment to peace, the understanding of mandates and orders, the preaching of the law, the concept of a right to resistance, the respective sin and reality understanding, the way of speaking about the 'mature world', the reception of Nietzsche, the connection between confession, forgiveness of sins, and the Eucharist, the importance of eschatology also in view of 'salvation for this world', the concept of theological ethics, and the respective church understanding. In a prospect, the authors discuss the question of what should be discussed with Bonhoeffer and Iwand in view of the current situation of church and theology. Contributions by Neddens: Dr. theol. Christian Johannes Neddens is pastor of the Independent Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Brunsbrock and Stellenfelde as well as youth pastor and emergency chaplain. Contributions by den Hertog: Dr. Gerard den Hertog is Professor of Systematic Theology at the Theologische Universiteit Apeldoorn.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059758-1>
Between Enlightenment, Policey and Administration: On the Genesis of the Medical System 1750-1850 ¤ The emergence of the medical system in Germany is characterized by several profound changes of the late absolutist territorial state. Tendencies towards centralization and regulation are evident in the field of medicine and public health of the population in the 18th century. The progressive processes in the shaping of the medical system cannot be located solely in the field of medicine, nor in that of administration or police, but are - as moments of a far-reaching political and social transformation - a mixture of different discursive strands, administrative practices, and government techniques. The eleven contributions of the volume deal with three focal points: 1. Medical police as an interdiscourse between police, enlightenment, and medicine 2. The development of medical competence, the control of healing persons, and the exclusion of unauthorized healers 3.

Monuments of Concrete : Bunkers in Cities and Landscapes ¤ To be found in Europe. Again and again, there have been attempts to demolish these often monumental buildings, to give them a new use or to preserve them as memorials and museums. However, the question of how to deal appropriately with these memorial sites is still leading to controversial discussions, as the bunkers' ruins, left behind by the Third Reich, are indeed part of the most difficult heritage of German history. - - In the present volume, which owes its origin to an international conference, organized by the University of Oldenburg in cooperation with the Johannes a Lasso Library in Emden, art historians, architects, exhibition makers, and artists approach the complex topic from completely different perspectives. They address the question of where the increasing interest in these concrete giants comes from, what makes them fascinating, and how they can be used appropriately. This is exemplified by treating bunker facilities, among others, in Frankfurt/M., Emden, Kiel, Braunschweig, Bug/Rügen, Schweinfurt, and Berlin as well as Vienna and London	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147004-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133624-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114333-4>
Education Mobility: Studies on the Individualization of Working-Class Daughters in Modernity ¤ The contributions deal with mobility processes of women, exclusively those of working-class daughters, against the backdrop of individualization and modernization processes. Their mobility is often prompted by school as an instance of individualization, where ... the social origin culture often experiences a contradiction to the requirements of higher school with its demands for education, intellectuality, and theoretical ability. Therefore, socialization and education processes must be reflected both in connection with reproduction and with the change of social structure. The individual essays deal with the following topics: 1) A historical consideration of education processes of proletarian women. 2) A feminist engagement with the terminology of previous research when it speaks of 'working-class women'. 3) An attempt to describe the way of ascent as a way with processes of alienation and re-appropriation using a deep hermeneutic analysis of fairy tales. 4) A description of the connection between gender-specific socialization, education ascent, and gender identity. 5) A comparison of the biographies of two working-class daughters studying. 6) A study on the connection between study subject, gender, and social origin, using the example of distance students. 7) A comparison of the study behavior of working-class and academic daughters. 8) Interview material for the comparison of the study situation of working-class sons and daughters at a university.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112762-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060290-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112560-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077572-0>

Luginsland. Architecture with a View : [Exhibition] ¤ The building type of 'view architecture' emerged in the course of tourist developments in the 19th century and has increasingly gained attractiveness. On the one hand, view buildings are created that - having wandered into the cities - serve as visitor platforms for curiosity and location marketing; on the other hand, projects have gained a new meaning in the context of ecological interest, where the goal is the ascent and the view into the habitats of the forest, a goal that is also followed by the 'tree top trails'. The richly illustrated publication with photos, models, and plans sketches a panorama of architectural interventions from the last fifteen years. Topics such as architecture and landscape, ecology and habitat, or the history of seeing and looking out are dealt with just as much as the interplay between architecture and art or architecture and engineering. The criterion for the selection of towers, platforms, and small architecture was less their size and prominence than their architectural quality	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136859-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140255-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4203577-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033573-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059261-3>
Revolution and Counter-Revolution in European Image Publishing 1789 - 1889 ¤ This systematically compiled volume opens up - below 'high art' - an international image culture that has so far received little attention from specialists and art historians. All contributions focus on the particularly rich iconographic production of the 'Century of Revolutions' (ca. 1770-1871). From portrait and fashion prints to political allegories and caricatures, and from geographical maps to popular picture books, practically all print-based image genres of this extended 'threshold period' (Reinhart Koselleck) are examined in detail with regard to their own production and reception conditions, their potential for memory, and their European networking.

Anatomy of Exclusion : Theory and Practice of Critical Social Work ¤ In excerpts, the book shows current developments in the theory and practice of social work, by tracing the historical conditions of social work and making clear the complex relationships in which subjects are to be located. It becomes apparent that the changes that began in the 1970s and have continued to this day in the structure and content of social work are primarily neoliberal adjustments. As a consequence of this transformation, both the situation of clients and the situation of social work itself become increasingly precarious. Possibilities are shown for how professionals can build structures of counter-hegemonic critical practice for themselves and for the users of social work. The content • Institutional organization of poverty • The anatomy of society • Psychosocial destruction of the subject in neoliberalism • Perspectives of a critical practice of social work The target groups • Researchers in the research contexts of social work and social affairs • Students and lecturers in the departments of social work / social pedagogy • Professionals in social work and social pedagogy The authors Dr. Ingo Zimmermann is Professor of Social Work at the Catholic University of North Rhine-Westphalia, Münster.

Believe against each other - research together? : Paradigm shift in early modern science cultures ¤ Den inhaltlich-thematischen Ausgangspunkt des Bandes bildet das sich verändernde Verhältnis von frühneuzeitlicher Astronomie und Physik zur christlichen Religion im Allgemeinen und zu ihren konfessionsspezifischen Ausprägungen im Besonderen. Vor diesem Hintergrund nehmen die versammelten Beiträge exemplarisch die entsprechenden, mit dem Wandel des Weltbildes verbundenen Prozesse anhand des zur Transkonfessionalität tendierenden Paradigmenwechsels in den frühneuzeitlichen Wissenschaftskulturen in den Blick. Dabei bieten die Welt, deren Bilder einen Wandel durchliefen, die Naturwissenschaften, die den Wandel vorantrieben, und die Theologien, die sich von einstigen Gewissheiten über Gott und Welt verabschiedeten, sich neu konstituierten und das Leben sowie die Naturforschung in der Frühen Neuzeit entscheidend mitbestimmten, eine dankbare Fläche für eine interkonfessionell vergleichende Untersuchung konfessioneller Spezifika.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048946-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041408-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059758-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003311-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045956-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136343-7>

Heiligkeiten : Constructions, Functions, and Transfer of Sanctity Concepts in Early and High Medieval Europe ¤ What functions did sanctities, saints, and hagiographies have in early and high medieval Europe? How were they constructed and how did the spatial transfer of sanctity concepts succeed? The authors of this volume examine the diversity of sanctities and the underlying conceptions. Through an analysis of narrative design strategies and the used representation media, they show how justification and argumentation strategies differ for different types of saints. The investigation includes both usage contexts as well as involved persons and groups and their interest in the functionalization of saint veneration and hagiographies. This approach enables the understanding of the formation of medieval discourse communities around saints and sanctities and the use of hagiographic texts in social, religious, societal, and religious-political questions.

Proceedings of the fifth HPI Cloud Symposium "Operating the Cloud" 2017 ¤ Version control is a widely used practice among software developers. It reduces the risk of changing their software and allows them to manage different configurations and to collaborate with others more efficiently. This is amplified by code sharing platforms such as GitHub or Bitbucket. Most version control systems track files (e.g., Git, Mercurial, and Subversion do), but some programming environments do not operate on files, but on objects instead (many Smalltalk implementations do). Users of such environments want to use version control for their objects anyway. Specialized version control systems, such as the ones available for Smalltalk systems (e.g., ENVY/Developer and Monticello), focus on a small subset of objects that can be versioned. Most of these systems concentrate on the tracking of methods, classes, and configurations of these. Other user-defined and user-built objects are either not eligible for version control at all, tracking them involves complicated workarounds, or a fixed, domain-unspecific serialization format is used that does not equally suit all kinds of objects. Moreover, these version control systems that are specific to a programming environment require their own code sharing platforms; popular, well-established platforms for file-based version control systems cannot be used or adapter solutions need to be implemented and maintained. To improve the situation for version control of arbitrary objects, a framework for tracking, converting, and storing of objects is presented in this report. It allows editions of objects to be stored in an exchangeable, existing backend version control system. The platforms of the backend version control system can thus be reused. Users and objects have control over how objects are captured for the purpose of version control. Domain-specific requirements can be implemented. The storage format (i.e. the file format, when file-based backend version control systems are used) can also vary from one object to another. Different editions of objects can be compared and sets of changes can be applied to graphs of objects. A generic way for capturing and restoring that supports most kinds of objects is described. It models each object as a collection of slots. Thus, users can begin to track their objects without first having to implement version control supplements for their own kinds of objects. The proposed architecture is evaluated using a prototype implementation that can be used to track objects in Squeak/Smalltalk with Git. The prototype improves the suboptimal standing of user objects with respect to version control described above and also simplifies some version control tasks for classes and methods as well. It also raises new problems, which are discussed in this report as well.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7623494-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123065-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053474-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006650-2>

Limits of Transgression : Controversies around Transculture, Transgender, and Transspecies ¤ Transgender, transculture, transnationality - concepts of trans are experiencing a political and scientific boom. In them, the demand for an opening of sociocultural identities is being made. However, the fluid boundaries of national, social, and bodily spaces are threatening to solidify again in traditions and neoracisms: So, values of the bourgeois small family as well as right-wing populist positions are not only repeatedly discussed, but reproduced in various media and social channels. The contributions of the volume therefore ask: Through which processes do trans concepts essentialize - and at which normative boundaries do they break?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035964-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128337-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026482-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7739736-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076527-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7619945-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4519498-1>
Emissions from agricultural soils : KTBL/vTI conference from 8 to 10 December 2010 at the Bildungszentrum Kloster Banz in Bad Staffelstein ¤ The reduction of emissions is an important goal for air purification and the mitigation of climate change. While emissions from animal husbandry are already relatively well quantifiable, the height of emissions from soils is still afflicted with greater uncertainties. In particular, it is not clarified to what extent, in addition to direct emissions at the site, indirect emissions through the excretion of nitrate and resulting hydrogen sulfide formations at other sites are to be taken into account. The conference contributions provide information on nitrous oxide, ammonia, carbon dioxide, and methane emissions, as well as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds. The state of knowledge, strategies, and practical solutions for reducing emissions, as well as findings on the fundamental emission-influencing factors, are presented (Source: KTBL).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014573-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164578-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4007348-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034421-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183288-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4438735-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169678-5>

Canon, Evaluation and Mediation: Literature in the Knowledge Society ¤ The present collection of essays deals with the theory and practice of literature mediation in the 'post-bourgeois' knowledge society and considers various aspects: It examines how 'extra-literary' factors such as power and economy steer the evaluation and canonization of contemporary literary works, what effect medial conditions, e.g. Web 2.0, can be attributed to, and how internal literary factors affect evaluation processes. In the first part, models and methodological basic questions of the evaluation and canon discussion are presented, while the second part examines canonization processes in institutions of the literary business. The question of what role evaluation actions and the concept of the canon play in current literature mediation is dealt with in the third part. The book is addressed to all those who deal with questions of canon formation, evaluation, and literature mediation in the literary business and literary science. The book presents the results of a conference held in the spring of 2010 by members of the Promotionskolleg 'Evaluation and Canon. Theory and Practice of Literature Mediation in the 'post-bourgeois' Knowledge Society', which aimed to track down the changed global societal conditions in terms of dealing with literature in a narrower and broader sense. The entirety of the contributions has an essayistic-exemplary character, which impressively shows – whether intended or not – that the common denominator of the underlying 'post-bourgeois' knowledge society has grown so large that one can hardly notice the commonalities anymore. This is also an observation of those who regularly deal with collections like the present one: The trend of conferences and their written results clearly shows in all directions – diversification is the magic word of the present (literaturkritik.de)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035964-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131583-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7540330-4>

Strangers in the City : Orders, Representations and Social Practices ; (13th - 15th century) ¤ Blurb: Whether pilgrims, Jews, merchants, Saracens or slaves: strangers play a significant role in the medieval city. This is reflected in order designs on normative, everyday practical and artistic levels, which are inspired and changed by strangers. With relational perception and the various attributions of difference, specific relationships of inclusion and exclusion are connected within urban society. Accordingly, the status and function of strangers change from political and economic partners or cultural and knowledge bearers to internal and external enemies. The range of their representations extends from the privileged personality to the dominated object. The volume analyzes these fields of tension interdisciplinarily with a focus on Italian cities between 1200 and 1500.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056723-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155370-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4181935-4>

Myths of the Nations: A European Panorama ¤ Blurb: Peoples and nations draw upon historical events to reassure themselves of their origins and identity. This is particularly evident in 19th-century Europe, as a result of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, which created a need for historical legitimation in the still young European nations. In part, long-past events are brought into the national memory, especially in paintings and graphics. They often acquire mythic dimensions in the process. For the first time, this book brings together, in a 17-country European comparison, historically significant events depicted in 19th-century representations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075159-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4286607-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041282-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037220-0>

Books, Publishers, Media ¤ For the first time, the book is made the medium of the thematic focus of the yearbook. For those exiled after 1933, it was not only an instrument of political enlightenment, but above all also a weapon in the anti-fascist struggle. The symbolic act of book burning by the National Socialists in May 1933 was immediately taken up by >other Germany< and strategically turned into an expression of cultural barbarism against National Socialism: The founding of the German Freedom Library in Paris in May 1934 exemplifies the claim of exile to preserve the humanistic tradition. The founding of book publishers and magazines symbolized a politically and literarily wide-ranging counter-publicity, and they created the conditions for the emergence of an exile literature, which, in terms of scope and rank, represents a singular phenomenon in world history. The contributions of the volume focus on the symbolic dimension of the book as well as the political function of magazines, achievements and working methods of the exile press, structures of the book trade, the reception of exile literature on the American book market, as well as the role of literary agents, not least the effects of the NS book theft and the publisher's continuation of the political exile after 1945	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4306899-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070334-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015961-9>
The Hamburg Beguines at St. Jacobi in Context of their Manuscripts and Culture ¤ BEGIN: From the Beguine convent at St. Jacobi in Hamburg, 14 Middle Low German manuscripts have been preserved, which provide a unique insight into the religious life of medieval women. The prayer books, together with archival materials from the convent such as the account books of the mistresses or wills, indicate an active role of the convent in late medieval Hamburg. From a religious profile perspective, the Hamburg prayer books in particular show cross-order influences of the Devotio moderna. This shows that this literature must be read in a geographically and religiously broader context. Already just liturgical and material similarities to traditions of North German dioceses and monasteries, e.g. monasteries in the Lüneburg Heath, illustrate how complex the networking of religious institutions was in the Late Middle Ages. Materially, the Hamburg codices lead into the hitherto little-known book culture of semi-religious women.

The Moving Image : Film and Art ¤ That the moving images of film can be considered from aesthetic and pictorial-theoretical perspectives may hardly surprise. It is all the more astonishing that art history has so far presented no comprehensive and systematic exploration of film. The authors' goal is therefore to demonstrate the sophisticated methodological and theoretical competence of art history as an image science, in order to present the exceptionally exciting range of their different approaches. Films by Antonioni, Lynch, Tarkovsky, and Renoir serve as the starting material for art-historical considerations of film history, film practices, and the socio-institutional and media-technical framework conditions of the cinematic apparatus.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140881-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006568-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120632-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114333-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017102-4>

Visual Arguments: The Mysteries of Representation and the Computability of the World ¤ In the year 1610, King James I of England lamented that >nothing was left unexplored<, neither the >highest mysteries of God<, nor the >deepest mysteries that belong to the persons of kings and princes, who are gods on earth.< With these words, the monarch described the impending, fundamental shifts in the structure of power mediation. For the political systems of the time were based on state theories that had established themselves through the visual implementation in representation. It was the iconic quality of the image that formed the basis of the representation systems of the Early Modern period. Only these could represent the mysteries of power, as required, appropriately. To what extent this conception was stripped of legitimacy by the increasingly professionalized arts and sciences of the Early Modern period and what counter-strategies were developed, is shown by the volume from different perspectives. The contributions come from the disciplines of art history, cultural studies, and German studies and address the hitherto hardly discussed question of the discrepancy between the mysteries of power and the computability of the world. In this context, the image plays a central role as a site of conflict as well as a site of attempts at harmonization. Horst Bredekamp is an art historian and professor of art history at the Humboldt University of Berlin. Research focuses: Iconoclasm, Romanesque sculpture, Renaissance and Mannerist art, political iconography, art and technology, new media	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4024596-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114382-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137492-7>
Automobil-Sensorik 3 : Principles, Technologies, and Applications ¤ About the Book The sensorics takes on a significant and strongly growing importance in the automobile. In the wake of the rapid developments in the field of vehicle technology, such as automated driving and electromobility, more precise and robust sensor information is indispensable. These informations are used in complex control algorithms of vehicle electronics, especially for object recognition, system monitoring, drive control, stability, safety, and comfort enhancement. In addition to the optimization of established sensor principles, new and hybrid sensor concepts and technologies are increasingly gaining importance for the generation of this information. The resulting sensor systems are subject to high technical requirements and increasingly high demands in terms of costs, miniaturization, quality, and reliability. In this technical book, sensor principles and technologies are described that reflect the trend of current sensor developments for forward-looking vehicle application areas. The focus of this edition lies on sensor systems that are used in the areas of automated driving, electromobility, interior detection, and user recognition. Scenario-based validation of a hybrid radar model for testing and validation of automated driving functions -- Coreless magnetic current sensors for high-performance E-drives -- High-integrated current sensors for electric vehicles -- Model-based temperature monitoring of HV components in electric vehicles -- Approaches to optical state determination in lithium-ion batteries for use in electric vehicles -- Innovative H2 sensorics for fuel cell vehicles -- High-frequency sensorics for direct loading recognition of diesel particulate filters -- 3D sensorics based on a time-of-flight camera for contactless vehicle control -- Miniaturized 3D time-of-flight camera for interior monitoring and gesture control in the vehicle -- Intelligent contactless gesture sensors for future vehicle access systems -- Data fusion-based, thermodynamic sensor model for interior temperature measurement -- High-integrated motor position sensors for braking systems and electric drives -- Innovative 3D Hall sensors with intelligent energy management and stray field suppression -- Position detection using a sensor array of tunnel magnetoresistive vortex dots and learning signal processing.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191569-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121663-5>

Architecture of Slovakia : Impulses and Reflections ; [on the occasion of the eponymous exhibition at the exhibition center of the Vienna Municipal Insurance Company AG in Vienna ; the exhibition is a co-production of the Vienna Municipal with the Slovak Association of Architects (SAS) ; exhibition duration: October 30, 2003 - February 29, 2004] ¤ *Further details Content: When recalling the geographical proximity of the capital cities Vienna and Bratislava, which are not even 50 kilometers or a short car ride apart, it becomes clear how little we know about this country. The catalog presents Slovak architecture in the 20th century, divided into 5 time periods. In addition to Bohuslav Fuchs, Vladimir Karfik, a long-time employee of Le Corbusier, or Bedrich Weinwurm, who have gained fame primarily through their work in Brno, it is necessary to present less well-known buildings in Bratislava and the interior of the country, such as the world-famous sanatoriums in the Tatra or the unique building situation in Pistian. Especially the first half of the past century was characterized by modernity, which worked here until 1948 due to the political circumstances. Due to the economic situation, the avant-garde was able to realize its ideas in an unprecedented density in the 1920s and 30s, which is why it is also called 'Bauhaus in the East' and emerged from the most committed art and architecture schools in Czech Republic and Slovakia.

Reformation in Islam : Perspectives and Limits ¤ That Islam can only exist in the modern world, shaped by democracy, secularism, and progress, if it undergoes a reformation, is claimed by some and denied by others and is the subject of a debate that has been ongoing to this day and can be traced back at least to the early 20th century. This collection allows voices for and against a reformation in Islam to be heard and brings the debate into the light of current events and challenges, including the rise of Salafism.

Lost Citizens? : Kurt Tucholsky and the Weltbühne Circle between Bourgeoisie and Workers' Movement : Documentation of the 2015 Annual Conference ¤ A 'lost citizen' – the Thomas Mann quote about the wannabe artist Tonio Kröger can be applied to most authors of the left-democratic weekly DIE WELTBÜHNE with slight modification. They were mostly of bourgeois origin, had studied – Carl von Ossietzky, the son of a petty bourgeois who grew up in poor conditions in Hamburg, was the exception that confirmed the rule. For this reason, also well-off writers from wealthy backgrounds, such as Kurt Tucholsky or Kurt Hiller, broke at least with their parents' houses and backgrounds in terms of political ideas, and like Ossietzky, sought an alliance with the industrial proletariat, which was separated from them by their way of life: a hope that soon shattered.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069722-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002581-0>

Societal Images in Transition: Sociological Perspectives in Germany ¤ The permanent interaction between society and sociology needs to be redefined. In light of the current cultural and technological changes and political transformations, the traditional arrangements of social integration and consensus-building at the end of the 20th century appear to be standing at the disposal. This not only necessitates the development of contemporary theoretical and analytical instruments, but also sketches the space for reflection, within which sociology develops at the beginning of the new century. Along the themes of theory and society, social inequality in the market society, and facets of civil society, the volume outlines the contours of a contemporary sociology and represents its analytical and diagnostic capabilities	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077587-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020588-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157063-7>
Supporting Learning Processes with Digital Tools : Perspectives from the Didactics of Natural Science Subjects ¤ Publisher's information: Computers, interactive whiteboards, smartphones, or tablets offer new opportunities for teaching natural sciences. Students are experienced in handling technology – the best prerequisites for using it in class? Studies show that Germany is significantly behind other countries in using digital media or computers in school education. What is the reason for this? What additional value do digital tools offer in terms of subject didactics? What are the current discussions, experiences, and results from the subject didactics of natural sciences? The three editors Dr. Jenny Meßinger-Koppelt (Project Manager for Natural Sciences, Joachim Herz Foundation), Prof. Dr. Sascha Schanze (Institute for the Didactics of Natural Sciences, Leibniz University Hannover), and Prof. Dr. Jorge Groß (Didactics of Natural Sciences, Otto-Friedrich University Bamberg) have published a new book on these questions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041421-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4196910-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070463-4>
Service Modeling: Methods, Tools, and Industry Solutions ¤ Methods, languages, and tools for service modeling -- Approach to comprehensive creation and processing of service models -- Modeling of product platforms for logistics services -- Analyzing information flows in service networks -- Concept of a modeling language for software tool-supported modeling, configuration, and evaluation of hybrid performance bundles -- Development processes of hybrid performance bundles – Evaluation of modeling methods considering cyclic influencing factors -- Service reference models and order frameworks -- Reference model-based authoring services -- Order frameworks for hybrid value creation -- Modeling of technical customer service processes of machine and plant construction as part of hybrid products -- Modeling of IT and consulting services -- Explanation and modeling of fuzzy aspects in IT-based service processes -- Service orientation in process management – Analysis of the potential of service-oriented architectures based on process models. In response to the increasing competitive pressure, companies are facing – in addition to rationalization and differentiation measures – primarily customer binding. A central role is played here by the expansion and customer-individual design of service offerings. The model-based development and continuous improvement of services are therefore gaining more and more importance. The book provides an overview of the methods used and shows future development perspectives. The numerous examples from different industries focus on models for service development and provision and, on the other hand, models of information systems that support the development and/or provision of services. They consider all life cycle phases of services as well as all "dimensions" of the service concept, which serve as a basis for the development of resource, process, and product models.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061963-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224244-7>
Water without Borders : Contributions to the Day of Hydrology on March 22/23, 2012 at the Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg ; [TdH 2012] ¤ From the foreword: Hydrology and water management require an integrative approach and therefore often encounter disciplinary, methodological, and administrative boundaries. Therefore, inter- and transdisciplinarity has increasingly gained importance both in hydrological research and in water management applications. The Day of Hydrology 2012 is therefore under the motto Water without Borders. The conference addresses and discusses works that explore these physical and disciplinary boundary areas, apply methods across barriers, and show approaches to overcoming boundaries. The 123 contributions are divided into three thematic areas: Theme 1: Boundary areas (research, modeling); Theme 2: Cross-boundary transitions (management, planning); Theme 3: Boundary transcendence (application, governance).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064821-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064734-1>

The Concept of Refugee: Legal, Moral, and Political Controversies ¤ Introduction -- I. Experiential perspectives -- II. Well-founded fear – The refugee concept as a legal concept -- III. Refugees Welcome – Moral implications and the ambivalences of the welcoming culture -- IV. Freedom of movement is everybody's right – Refugees as political actors -- V. Summary and outlook. For years, refugees have been discussed again and again – about open and closed borders, justified and unjustified asylum claims, about reception and deportation. What rights refugees have and what obligations exist towards them is contested. The book analyzes central problems of these moral, legal, and political debates and the social practices of dealing with refugees. At the same time, it introduces basic concepts of current flight and refugee research and focuses on the concept of refugee itself in interdisciplinary research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076226-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005248-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017604-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048821-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4215794-8>
The Bath as a Place of Leisure: Spaces, Carriers, and Practices of Bathing Culture from Antiquity to the Present ¤ What do bathing culture and otium have to do with one another? How the two are linked has so far barely been dipped into by researchers. To change that, the present conference volume diachronically investigates the culture and practices of bathing along with its architecture from antiquity to modern times.

Reproduction of Inequality through Work and Family ¤ Intergenerational Transfers and Support Services - Precarious Life Situations: State Regulation versus Individual Coping - Family Life Situation and Life Chances of Children A key finding of inequality research is that when analyzing social inequality, not only the individual but also the household and family must be taken into account. Families are powerful institutions of lifelong intergenerational solidarity. The social networks of individual family members represent social capital for all other family members; education, income, and parental status are essential resources for children. Those who had better individual starting positions in childhood and youth are also at an advantage in adulthood. Those who have children have support resources in higher age. However, all these socially desired transfers, resources, and family solidarity are accompanied by - at least potentially - undesirable consequences for the social structure, reproduction, and possibly an increase in overall societal inequality. The present volume aims to contribute to the clarification of at least some of the relevant questions in this context.

Fiscal Policy and Public Debt ¤ Main description: The conference volume on the 2004 work conference of the Financial Science Committee on the topic "Fiscal Discipline and Public Debt" offers in four contributions a competent overview of explanations for the strained situation of public budgets and instruments for overcoming them. -- Hans Fehr and Gitte Halder (University of Würzburg) quantify with the help of an intertemporal equilibrium model the budget and welfare effects of demographic development in Germany. The analysis shows that the problems cannot be solved alone by increased birth and immigration rates and that further reforms of the social systems are necessary to secure their financing. -- Heinz Grossekettler (University of Münster) examines the requirements of the European Stability and Growth Pact for the coordination of the budget policy of EU member states. In international comparison, the German stability pact proves to be little functional and substantial improvements are called for. -- Reinhard Neck (University of Klagenfurt) extends the tax smoothing theory of Barros to explain the development of public debt by economic and political influence factors and checks these hypotheses econometrically using the example of Austria. -- Gunnar Schwarting (Mainz) notes a worrying financial situation of the German municipalities. Their management is expected neither by conventional consolidation concepts nor by the regulatory and market-oriented instruments currently under discussion, but rather by municipal capital market ratings.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043153-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127795-8>
The Relevance of Ilse Arlt's Thinking ¤ Ilse Arlt founded the first welfare school in Vienna in 1913, part of the then Danube Monarchy. She combined this with the project of a scientific 'people's care'. In addition to her notable pedagogical activity, she dealt with the scientific foundation of care in an original way, published on household management, need theory, and economic aspects of need and people's care. Her last major publication dates from 1958, a few years before her death. Her contributions fell into oblivion. Arlt's name remained known in the Austrian social work community, but her theoretical work was not received. With her commendable diploma thesis, Ursula Ertl (1995) created the basis for a renewed engagement with Ilse Arlt's thoughts. She found a wealth of interesting material in her research. Only a few publications picked up the ball (Staub-Bernasconi 1996, Frey 2005). In 2007, the Institute for Social Inclusion Research was founded at the FH St. Pölten as a social work research institute. The team decided to give the institute the name of Ilse Arlt. A colloquium was to be held to pay a detailed tribute to the patroness. The engagement with the texts of the pioneer of scientific social work became an intellectual pleasure. We now want to share this pleasure with a broader professional public. The present reader brings together the contributions to the 1st Ilse Arlt Colloquium and is intended to stimulate a broader reception. Current work is underway for a reissue of Arlt's most important theoretical and autobiographical writings, which we will soon present to the professional public. Dr. Peter Pantucek is the head of the Bachelor's program in Social Work and the Ilse Arlt Institute for Social Inclusion Research at the FH St. Pölten. Dr. Maria Maiss is a lecturer in Philosophy, Ethics, and Social Work Theory at the FH St. Pölten. Ilse Arlt, pioneer of Austrian social work, considered social work as a scientifically grounded profession. With her critical attitude towards the care of her time, her need theory, and her pedagogical activity, she provided original contributions that are still surprisingly relevant today. The present volume introduces Ilse Arlt's biography and her thinking and places her theoretical considerations in the context of current social work scientific discourses.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055676-1>
Who pays, orders : (Un-)Dependencies of media content from media financing ¤ The media needs to be independent, but it also needs funding. Money, however, is rarely given without expecting a return service, or at least without strings attached. Readers only pay for what they want; advertisements are only booked in matching context, and public broadcasters are fighting for the acceptance of their contribution-based funding. New forms of financing, such as crowd funding, donations and new public-law creations, are attempts to counteract this interdependency of media content and media funding. However, these new forms of financing also entail new (and old) interdependencies.This documentation of a conference at the University of Passau attempts to examine this hypothesis of the (inevitable) dependency of content on funding. Aiming for an independent media sector, individual and, especially, innovative forms of financing are discussed and illustrated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4427177-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186820-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037877-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074661-6>

The functional and institutional diversity of this personnel and its integration into very different local and regional power structures have made the research of this field of practical administrative activity more difficult. The working group "Policey/Police in premodern Europe" has therefore discussed relevant research results at a working meeting, whose contributions are presented here.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115591-9>

With the lectures, a wide arc is drawn in two senses: once from current developments of important determinants in planning to expected future trends; on the other hand, in spatial terms from the municipal or regional focus beyond the three countries to the European level. In this context, concrete demands are also worked out with a view to the further development and further harmonization of spatial development within the framework of European integration.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177425-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048590-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049040-3>
Remotivierung : from Morphology to Pragmatics ¤ In this volume, researchers in German linguistics examine remotivation processes in German in the fields of morphology, word formation, phraseology, and pragmatics, and discuss their theoretical classification within the framework of grammaticalization and lexicalization processes and their counter-processes. This volume stands like the 2010 volume edited by Rüdiger Harnisch and also published in the LIT series, Processes of linguistic strengthening – Types of formal resegmentation and semantic remotivation in the tradition of Passau remotivation research. Starting from morphological research on language change processes, it becomes apparent that there are additional systematically comparable and thus parameterizable and typifiable counter-forces sui generis, in which linguistic units are elevated in formal and semantic status and thus formally resegmented and semantically remotivated. In addition to the sign-based remotivations in the form of reanalyses and pleonasms, this volume is particularly devoted to usage-based remotivations in the form of recontextualization and shows the broad applicability of the overarching concept of remotivation across all linguistic levels – from the morpheme to the textual and discursive level	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170590-7>

Through assistance functions, access to the web and radio, location and context capture, mobile services become the central individual medium for the exchange and processing of all professional and everyday information. This opens up new possibilities for action and innovation opportunities, offers relief and relief, but also creates new dependencies, additional data trails and risks of misuse. The decisive question is therefore how the new usage possibilities must be legally designed and supplemented in order to keep both development and innovation opportunities open, as well as to win the necessary trust of the user and ensure the protection of general interests ...

Social Aspects of Music Learning ¤ The investigation and description of music-related teaching and learning processes belong to the core themes of music education research. Questions about what, how, and what is learned, as well as which aspects are relevant in this context, etc., play a role in music education research competence as well as in philosophical considerations of education, comparative approaches, or historically oriented studies. The answers are correspondingly diverse. The 39th conference proceedings of the Music Education Research Working Group (AMPF) shines with its contributions to the annual conference in Bad Wildbad 2017 methodologically diverse in research, on the one hand, concrete specific questions about the social in musical learning processes. On the other hand, the contributions under this topic setting also go to societal and (education-) political considerations. In the overall view, it becomes apparent which tasks arise from focusing on social aspects of music learning for music education in research and practice.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4696474-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017894-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027266-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040843-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7693876-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170838-6>
Evangelical and German? : Diaspora Communities in the 20th Century between National Protestantism, Ethnic Politics, and Ecumenism ¤ In times when Germany is a target for immigration and flight from all parts of the world, it seems sensible to recall that this country has been primarily an emigration area for centuries and the history of many Germans has been shaped by emigration, flight, and exile until recent times. The essays offered in the present volume describe the handling of different types of evangelical diaspora communities with the political and social crises and breaks of the 20th century in their German homeland and host countries. The focus is on the years after World War I, National Socialism, World War II, and finally the time after 1945. It shows that evangelical diaspora communities had to redefine their relationship to their German homeland and the Evangelical Church in Germany repeatedly throughout the 20th century. With the theme of 'diaspora communities', ecclesiastical contemporary history research gains access to an interesting field of research that is connectable to current migration and global historical questions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4263346-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070334-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015829-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068999-2>
Migration in Europe : 64th Scientific Conference of the Association of German Economic Research Institutes on April 26 and 27, 2001 ¤ The demographic development in Germany over the next decades and the EU enlargement have led to a heated debate about the expected consequences for the economic development and economic policy of Germany. The conference contributions compiled here deal with the question of what significance labor migration will have in this context. So Henkel shows how urgently an increase in immigration is needed to counteract the decline in the working-age population and the resulting burden on the social security systems. -- In view of the integration of labor markets in the context of EU enlargement, Brücker and Flaig point out that the influence of unobserved, country-specific determinants of migration behavior brings great uncertainty. Walwei argues that the expected immigration does not justify a relaxation of efforts to strengthen the domestic labor force potential, and Bonin contradicts the expectation that future immigration must burden the public budgets. A positive contribution is all the more to be expected if the migration policy succeeds in achieving immigration of over-average qualified labor. In the question of possible positive effects of migration in the context of increased social mobility of the immigrating working population, Dietz shows to what extent uncertainties about the residence status or formal qualification requirements have hindered the social ascent of immigrants. Finally, von Löffelholz estimates that an intensification of the existing integration policy measures would induce very high social net gains	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0>
Female Science, Male Science : Symposium at the University of Oldenburg from June 15-16, 1983; Conference Contributions ¤ The symposium Female Science, Male Science, documented here, deals with the various dimensions of the role of women in the scientific community. On the one hand, the existing disadvantage of women in the university sector is shown and made clear that there can be no talk of the constitutionally guaranteed equal rights of man and woman. On the other hand, it is about the question of a female science, i.e., to what extent the female interest in knowledge can contribute to new scientific questions and beyond to other forms of work and communication.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066562-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020547-2>
Algorithmuskulturen : on the computational construction of reality ¤ High frequency trading, Google ranking, filter bubble - just three topical examples of the power of algorithms. This title presents a collection of contributions that deal with the historical emergence and wide distribution of algorithms that can be found in various aspects of social life today. They focus on the correlations between algorithmic and non-algorithmic actors and their significance for our daily lives and our social relationships and follow up on the mechanisms with which algorithms - products of a specific global access - frame reality while organizing the way how humans thinks about society. The contributions include case studies on social media, advertising and evaluation but also on mobile safety infrastructures, such as drones.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7651115-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026926-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1038714850> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123065-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169194-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125698-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001307-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194462-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4639271-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001183-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077624-4>
The Datified Animal: On the Animal Turn in Cultural and Media Studies ¤ As a result of the datification of animals and their medialization, new forms of togetherness emerge: animals, technology, and humans form a collaboration network. Notably, the enormous data masses transform the animal into a mediated transparency nature. This raises the question of who actually has the power of action and media competence. The contributions in this anthology take a look at these new, cross-species collaborations and socialities with their specific communication structures from an interdisciplinary perspective and investigate their technical and epistemological effects 1.

The Orient, the Foreigner : Positions of Contemporary Art and Literature ¤ The »Orient« as a cultural-geographical category is at the same time diffuse and overdetermined: changing between the clichés of tyranny and despotism on the one hand, sensuality and wisdom on the other. Although the idea of an oriental entity has been ideologically questioned, the topos is today not only idealized as a tourist destination in catalogs, but also in the current political situation as a picture of the Arab, oriental other mass-medially rewritten. In this context, art and literature have an important function as reflection media with which foreign images can be critically questioned. In ten interdisciplinary contributions, the present collection analyzes artistic and literary practices of the differentiation of the »oriental foreigner«.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035964-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114333-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121438-9>

Current Developments in Environmental Protection Law: Documentation of the 17th Leipzig Environmental Law Symposium of the Institute for Environmental and Planning Law of the University of Leipzig and the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research - UFZ on April 19 and 20, 2012 ¤ In light of the implementation of the European Industrial Emissions Directive into national law, a number of questions arise, particularly with regard to future permit requirements and the significance of BVT guidelines and conclusions. The documentation of the 17th Leipzig Environmental Law Symposium focuses on these questions. Several contributions deal with the requirements of the directive and its implementation, the corresponding draft law is presented in detail and critically evaluated from various sides. The remaining contributions are dedicated to other current issues in environmental protection law. On the one hand, air quality law and noise reduction planning are subjected to a balancing consideration. On the other hand, the conflicts between projects approved under environmental protection law and the requirements of spatial planning are examined in more detail. An overview of developments in case law rounds off the work. This volume is aimed at all those who are concerned with environmental protection law issues in science and practice.

Mysticism, Metaphor, Image : Contributions of the VII. Makarios Symposium Göttingen 2007 ¤ German and Finnish theologians discuss the basic questions of Christian mysticism based on authors from the Orient. These authors from the Iraqi-Iranian sphere (Aphrahat the Persian manner, Babai the Great, St. Hierotheos, Isaac of Nineveh, Makarios), play a crucial role in the field of Christian-Oriental mysticism. At the same time they take contributions also beyond this geographic area and go to the mysticism in the German context after Luther (Brandt, Kant) and provide a review, a critical voice to the concept of mysticism and its positioning in the German theology	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006619-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041003-1>

Einkommens- und Vermögensverteilung in historischer Sicht : Studies on the Development of Economic Theory XXXVII ¤ Die fortwährende gesellschaftliche Debatte über die angeblich wachsende »Kluft zwischen Arm und Reich« ist höchst aktuell und durch das Buch Pikettys »Das Kapital im 21. Jahrhundert« befeuert worden. Verteilungsfragen – wer bekommt wovon und wieviel und warum – wurden in der Volkswirtschaftslehre immer wieder diskutiert. Im vorliegenden Band wird in vier Aufsätzen auf die verteilungstheoretischen und -politischen Perspektiven verschiedener Autoren eingegangen. -- Schon bei Adam Smith, dem »Adam der politischen Ökonomie«, spielte das Postulat der natürlichen oder moralischen Gleichheit eine bedeutende Rolle, vor allem, wenn man sein moralphilosophisches Hauptwerk, die »Theory of Moral Sentiments«, seinem ökonomischen Hauptwerk, dem »Wealth of Nations«, zur Seite stellt. Dabei blickte er vor allem auf den Effekt, den materielle Ungleichheit auf die Schaffung von Wohlstand, auf die Stabilität der öffentlichen Ordnung und auf die Pflege der allgemeinen Moralität ausübt. Spätere Generationen von Ökonomen haben sich dann vor allem mit der Frage beschäftigt, aus welchen Quellen Profite und Zinsen entspringen und ob diese dauerhaft sind. Neben funktionellen und der personellen Verteilungsfragen stellen sich solche auf der regionalen Ebene. Das wurde in den regionalökonomischen Arbeiten von August von Lösch behandelt. Ganz aktuell ist die Frage, wie sich die Digitalisierung und Verbreitung von KI auf die Verteilung auswirken wird. / »Income- and Wealth Distribution in Historical Perspective« -- The ongoing social debate about the »gap between rich and poor« is currently topical, though not new. This volume contains contributions to the treatment of distribution questions by Smith, Ricardo, Marx and von Lösch. In addition, there is also a contribution to the question of how computerization and digitization will affect income and assets. Ricardo already asked himself the question, what might happen in the future when machinery will make human labour dispensable.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063086-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7>
Geographic Information Systems in Regional Planning : Documentation of the Workshop of the Academy for Spatial Research and Planning and the Greater Hannover Municipal Association ¤ The Geographic Information System (GIS) is gaining importance as a planning tool in regional planning. Various aspects of GIS applications, such as the quality and scope of spatially related base data, selection criteria and costs for a GIS introduction, cooperation issues, offers and services in the GIS sector, are of great concern to many users. In the framework of a workshop, practitioners, users, and experts dealt with the multitude of questions associated with the use of modern technology.

The Historical Jubilee: Genesis, Ordering Performance, and Staging History of an Institutional Mechanism ¤ The historical jubilee counts among those cultural self-evidences that are accepted and practiced all around and are therefore rarely questioned. Public and private memory and festival culture is almost unimaginable without jubilees. In each case, an individual sequence of events is prepared as a personal history from the overall complex of the transmitted history on the occasion of the jubilee cycle recurrence of the initial point, which is proven by sources or is only fictional. The historical jubilee is the symbol for this personal history. Through the reconnection to the past, the duration is signaled that means not only tradition but also implies a claim to validity for the future: The history staged in the jubilee is not a decline leading to a deadline, but a milestone filled with hopes and wishes. The automatism with which historical jubilees are celebrated by organizations and individuals lets the historical dimension of the jubilee cycle itself be forgotten. Here, the present volume starts, which originated from a conference within the framework of the Dresden Special Research Area 537 "Institutionalization and Historicity". Its goal is the historical derivation of a central institutional mechanism for modern memory culture.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129003-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019625-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160028-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4767147-6>
Elementary School between the Demands of Individualization and Standardization : [13th Anniversary of the Commission "Elementary School Research and Pedagogy of the Primary Stage" of the German Society for Educational Science ; Conference Proceedings] ¤ The elementary school as the first compulsory educational institution for all children has been facing the challenge since its founding in 1920 to be fair to the individual development of each child as well as to the standardized expectations of society. In the wake of international comparison studies (TIMSS, PISA, IGLU) with worldwide standardized school performance, the double task of the elementary school as well as the problems and possible follow-up costs associated with its fulfillment have again received renewed attention in scientific reflection within and outside elementary school pedagogy. The contributions brought together in this volume deal with the typical demands of standardization and individualization for work in elementary school on the basis of new research-based findings. Prof. Dr. Margarete Götz holds the chair for elementary school pedagogy and elementary school didactics at the University of Würzburg. Karin Müller is a scientific assistant at the chair for elementary school pedagogy and elementary school didactics at the University of Würzburg.

Social Pedagogical Professionalization in Crisis? ¤ Crisis are societal perceptions that contribute to the public awareness of various social problems, in order to be able to address them socially politically. Social pedagogy is involved in these crisis perceptions, not least because this brings about the conditions of its (un-)possible professional action, its qualification, political location but also coping. The book puts the question »social pedagogical professionalization in crisis?« on the one hand with contributions to fundamental research results, on the other hand with a view to political positioning in the focus.

Monuments in the Garden - the Garden as Monument: International Symposium from March 31 to April 2, 2011 in Schwetzingen ¤ The monument is a phenomenon that, in European garden art from the early modern period to the 19th century, has an equally important and changing significance. The spectrum ranges from the monument as a medium of politically dynastic programs in the princely gardens of Europe to historically relevant aspects of the monument, as an object and initial of preservation. - The present publication documents the results of an international symposium that took place in the background of the nomination of the electoral summer residence Schwetzingen for the UNESCO World Heritage List under the title "Monuments in the Garden - the Garden as Monument" in the spring of 2011 in Schwetzingen. It contains 22 contributions from renowned experts in the history of architecture, art, and garden art from eight European countries. With this, the conference volume presents the first comprehensive and systematic overall view of the complex of topics monument and garden.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140684-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004973-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155980-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125179-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7603271-1>

Already since antiquity, people have been trying to combine the advantages of living in the countryside with those of city life. From the perspective of landscape architecture, the internationally represented contributors discuss the development of high-quality, green, and sustainable living at the interface between city and country. Different perspectives of current planning theory and practice are presented. Against the background of further planning disciplines and influencing factors and in search of the best solutions for the future of the garden city in the extended sense, the texts (in German and English) call for integrative and broadly inspired planning, development, negotiation, and implementation.

Structural Change in Post-Mining Landscapes: Strategies for Sustainable Development ¤ The Saxon-Thuringian border region is particularly characterized by the typical development problems of post-mining landscapes. This includes not only the old lignite mines and facilities for the further processing of the extracted lignite, but also the legacies of uranium mining by the former Wismut AG. Therefore, the rehabilitation and development of these areas in the affected regions are a priority, cross-border task for regional planning in both countries. Accordingly, strategies are being developed for the necessary structural change that are intended to open up ways to sustainable development for these regions. This problem was dedicated to the joint regional planning conference for Saxony and Thuringia on July 15/16, 2000 in Altenburg, whose main lectures are reproduced in this volume.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4487916-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049348-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061655-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058136-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5>

Threatened Professionalism: Constraints and Current Challenges for Social Work ¤ What constellations, problems, and developments can threaten or constrain professionalism in social work? Under this question, the contributions of the volume focus on a previously rarely focused aspect of professions research. From the breadth of the entire field of action, examples are shown where problematic and ultimately disturbing effects on professional action are found. Threats and constraints are presented and analyzed in various ways in areas such as school social work, family work, adult psychiatry, and youth welfare.

Democracy and Association : Potentials of Democratic Education in Youth Work ¤ If it is assumed that democracy can be learned and must be learned, the question arises: Where does man become a democrat? Wibke Riekmann pursues the thesis that, from a theoretical point of view, it is the association that is neglected by educational science. However, the empirical evidence seems to contradict this assumption. Service orientation and familialization lead the associations in a different direction. The author reconstructs the democratic self-awareness of associations at four exemplary selected associations of youth work in history and present. It shows that the associations do not fully exploit their democratic potential and reflect too little. The perception of the association as a formative institution is thus at the beginning for the associations themselves, but also for educational science and politics	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046526-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120532-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076215-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028863-8>
New Spaces for Art : International Architecture Competition Kunsthalle Mannheim ¤ 29 architecture firms from around the world participated in the 2012 competition for the new construction of the Kunsthalle Mannheim. As »a mirror of the current developments in world architecture«, the chairman of the jury evaluated the quality of the submitted designs. The publication presents numerous illustrations of the original plans, showcasing the diverse ideas of the architects and providing an overview of the current state of museum architecture. The winning design by the Hamburg-based architecture firm gmp (Gerkan, Marg and Partner) convinces with a striking appearance, a breathtaking spatial experience, and intelligent functional quality. By 2017, a »treasure house« for the Mannheim collection of modern and contemporary art will be built in the heart of Mannheim. The complex task of »museum« is a royal discipline that is also being intensively examined from a museological perspective. In nine text contributions, exhibition makers, museum planners, art historians, and architecture critics ask what it means to think of new spaces for art.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124970-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171533-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002857-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115624-9>

Social Work and Urban Development: Research Perspectives, Fields of Action, Challenges ¤ Social work and urban development from different research perspectives -- fields of action of social work in urban and neighborhood development -- challenges of professional social work in the urban and neighborhood context. The contributing authors of this anthology present concepts of social work in urban development from a partial, intermediate, reflexive spatial, and planning-related perspective and provide insights into the chances and limitations of their implementation through case examples. The history of social work is closely linked to the development of the city. In this process, different positions of professional action and research have emerged. Furthermore, future challenges such as the Right-to-the-City movements, guiding images such as social sustainability, and approaches to planning-related social work are highlighted. For the second edition, additional contributions were included to present newly positioning arguments to the specialist audience.

Baukunst von morgen! : Hamburg's Churches of the Post-War Period ; Otto Bartning, 1953 ; [Catalogue for the eponymous exhibition of the Hamburg Monument Protection Office and the Free Academy of Arts Hamburg, 6 September - 7 October 2007] ¤ They seemed sometimes like they were from another time - alien structures in the war-torn Hamburg. Opinions on modern church buildings were far apart back then. Architect Otto Bartning saw them in his speech to the German Association of Architects in 1953 as the "Baukunst von morgen!". Some longed for their familiar historical spaces back, while others welcomed the new beginning of modernity with enthusiasm. Outstanding works of architecture emerged with the churches of the 1950s to 1970s in Hamburg. With their sculptural building bodies, visionary space designs, and great window images and lighting concepts, the churches enrich the cultural landscape of the Hanseatic city. The Hamburg Monument Protection Office draws attention to the peculiarities and beauties of these important and indispensable works of architecture in this richly illustrated book. - - The dwindling financial and membership strength of the two major confessions also puts the post-war churches back in the discussion: Many are being questioned today, and some are threatened with demolition. The more important it is to focus attention on these historical sites and document their significance as religious, social, and cultural spaces for the city.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073436-5>
With Sword or Firm Faith: Luther and the Witches ¤ The Medieval Crime Museum Rothenburg dedicates a large and impressive special exhibition to the witchcraft and witch belief from its early beginnings to the end of the great witch hunts in the 17th century. The focus lies on Martin Luther's confrontation with witchcraft in sermons and table talks; however, this has only secondary importance for his overall work. Luther grew up in a pious environment shaped by superstition and fear and believed, like his contemporaries, in sorcery and witchcraft. As a theologian, he demonized ghostly apparitions, excommunicated witches, and threatened them with judicial consequences. At the same time, he was committed to curbing the witch belief. The richly illustrated companion volume to the exhibition brings together essays on the historical backgrounds of witchcraft and presents 120 impressive objects, from writings on witchcraft to engravings to tools of torture. Informative and visually appealing; usable beyond the jubilee year 2017	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113908-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113907-0>
Future Elbe - River Landscape and Settlement Area : 1. IÖR-Symposium on October 14/15, 1993 in Dresden ¤ The contributions deal with the state of the Elbe and its landscape area, spatial planning and landscape ecological tasks, the economic development of the Elbe area and the controversial discussion in recent times on the expansion as a shipping route. In a concluding podium discussion, the conflicting views of the spatial planners and water engineers, respectively, and the opponents and supporters of an expansion were particularly highlighted. In the case of an expansion, there is a particular erosion hazard for the Elbe, which can be well grasped by modern computer technology. Discussion topics were the necessity of the Elbe expansion in view of future traffic development, the predictability of the effects and the appropriateness of the planning procedures as well as the costs and benefits of the expansion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4181221-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132857-7>
The World and Us: The External Relations of the European Union ¤ The European Union is, starting with the financial and sovereign debt crisis, occupied with the management of profound crises, whose causes partly lie within itself, in its policy or in political developments of its member states, partly but also outside, as is the case with migration movements. The collection of essays addresses itself to external policy questions in this context and examines the competences and instruments of the EU as well as the practice and the limits of the EU's external policy action. The authors turn to the individual policy fields of asylum policy, neighborhood policy, defense policy, trade policy, and investment arbitration. It is to be analyzed with this how the EU can reinvent itself through external action. At the same time, the book wants to contribute to a discussion about whether the Union also follows its own constitutional principles in a contradiction-free manner in its external action.

Europeans in the Levant: Between Politics, Science, and Religion (19th - 20th Century) ¤ The essays investigate the involvement of European powers and their official and unofficial representatives in the rediscovery of the Holy Land and the Levant in the 19th century, when the region became a plaything of the international political scene. The focus is on the back-and-forth between the powers, interest groups, and actors on the ground and the local populations. Hitherto neglected aspects of social, educational, and religious history are incorporated, and religious and national interests are revealed that often continue to the present day.

Violence in the Middle Ages : Realities - Imaginations ¤ Sword fighting, blood feuds, torture - these are images full of cruelty and brutality that cling to the >dark< Middle Ages. But how do they relate to the actual violence of the era? What status did physical violence have for the different groups of medieval society? And how did the Middle Ages itself imagine its violence? A history of violence in the Middle Ages cannot be simply extracted from the text and image documents, because they follow certain representation conventions. A proper understanding of medieval violence requires knowledge of the conceptions and fantasies that drove their actors - feud lords, crusaders, flagellants - to acts of violence against themselves and others. In an interdisciplinary collaboration of archaeology, history, art history, and ethnology, the book develops a new history of medieval violence	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157237-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129108-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020832-1>
Cities for All ¤ In honor of the two city directors Martin Neuffer and Rudolf Koldewey of the state capital Hanover, the symposium took place in June 2005. The visionary ideas and development possibilities of Martin Neuffer ("Cities for All - Draft of a City Policy" as a programmatic title of one of his books) and the rather sober and pragmatic thinking and acting of Rudolf Koldewey formed the intellectual field of tension in which the individual contributions of this documentation are located. As a result, the current challenges to urban planning and urban development are clearly shown against the background of partly far-reaching changes in the urban development policy framework from the perspective of local politics, urban research, planning administration, and administrative modernization.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073648-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056795-3>
10 Years of Austria's EU Membership: Balance and Outlook ¤ Noted experts present in 20 contributions the advantages and disadvantages of Austria's EU membership from a legal perspective. They focused on those aspects which were of particular interest in the accession negotiations. Starting from the constitutional legal foundations of EU membership with a total amendment of the federal constitution, they deal with the following topics: the participation of the federal government and the states in EU projects, Austria's participation in the common foreign and security policy in the context of permanent neutrality, and the relationship between EU law and Austrian national law. Subsequently, they explain the transit traffic and (foreigner) basic traffic, the preservation of environmental standards, agricultural and agricultural structure policy, the anonymity of bank accounts and savings deposits, access to universities and universities, and the preservation of social standards.

Globalization and the Future of the Social Market Economy ¤ Globalization forces us to think about which of the institutions in our society, which have been established over many years, must be subject to changes. The Social Market Economy with its social networks and its variety of arrangements, which are intended to secure as many incomes as possible downwards, is under pressure due to the increasing international competition. More flexibility instead of rigidity, more risk-taking instead of risk aversion and more entrepreneurial initiative instead of bureaucratic spirit is required. Reductions in the systems of social security are unavoidable, because their financing has long since overburdened the public budgets.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058136-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4557997-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055722-4>

Aesthetics of Digital Media: Current Perspectives ¤ In an increasingly comprehensive way, digital technologies and social media determine selection, form, and content of perception - and produce new (un-)visibility again and again. Cultural practices as a repertoire of signs, symbols, and behaviors are subject to constant transformation and meaning change. This development dynamics in the field of auto-operational forms and cultural practice demands a new categorization and questioning of the aesthetics of visually supported digital media.

Future of Work - Human Perspective: Current Research Findings and Good Practices ¤ This academic book describes the opportunities and risks for employees and executives in a modern working world. Overarching developments such as demographic change, increasing digitalization and globalization, as well as the resulting value shift, change the organizational environments and thus also the understanding of work. The contributing authors focus on the human being and discuss the effects of these changes on individual work, how satisfied employees are currently with their work contents and environments, and how they want to work in the future. Furthermore, they investigate which framework conditions, structures, office forms, and models organizations must develop in the future to design the workplace of the future as productive, motivating, and healthy. The future competence requirements for employees are considered, and the leadership role in New Work is analyzed. The division of contributions into three different categories - scientific contributions, practice reports, and personal viewpoints - allows for a diverse reading access to the topic.

Competition for Public Remembrance : Memory Cultures in the Potsdam and Brandenburg Area ¤ Public remembrance is characterized by competition. Private memory communities try to assert themselves against public remembrance, occupy new spaces, or override prevailing rituals. They demand a different remembering, spark debates, and question existing values. The contributors ask in the context of Public History about the dominant and marginalized actors, the historical backgrounds of the competitions, as well as solutions for existing conflicts. They present particularly for Potsdam various approaches on how memory spaces can be occupied analogously or digitally and new dialogues can be opened.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032081-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200793-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071769-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065835-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172385-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019622-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210408-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7608229-5>

Turkey Research in the German-speaking Area: Turbulences, Crises, and Resistances ¤ The authors of this collective volume investigate turbulences, crises, and resistances in the history and present of Turkey. At the center stands the question of how social and political change is negotiated in art and literature, what influence it has on transnational migration movements, how it changes the urban space, and what role academic freedom plays. Alone three military coups shaped the history of the country in the second half of the 20th century. The subsequent neoliberal agenda of the 1980s had not only economic, but far-reaching social and cultural consequences. The volume follows an interdisciplinary and epoch-spanning approach that examines interactions between culture and politics on the one hand and illuminates societal structures in their historical changeability on the other.

Enhancement : Critical Theory and Psychoanalytic Practice ¤ People have never been enough. Since they began to differentiate themselves from other animals, they invented tools and eventually large machines to tame natural forces, use resources better, and make life more comfortable. What is now called Enhancement only continues an ancient tradition. In order to grow in line with the demands of everyday and working life, drugs are increasingly used to enhance performance. And brain-machine interfaces already belong to the treatment options in some areas of medicine. But what images of humans, perfection requirements, and psychological conflicts does Enhancement transport? Should psychotherapy be helpful in this development? Or is it time for a full brake? The authors illuminate these questions using critical theory and psychoanalytic instruments from an interdisciplinary perspective. They show the different facets and chances, but also the illusions and limitations of Enhancement, as well as its inextricable entanglement with the logic of the market.

Sex Work : Prostitution – Worlds and Myths ; [... in occasion of the exhibition "Sex Work. Prostitution - Worlds and Myths" at the Museum of Work, Hamburg ... Women's Museum, Bonn ...] ¤ // Sperrgebiet and Herbertstraße, Reeperbahn and "La Merced", women and men on the street or in the brothel, "Dock seagulls" in the harbor: prostitution has many faces. Behind them, there are even more stories waiting to be told. "Sex Work" tells these stories: about work and private life of sex workers, about the fight for legal equality and social recognition, about the handling of prostitution in Europe and overseas, about the myth of fast money. Over 100 contributions and experience reports shed light on the backgrounds of a billion-dollar, traditional service industry. "Sex Work" - this term goes back to the American sex workers' movement and their demand for legal and social equality. Sex work is a traditional service and is today a significant economic factor: approximately 200,000 women work in the sex industry here, the annual turnover is estimated at around 14 billion euros. Prostitution is today recognized as a profession and is legal. The law of 2002 abolished the discrimination of prostitution as immoral. Sex workers can now enter the statutory health and pension insurance. This exhibition casts a glance behind the scenes, shows what often remains invisible in the shadow of voyeurism: a world of work between illusion and reality, it scratches at clichés without the moral finger, asks: Is sex work a profession like any other? Is there the big, fast money? How do sex workers see their work?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047516-5>

The Politicization of the Utopian in the 18th Century: From Utopian System Design to the Age of Revolution ¤ Blurb: The classical utopian tradition initiated by Thomas More has represented the claim to validity of a regulative principle or an ideal. This changed fundamentally in the 18th century. How the Enlightenment introduced the problem of practical reality change into the utopian discourse and thereby produced forms of legitimation of social practice anticipating the 19th century, is the systematic interest in knowledge of the contributions collected in this volume. They originated from the symposium on the topic "The Politicization of the Utopian in the 18th Century", which took place in the spring of 1995 at the Interdisciplinary Center for the Research of European Enlightenment in Halle.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046590-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041251-9>
Relationship between the legislature and the judiciary : contributions to the 6th Seoul-Freiburg Law Faculties Symposium ¤ The volume contains the lectures of the 6th Seoul-Freiburg Law-Faculties Symposium, which took place in Freiburg i. Br. in June 2016. Since its beginning in the year 1996, the partnership between the Law School of the Seoul National University and the Faculty of Law of the Albert-Ludwigs University has borne various fruits, significantly contributing to mutual understanding of legal thinking and legal research in both legal cultures and legal systems, and thus continuing the equally old and valuable tradition of close connection between Korean and German law. Like the preceding symposia, the 2016 symposium dealt with the general theme 'Relationship between the Legislature and the Judiciary' with a fundamental problem, whose specific manifestations in constitutional law, legal theory, private law, criminal law, commercial law, and administrative law were the subject of lectures and discussions.

Two Years Later: Municipal Experiences in Implementing the TAG (§§ 22-24a SGB VIII) : Documentation of the 9th Berlin Conference on Youth Welfare on November 2-3, 2006 in Berlin ¤ On January 1, 2005, the Law on the Quality-Oriented and Needs-Based Expansion of Daycare came into effect and thus made ongoing developments in the expansion of childcare binding. In many municipalities, the development and renovation process had already been underway beforehand. On this conference, the current implementation status of the TAG was discussed two years after its entry into force. The German Youth Institute e. V. presented its evaluation results in this regard. The focus of the event was on the presentation and discussion of successful municipal examples of childcare from various cities and districts in East and West. In particular, the following aspects were referred to: Qualified needs-based planning, flexible service forms, daycare, as well as quality development and personnel development.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030638-0>
Forum Mergers & Acquisitions 2011 : Contributions from a legal and economic science perspective ¤ The topic of Mergers Acquisitions is of high relevance for science and practice. The challenge lies particularly in interdisciplinary questions that regularly arise in the context of such transactions. The MA Alumni Germany e.V. has therefore launched the conference Mergers Acquisitions in the field of tension between legal and economic sciences - Current findings from research and practice in order to initiate a cross-disciplinary discourse. In the framework of the first conference 2010, ten contributions emerged, in which legal and economic scientists critically deal with the topic of MA.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4205916-1>
Excellence in Legal Education : On the Way to a Legal Science Didactics ¤ The first volume of the "Schriften zur rechtswissenschaftlichen Didaktik" contains a stocktaking and critical reflection of previous approaches, projects, and framework conditions for improving legal education and teaching. This creates the basis for a qualified exchange on the way of teaching and learning in legal science, which has been lacking so far.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025226-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029067-0>
Between Dream and Trauma: Urban Planning of the Post-War Modern ¤ Vision, guidelines, plans, and practical examples for the reconstruction (mainly) of German cities after the destruction caused by air raids in the Second World War. (Erdmann Steinmetz) "Light - cheerful - natural - festive - colorful - radiant", was a target vision for the reconstruction of the cities destroyed (mainly) in the 2nd World War, in order to "complete the work of the bombs" and to realize a visionary new beginning - a concept that was hardly implemented. In this volume, 15 authors present guidelines and examples - including Berlin, Hanover, Hamburg, Saarbrücken, ("socialist") Dresden - under political, social, and aesthetic conditions and discuss the causes of the current trend towards demolition and reconstruction. The work, equipped with numerous small-format images and plans as well as extensive literature references, also aims to provide a "contemporary view of the structure and shape of our everyday living environment". It offers, beyond the professional framework, essential and interesting possibilities. (2) (Erdmann Steinmetz)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056754-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056795-3>
Language and Law ¤ The conference proceedings aim to stimulate the interdisciplinary discussion between language and law sciences once again, and against the backdrop of current social developments. The selected topics are illuminated from both linguistic and legal perspectives, i.e. by language scientists and lawyers, respectively: the relationship between language, law, public and politics, communication in court, a partly linguistic and philosophical view of relevant legal statements, questions of interpretation, especially in the face of the complex intertextuality of law, historical and current (related to European integration) changes in legal and language systems, the benefits of linguistics for criminology, as well as causes and solutions for the difficulty of understanding laws	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048839-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0>
Russia and Germany - Neighbors in Europe ¤ In the first part, contributions to the development of post-communist Russia and the handling of the Soviet heritage are presented. This deals with the emergence of new states on the territory of the former USSR, the state rebirth of Russia and the acceptance of the new state by the population as well as historical peculiarities of post-communist democracy in Russia. In the second part, it deals with the economic and social transformation in Russia and Germany. The economic development of Russia within the CIS, the overcoming of the division in a united Germany, and long-term growth prospects of the new federal states from an order-theoretical perspective are treated. In a concluding part, problems and perspectives of Russia's westward integration are discussed. (BIOst-Wpt)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055785-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060633-8>

Administration and its Law ¤ The present volume contains the lectures held within the framework of the 2018 annual conference of the German Section of the International Institute of Public Administration Sciences in Leipzig. The conference was held under the general theme „Administration and its Law“. The aim of the volume is to consider the relationship between administration and administrative jurisdiction under various aspects as well as the role of law as an instrument of administration control, and – in a third block – to discuss different aspects of the – going beyond the mere effect of norms – relationship between national administrations and EU law. Contributions were made by high-ranking persons from administrative jurisdiction, including the President of the BVerwG Prof. Dr. Rennert, and from administration as well as researchers from law and political science.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063351-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063337-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063317-2>

Area and Protected Area Management by Foundations, Associations, and Societies ¤ Voluntary engagement is a crucial pillar for nature conservation in Germany. The first nature conservation associations were founded over 100 years ago, and the acquisition of areas by associations for the protection of threatened areas has been taking place for a long time. Following German reunification in 1990, for example, the sale of former state property of the GDR also led to the transfer of nature conservation areas (so-called national natural heritage) to foundations and associations, which as new area owners took on various obligations. Many successes in nature conservation are due to this continuous voluntary effort. These circumstances prompted the BfN to hold a conference on the island of Vilm in 2015, at which various foundations, associations, and organizations presented their successes in area and site protection explicitly. This volume summarizes the results of the conference and makes them known to a broader public.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115348-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013673-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4690740-3>
New Perspectives in Guardianship and Custodianship Law : 9th Göttingen Workshop on Family Law 2010 ¤ The present volume contains the papers of the 9th Göttingen Workshop on Family Law, held on December 10, 2010, which dealt with the current revision of the Guardianship Law. The opening presentation was on the need for reform in Guardianship and Custodianship Law (Gisela Zenz), followed by an explanation of the government's draft bill (Thomas Meyer). Subsequently, the question was addressed of whether and to what extent the Law on Guardianship can be used as a model for the new Guardianship Law (Dieter Schwab). The next contribution called for a change in perspective from the legislator to the ward, discussing the selection of the appropriate guardian for the individual ward (Barbara Seidenstücker). Finally, the structural problems on the side of the youth welfare offices were shown (Hans-Werner Pütz) and the neglected problem in the legislative process was highlighted, which consequences arise from the draft bill for the supplementary guardianship (Thomas Meysen). Volume 9 of the series Göttingen Juristische Schriften The series is published by the Faculty of Law of the Georg-August-University and makes events at the faculty accessible to an interested public.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063990-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045622-5>
Education and Standards: Critique of the 'De-Standardization' of the German Education System ¤ In rare consensus and in great haste, the ministers of education and senators have decided to develop national education standards, to concretize them in selected areas, to declare their introduction binding, and to monitor their implementation. It is more or less clearly expected that Germany or the respective federal state will perform better in similar performance comparisons in the near future. However, after a more detailed analysis of the concepts formulated under the heading of education standards, it becomes apparent that many questions are either unresolved or decided in a way that gives rise to concerns. In this volume, a critique of these concepts is attempted as a scientific evaluation of their chances and risks. Most contributions to this volume were initially formulated as expert opinions on behalf of the GEW, internally discussed, and discussed on a larger, public conference. The GEW itself has clearly positioned itself in the public debate on the drafts. Furthermore, several education scientists have asked which risks could arise from the favoring of standards and, in particular, from the related concretizations, and how this relates to the chances that could be or should be associated with such an approach.

How Much Pluralism Does Humanity Need? : A University Seeks Its Identity ¤ In this volume, scholars from the new federal states engage with the scientific legacy of teacher training in the former GDR, exemplified by the Magdeburg Pedagogical University. The basis is formed by contributions from a colloquium held on April 1 and 2, 1992, at this university under the title of this volume. In an appendix, documents are added as an example of teacher training, which illuminate the training situation before the turn and at the same time show the ideological burden of the subject.

Told Orders - Orders of Telling : Studies on Texts from the Middle Ages to the Early Modern Period ¤ As narrative texts unfold worlds, they also design orders. Furthermore, they must be designed in an orderly manner in telling, so that the concept of 'order' applied to narrative texts is relevant in a double sense: as orders of telling as well as told orders. 'Order' is understood as a dynamic concept that can only be grasped in its plurality and is strongly tied to the social action spaces of its negotiation. Since orders aim, inter alia, to establish and organize communities, shape perception, generate meaning, offer sense, and enable knowledge. Accordingly, the order conceptions designed in told worlds can be read as a specific expression of cultural knowledge. The primary interest of the volume is to test 'order' as a category of narratological analysis and to inquire, through the double formula mentioned in the title, how order conceptions of societies are productively negotiated through orderly telling in texts of the Middle Ages and the Early Modern Period, and in what form narrative literature can claim to be part of the formation of a sociocultural world.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039687-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152975-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043744-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124854-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129491-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035964-5>

Is a turning point looming? The frequent verdict on this - Populism! - warns of threats to the constitutional democracy. But is the appeal to the ›people‹ anti-democratic? After all, no politician wants to be called ›populist‹, yet no politician, no politician, renounces the declaration that the ›people‹ or ›the people in our country‹ are the main driving force behind their actions.

Inclusion in School Sports : Suggestions and Reflections ¤ Since the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, inclusive education of children with and without special needs has become the norm in Germany. In the coming years, physical education teachers will increasingly focus on the question of what changes the inclusive physical education and extracurricular movement, play, and sports offers in the full-day school will bring. In the current teacher training, this topic is hardly anchored. The book brings together contributions from theory and practice, which were presented for the first time at the specialist conference 'All in Motion? Suggestions and Reflections on Inclusive School Sports' at the German Sport University Cologne in March 2015.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130615-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077704-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7693876-1>
Purity and Authority in the Cultures of the Ancient Mediterranean ¤ Conceptions of purity and impurity are important structural elements of ancient religious traditions. In their simplest form, they regulate the physical presence of individuals and objects in sacred precincts or at other places where this seems socially required. Due to their potential for regulating inclusion and exclusion, conceptions of purity have always also had an – often implicit – significance for the formation and maintenance of human communities. With the religious, a political dimension is necessarily connected. In the present conference volume, it is investigated how communities of the ancient Mediterranean and their leaders dealt with this political potential.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049396-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068754-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136148-9>
In the Name of God... : Theology and Practice of Prayer in Christianity and Islam ¤ What does prayer achieve? What role does it play in the relationship between man and God, and what areas of overlap are there between Christian and Muslim prayer? Prayer is the central expression of religious faith in Christianity and Islam. But what does prayer 'achieve' - and with whom? What role does the community of faith play in this? Are there criteria for authentic prayer or areas of overlap between Christianity and Islam? Prayer texts are important sources for understanding God, the image of man, and the relationship between God and man in both religions. But even if there are numerous parallels and similarities between Christian and Muslim prayer, the trinitarian structure of Christian prayer is particularly problematic for Muslims.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4192352-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027743-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4010074-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114388-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019514-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4354651-1>
From Studium generale to University Reform: The 'Oberaudorfer Gespräche' as a Forum for Trade Union University Policy 1950-1968; [Publication of the Center for Contemporary History of Education and Science at the University of Hanover] ¤ The edition of the almost forgotten 'Oberaudorfer Gespräche' opens a view into considerations for university reform, which were led by the university committee of the GEW in the DGB from 1950 to 1968. The 'general debate' initiated by the initiator of the conversations, the former state secretary Eduard Brenner, on the necessity of a university reform led to a variety of resolutions to take up the debate on university reform again, which had dried up in the post-war period. At first, the question of a 'studium generale' that should accompany the entire study was at the center. Inspired by life and offers at Anglo-Saxon campus universities, detailed plans for individual courses of study were worked out. In the following, the focal points shifted: They touched on examination reforms, general university didactics, the misery of non-ordinaries, the academization of teacher training for elementary school teachers. The explosion of old forms in favor of the 'team' idea, interdisciplinary training, and promotion of young scientists are worth highlighting. (HoF/Text adopted)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025255-3>
Robert Schuman : Political Realism and European Spirit ¤ “The peace of the world cannot be preserved without creative efforts corresponding to the magnitude of the threat,” so said Robert Schuman in the most famous speech of his life.

Learning Landscapes : new school buildings ; [Exhibition] July 26 to August 18, 2012, Renate Kammer Gallery ; [Catalogue] ¤ What is school and what is »child-friendly« architecture? A row of classrooms, the sound of the school bell, noisy children in long, narrow corridors, dusty display cases on hexagonal-tiled landing platforms, easy-to-maintain floors and heavy fire doors? For architect Marc-Olivier Mathez, school is »WorkCity«, a staging, a space that should not be subject to a societal will to discipline. Mathez began his school building projects with the »Grund- und Stadtteilschule Stübenhofer Weg«. In 2010, the architecture firm developed a pedagogical school architecture project in line with the Dutch architect Herman Hertzberger – simple building, spacious rooms, plenty of daylight and art light, open interior spaces without corridors, work and rest areas – a vision for the future of Germany. This catalogue book presents three of Mathez' innovative school architecture projects: the »Gymnasium Süderelbe« in Neugraben-Fischbek, the »Grund- und Stadtteilschule Stübenhofer Weg« in Kirchdorf-Süd and the »Integrative Grundschule Am Johannisland« in the »BGZ Neugraben-Fischbek«.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180094-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4216380-8>

Global Crisis - Regional Sustainability: Options for Future-Oriented Urban and Regional Development ¤ The global financial crisis of 2008/09 serves as the starting point for the considerations in this volume: Is it a systemic crisis that cannot be resolved in individual sectors of the economy and politics, but rather involves the fundamental problem of human management of the planet Earth? Then all efforts on a regional level to escape the crisis would be doomed to fail in the long term. Or is the regional level suitable to implement other economic and lifestyle options that can successfully counter the various crises of global development (economically, ecologically, socially) with independent sustainability paths? While the initial contributions to the volume deal with this fundamental question, the further contributions take a stance in favor of the possibilities of regional sustainability: Economic approaches to regional economic cycles Ecological and energetic contributions to sustainable settlement policy Approaches to social sustainability under the challenges of global demands Questions of control of regional and social sustainability Aspects of densification Reduction of local conflicts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076605-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065471-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056730-8>
Social Entrepreneurship : Perspectives for Urban Development ; [Workshop "Social Entrepreneurs in Germany - Spatial Demands and Spatial Effects"] ¤ Although social innovation ability has become a topic of increasing discussion in political and scientific debates in recent years, its potential for urban development has been explored only to a limited extent so far. Social inequalities and spatial disparities, however, require new solution models in the face of the consequences of globalization and the withdrawal of the welfare state. In this context, people in industrialized countries are increasingly relying on individuals who, as 'Social Entrepreneurs', address social problems with innovative approaches and entrepreneurial means. The authors shed light on specific problem areas from a spatial perspective, discuss policy and development frameworks, outline the current state of knowledge, present practical examples, and highlight further research needs, focusing on Germany. Experts from various disciplines, as well as politicians, administrators, consulting institutions, funding organizations, and Social Entrepreneurs themselves, contribute to the discussion. Dr. Petra Jähnke, PD Dr. Gabriela B. Christmann, and Karsten Balgar are employed at the Leibniz Institute for Regional Development and Structural Planning (IRS) in Erkner.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7726532-4>
Ecological Balance Assessment of Biogas Plants: Considering the Lower Saxony Conditions ¤ A motivation for this study is particularly the consideration of the Lower Saxony conditions in the ecological balance assessment. The biogas plant systems considered in the different regions of Lower Saxony differ primarily from each other in terms of the available or used substrate types. While in the agricultural region of South Lower Saxony no fertilizer as a substrate is available, the utilization of manure from local animal husbandry operations is not a problem for the plants in the processing and mixing region. The plant from the dairy farming region is characterized by the fact that grass silage from the prevailing grassland in the region is used as a substrate. The availability of alternative energy crops is lower in this region, as the arable land is occupied for the cultivation of animal feed. The choice of the used substrates has a significant impact on the results of the ecological balance. This effect is particularly evident with the substrates fertilizer and grass silage. The use of fertilizer has a positive effect on the ecological balance in two ways. On the one hand, there are almost no environmental impacts for the provision of fertilizer, as no environmental burden is assigned to production for the reasons mentioned in Section 4.3. As a second positive aspect, the treatment of fertilizer in the biogas plant is to be mentioned, which leads to a reduction in methane emissions compared to the reference system. In contrast, grass silage from grassland use results in higher potential ammonia emissions compared to the cultivation of energy crops in arable farming. Due to the fact that a nutrient balance is carried out by fertilization for the grass yields, the ammonia emissions must be taken into account in the ecological assessment.

Mythography in Modern Times : Models and Methods in Literature, Art, and Science ¤ Since antiquity, mythographic handbooks have played a significant role in the dissemination of mythological knowledge. The knowledge of ancient myths served literature, the arts, and sciences with a virtually inexhaustible supply of ideas, which have been expressed in various forms. That myths are ?readable? on a meaningful level, which goes beyond their superficial meaning, is by no means self-evident. It is the merit of the mythographers from antiquity to modern times to have experimented with forms of mythological allegoresis, which found their impact in the aforementioned areas. This integral view of modern mythography is the guiding idea of the present volume, which explores the topic through selected case studies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035964-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4449808-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4261003-5>

EU Enlargement : New Chances for Europe?! : Proceedings of the 9th Leutherheider Forum of the Adalbert-Stiftung-Krefeld in cooperation with the Rhineland-Westphalian Institute for Economic Research Essen from January 16 to 19, 1997 ¤ The reform countries of Eastern Europe are knocking with force on the doors of the European Union. Ten countries have already submitted an application for membership in the community and will - although probably not all with equal priority - now enter the process of accession negotiations. The accession candidates see EU membership primarily as economic and political opportunities. But does not an enlargement also mean a chance for the EU itself? It would not be the first time that an institution is only able to implement overdue reforms from within under external pressure. The title of the conference, which this volume reports on, was therefore also "EU Enlargement - New Chances for Europe?!". In addition to the advantages, the risks of an enlargement were also discussed. In this fast-paced time, it has certainly become clearer since the conference (January 1997) regarding the schedule and procedure for the enlargement; however, little has changed in the fundamental problems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128080-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066410-7>

Be Clean ...! ¤ Be Clean ...! focuses on the numerous areas of life that have been increasingly influenced by hygiene measures and public health care since the 19th century. The steadily growing knowledge since the beginning of scientific hygiene research in the 18th century has led to better living conditions and a significantly higher life expectancy - at least in Europe and the >western world<. Topics of this catalog include, among other things, hygiene in everyday life, the medical-scientific field, and >Hygiene and Society<. This volume offers a wide range of scientific contributions, illustrated with large-format images, which deal with, for example, the history of the plague, the myth of (purifying) water, or the cultural history of public baths.

The Case Law of the ECJ and its Influence on National Private Law Orders ¤ The binding final decision on the interpretation of Union law lies with the ECJ. Regularly, such a decision affects the national legal orders. Often, the ECJ has to decide on the interpretation of directives that affect national private law in the context of a preliminary ruling procedure. The consequence of such a decision is regularly the change of the legal situation in the member states. The change of national private law can take place in different ways. In question is, for example, the change of national case law or laws in the member states. The present volume exemplarily shows how and in what way the case law of the Court of Justice has affected various areas of law from Spanish and German private law (e.g. sales law, consumer protection law and competition law.

Progress, Norm, and Nonconformity: Explorations of Everyday Life in the GDR ¤ Synopsis Ten years after the end of the GDR, it seems as if the memories are drifting further and further apart. How did people really live in the GDR? What was everyday life like between collectivism and individuality, between pay and honor, luxury and basic supply? A group of cultural scientists and historians has pursued these questions and has more closely examined important areas of everyday life. The objects being considered range from the small postage stamp, in which a whole country is reflected, to industrial large-scale enterprises that operated their own kindergartens, polyclinics, and cosmetics studios. The experiences of people are the starting point for all investigations, regardless of whether it is about the equal rights of women or the situation in trade and supply. Clearly recognizable, in addition to the	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001307-8>

The Vitality of Critical Social Theory: Documentation of the Work Conference on the Occasion of Theodor W. Adorno's 100th Birthday, July 4-6, 2003 at Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main ¤ Is Adorno's work historically become and its impact past? Or can the vitality of his critical social theory and its motives be spoken of? This question, to be examined without illusions and without prejudice, was the focus of the Frankfurt Work Conference on the occasion of Adorno's 100th birthday. Representatives from all areas in which Adorno has had an impact present their work as examples. The range extends from faithful continuation to the attempt to work out what was left unexecuted by Adorno, to the content and methodical re-description of tasks up to the criticism of the limitations of the Adornian approach. Whoever wants to examine the initial question through material analyses and is not already theoretically decided will be involved in a varied and instructive way with the possible answers through this volume.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073840-1>

Technological Knowledge: Emergence, Methods, Structures ¤ With the conference 'Technological Knowledge', acatech made a significant contribution to the discussion on formulating a self-understanding of technological sciences in its first year as the German Academy of Technical Sciences. The interdisciplinary contributions focused on questions of the emergence, method, and structure of technological knowledge, and thus the continuation of a systematization of technological sciences.

Courage to Laziness : The Work and Its Fate ¤ Work is apparently the decisive source for the prosperity, value, and dignity of humans. But what is work? Is this identical with gainful employment? And is the human being actually a naturally working being that falls into a crisis without a job? Would it not be time to fundamentally think about the value and essence of work and also to pay more attention to other possibilities of action and ways of existence of humans again? At the 21st Philosophicum Lech, representatives from philosophy, sociology, and adjacent sciences asked how much courage it takes to think of a society in which everything does not revolve around work.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170872-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153792-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045791-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138757-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4206782-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002567-6>
Temporalität und Form : Configurations of Aesthetic and Historical Consciousness ; Author Colloquium with Karl Heinz Bohrer [December 2002] ¤ The literary scholar and MERKUR editor living in Paris and London, Karl Heinz Bohrer, has exerted a far-reaching impact beyond the borders of the Federal Republic with his contributions to aesthetic theory formation and his interventions in the cultural and socio-political discourse of modernity. The volume documents the contributions of an author colloquium dedicated to Bohrer, which brought together renowned representatives of the philosophical, art and literary theoretical disciplines in Bielefeld, the long-time workplace of the currently teaching scholar in Stanford and New York. The colloquium not only provides the first systematic engagement with Bohrer's work, but can also be read as a preliminary balance of the achievements of post-Adornian aesthetics.

What does subject-oriented history didactics mean? : Contributions to theory, empiricism, and pragmatics ¤ The 'subject-orientation' appears only at first glance as an exaggerated description of the almost clichéd principle that learners should be 'picked up where they stand'. In fact, it reaches much further, because it places the orientation towards the learning subject even stronger than before on a theoretically-methodical basis. The present volume shows the diversity that subject-orientation has been shaped by so far and which enriches the historical didactic discourse	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020533-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077167-2>
The Sisters of Icarus : Woman and Flight ; [in conjunction with the exhibition "The Sisters of Icarus - Woman and Flight", which will be shown at the Zeppelin Museum Friedrichshafen from June 04 to September 26, 2004] ¤ They demanded the 'half of the sky' - but on the way there, women are often confronted with insurmountable obstacles. Aviatrixes, who early on demanded an equal place in aviation, encountered rejection, resistance, and unfair treatment. Retreats into the typical female role of mother and housewife, career changes, economic hardship, or even suicide could be the result. Aviation history is still presented as a success story of men. But since the invention of the balloon in 1783, women have been intensively involved in aviation. They have developed the technology and set records. For most, it was still difficult to break out of the shadow of men and make their achievements visible, although they had notable successes. Balloonists, parachutists, sailplane and motor pilots, technicians, scientists, and astronauts were not evaluated according to their real achievements, but were seen within the limits of the prevailing female role. But even the pioneers of aviation faced the experience of the border between life and death. They, like their male colleagues, consciously sought 'debordering' and were border-crossers who risked a 'sensational ascent' - whether into the air or into another social class. As 'Sisters of Icarus', they often shared his tragic fate. The companion book to the exhibition 'The Sisters of Icarus - Woman and Flight' puts the role of women at the center of the consideration. The collection of scientific contributions deals with the entire spectrum of the theme Woman and Flight: From the pioneers of aviation to the role of women in sports, military, and commercial aviation to space travel and the impact of the flight theme in the work of women artists. <CR>From the content: <CR>Maria Osietzki: 'Flight is worth the life' - Debordering female life designs in the history of aviation <CR>Heike Vogel: Early balloonists and pilots - Obstacles and strategies for implementation <CR>Gundula Wolter: Sensational sports costumes - The clothing of the aviation pioneers <CR>Guillaume de Syon: Engines of Emancipation? - Women's Flying Clubs before World War II <CR>Gertrud Pfister: Records, victories, sensations - Pi...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4216694-9>
Common man, society and religion in the 16th century : piety, morality and discipline in the Carpathian Basin ¤ The bilingual volume brings together, in part, groundbreaking results of an interdisciplinary research conference, whose contributions address social, economic, cultural, and ecclesiastical historical aspects of the early modern period in the Carpathian arc. Based on sources evaluated for the first time in many cases, the contributions deal with current research questions and research horizons on the interdependence of social, economic, cultural, and religious phenomena in the Carpathian arc of the early modern period, in which the Ottomans became the internationally dominant political factor. Transformation processes were triggered by population and military movements, economic, political, and religious-mental upheavals, which oscillated between opportunistic adaptation and rebellious resistance and correspondingly triggered political measures and counter-reactions. In doing so, the prevailing research opinion on the history of tolerance in Transylvania is called into question and completely revalued	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030702-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049428-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048946-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113326-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164948-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040222-8>
Corporate Tertiarization : The Holistic Transformation from a Production Enterprise to a Service-Oriented Problem Solver ¤ The transformation from an industrial to a service-oriented society is ongoing. As a result of this shift towards the tertiary sector, there is a constantly increasing demand for services, and former pure goods producers are therefore increasingly developing into holistic problem solvers. The authors of this volume investigate the challenges that companies face on their way from a production enterprise to a service-oriented problem solver. Topics include: " The transformation of corporate culture and the establishment of corresponding organizational structures, " appropriate personnel development, qualification, and motivation, " service-specific organizational development, " strategy development for the service business, " development and design of performance portfolios and individual services, " appropriate IT development	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075693-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012181-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026813-5>
Eva's Bite : Female Aggression and its Realities ; [Conference 1994] ¤ Eva's Bite is a collection on the topic of 'Female Aggression and its Realities'. Neither is it the 'peaceful woman' nor the unbridled destructive woman, who served as a model for the authors. Aggressive women are socially ostracized because it is not socially acceptable to think of aggression and femininity together. The myth of the 'peaceful woman' is exposed as a social construct, against which one can rebel. It is also a rebellion against the victim discourse, in which women are only given space because they are victims. Instead of clinging to the traditional patriarchal discourse, the authors try to find new ways. They approach the topic without destroying its contradictions and complexity, on the way of overcoming language clichés. Finding a new language is partly necessary to name the unspoken, ostracized, and taboo. On this basis, new freer role models can emerge. The collection contains material on mythological backgrounds, case descriptions, as well as a literary text by Elfriede Jelinek.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141621-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018202-2>
Translating wor(l)ds : Christianity across cultural boundaries ¤ This book addresses the translation of culture in the context of religion. The contributions, which analyse texts in literary, ethnohistorical and/or linguistic terms, show how different cultural traditions and languages are communicated across boundaries. They include studies of the missionary context of the Early Middle Ages and of colonially dominated cultures in Latin America, India, China, Africa and Australia, from the 16th to the early 20th century; and they analyse literary works with respect to how they transmit and translate culture: one a Christian play in the context of Islam, the other one a novel of the Haitian diaspora in the USA; another contribution presents the challenges of how the concept of religion itself is conveyed in contemporary scholarly contexts. By using different methodological tools, the authors show the manifold and innovative ways in which this field of the translation of culture can be approached.

Cultural Nation France? : The Cultural Dimension of Social Change ¤ More than in other countries, culture and education are constitutive components of the French nation and hold a high value for politics and society. Traditionally, the French elite attributes a universal, beyond-France significance to their culture. In recent years, these basic convictions have been questioned both internationally and in the domestic context. The France Yearbook 2011 takes up this debate. In the French domestic view, it is about the culturally shaped self-awareness of the Republic and the Nation, while in the external view, the transformations of cultural foreign policy are illuminated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125698-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020588-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046514-7>
Religious Pluralism and Tolerance in Europe : [3rd Constance European Colloquium, which took place from April 21 to 23, 2005 on the topic "Together - With Each Other - For Each Other. Religious Pluralism and Tolerance in Europe"] ¤ Europe is traversed by open and latent religious fields of tension, from which a colorful spectrum of current problem situations emerges: The examples range from disputes over headscarves, crucifixes, and mosque construction to the topics of migration and integration, to religious fundamentalism and terrorist violence. The anthology offers an interdisciplinary forum for dealing with the diverse historical and contemporary aspects of these phenomena. In this context, the basic principles and trends of European history are examined, the interaction and tension relationship between religious pluralism and the idea of tolerance is problematized, the danger of fundamentalism is illuminated, and the constitutional and politically-social situation in Europe is analyzed. The anthology is intended to make a significant contribution to a better understanding of the complex theme complex. - Europe, the tolerant continent? - The legacy of ancient pluralism - The legacy of the Middle Ages - At the confessional border - Fascism and National Socialism - Tolerance and recognition - Tolerance in times of intercultural conflicts - Pluralism and tolerance from the perspective of Christianity - Pluralism and tolerance from the perspective of Islam - Consequences for Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Europe - Considerations in view of the Jewish creation idea - The speech about the "Christian Occident" - Civil society and religion - Law, religion, and tolerance - Tariq Ramadan et al.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4296178-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112846-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040107-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121582-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060355-6>
Currency - Crisis - Emotion : Collective Perceptions of Economic Crises ¤ The diverse forms of expression of recent economic crises and the current challenges in Europe make it clear that the economy, which is still considered rational, needs to be examined in relation to its parallel developed 'strongly specialized emotional culture' (Eva Illouz). This is particularly evident in crisis discourses in politics, press, economy, or literature, where emotions are clearly visible as a collective 'form of mental attitude or attitude towards the world' (Richard Wollheim). The contributors to the volume examine the emotional dimensions of these crisis discourses in the past and present from the perspectives of sociology, economics, cultural, historical, and literary studies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066466-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055740-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194747-2>
Jewish History in Hellenistic-Roman Times: Ways of Research: From the Old to the New Schürer ¤ The German Protestant historian and theologian Emil Schürer was the first to deal scientifically with Judaism at the time of the Second Temple in his ";History of the Jewish People in the Time of Jesus Christ";. The fact that Schürer's work was re-published and translated into English nearly 100 years later gave rise to the question of how research on Jewish history in Hellenistic-Roman times developed in the 19th and 20th centuries.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028808-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114087-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020531-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162796-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4024313-8>
Early Attachments and Moral Development: Current Findings on Psychological and Social Conditions of Moral Autonomy ¤ This volume brings together attachment research and research on moral development based on Kohlberg's theory, attempting to link these two fields. At the center is the question of the social and psychological conditions of moral development and moral action. Under what conditions do children and adolescents develop in such a way that they build a stable moral motivation? Different aspects of morally relevant action are in focus: the exercise of violence and law-breaking, empathy and sensitivity to the needs of those close to them, the observance of moral core norms in conflicts of interest, personal commitment in the fight for fairer social conditions. The debates associated with these topics lead to convergent assessments in important points, but also open up further research questions with controversies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031081-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141551-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014516-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170537-3>
Evaluation (in) the Educational Science ¤ Evaluation is currently not only used as an instrument of educational science self-observation, but also for scientific policy control. Institutional and professional specifics of educational science determine the difficulties of evaluating their performances and the profiling of their disciplinary shape. The volume offers with its contributions theoretical, empirical, and comparative perspectives to analyze criteria and results of evaluation of educational science. It takes into account, in particular, also experiences of other disciplines and nations. Furthermore, the volume deals with the evaluation of educational institutions, describes experiences and discusses limits and possibilities of educational science to contribute to the evaluation of educational practice fields. It stands in the field of empirical science research of educational science and current science and education policy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044302-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071034-8>
The Digital Library and Its Right - a Stepchild of the Information Society? : Cultural Aspects, Technical Backgrounds and Legal Challenges of the Digital Cultural Memory ; [Proceedings of the Event 'The Digital Library and Its Right - a Stepchild of the Information Society?', which took place on September 6 and 7, 2012 at the Marriott Hotel in Cologne and was jointly organized by the University of Cologne, the Training Foundation for Law and Social Sciences at the University of Cologne and the University Library Center of North Rhine-Westphalia] ¤ Numerous information and cultural expressions are now only available in digital form. This facilitates access to content and its exchange on the one hand. On the other hand, however, the question arises as to how future generations will have access to the digitalia of the present as historical sources and as testimonies of our culture. This question is usually understood technically in the sense of the durability and readability of data carriers. Conversely, little attention has been paid to the legal difficulties that arise when building a digital cultural memory. It is only certain that the conditions, information, and cultural expressions to be stored have fundamentally changed compared to the analog age with its predominantly printed media. The reason for this lies on the one hand in the enormous public potential, especially of online publications, and on the other hand in the simple fact that digitalia always experience a multiplication when used and thus touch the copyright. The present collection, which documents a Cologne conference of the same name, deals with the legal framework conditions to be observed when building a digital cultural memory from different perspectives. In particular, it should be investigated whether the legal side of the digital library will require greater attention in the future, so that the established memory and remembrance culture of the present is not replaced in the future by a digital amnesia prescribed by law.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145274-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4380940-6>

Table Society of the Future: On an Ethics of Nutrition; Hannah-Arendt Lectures and the 17th Hannah-Arendt Days 2014 ¤ In the present volume, the authors of the Hannah Arendt Lectures and Hannah Arendt Days 2014 in Hanover deal with the problem of eating from different perspectives. The book documents this equally politically current and ethically sensitive debate about a table society of the future and works out the systematic connection between philosophy and gastrosophy, which Hannah Arendt claimed. Its core is the realization that our eating is not a purely private matter, but always also a political action. Content: Bernd Ladwig takes up the specifically animal-ethical perspective in his contribution "Why animals do not belong on our plates." Corinna Mieth considers the topic of meat consumption from the perspective of a consumer ethics based on the distinction between strong and weak duties. Ingo Pies considers the question of how to address hunger in the world from the perspective of business ethics. Christian Meyer describes what a minister must do in his daily business to actively work towards a table society of the future. Hilal Sezgin represents a radical animal rights morality that doubts whether something like humane animal husbandry is even possible. Hartmut Stützel finally shifts the focus from animals to humans by asking about the consequences for a grain cultivation that can not only adequately feed the (global) population, but also meet ethical and ecological requirements.

Manifestations in the Design Process : Design - Architecture - Engineering ¤ Den in the design process developed artifacts are given too little public and scientific attention, as are the things of our designed world. The book deals with the epistemic role of the manifestations emerging in the design process, making intentions, methods, and creative processes readable. The contributions from and about design, architecture, and engineering present an interdisciplinary inventory, asking for a new interdisciplinary perspective on design in the field of tension between analog and digital planning and technical processes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047340-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121208-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165102-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032231-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137304-2>
Iconology of the Performative ¤ We live in a world of images - so is the iconic turn stated in the humanities and social sciences. At the same time, we live in a performative culture, in which performances, stagings, and rituals are gaining importance. Images play a central role in the performative character of language as well as in the staging and perception of social or artistic actions. Images are events. They develop a specific power and ambiguity in performative performances and stagings, which is connected to enigmatic, transgressive, and liminal states. In this scenic-processual tension, collective and individual images mix, which cannot be reduced to textualization alone or simply bypassed. To what extent and to what benefit can an iconology of the performative be spoken, the authors discuss in structural, historical, and methodological terms. Both culture-specific and cross-cultural image patterns, collective and individual image spaces, performativity in images, and images as performative media are addressed. The contributions come from anthropology, art history, media and image science, communication science, history, education science, sociology, philosophy, and ethnomethodology	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161251-6>
Regional Development Policy between Centralization and Balance: Consequences for the Design at State Level ¤ The current occasion for the workshop were the preparations of the state and its regional actors for the new funding period of the EU Structural Funds with a clearly intensified and broadened instrumentarium of regional policy interventions. The new opportunities of especially intensive funding in the former administrative district of Lüneburg, which has been classified as convergence objective 1, as well as the wide range of interventions in the rest of the country require focus and priority settings that are oriented towards the development bottlenecks and opportunities of the regions and the state as a whole. This volume is intended to contribute to this discussion (Source: NIW)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049043-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066520-3>
Excess : from Excess in Religion, Art and Philosophy ¤ Excessive celebration, unbridled consumption, workaholics or sports fanatics - excess is a central and yet contentious phenomenon of our culture. While some vehemently reject excess and call for moderation, others actively seek out excessive experiences. This tension demands a scientific exploration. From the perspectives of theology, art history, and philosophy, this volume inquires into the reality of excesses. The contributions discuss the meanings of excess in different contexts and seek action perspectives.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033673-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4470928-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125698-0>
The Ten Commandments: A Contradictory Legacy? ¤ The Ten Commandments have permeated the norms and values of cultures shaped by the Jewish-Christian tradition up to the present day. But are the biblical commandments still determinations by which we can orient ourselves unbrokenly today? And do the dark sides of our history and present also go back to them? Notable contributors such as Jan Assmann, Hermann Deuser, Horst Dreier, Hanna-Barbara Gerl-Falkovitz, and Dietmar Mieth reflect in this volume what the Ten Commandments meant at the time of their promulgation and what they can mean to us today. Central themes such as the prohibition on murder, the prohibitions on desire, the prescription of monogamy, and the prohibition on images are each presented with a more skeptical and a reflectively positive voice. The fundamental relationship between the ethos of love and the morality of commandments is also taken into account in the considerations. Thus, a multifaceted image emerges that is of interest to all who ask about the foundations of law and morality in the present - regardless of whether they are believers or unbelievers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132695-7>
Conditions for Local Citizen Participation ¤ The book provides an overview of different forms of local citizen participation as we find them at the beginning of the 21st century in Germany. In the background, the question stands of how representative democracy can be adapted to the new social and political challenges of the 21st century. What opportunities and risks are associated with the participation forms that have developed in recent years, particularly at the local level?The book is designed to provide an overview. It shows how the science deals with the topic in a variety of ways. The authors address different questions. They draw, as is appropriate for the topic of local citizen participation, on different research methods. Qualitative and quantitative contributions complement each other. They all share the discussion of the questions about the goals and the conditions for success of different forms of local citizen participation, in order to contribute to further systematization of success and failure conditions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008767-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073648-9>

August Wilhelm Schlegel's Modeling of Literary History ¤ With the rediscovery of August Wilhelm Schlegel (1767–1845) in recent years, the success story of his Berlin lectures „Lectures on Fine Literature and Art“ (1801–1804) and his Vienna lectures „On Dramatic Art and Literature“ (1808) also came into focus. The two public lecture series aimed to rethink and reconceive the history of art and poetry with a focus on a „romantic“ tradition. How this new conception was concretized, what patterns it set, and what scientific and cultural policy intentions it pursued, are answered by the contributions brought together in this volume. They do not only address the question of the tension between a national and a cosmopolitan conception of literary history writing at Schlegel, but also take up genre-theoretical, translational, and comparative questions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036019-2>
Problems of Municipal Finance ¤ This volume contains the contributions presented at the conference of the Financial Science Committee of the Verein für Socialpolitik in Konstanz in 2000 on the topic "Problems of municipal finance". -- At the center of Wolfgang Scherf's work "Perspectives of municipal taxation" is the proposal to replace the trade tax in favor of a value-added tax, which is deductible from the value-added tax - alternatively from the income tax. Gisela Färber deals with "Theory and practice of municipal fee calculation". -- In the practice-oriented focus, the federal German legal framework is first presented, then the fee policy is largely shown by the example of the municipality of Speyer. Hans Georg Schmitz examines the traditional municipal accounting system and discusses reform proposals in the following. Karl-Dieter Grüske and Michael Maier deal with the "New Steering Model (NSM)". -- After an analysis of the defects of the traditional communal administration and after an analysis of approaches for a theoretical foundation of an administrative reform, the basic idea, main elements and efficiency potentials of the NSM are presented and evaluated on the municipal level.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071675-2>
Crimes of the Wehrmacht: Dimensions of the War of Annihilation 1941-1944; Exhibition Catalogue ¤ The war against the Soviet Union differed from all wars of European modernity, including those led by the German Wehrmacht in other countries during World War II. It was a war that targeted not only another army, but also parts of the civilian population. The Jewish population was to be murdered, non-Jews were to be decimated by hunger and terror and employed as forced labor. This criminal conduct did not arise from the escalation of the war, but was already part of the war plans. For what happened during the German occupation in the East, the war plans were only a determining factor. Furthermore, each individual case was shaped by concrete action conditions, determined by current influences and influenced by the behavior and action patterns of the actors. The war and international law in force at the time contained a number of internationally recognized principles that were to be observed in every war. Civilians and prisoners of war were under special protection. Although war law allowed for measures that were deeply inhumane and did not regulate every case, it did draw a clear line between right and wrong. - The exhibition 'Crimes of the Wehrmacht. Dimensions of the War of Annihilation 1941-1944' shows, based on the war and international law in force at the time, the involvement of the Wehrmacht in the crimes committed on the war fronts in the East and Southeast Europe during World War II. It documents a total of six dimensions of the war of annihilation: genocide of Soviet Jews; mass deaths of Soviet prisoners of war; war of hunger; deportations of forced laborers; partisan war; reprisals and hostage shootings. The exhibition shows the partial active and partial passive involvement of the Wehrmacht in the committed crimes. The research on this topic so far does not allow any statements about the number of German soldiers and officers involved. Nevertheless, the exhibition also shows the concrete behavior of individual persons. In the 'action spaces' it is demonstrated that the war of annihilation was not a place of abstract dynamics, but of tiered decisions and individual responsibilities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076906-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033151-9>
Das Handwerk der Seefahrt im Zeitalter der Industrialisierung : [the contributions ... were presented and discussed at a conference held from May 5-8, 1994, at the University of Bremen] ¤ The question that the book poses and answers is: How has traditional seafaring, customs, working and living conditions of sailors changed since the beginning of industrialization and the resulting changes in German shipping? In particular, the aspect of what has been preserved is of interest. Competent experts from various disciplines (technology, economics, cultural and social sciences, art) approach the difficult-to-delimit topic from their respective angle. Their essays, which are thematically far apart, provide a comprehensive overview of the connections for those interested in maritime history. The numerous references to literature help with a deeper understanding. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054184-8>
Law and Diversity: Local Configurations and Global Perspectives from the Early Modern Period to the Present ¤ Parallel justice, antidiscrimination laws, and the transfer of law - the theme of 'Law and Diversity' connects diverse current discussions and proves to be central for the social handling of difference and equality. The contributors to the volume - from history and law science as well as Jewish studies - place this theme in a historical perspective and take configurations and ways of dealing with legal diversity from the Early Modern Period to the present into view. Situations of cultural contact and interreligious coexistence as well as globally acting actors and organizations in Europe, Asia, the Americas, and Africa are illuminated.

Guaranteeing Family Influence in Family Businesses: Symposium of the Research Center for Family Businesses of the University of Bayreuth on October 6/7, 2016 ¤ To guarantee the influence of the family in family businesses is a crucial factor for the success of those businesses. Their influence is increasingly threatened from the inside and the outside. Internally conflicts within the family – between tribes or generations – about the succession may affect the family influence. Externally the growing number of legal requirements compromise the family influence directly and indirectly. A typical example is the claim for independent board members and the revision of the inheritance tax.The conference transcript documents the current state of scientific research on the influence of the family in family businesses in relation to that topic and at the same time it is devoted to knowledge transfer between science and practice. For this purpose, various instruments to secure family influence in family businesses are analysed and evaluated under different perspectives by considerable experts: for example, advisory boards, foundations, interim management, notarized agreements and common values. Besides the national view this volume also includes a comparative presentation on how Austrian, Swiss and Chinese family businesses deal with this issue. Therefore, the volume points out, that securing the family influence in family businesses is not only a major structural but also an overall challenge – a challenge practice and science must face together.With contributions by:Prof. Dr. Dr. Alexander Brink, Prof. Dr. Jens Prütting, Prof. Dr. Katharina Uffmann, Prof. Dr. Hermut Kormann, Prof. Dr. Knut Werner Lange, Prof. Dr. Susanne Kalss, Dr. Miriam Bird, Prof. Dr. Reinhard Meckl	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151276-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4503339-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016397-0>
Regional Integration in Central Asia ¤ The former Soviet republics in Central Asia - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan - became independent in 1991, without any prior independence movements. However, there is a need for cooperation in many areas for the countries in Central Asia. All Central Asian economies are relatively small and not integrated into the processes of global economic division of labor. Environmental problems, such as the Aral Sea disaster, affect all Central Asian countries. The desired integration into the world market requires the development of a capable infrastructure to transport the exported goods to the world markets. The development towards lasting forms of regional cooperation and integration is a crucial factor in designing sustainable strategies for the further transformation process. Authors from Central Asian countries and Germany examine in this volume the conditions and perspectives of regional integration in Central Asia. They analyze, in addition to the global economic conditions for regional integration, the prospects for the integration process against the background of problematic transformation processes in the individual countries. - Heribert Dieter: Introduction: The Need for Regional Integration in Central Asia - Cord Jakobeit: The Theory of Regional Integration - Alparslan Yenal: Global Economy in Transition: Structural Change and Trends - Elmar Altvater: Regionalization of the World Market - Serik Primbetov: Regional Integration of Central Asian States: Results, Experiences, Problems, and Perspectives - Heribert Dieter: Regional Integration in Central Asia: Economic Situation and Perspectives - Umiserik Kassenow, Klara Rachmetowa: Priorities of Economic Integration of Central Asian Countries - Kurt Hübner: Regional Integration and Payment Union: Chances and Limits of a Central Asian Payment Union (ZAZU) and Western European Experiences - Hansjörg Herr: Currency Cooperation in Central Asia - Advantages, Models, and Requirements - Umiserik Kassenow: The Foreign Economic Strategy of the Republic of Kazakhstan - Thomas Sauer, Thomas Röhm: The Foreign Economic Strategy of Kazakhstan - Turar Koitschujew: Post-Soviet Kyrgyzstan in the World Community - Jan Priewe: Considerations on the Foreign Economic Strategy of Kyrgyzstan - Sanaat Wachidowa: Regional Integration under Transformation Conditions: Economic Reforms and Restructuring in Uzbekistan - Hansjörg Herr: A Foreign Economic Strategy for Uzbekistan - Documentation: Declaration of Almaty of July 8, 1994 - Decision on the Creation of an Intergovernmental Council of July 8, 1994 - Statute of the Executive Committee of the Intergovernmental Council	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066410-7>

Integrated Risk and Sustainability Management : Successful Navigation through the Complexity and Dynamics of Risk ¤ Interdisciplinary perspectives on sustainability and risk management -- Sustainability of business models of companies and credit institutions -- Sustainability in personnel work as a critical factor for companies -- Sustainability and risk management in the responsibility of cities and regions. When risks are investigated without considering sustainability, decision-makers are limited because they are surprised by the complexity and dynamics of the risks. The challenges in society and large damages show that there is currently no convincing approach to dealing with risks that includes sustainability. The conference proceedings contain suggestions and solution approaches to linking the topics of risk and sustainability from society, politics, economy, health, and technology.

Nature and Theory of Emotion ¤ Cognitive neuroscience investigates the mechanisms of perception and recognition as brain processes. In recent years, emotions have been rediscovered and their fundamental, indeed indispensable role in behavior and action has been recognized and appreciated. Not least through these new approaches, psychology and philosophy have turned their attention to these long-neglected phenomena with renewed interest. The present, interdisciplinary volume provides an overview of the diversity of these approaches and the new insights and knowledge gained. The first part is introductory in nature. It provides information on psychological and developmental psychological theories of emotion as well as contributions from new methods such as functional imaging procedures. Furthermore, specific individual topics are discussed in more detail, such as emotions in animals, emotional development in early childhood, and the neurobiological foundations of love and lust. The second part deals with the dysfunction of emotions, for example the field of anxiety and depression and the phenomenon of emotional inhibition, as well as the question of how psychological structure and unconscious emotions are involved in the genesis of pathological phenomena. The third part finally encompasses reflective philosophical moments on the relationship between reason and passion, the affect theory of Kant and Hume, emotions in cross-cultural comparison, and the question of the nature of artificial feelings.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135740-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019702-5>

It appears to require the existence of new particles whose interactions to ordinary matter are extraordinarily feeble. One well-motivated candidate is the axion, an extraordinarily light neutral particle that may possibly be detected by looking for their conversion to detectable microwaves in the presence of a strong magnetic field. This has led to a number of experimental searches that are beginning to probe plausible axion model space and may discover the axion in the near future. These proceedings discuss the challenges of designing and operating tunable resonant cavities and detectors at ultralow temperatures. The topics discussed here have potential application far beyond the field of dark matter detection and may be applied to resonant cavities for accelerators as well as designing superconducting detectors for quantum information and computing applications. This work is intended for graduate students and researchers interested in learning the unique requirements for designing and operating microwave cavities and detectors for direct axion searches and to introduce several proposed experimental concepts that are still in the prototype stage. Describes unique designs for microwave cavity axion searches Includes detectors for ultra-low noise microwave applications Presents new methods of axion dark matter detection	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124298-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143745-7>
Advances in experimental political science ¤ Experimental political science has changed. In two short decades, it evolved from an emergent method to an accepted method to a primary method. The challenge now is to ensure that experimentalists design sound studies and implement them in ways that illuminate cause and effect. They must do so while also respecting ethical boundaries, interpreting results in a transparent manner, and sharing data and research materials to ensure others can build on what has been learned. This book explores the application of new designs; the introduction of novel data sources, measurement approaches, and statistical methods; the use of experiments in more areas; and discipline-wide discussions about the robustness, generalizability, and ethics of experiments in political science. The volume explores these new opportunities while also highlighting the concomitant challenges. The goal is to help scholars and practitioners conduct high-quality experiments that make important contributions to knowledge	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076229-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1>
Empire and politics in the Eastern and Western civilizations : searching for a ›Respublica Romanosinica‹ ¤ The volume includes the proceedings of the 2nd Roma Sinica project conference held in Seoul in September 2019 and aims to compare some features of the ancient political thought in the Western classical tradition and in the Eastern ancient thought. The contributors, coming from Korea, Europe, USA, China, Japan, propose new patterns of interpretation of the mutual interactions and proximities between these two cultural worlds and offer also a perspective of continuity between contemporary and ancient political thought. Therefore, this book is a reference place in the context of the comparative research between Roman (and early Greek thought) and Eastern thought. Researchers interested in Cicero, Seneca, Plato, post-Platonic and post Aristotelic philosophical schools, history, ancient Roman and Chinese languages could find interesting materials in this work	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115590-7>

Lake Baikal : a mirror in time and space for understanding global change processes : the 1998 BBD Baikal Symposium of the Japanese Association for Baikal International Research Program (JABIRP), Yokohama, November 5th-8th, 1998 ¤ Lake Baikal is the oldest lake and largest freshwater reservoir in the world. As a result of its exceptionally long geological history, the lake has been a theatre of evolution and speciation of organisms, and it currently harbors more species than any other lake in the world. Based on its unique nature, Lake Baikal was recently designated a World Heritage site and is regarded as a hotspot for evolution, speciation, and biodiversity. With its tremendously peculiar biota, Lake Baikal is now awaiting modern analytical approaches to the profound problems of speciation and evolution.

Innovation, evolution and economic change : new ideas in the tradition of Galbraith ¤ pt. 1. Changing capitalism : shareholders versus managers -- pt. 2. Globalized technostructures : towards a theory of the corrupt corporation -- pt. 3. Chartering the future : innovation, state power and the market system The book begins with a penetrating analysis of the main features of today's capitalism and in particular the conflict between shareholders and managers. It moves on to focus on the consequences of globalization in the decision-making processes of large corporations and represents an important step in the development of a theory of fraud and corruption within corporations. In the final part, the authors address and explore the consequences of the domination of influential groups over major social and political decisions, on the blurred boundaries between the public and the private sectors and its consequences in the fields of technological regulation and the evolution of public services. In so doing, the authors question the meaning and power of democracy in today's society	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078614-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029577-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5>

Ultrafast Magnetism I : Proceedings of the International Conference UMC 2013 Strasbourg, France, October 28th - November 1st, 2013 ¤ This volume on Ultrafast Magnetism is a collection of articles presented at the international “Ultrafast Magnetization Conference” held at the Congress Center in Strasbourg, France, from October 28th to November 1st, 2013. This first conference, which is intended to be held every two years, received a wonderful attendance and gathered scientists from 27 countries in the field of Femtomagnetism, encompassing many theoretical and experimental research subjects related to the spins dynamics in bulk or nanostructured materials. The participants appreciated this unique opportunity for discussing new ideas and debating on various physical interpretations of the reported phenomena. The format of a single session with many oral contributions as well as extensive time for poster presentations allowed researchers to have a detailed overview of the field. Importantly, one could sense that, in addition to studying fundamental magnetic phenomena, ultrafast magnetism has entered in a phase where applied physics and engineering are playing an important role. Several devices are being proposed with exciting R&D perspectives in the near future, in particular for magnetic recording, time resolved magnetic imaging and spin polarized transport, therefore establishing connections between various aspects of modern magnetism. Simultaneously, the diversity of techniques and experimental configurations has flourished during the past years, employing in particular Xrays, visible, infra-red and terahertz radiations. It was also obvious that an important effort is being made for tracking the dynamics of spins and magnetic domains at the nanometer scale, opening the pathway to exciting future developments. The concerted efforts between theoretical and experimental approaches for explaining the dynamical behaviors of angular momentum and energy levels, on different classes of magnetic materials, are worth pointing out. Finally it was unanimously recognized that the quality of the scientific oral and poster presentations contributed to bring the conference to a very high international standard	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186732-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045956-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4327470-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037021-5>

The early Greek alphabets : origin, diffusion, uses ¤ The birth of the Greek alphabet marked a new horizon in the history of writing, as the vowelless Phoenician alphabet was borrowed and adapted to write vowels as well as consonants. Rather than creating a single unchanging new tradition, however, its earliest attestations show a very great degree of diversity, as areas of the Greek-speaking world established their own regional variants. This volume asks how, when, where, by whom and for what purposes Greek alphabetic writing developed. Anne Jeffery's Local Scripts of Archaic Greece (1961), re-issued with a valuable supplement in 1990, was an epoch-making contribution to the study of these issues. But much important new evidence has emerged even since 1987, and debate has continued energetically about all the central issues raised by Jeffery's book: the date at which the Phoenician script was taken over and adapted to write vowels with separate signs; the priority of Phrygia or Greece in that process; the question whether the adaptation happened once, and the resulting alphabet then spread outwards, or whether similar adaptations occurred independently in several places; if the adaptation was a single event, the region where it occurred, and the explanation for the many divergences in local script; what the scripts tell us about the regional divisions of archaic Greece. There has also been a flourishing debate about the development and functions of literacy in archaic Greece. The contributors to this volume bring a range of perspectives to bear in revisiting Jeffery's legacy, including chapters which extend the scope beyond Jeffery, by considering the fortunes of the Greek alphabet in Etruria, in southern Italy, and on coins	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113791-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001336-4>

Karl Friedrich Schinkel, 1781 - 1841, the drama of architecture : [in conjunction with the exhibition "Karl Friedrich Schinkel, 1781 - 1841: the Drama of Architecture", organized by the Art Institute of Chicago and presented October 29, 1994, through January 2, 1995] ¤ Neoclassicism’s most prominent exponent in Prussia, Karl Friedrich Schinkel is revered today for his reshaping of Berlin as Prussia’s capital, and for catalyzing the Greek Revival in Germany. Most of Berlin’s most famous Neoclassical structures are his doing--the Neue Wache, the Schauspielhaus, the Gendarmenmarkt and the Altes Museum, for example. His Bauakademie of 1836 is even considered by many to foreshadow the austerity and clean lines of German Modernist architecture. But Schinkel is equally revered for his legacy of architectural drawing and unbuilt works, gathered (from the Schinkel archives) herein, making this book the definitive Schinkel primer.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>

3-D structural interpretation : earth, mind, and machine ¤ Three-dimensional geologic interpretation of surface and subsurface data requires integration and application of both geologic knowledge and spatial cognitive skills. Much surface geologic mapping still employs pen and paper techniques, but subsurface interpretation is usually accomplished using sophisticated visualization software. In both cases, successful interpreters use mental models that bridge internal and external forms of 3-D visualization to construct 3-D geologic interpretations. This volume sets out to understand more about the convergence of geology, 3-D thinking, and software, which collectively provide the basis for truly effective interpretation strategies. It should appeal to all geologic interpreters, and especially those who investigate and teach interpretation skills.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4225664-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039798-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4475269-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4483774-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156694-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059351-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170297-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020227-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130684-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4321722-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156696-8>

Inherently parallel algorithms in feasibility and optimization and their applications ¤ The Haifa 2000 Workshop on 'Inherently Parallel Algorithms for Feasibility and Optimization and their Applications' brought together top scientists in this area. The objective of the Workshop was to discuss, analyze and compare the latest developments in this fast growing field of applied mathematics and to identify topics of research which are of special interest for industrial applications and for further theoretical study. Inherently parallel algorithms, that is, computational methods which are, by their mathematical nature, parallel, have been studied in various contexts for more than fifty years. However, it was only during the last decade that they have mostly proved their practical usefulness because new generations of computers made their implementation possible in order to solve complex feasibility and optimization problems involving huge amounts of data via parallel processing. These led to an accumulation of computational experience and theoretical information and opened new and challenging questions concerning the behavior of inherently parallel algorithms for feasibility and optimization, their convergence in new environments and in circumstances in which they were not considered before their stability and reliability. Several research groups all over the world focused on these questions and it was the general feeling among scientists involved in this effort that the time has come to survey the latest progress and convey a perspective for further development and concerted scientific investigations. Thus, the editors of this volume, with the support of the Israeli Academy for Sciences and Humanities, took the initiative of organizing a Workshop intended to bring together the leading scientists in the field. The current volume is the Proceedings of the Workshop representing the discussions, debates and communications that took place. Having all that information collected in a single book will provide mathematicians and engineers interested in the theoretical and practical aspects of the inherently parallel algorithms for feasibility and optimization with a tool for determining when, where and which algorithms in this class are fit for solving specific problems, how reliable they are, how they behave and how efficient they were in previous applications. Such a tool will allow software creators to choose ways of better implementing these methods by learning from existing experience	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193615-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043664-0>

The Things and their Relatives. On the Development of Collections ¤ In the last few years scientific collections has gained significance. In particular, the "Recommendations on Scientific Collections as Research Infrastructures" published by the German Science Council (Wissenschaftsrat) in January 2011 have caused a surge in attention.This volume of the series Hamburg's University Speeches (Hamburger Universitätsreden) documents the frame of the Annual Conference of the Society for University Collections (Gesellschafts für Universitätssammlungen) in 2016 and the lecture given by Ulrich Raulff, Director of the German Literary Archives in Marbach. In his text "The Things and their Relatives" he shows how an object without context immediately loses its meaning. Raulff ends his reflections on things and their collection with an appeal to the representatives of the scientific collections to conduct their own research, namely in their own collections. Archives, museums and collections should not wait for being researched. They should not limit themselves to the classical "research in indexing", but should initiate and carry out research projects themselves. Only through their own understanding of research a meaningful collection policy can be developed, which will really reach the present and the future. The text of the speech is followed by 30 colour photographs of special objects presented by Ulrich Raulff during his lecture in the atrium of the Hamburg State and University Library	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128844-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4051494-8>

Approaches to cognition through text and discourse ¤ This book explores the overlapping area of study that discourse linguists and cognitive linguists are interested in. It procedes from considerations of information structuring, coherence and foregrounding to those of negotiation of meaning in situational and cultural contexts. The cognitive issues brought to the fore range from assumptions that we make about the interlocuters ́memory constraints, the relative salience that we give to and recognize in elements of discourse, prototypicality and the figure-ground distinction reflected in language use, locative concerns, iconicity, negotiation between people or groups of people of common ground and establishment of shared conceptual models within society at large, which raises the issues of culture and ideology. The contributions, all by established linguists with highest qualifications, present new findings which have important theoretical implications.

Overview of new forms of employment : 2018 update ¤ Across Europe, new forms of employment are emerging that differ significantly from traditional employment. Some of these forms of employment transform the relationship between employer and employee while others change work organisation and work patterns. They often involve locations other than the usual employer’s premises, and or extensive use of information and communications technology. This report identifies nine forms of employment that are either new or have become increasingly important in Europe since the year 2000. All of the nine forms discussed are aimed at increasing flexibility for employers and/or employees. Some may benefit employers and employees equally, but in a few cases there are concerns regarding their impact on working conditions and the labour market. The report highlights the need for awareness of potential problems and of safety nets for workers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047390-9>

Creation and governance of human genetic research databases : [report of the Workshop on Human Genetic Research Databases - Issues of Privacy and Security, 26 & 27 February 2004, Tokyo, Japan] ¤ Scientists have known for years that complex diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, arise from a combination of lifestyle, environmental, genetic and random factors. Large-scale study of populations may contribute significantly to science's understanding of the complex multi-factorial basis of disease and to improvements in prevention, detection, diagnosis, treatment and cure. As a result of developments in biotechnology and bioinformatics, the opportunity to store and analyse increasingly large amounts of genetic data have rendered possible the creation of large-scale population databases. Genetic research, involving the use of such databases containing human genetic and genomic data, information, and biological samples, is thus becoming increasingly feasible.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072653-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011119-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200230-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017894-8>

Administrative Action in the Refugee Crisis ¤ In the course of the refugee crisis, over 1.4 million refugees have arrived in Germany. This entails many new demands on administrative bodies and has led to considerable implementation problems. There is a cross-level implementation system of a substantial institutional and procedural complexity. The problems of administrative action were initially barely discussed. In the meantime, however, the discussion has intensified. In addition, the Federal Agency of Migration and Refugees, the Federal Labour Office and the federal states have begun to reform the existing administrative implementation system, and there are innovative approaches in the area of integration on a municipal level.

Take it sporty – Planning as an obstacle course : 16th Young Forum of the ARL, May 29 to 31, 2013 in Kaiserslautern ¤ Spatial planning has a challenging mandate of design and coordination. Herewith, the tasks of planners and the demands made on planning are becoming increasingly diverse and complex. Planners are thus repeatedly confronted with boundaries and barriers, often reaching the limits of their ability to act. However, such limits are seldom final; they represent rather transitions to new situations. It is a matter of discovering how to overcome the existing boundaries and barriers of (or in) the various dimensions and fields of planning. Often the challenge for planners here is to leave behind what is familiar and to break new ground. This volume seeks answers to the questions of how planning can remain capable of effective action, what would have to change to ensure this, and how planning can perhaps even take advantage of boundaries and barriers. The meeting of the ARL Junges Forum from 29 to 31 Mai 2013 in Kaiserslautern discussed these topics. The focus was on the following questions: How can new avenues be explored in planning? What needs to change, and how can planning actually take advantage of existing boundaries and barriers?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034354-6>

Neighbourhoods and city quarters in antiquity : design and experience ¤ Studies on ancient urbanity either concerns individual buildings or the city as a whole. This volume, instead, addresses a meso-scale of urbanity: the socio-spatial organisation of ancient cities. Its temporal focus is on Late Republican and Imperial Italy, and more specifically the cities of Pompeii and Ostia. Referring to a praxeological and phenomenological perspective, it looks at neighbourhoods and city quarters as basic categories of design and experience. With the terms ‘neighbourhood and ‘city quarter’ the volume proposes two different methodological approaches: Neighbourhood here refers to the face-to-face relation between people living next to each other – thus the small-scale environment centred around a house and an individual. Neighbourhoods thus do not constitute a (collectively defined) urban territory with clear borders, but are rather constituted by individual experiences. In contrast, city quarters are understood as areas that share certain characteristics	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077814-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041030-4>
Interactive task learning : humans, robots, and agents acquiring new tasks through natural interactions ¤ Experts from a range of disciplines explore how humans and artificial agents can quickly learn completely new tasks through natural interactions with each other. Humans are not limited to a fixed set of innate or preprogrammed tasks. We learn quickly through language and other forms of natural interaction, and we improve our performance and teach others what we have learned. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the acquisition of new tasks through natural interaction is an ongoing challenge. Advances in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and robotics are leading us to future systems with human-like capabilities. A huge gap exists, however, between the highly specialized niche capabilities of current machine learning systems and the generality, flexibility, and in situ robustness of human instruction and learning. Drawing on expertise from multiple disciplines, this Strüngmann Forum Report explores how humans and artificial agents can quickly learn completely new tasks through natural interactions with each other. The contributors consider functional knowledge requirements, the ontology of interactive task learning, and the representation of task knowledge at multiple levels of abstraction. They explore natural forms of interactions among humans as well as the use of interaction to teach robots and software agents new tasks in complex, dynamic environments. They discuss research challenges and opportunities, including ethical considerations, and make proposals to further understanding of interactive task learning and create new capabilities in assistive robotics, healthcare, education, training, and gaming.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120666-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125909-9>

Algebraic Design Theory and Hadamard Matrices : ADTHM, Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, July 2014 ¤ This volume develops the depth and breadth of the mathematics underlying the construction and analysis of Hadamard matrices and their use in the construction of combinatorial designs. At the same time, it pursues current research in their numerous applications in security and cryptography, quantum information, and communications. Bridges among diverse mathematical threads and extensive applications make this an invaluable source for understanding both the current state of the art and future directions. The existence of Hadamard matrices remains one of the most challenging open questions in combinatorics. Substantial progress on their existence has resulted from advances in algebraic design theory using deep connections with linear algebra, abstract algebra, finite geometry, number theory, and combinatorics. Hadamard matrices arise in a very diverse set of applications. Starting with applications in experimental design theory and the theory of error-correcting codes, they have found unexpected and important applications in cryptography, quantum information theory, communications, and networking On (−1, 1)-matrices of skew type with the maximal determinants and tournaments -- On good matrices and skew Hadamard matrices -- Suitable permutations, binary covering arrays, and Paley matrices -- Divisible design digraphs -- New symmetric (61,16,4) designs obtained from codes -- D-optimal matrices of orders 118, 138, 150, 154 and 174 -- Periodic Golay pairs of length 72 -- Classifying cocyclic Butson Hadamard matrices -- Signed group orthogonal designs and their applications -- On symmetric designs and binary 3-frameproof codes -- An algorithm for constructing Hjelmslev planes -- Mutually unbiased biangular vectors and association schemes -- A simple construction of complex equiangular lines -- Inner product vectors for skew-Hadamard matrices -- Twin bent functions and Clifford algebras -- A Walsh-Fourier approach to the circulant Hadamard matrices -- A note on order and eigenvalue multiplicity of strongly regular graphs -- Trades in complex Hadamard matrices -- The hunt for weighting matrices of small orders -- Menon-Hadamard difference sets obtained from a local field by natural projections -- BIRS Workshop 14w2199 July 11-13, 2014 Problem Solving Session	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4158663-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164747-6>

Boundary and Interior Layers, Computational and Asymptotic Methods BAIL 2016 ¤ This volume collects papers associated with lectures that were presented at the BAIL 2016 conference, which was held from 14 to 19 August 2016 at Beijing Computational Science Research Center and Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. It showcases the variety and quality of current research into numerical and asymptotic methods for theoretical and practical problems whose solutions involve layer phenomena. The BAIL (Boundary And Interior Layers) conferences, held usually in even-numbered years, bring together mathematicians and engineers/physicists whose research involves layer phenomena, with the aim of promoting interaction between these often-separate disciplines. These layers appear as solutions of singularly perturbed differential equations of various types, and are common in physical problems, most notably in fluid dynamics. This book is of interest for current researchers from mathematics, engineering and physics whose work involves the accurate app roximation of solutions of singularly perturbed differential equations; that is, problems whose solutions exhibit boundary and/or interior layers	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042805-9>
The occult sciences in pre-modern Islamic cultures ¤ The present edited volume is based in part on papers that were delivered at an international conference, which was held at the American University of Beirut (AUB) on 5–6 December 2013 and was organized by the Orient-Institut Beirut (OIB) in association with the Center for Arab and Middle Eastern Studies (CAMES) at the American University of Beirut (AUB). The conference carried the title that has been retained for this present volume as: The Occult Sciences in Premodern Islamic Cultures. Not all the chapters that constitute the present volume were presented at the conference, and some of the papers that were delivered at the conference have not been included in this volume. It is therefore more prudent to think of this book as a collection of studies rather than as a strict proceedings volume. It is also evident that some of the chapters are expanded and adapted versions of the papers delivered at the conference. In pre-modern Islamic cultures, a number of arts and practices that are associated with the occult sciences were seen as epistemic expansions of the field of scientific knowledge in its various branches. The sciences of the occult dealt with what was taken to be of the order of non-observable realities that were studied by pre-modern natural scientists. This included all phenomena that could not be explained on the basis of the four classical elements. The sciences of the occult were situated between natural philosophy and metaphysics, and at times blended with these in more direct forms — as was the case with astronomia (ʿilm al-nujūm), which combined mathematical astronomy with astrology, or the bent on arithmology and numerology that accompanied the sciences of arithmetic and number theory. An examination of these pre-modern forms of knowledge can itself further enrich our modern understanding of what constitutes the limits of science and its epistemological bearings in the deliberations of philosophy of science.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027743-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043421-7>

Applications of Organometallic Chemistry in the Preparation and Processing of Advanced Materials ¤ In the ten years since the scientific rationale for the design, synthesis and application of inorganic and organometallic polymers (IOPs) was first conceptualised, we have witnessed the first tentative exploration of IOPs as precursors to new materials, with efforts focusing on the design and synthesis of novel ceramic precursors. Developing expertise led to precursor studies combined with the characterisation of the transformation processes that occur when IOPs are converted to ceramic materials. Now at maturity, the science presented in this volume reveals the polymer precursor approach to materials synthesis together with examples of processing ceramic shapes for a range of mechanical properties, the development of sophisticated, noninvasive analytical techniques, and IOP design rationales relying on well-defined processing-property relationships. The production of multifunctional IOPs is described, providing ion conductivity, gas sensing, bioactivity, magnetic properties, etc., combined with processability. The existence of well-defined IOPs and the exquisite control that can be exerted on sol-gel systems now provide access to such a variety of mixed organic-organometallic and/or inorganic hybrid systems that their exploitation is likely to develop into an entirely new field of materials chemistry. Future exciting avenues of research are also being opened up with the advent of buckyballs, Met-Cars, dopable preceramics, rigid-rod organometallics, and molecular tinkertoys	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062670-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142565-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173025-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169616-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4312250-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4297838-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030282-9>
Computer Intensive Methods in Statistics ¤ The computer has created new fields in statistics. Numerical and statistical problems that were unattackable five to ten years ago can now be computed even on portable personal computers. A computer intensive task is for example the numerical calculation of posterior distributions in Bayesian analysis. The Bootstrap and image analysis are two other fields spawned by the almost unlimited computing power. It is not only the computing power through that has revolutionized statistics, the graphical interactiveness on modern statistical environments has given us the possibility for deeper insight into our data.

Nanotechnology and occupational health : [most of the articles in this volume are invited papers from the 2nd International Symposium on Nanotechnology and Occupational Health, held in Minneapolis, MN, October 3 - 6, 2005] ¤ Nanotechnology is rapidly invading many aspects of modern society - from science, research and engineering to industrial and commercial applications and, inevitably, to man and his environment. One of the biggest challenges, therefore, is managing environmental, health and safety risks of nanomaterials. Yet, the information necessary to assess their long term effects is scarce. Systematic research into what potentially makes engineered nanomaterials hazardous, how this translates into risk, and how these can be managed will be vital and involves interdisciplinary collaboration. The first Inter This volume, a reprint from a special issue of the Journal of Nanoparticle Research, draws on work presented at The Second International Symposium on Nanotechnology and Occupational Health, held in Minnesota in 2005.

Macroeconomic causes of unemployment: diagnosis and policy recommendations ¤ This conference volume deals with one of the most severe economic, social and political problems major European economies face since the early nineties, the problem of lasting high unemployment. Contrary to the current German discussion, solely concentrating on microeconomic explanations and therapy recommendations, this volume presents papers based on various macro-economic points of view, showing different ways out of the employment crisis. Apart from renowned German economists, some well-known international academics participated in the 1998 Berlin symposium, to learn from experience in other countries. -- The first chapter contains the main standard textbook models and paradigms explaining lasting high unemployment. The question in the second chapter is if it is possible to fight unemployment with the help of macro policy on a purely national basis in the presence of global markets. The third chapter indicates possible effects of misalignments in financial markets on economic growth and employment. The contributions of the fourth chapter present experiences of other countries, which have succeeded in recent years in lowering their unemployment rates. The question at issue is, if these concepts can be transferred to Germany. The topics of the concluding chapter are practical macroeconomic starting points for sustainable employment growth in Europe. The methods contradict supply side arguments for the stabilisation of employment predominant in the German discussion. Attention is focused on relations between the role of monetary and fiscal policy in close conjunction with wage policy. Furthermore it is made evident that in global markets a theoretical macroeconomic concept as a base for sustainable employment is not very promising without enhanced international co-operation	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002730-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127364-3>

Constructing and Experiencing Jewish Identity ¤ Classification is an inherent feature of all societies. The distinction between Jews and non-Jews has been a major theme of Western society for over two millennia. In the middle of the twentieth century, dire consequences were associated with being Jewish. Even after the Shoah, the labelling of Jews as “other” continued. In this book, leading historians including Michael Brenner, Elisheva Carlebach and Michael Miller illuminate the meaning of Jewishness from pre-modern and early-modern times to the present day. Their studies offer new perspectives on constructing and experiencing Jewish identity.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067864-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026482-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028808-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114087-4>

Agent-Oriented Software Engineering II : Second International Workshop, AOSE 2001 Montreal, Canada, May 29, 2001 Revised Papers and Invited Contributions ¤ Since the 1980s, software agents and multi-agent systems have grown into what is now one of the most active areas of research and development activity in computing generally. One of the most important reasons for the current intensity of interest in the agent-based computing paradigm certainly is that the concept of an agent as an autonomous system, capable of interacting with other agents in order to satisfy its design objectives, is a natural one for software designers. This recognition has led to the growth of interest in agents as a new paradigm for software engineering. This book reflects the state of the art in the field by presenting 14 revised full papers accepted for the second workshop on this topic, AOSE 2001, together with five invited survey articles. The book offers topical sections on societies and organizations, protocols and interaction frameworks, UML and agent systems, agent-oriented requirements capture and specification, and analysis and design	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4469781-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4389058-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116521-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4504809-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4455835-1>

X-Ray Lasers 2012 : Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on X-Ray Lasers, 11–15 June 2012, Paris, France ¤ These proceedings comprise of invited and contributed papers presented at the 13th International Conference on X-Ray Lasers (ICXRL 2012) which was held 11-15 June 2012 in Paris, in the famous Quartier Latin, inside the historical Center of Cordeliers. This conference is part of a continuing series dedicated to recent developments and applications of x-ray lasers and other coherent x-ray sources with attention to supporting technologies and instrumentation. New results in the generation of intense, coherent x-rays and progress towards practical devices and their applications are reported in these proceedings, including areas of research in plasma-based x-ray lasers, 4th generation accelerator-based sources and higher harmonic generation. Recent achievements related to the increase of the repetition rate up to 100 Hz and shorter wavelength collisional plasma-based soft x-ray lasers down to about 7 nm are presented. Seeding the amplifying plasma with a femtosecond high-order harmonic of infrared laser was foreseen as the required breakthrough to break the picosecond frontier. Numerical simulations based on the Maxwell-Bloch model are presented in these proceedings, transposing the chirped pulse amplification technique to the x-ray domain in order to increase the time over which the femtosecond seed can be amplified. These proceedings also include innovative applications of soft x-ray lasers based on techniques and diagnostics relevant to topical domains such as EUV lithography, inertial confinement fusion, or warm dense matter physics	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178312-8>

Postfactual Storytelling? : Post-Truth - Fake News − Narration ¤ It is often claimed in contemporary public debate that we live in a “post-factual age.” This interdisciplinary volume employs the theories and methods of narrative research to investigate the relationship between the “post-factual” and narrative. It seeks to make sense of the core concepts in the debate, such as post-factual, post-truth, reality and truth, events, tales, stories, and narratives. Does postfactual storytelling exist? In current public discourse, there is often critical talk of a ‘post-factual era’. At the same time, there is a growing desire for new, equally believable and visionary narratives that can retell the fundamental foundations of our social, cultural, and political coexistence in a crisis situation felt as a turning point. In this context, a debate has recently emerged about the significance, function, and usefulness of the concept of ‘postfactual storytelling’. Drawing on theories, findings, and methods of narrative research, the contributions to this interdisciplinary volume investigate the relationship between the ‘post-factual’ and the narrative and, at the same time, aim to determine the key terms of the debate, such as ‘post-factual’ and ‘post-truth’, ‘reality’ and ‘truth’, ‘events’ and ‘occurrences’ as well as ‘narratives’, ‘stories’, and ‘narratives’.

Cellular Metals and Polymers : CMaP : Proceedings of the Symposium on Cellular Metals and Polymers, sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), held October 12 - 14, 2004, in Fürth, Germany, including reports from DFG priority program Cellular Metals (SPP 1075) ¤ Closed Cell Metal-Hollow-Sphere-Structures Made by Expandable Polystyrene Technology -- Metal Foams: Properties -- Micromechanical Modelling and Experimental Characterization of the Deformation Behaviour of Open-Cell Metal Foams -- Notch Sensitivity of Aluminium Foams under Fatigue Loading -- Strain-Hardening and Damage of Foamed Aluminium during Tensile Deformation -- Simulation of Cellular Aluminium: Crash and Impact -- Effect of Cell Characteristics on the Compressive Deformation Behavior of a Closed-Cell Aluminium Study on the Production of Metal Foams Using Maxima of the Hydrogen Solubility of Casting Alloys -- The New Easy Foam-Process -- Manufacture and Investigation of Metal Foam Hybrid Components -- Simulation of Metal Foam Formation with the Lattice Boltzmann Method -- Production of Fe-Cr-C-Base Foam: Theoretical Considerations and Practical Fabrication -- Effect of Powder Blending Ratio on Pore Morphology of Combustion Processed Al-Ni Foams -- Influence of Powder Pre-Treatments on Metal Foam Pore Structure -- Investigation of Micropore Creation on the PM-Foam Morphology Intro -- Cellular Metals and Polymers -- Preface -- Table of Contents -- Metal Foams: Keynotes -- An Overview of the Mechanical Properties of Foams and Periodic Lattice Materials -- Fabrication and Properties of Porous Materials with Directional Elongated Pores -- Metal Foam as a Combination of Lightweight Engineering and Damping -- VFT: The Novel Vacuum Foaming Technology for Mg-Foams -- A New Generation of Materials and Products -- Metal Foams: Processes -- Analysis of Metal Foaming Behaviour and Development of Foaming Processes This collection constitutes an essential sourcebook for researchers, producers and users seeking technical information on materials with foam-like structures. The collection is unique, in that it brings together people from the fields of metals and polymers. Both material types derive their advantageous properties from a cellular structure. These properties include: low weight, high specific stiffness and strength, excellent energy absorption capacity, as well as damping and insulation properties. On the other hand, the processing of metals is far more difficult due to the higher temperatures involved. Another important factor is the faster decay of metal foam structures, at the end of the foaming process, because of their combination of high surface tension and low viscosity. The differences in foamability, between metals and polymers, explain why cellular plastics have been widely used for some time whereas cellular metals have only recently found their first applications. The present volume expertly reviews the known scientific results in these fields; particularly with regard to the understanding of foam processing (e.g. mechanisms of stabilization) as well as foam properties (e.g. the material's response to fatigue and crash situations).This collection constitutes an essential sourcebook for researchers, producers and users seeking technical information on materials with foam-like structures. The 63 papers of this proceedings were first presented at the Symposium on Cellular Metals and Polymers, sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, in October 2004, in Fürth, Germany. Also included are reports from the DFG program on Cellular Metals. Keynote talks were given on topics that include an overview of the mechanical properties of foams and periodic lattice materials, physics of polymer foams, and the role of rheology in foaming polymers. The papers are grouped into sections, including processes of metal foams, properties of metal foams, particle foams and simulation, component fabrication and application of metal foams, and commercial applications and products of polymer foams.

Jewels without crowns : Mughal gems in miniatures ¤ India and gemstones are inseparable. Among the Subcontinent’s most prolific patrons of the jewelled arts were the Mughal emperors, whose adornments dazzled visitors centuries ago and continue to excite viewers today. Complimenting the brilliance of these creations were the miniature paintings of the time. Often likened to jewels, these works on paper do more than entertain the eye; they illuminate as well. By comparing the paintings and the objects depicted in them, the world of Mughal opulence is opened to the reader. Jewels without Crowns brings together two fields of artistic accomplishment by one of the most visionary dynasties of the Islamic world.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135092-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4052945-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008650-1>

Commonly residues are known to pollute environments, causes hygienic problems or they are cost-intensive to collect and treat. Since fossil raw materials are becoming scarce, biogenic residues are more and more a topic of utilization. Application options are manifold. They range from energetic utilization, e.g. to provide electricity and heat for households, industries and agricultural facilities, up to substantial applications ranging from bulk products such as composts and specific products like mineral fertilizers or biochemicals. A special challenge is the interface between rural and urban systems. In this context the mutual understanding is often limited, usually due to a lack of knowledge or contradicting interests. The RAMIRAN2015 proceedings provides reviewed four-page summaries of about 160 conference presentations given by participants from more than 35 countries to the described issues at the conference. The information relates on the state-of-the-art and on innovations in following areas: quality fertilizers from residues, sustainable soils, advances in emission prevention, the bioresource challenge, and sustainable regions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076573-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172777-0>
Law Didactics - Necessity or Luxury? : 1st Conference on Law Didactics in Austria ¤ This edited book brings together several contributions from the first conference on law education under perspective of educational sciences and jurisprudence in autumn 2014. With this conference new perspectives from an Austrian view have been opened. From a jurisprudential perspective the question arises why an established and consolidated system should be extended or revised by bringing in aspects and questions from education into the canon of law education. From a didactical perspective there is a challenge to face the specific requirements of the discipline and its corresponding epistemology. This includes above all the question how a general educational access can become a content-specific educational access. In addition to these general aspects the book also analyzes questions of curricular design, course planning and assessment.With contributions by:Walter Berka | Patrick Warto | Otto Lagodny | Hans Paul Prümm | Ulrike Kugler | Roland Robwein | Eva-Maria Griesbacher | Martin Griesbacher | Kai von Lewinski | Barbara Lange | Ulrike Hanke | Ann-Marie Kaulbach | Helga Wessel | Marcus W.

Contemporary Jewish Autobiography ¤ The proceedings of the conference of the same name assemble papers concentrating largely on Franco-Jewish autobiography in the last few decades. Relevant literature in English and German is also discussed. In addition, three Italian authors of autobiographies comment on their own works. The theoretical reflection undertaken in the volume either accompanies the analysis of individual works or takes a broader view. It centres (a) on the relationship between autobiography and 'auto-fiction', and (b) on the fundamental issue of what we precisely mean when we speak of 'Jewish autobiographies'.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028808-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003939-0>

Control of Partial Differential Equations : Cetraro, Italy 2010, Editors: Piermarco Cannarsa, Jean-Michel Coron ¤ The term “control theory” refers to the body of results - theoretical, numerical and algorithmic - which have been developed to influence the evolution of the state of a given system in order to meet a prescribed performance criterion. Systems of interest to control theory may be of very different natures. This monograph is concerned with models that can be described by partial differential equations of evolution. It contains five major contributions and is connected to the CIME Course on Control of Partial Differential Equations that took place in Cetraro (CS, Italy), July 19 - 23, 2010. Specifically, it covers the stabilization of evolution equations, control of the Liouville equation, control in fluid mechanics, control and numerics for the wave equation, and Carleman estimates for elliptic and parabolic equations with application to control. We are confident this work will provide an authoritative reference work for all scientists who are interested in this field, representing at the same time a friendly introduction to, and an updated account of, some of the most active trends in current research. 1 On some recent advances on stabilization for hyperbolic equations -- 2 Notes on the Control of the Liouville Equation -- 3 Some questions of control in ﬂuid mechanics -- 4 Carleman estimates and some applications to control theory -- 5 The Wave Equation: Control and Numerics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032317-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044779-0>

Beyond patronage : reconsidering models of practice ¤ Essays, projects, and interviews will examine emerging forms of sponsorship, new forms of connectivity - technological or social - that produce innovative modes of collaboration, and strategies for cultivating relationships that allow us to rethink typical hierarchies between those in power and those in service. One could argue that the profession of architecture has traditionally been characterized by patronage. Throughout the twentieth century, private clients have enabled architects to develop and realize their most significant work. Today, the landscape of patronage is shifting. While the role of private clients is still central to the survival of the profession, an increasing number of architects and design practitioners are actively cultivating partnerships with not-for-profits, granting agencies, educational institutions, and other public organizations. How are these broader relationships redefining the role of patronage in architecture? Have our current economic, ecological, and political climates provoked architecture to confront its own priorities and assumptions? How can the practice of architecture be shaped not only through relationships of power, but also through strategies of empowerment? How are emerging practitioners today grappling with issues of inclusion and exclusion in the field?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7607862-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069340-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131695-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004799-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002844-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4441716-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002849-5>

Sensor Systems and Software : First International ICST Conference, S-CUBE 2009, Pisa, Italy, September 7-9, 2009, Revised Selected Papers ¤ This book constitutes the proceedings of the First International ICST Conference, S-CUBE 2009, held in Pisa, Italy, in september 2009. The 16 contributions published in this volume were carefully selected from 45 submitted works in a rigorous peer-reviewed process. In addition to this 3 distinguished researchers were asked to contribute 3 invited papers. The papers examine research challenges facing system development and software support for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Currently, wireless sensor networks introduce innovative and interesting application scenarios that may support a large amount of different applications including environmental monitoring, disaster prevention, building automation, object tracking, nuclear reactor control, fire detection, agriculture, healthcare, and traffic monitoring. The widespread acceptance of these new services can be improved by the definition of frameworks and architectures that have the potential to radically simplify software development for wireless sensor network based applications. The aim of these new architectures is to support flexible, scalable programming of applications based on adaptive middleware. As a consequence, WSNs require novel programming paradigms and technologies. Moreover the design of new complex systems, characterized by the interaction of different and heterogeneous resources, will allow the development of innovative applications that meet high performance goals. Hence, WSNs require contributions from many fields such as embedded systems, distributed systems, data management, system security and applications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4426067-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126945-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4307964-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308224-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076370-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4789222-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139375-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274324-2>

Rethinking linguistic creativity in non-native Englishes ¤ At a time when the paradigm gap (Sridhar & Sridhar 1986) between the EFL and ESL research areas is attracting much scholarly attention, the contributions in the current volume explore this gap from the perspective of linguistic innovations across the two different types of non-native Englishes. In this endeavour, this volume unveils the many facets of linguistic innovations in non-native English varieties and explores the fine line between learners' erroneous versus creative use of a target language. Adopting empirical, corpus-based approaches to portray linguistic innovations characteristic of EFL and ESL varieties, the contributions show how the interaction of linguistic and social forces influences the development of novel linguistic forms in both endonormative ESL contexts and exonormative EFL contexts	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018424-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014777-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032903-3>

Sensing Collectives : aesthetic and political practices intertwined ¤ Are aesthetics and politics really two different things? The book takes a new look at how they intertwine, by turning from theory to practice. Case studies trace how sensory experiences are created and how collective interests are shaped. They investigate how aesthetics and politics are entangled, both in building and disrupting collective orders, in governance and innovation. This ranges from populist rallies and artistic activism over alternative lifestyles and consumer culture to corporate PR and governmental policies. Authors are academics and artists. The result is a new mapping of the intermingling and co-constitution of aesthetics and politics in engagements with collective orders	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046514-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4024596-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140349-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000626-8>
Transatlantic democracy in the twentieth century : transfer and transformation ¤ Transatlantic Democracy in the Twentieth Century refers to much more than a US mission in Europe after the two world wars or the re-education of the German populace at the end of the country’s "Sonderweg." Following the Cold War and the apparent absolute victory of the Western model, the debate over democracy has been reinvigorated by the challenges of post-democracy and populism, thus reshaping our understanding of transatlantic history. Transatlantic democracy in the 20th century - this concept goes beyond the idea of an American civilizing mission in Europe after two World Wars, and certainly beyond the notion of re-educating Germans, and making them fit for Western institutions after Nazism. As democracy is being contested anew in the beginning of the 21st century, a much more complicated landscape of democracy since 1900 emerges. Transfer was not a one-way-street, and patterns of conflict and transformation affected both American and European political societies. American democracy may not be reduced to a resilient defense of original traditions, while the narrative of German democracy is more than redemption from catastrophe. The essays in this volume contribute to a new history of transatlantic democracy that accounts for its manifold experiences and constant renegotiations, up to the current challenges of American and European populism.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046584-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011413-2>

The monograph describes how accretion processes are related to the presence of jets in stellar objects and active galactic nuclei and to jet formation. The authors treat theoretical work as well as current observational facts. This volume of the highly esteemed Les Houches series is meant as an advanced text that can serve to attract students to exciting new research work in astrophysics	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003326-0>
Lie Theory and Its Applications in Physics : Varna, Bulgaria, June 2013 ¤ Traditionally, Lie theory is a tool to build mathematical models for physical systems. Recently, the trend is towards geometrization of the mathematical description of physical systems and objects. A geometric approach to a system yields in general some notion of symmetry which is very helpful in understanding its structure. Geometrization and symmetries are meant in their widest sense, i.e., representation theory, algebraic geometry, infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and groups, superalgebras and supergroups, groups and quantum groups, noncommutative geometry, symmetries of linear and nonlinear PDE, special functions, and others. Furthermore, the necessary tools from functional analysis and number theory are included. This is a big interdisciplinary and interrelated field. Samples of these fresh trends are presented in this volume, based on contributions from the Workshop "Lie Theory and Its Applications in Physics" held near Varna (Bulgaria) in June 2013. This book is suitable for a broad audience of mathematicians, mathematical physicists, and theoretical physicists and researchers in the field of Lie Theory	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037952-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130355-6>
The regulation of international financial markets : perspectives for reform ¤ At present primarily governed by market forces with little regulatory interference, international financial relations have become increasingly important for global as well as national economies. Contributors to this volume consider whether this absence of regulation is wise, in the light of recent financial crises. This book accordingly presents a framework for an analysis of the options in regulating international financial markets from the perspective of public international law. The volume will be of interest to scholars and practitioners involved with comparative public law, constitutional economics and financial regulation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201190-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4302181-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027402-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120506-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162044-6>

Foliation Theory in Algebraic Geometry ¤ Featuring a blend of original research papers and comprehensive surveys from an international team of leading researchers in the thriving fields of foliation theory, holomorphic foliations, and birational geometry, this book presents the proceedings of the conference 'Foliation Theory in Algebraic Geometry,' hosted by the Simons Foundation in New York City in September 2013. Topics covered include: Fano and del Pezzo foliations; the cone theorem and rank one foliations; the structure of symmetric differentials on a smooth complex surface and a local structure theorem for closed symmetric differentials of rank two; an overview of lifting symmetric differentials from varieties with canonical singularities and the applications to the classification of AT bundles on singular varieties; an overview of the powerful theory of the variety of minimal rational tangents introduced by Hwang and Mok; recent examples of varieties which are hyperbolic and yet the Green-Griffiths locus is the whole of X; and a classification of psuedoeffective codimension one distributions. Foliations play a fundamental role in algebraic geometry, for example in the proof of abundance for threefolds and to a solution of the Green-Griffiths conjecture for surfaces of general type with positive Segre class. The purpose of this volume is to foster communication and enable interactions between experts who work on holomorphic foliations and birational geometry, and to bring together leading researchers to demonstrate the powerful connection of ideas, methods, and goals shared by these two areas of study.

Feminist philosophy of technology ¤ INTRODUCTION -- What is Femeinst Philosophy of Technology? A Critical Overview -- Technologies: Robots -- Technologies: Reproduction and Health Care -- Fields: Art, Science, And applied Work -- Fields: Politics, Society, and the Law -- Perspectives: From Ecofeminism to New Materialist Feminism and Critical Posthumansim. There has been little attention to feminism and gender issues in mainstream philosophy of technology and vice versa. Since the beginning of the so-called »second wave feminism« (in the middle of the 20th century), there has been a growing awareness of the urgency of a critical reflection of technology and science within feminist discourse. But feminist thinkers have not consistently interpreted technology and science as emancipative and liberating for the feminist movement. Because technological development is mostly embedded in social, political, and economic systems that are patriarchally hierarchized, many feminists criticized the structures of dominance, marginalization and oppression inherent in numerous technologies. Therefore, the question of defining and ascribing responsibility in technics and science is essential for this anthology – regarding for instance the technological transformation of labor, the life in the information society, and the relationship between humans and machines.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126976-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127504-4>

Engineering Societies in the Agents World VI : 6th International Workshop, ESAW 2005, Kusadasi, Turkey, October 26-28, 2005, Revised Selected and Invited Papers ¤ ESAW 2005 took place at the Pine Bay Hotel in Kusadasi, Turkey at the end of the October 2005. It was organized as a stand-alone event as were ESAW 2004and ESAW 2003.Following the initial ESAW vision,which wasset in 1999, by the members of the working group on “Communication, Coordination and Collaboration” of Agentlink, ESAW 2005 continued to focus on the engineering of complex software systems in terms of multi-agent societies, especially the social and environmental aspects of such societies. The number of participants (40 researchers from 10 countries) and the highly interactive discussions held during the workshop showed the augmented importance of the initial vision as well as the e?ectiveness of ESAW as a well-established research forum. It is obvious that today’s interconnected world increases the importance of approaches concerning the engineering of complex and distributed software systems. These kinds of large scale systems, made up of massive numbers of autonomous components, force us to discover new and novel approaches to model and engineer such systems as agent societies. It is very likely that such innovations will exploit lessons from a variety of di?erent scienti?c disciplines, such as sociology, economics, organizational science and biology: ESAW 2005 included presentations from these domains in addition to its traditional - search topics.

This book is based on a school held at DIKU Copenhagen, Denmark in summer 1998 during which leading researchers summarized the state of the art in partial evaluation. The lectures presented survey the foundations of partial evaluation in a clear and rigorous manner and practically introduce several existing partial evaluators with numerous examples. The second part of the book is devoted to more sophisticated theoretical aspects, advances systems and applications, and highlights open problems and challenges. The book is ideally suited for advanced courses and for self study.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055382-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006340-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4323152-4>

Security System Reform and Governance ¤ This publication continues efforts by the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) to develop tools and instruments for conflict prevention and for improving security and stability in the long term. The guidance underlines the positive role that the integrated reform of a country’s security system can play in stabilising fragile, conflict-prone or conflict affected states. This includes not only the armed forces, police and gendarmerie, intelligence services and justice and penal systems, but also the civil authorities responsible for oversight and democratic control. Part I contains a policy statement and paper endorsed in 2004 by development ministers and agency heads of the DAC and by the OECD council. It sets out the key concepts of security system reform (SSR) and suggests ways to support it in developing countries, taking into account regional dynamics. In Part II, a lead consultant examines the origins of the SSR agenda and the challenges that donors face in promoting it in partner countries. The Annex to the publication contains work by an expert working in each of the four regions: Africa, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, and South-east Europe, the Baltics and the CIS. It sets out their assessment of the changes that are taking place in the way that developing countries in these regions think about security and provides an account and analysis of individual reform activities currently being undertaken.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127888-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115716-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054793-0>
The search for extraterrestrial intelligence : proceedings of the 2nd SETI-INAF Meeting 2019 ¤ This book presents the latest knowledge of the newly discovered Earth-like exoplanets and reviews improvements in both radio and optical SETI. A key aim is to stimulate fresh discussion on algorithms that will be of high value in this extremely complicated search. Exoplanets resembling Earth could well be able to sustain life and support the evolution of technological civilizations, but to date, all searches for such life forms have proved fruitless. The failings of SETI observations are well recognized, and a new search approach is necessary. In this book, different detection algorithms that exploit state-of-the-art, low-cost, and extremely fast multiprocessors are examined and compared. Novel methods such as the agnostic entropy and high-sensitivity blind signal extraction algorithms should represent a quantum leap forward in SETI. The book is of interest to all researchers in the field and hopefully stimulates significant progress in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4350496-6>
Nuclear fusion research : understanding plasma-surface interactions ; [on October 28 - 31, 2002, a technical meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was held at the Institut für Plasmaphysik, Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany ; this was the fourth in a series of such meetings ...]  ¤ It became clear in the early days of fusion research that the effects of the containment vessel (erosion of "impurities") degrade the overall fusion plasma performance. Progress in controlled nuclear fusion research over the last decade has led to magnetically confined plasmas that, in turn, are sufficiently powerful to damage the vessel structures over its lifetime. This book reviews current understanding and concepts to deal with this remaining critical design issue for fusion reactors. It reviews both progress and open questions, largely in terms of available and sought-after plasma-surface interaction data and atomic/molecular data related to these "plasma edge" issues. TOC:1.

Robotic Welding, Intelligence and Automation ¤ BEGIN Part 1: General Intelligent Robotics -- Part 2: Intelligent Techniques for Robotic Welding -- Part 3: Vision Sensing and Intelligent Control of Arc Welding Processing -- Part 4: Welding Automations -- Part 5: Intelligent Control and its Application in Engineering. Robotic welding systems have been used in different types of manufacturing. They can provide several benefits in welding applications. The most prominent advantages of robotic welding are precision and productivity. Another benefit is that labor costs can be reduced. Robotic welding also reduces risk by moving the human welder/operator away from hazardous fumes and molten metal close to the welding arc. The robotic welding system usually involves measuring and identifying the component to be welded, we- ing it in position, controlling the welding parameters and documenting the produced welds. However, traditional robotic welding systems rely heavily upon human interv- tion. It does not seem that the traditional robotic welding techniques by themselves can cope well with uncertainties in the welding surroundings and conditions, e. g. variation of weld pool dynamics, fluxion, solid, weld torch, and etc. On the other hand, the advent of intelligent techniques provides us with a powerful tool for solving demanding re- world problems with uncertain and unpredictable environments. Therefore, it is intere- ing to gather current trends and to provide a high quality forum for engineers and researchers working in the filed of intelligent techniques for robotic welding systems. This volume brings together a broad range of invited and contributed papers that describe recent progress in this field. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053870-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4277487-1>
Random Matrices and Iterated Random Functions : Münster, October 2011 ¤ Random Matrices are one of the major research areas in modern probability theory, due to their prominence in many different fields such as nuclear physics, statistics, telecommunication, free probability, non-commutative geometry, and dynamical systems. A great deal of recent work has focused on the study of spectra of large random matrices on the one hand and on iterated random functions, especially random difference equations, on the other. However, the methods applied in these two research areas are fairly dissimilar. Motivated by the idea that tools from one area could potentially also be helpful in the other, the volume editors have selected contributions that present results and methods from random matrix theory as well as from the theory of iterated random functions. This work resulted from a workshop that was held in Münster, Germany in 2011. The aim of the workshop was to bring together researchers from two fields of probability theory: random matrix theory and the theory of iterated random functions. Random matrices play fundamental, yet very different roles in the two fields. Accordingly, leading figures and young researchers gave talks on their field of interest that were also accessible to a broad audience. E.

Nazism across borders : the social policies of the Third Reich and their global appeal ¤ Nazism across Borders argues that Nazi social policies were part of transnational exchanges and processes. Beyond territorial conquest, the Nazis planned to export and internationalize their version of welfare, and 26381promoted a new kind of internationalism, pitched as a superior alternative to its liberal and Communist contenders.Since the late nineteenth century, the 'German social model' had established itself as a powerful route for escaping from the precarious conditions associated with wage work. The Nazis capitalized on this reputation, continuing some elements, but also added new measures, mainly to pursue their antisemitic, racist, and highly aggressive goals. The contributions in this collection shed new light on the complex ways in which German and Nazi ideas were received and negotiated by non-German actors and groups around the world before the Second World War. Why were they interested in what was going on in Germany? To what extent did Nazi policies emulate programmes elsewhere (for example, in Fascist Italy), and where did they serve as role models? Nazi social policies, we argue, were a benchmark that societies as diverse as Japan, Norway,and the United States considered in making their own choices. Nazism across Borders breaks new ground for the history of the Second World War and 'Hitler's empire' in Europe. How did the Nazis export their ideas when they finally occupied large swaths of the continent and what was the role of non-German actors? What were the links to the better-known stories of exploitation of lands, resources, and peoples?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055879-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041316-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027462-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049716-1>
Infinite Dimensional Dynamical Systems ¤ This collection covers a wide range of topics of infinite dimensional dynamical systems generated by parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations, solitary equations, lattice differential equations, delay differential equations, and stochastic differential equations. Infinite dimensional dynamical systems are generated by equations describing the evolution in time of systems whose status must be depicted in infinite dimensional phase spaces. Studying the long-term behaviors of such systems is important in our understanding of their spatiotemporal pattern formation and global continuation, and has been among the major sources of motivation and applications of new developments in nonlinear analysis and other mathematical theories. The theory of infinite dimensional dynamical systems has also increasingly important applications in the physical, chemical and life sciences. This book collects 19 papers from 48 invited lecturers to the International Conference on Infinite Dimensional Dynamical Systems held at York University, Toronto, in September of 2008. As the conference was dedicated to Professor George Sell from University of Minnesota on the occasion of his 70th birthday, this collection reflects his pioneering work and influence in core areas of dynamical systems, including non-autonomous dynamical systems, skew-product flows, invariant manifolds theory, infinite dimensional dynamical systems, approximation dynamics, and fluid flows.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013396-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4207956-1>

Intellectual property in the global arena : jurisdiction, applicable law, and the recognition of judgments in Europe, Japan and the US ¤ The private international law of intellectual property is currently much debated both in Europe and abroad. Art. 8 of the Rome II Regulation of 2007, which codifies a territorial approach for the infringement of intellectual property, has provoked an intensive discussion in Europe as to whether the lex loci protection is still appropriate for intellectual property litigation in the age of worldwide networks. A condensed outcome of this debate is summarized in the »Principles for Conflict of Laws in Intellectual Property« (CLIP Principles) drafted by the European Max Planck Group on Conflict of Laws in Intellectual Property (CLIP), published recently in a second preliminary draft. On the international scale, the American Law Institute's »Intellectual Property: Principles Governing Jurisdiction, Choice of Law, and Judgments in Transnational Disputes« of 2007 (ALI Principles) are the focal point of the debate. A Japanese project (»Transparency Proposal«) was finalized in 2009. This volume provides a comparative analysis of the three proposals.

Self-Adaptive Software: Applications : Second International Workshop, IWSAS 2001 Balatonfüred, Hungary, May 17-19, 2001 Revised Papers ¤ The 18 revised full papers presented in this book together with an introductory survey were carefully reviewed and constitute the documentation of the Second International Workshop on Self-adaptive Software, IWSAS 2001, held in Balatonfüred, Hungary in May 2001. Self-adaptive software evaluates its own behavior and changes it when the evaluation indicates that the software does not accomplish what it is intended to do or when better functionality or better performance is possible. The self-adaptive approach in software engineering builds on well known dynamic features familiar to Lisp or Java programmes and aims at improving the robustness of software systems by gradually adding new features of self-adaption or autonomy	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128128-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055382-6>
Employment, growth, and finance : economic reality, and economic growth ¤ This important new book brings together a significant body of new essays on some of the central economic problems facing governments, firms and individuals in the 1990s. Under the direction of Paul Davidson and Jan Kregel, an international group of distinguished economists provide new perspectives on key issues including employment, corporate and work place restructuring, economic growth and development, financial integration and transformation of the former command economies. Combining rigorous scholarly assessments of the issues with policy prescription, the contributors seek to provide solutions to the problem of providing full employment, to identify the factors determining the expansion of the economy, and to analyse the impact of financial markets, financial derivatives and international regulations on domestic and global economic performance. Employment, Growth and Finance will be welcomed by all those interested in the solutions to international economic problems being developed by post Keynesian economists	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005982-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066527-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030426-7>

The Improved Human : Biotechnological Possibilities between Freedom and Responsibility ¤ BEGIN: The phenomenon of increasing optimisation and transformation of the human body using modern biotechnologies is encountered in various fields. In addition to interference with the human genome, attempts to merge man and machine are becoming increasingly important. Since the idea of an inviolable form of human ‘nature’ has been lost, new philosophical and ethical efforts are required in order to meet the challenges associated with it. In this book, the topics of transhumanism, humans and machines, genome editing, sex reassignment and the issue of enhancing happiness through biotechnological means are discussed and reflected on ethically. With contributions by Alois Birklbauer, Christian Egarter, Reinhold Esterbauer, Johann Platzer, Andreas Reinisch, Michael Rosenberger, Walter Schaupp, Peter Strasser, Gunda Werner.

Biology und Epidemiology of Hormone Replacement Therapy : Discussions on Post-Menopausal Health ¤ Die Vor- und Nachteile der Hormonersatztherapie (HRT) werden von einer Expertengruppe hinsichtlich der epidemiologischen Beweislage diskutiert. Obwohl alle positiven und negativen Aspekte der HRT behandelt werden, liegt der Schwerpunkt der Diskussionen bei der Frage des Brustkrebsrisikos. Unter anderem wird gezeigt, dass die aus epidemiologischen Studien abgeleiteten Ergebnisse sich nicht mit den Wachstumseigenschaften dieser Tumoren decken so dass weiterführende Bevölkerungsuntersuchungen unter Einbeziehungen pathobiologischen Sachverstands notwendig erscheinen. This volume contains an advanced level discussion on the appropriateness of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in modern postmenopausal women on the basis of the current evidence provided by recent epidemiological studies. It addresses all aspects of benefits and risks associated with HRT, including issues concerning psychology, the cardiovascular system, bone structure, and carcinogenesis. It focuses, however, on cancer risk and on risk of breast cancer in particular. In doing so, it provides a detailed discussion of the pathobiological features of breast cancer, concluding that the evidence provided by epidemiological studies is in conflict with the biological growth features of breast cancer. It advocates further epidemiological studies which incorporate pathobiologische Beurteilungen.

Representing Gods and Humans in the Ancient Near-East and in the Bible : Proceedings of the Colloquium Organized by the Collège de France, Paris, May 5-6 2015 ¤ What was the function of representing deities and also humans in the ancient Near-East? Which were the different ways of making gods visible, and the specific functions of these representations? Might these material and visual representations help us to better understand official cults, as well as private cults? What was the role of images in the royal cult? Was the king the only “image” of the gods, or could all humans fulfill this role? Why were cult images forbidden? Does the biblical prohibition have any precedent or parallel in the ancient Near-East, or elsewhere? And how do the ways of representing gods and humans change in the absence of cultic images? The conference Representing Gods and Humans in the Ancient Near-East and in the Bible, held at the Collège de France, Paris, on May 5-6 2015, sought to shed light on these questions surrounding the image, a critical issue for our understanding of ancient as well as modern religions	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125333-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136253-6>
Geometric Topology: Recent Developments : Lectures given on the 1st Session of the Centro Internazionale Matematico Estivo (C.I.M.E.) held at Montecatini Terme, Italy, June 4–12, 1990 ¤ Geometric Topology can be defined to be the investigation of global properties of a further structure (e.g. differentiable, Riemannian, complex, algebraic etc.) one can impose on a topological manifold. At the C.I.M.E. session in Montecatini, in 1990, three courses of lectures were given on recent developments in this subject which is nowadays emerging as one of the most fascinating and promising fields of contemporary mathematics. The notes of these courses are collected in this volume and can be described as: 1) the geometry and the rigidity of discrete subgroups in Lie groups especially in the case of lattices in semi-simple groups; 2) the study of the critical points of the distance function and its application to the understanding of the topology of Riemannian manifolds; 3) the theory of moduli space of instantons as a tool for studying the geometry of low-dimensional manifolds.

Infrastructure-Induced Mobility ¤ Do roads induce mobility? This might sound like a strange question, yet it only stands to reason that building new roads -- or other infrastructure -- may actually encourage people to use the new additional capacity to travel more. Induced mobility is a hotly debated issue, but the experts are no longer in any doubt that it is a very real phenomenon. However, measuring it is another matter, since we do not have sufficient data or experience in this area. This Round Table presents the data that is available to date on infrastructure-induced mobility. From the introductory reports and discussions, it is clear that much progress has been made in the last few years. As recently as ten years ago, many experts would have disputed the very existence of the induced mobility phenomenon. Today a consensus is emerging: Round Table 105 gives the full report.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062937-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039785-3>

Fete of Combinatorics and Computer Science ¤ Discrete Mathematics and theoretical computer science are closely linked research areas with strong impacts on applications and various other scientific disciplines. Both fields deeply cross fertilize each other. One of the persons who particularly contributed to building bridges between these and many other areas is László Lovász, whose outstanding scientific work has defined and shaped many research directions in the past 40 years. A number of friends and colleagues, all top authorities in their fields of expertise gathered at the two conferences in August 2008 in Hungary, celebrating Lovász' 60th birthday. It was a real fete of combinatorics and computer science. Some of these plenary speakers submitted their research or survey papers prior to the conferences. These are included in the volume "Building Bridges". The other speakers were able to finish their contribution only later, these are collected in the present volume.

The lives and death-throes of massive stars : proceedings of the 329th Symposium of the International Astronomical Union held in Auckland, New Zealand November 28-December 2, 2016 ¤ Research on massive stars is undergoing a period of rapid progress with long-held convictions being shown to be incomplete. While these stars are relatively few in numbers, they are the main driver of chemical and dynamical evolution in galaxies through their stellar winds and explosive deaths in core-collapse supernovae. Furthermore the impact of massive stars is widely recognized in many areas, as they are often used as tools to interpret the conditions and processes arising in different environments. In parallel, the development of new instrumentation, analysis techniques and dedicated surveys across all possible wavelengths have delivered large amounts of exquisite new data. These data are now providing a harsh test for the current state-of-the-art theoretical calculations of massive star birth, evolution and death. Aspects of massive stars discussed include supernovae, stellar evolution, stellar properties, and stellar populations.--	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057365-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169052-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184117-7>
Democracy, Decentralisation and Deficits in Latin America ¤ What is the impact of political decentralisation in Latin America? This book considers the problems raised by political decentralisation in the region and identifies the challenges ahead. Political decentralisation tends to devolve a certain amount of financial responsibility to the sub-national levels of government, hence potentially destabilising centrally established fiscal and budgetary targets. The question is, thus, a particularly timely one which seeks to reconcile enhanced democratisation with the fiscal rigour demanded by the international marketplace. This book brings together papers presented at the eighth annual meeting of the "International Forum on Latin American Perspectives", sponsored jointly by the OECD Development Centre and the Inter-American Development Bank. The analyses of economic experts are confronted with the real-life experiences of practitioners from a number of Latin American countries, providing the reader with a stimulating exposé of the risks and benefits to economic development of the new decentralising trend. Of particular interest are the so-called "ten commandments" suggested by Ricardo Hausmann as a set of rules which should govern fiscal management in decentralised democracies. Discussion of these and other propositions makes for a lively, yet soundly based contribution to this very important debate.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127795-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012005-3>

The Newspaper as Medium in Modern Language History: Corpora - Analysis - Impact ¤ In the 18th and 19th centuries, newspaper publishing saw a major upsurge: the daily newspaper spread as an alternative to existing weekly newspapers and expanded the scope of available text types. 'Newspeak' had considerable influence over the development of the German language. Projects to digitalize newspapers, as presented by this edited volume, help to illuminate this history.-- The investigation of newspapers has been largely neglected in linguistic research so far. However, newspapers already reached a larger audience in the 18th century than any other form of communication. The 'newspaper language' had a significant impact on the development of German, also by supporting interregional balancing tendencies. However, these processes were not systematically investigated, nor was the language use of the developing or newly emerging rubrics and press text types. The prevailing aversion in educated circles to the style of serially produced texts under time pressure for the moment led to the neglect of the newspaper as an important source of language history and thus to not always accurate assessments of its linguistic design. Furthermore, newspapers were only available in representative digitalized selection corpora in excerpts. Recently, however, large-scale projects for newspaper digitization have emerged, which can serve as a basis for new linguistic studies. The contributions of this conference volume deal with the creation of digital historical newspaper corpora, characteristics and development trends of newspaper language on various levels and on the basis of individual corpora, as well as the evaluation of newspaper language from a contemporary perspective	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4293595-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056475-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131821-3>

Social life of economic inequalities in contemporary Latin America : decades of change ¤ This book is open access under a CC BY 4.0 license. This edited volume examines how economic processes have worked upon social lives and social realities in Latin America during the past decades. Through tracing the effects of the neoliberal epoch into the era of the so-called pink tide, the book seeks to understand to what extent the turn to the left at the start of the millennium managed to challenge historically constituted configurations of inequality. A central argument in the book is that in spite of economic reforms and social advances on a range of arenas, the fundamental tenants of socio-economic inequalities have not been challenged substantially. As several countries are now experiencing a return to right-wing politics, this collection helps us better understand why inequalities are so entrenched in the Latin American continent, but also the complex and creative ways that it is continuously contested. The book directs itself to students, scholars and anyone interested in Latin America, economic anthropology, political anthropology, left-wing politics, poverty and socio-economic inequalities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186884-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4248362-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4234987-4>

The First Pannonian Symposium on Mathematical Statistics ¤ The first Pannonian Symposium on Mathematical Statistics was held at Bad Tatzmannsdorf (Burgenland/Austria) from September 16th to 21st, 1979. The aim of it was to further and intensify scientific cooperation in the Pannonian area, which, in a broad sense, can be understood to cover Hungary, the eastern part of Austria, Czechoslovakia, and parts of Poland, Yugoslavia and Romania. The location of centers of research in mathematical statistics and probability theory in this territory has been a good reason for the geographical limitation of this meeting. About 70 researchers attended this symposium, and 49 lectures were delivered; a considerable part of the presented papers is collected in this volume. Beside the lectures, vigorous informal discussions among the participants took place, so that many problems were raised and possible ways of solutions were attacked. We take the opportunity to thank Dr. U. Dieter (Graz), Dr. F. Konecny (Wien), Dr. W. Krieger (Göttingen) and Dr. E. Neuwirth (Wien) for their valuable help in the refereeing work for this volume. The Pannonian Symposium could not have taken place without the support of several institutions: The Austrian Ministry for Research and Science, the State government of Burgenland, the Community Bad Tatzmannsdorf, the Kurbad Tatzmannsdorf AG, the Austrian Society for Information Science and Statistics, IBM Austria, Volksbank Oberwart, Erste Österreichische Spar-Casse and Spielbanken AG Austria. The Austrian Academy of Sciences made possible the participation in the Symposium for several mathematicians. We express our gratitude to all these institutions for their generous help.

Protection of Materials and Structures From the Space Environment ¤ The goals of the 10th International Space Conference on "Protection of Materials and Structures from Space Environment ICPMSE-10J, since its inception in 1992, have been to facilitate exchanges between members of the various engineering and science disciplines involved in the development of space materials, including aspects of LEO, GEO and Deep Space environments, ground-based qualification, and in-flight experiments and lessons learned from operational vehicles that are closely interrelated to disciplines of the atmospheric sciences, solar-terrestrial interactions and space life sciences.The knowledge of environmental conditions on and around the Moon, Mars, Venus and the low Earth orbit as well as other possible candidates for landing such as asteroids have become an important issue, and protecting both hardware and human life from the effects of space environments has taken on a new meaning in light of the increased interest in space travel and colonization of other planets. And while many material experiments have been carried out on the ground and in open space in the last 50 years (LDEF, MEEP, SARE, MISSE, AOP, DSPSE, ESEM, EURECA, HST, MDIM, MIS, MPID, MPAC and SEED), many questions regarding the environmental impact of space on materials remain either poorly understood or unanswered. The coming generations of scientists will have to continue this work and tackle new challenges, continuing to build the level of confidence humans will need to continue the colonization of space. It is hoped that the proceedings of the ICPMSE-10J presented in this book will constitute a small contribution to doing so.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065579-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177066-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180280-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197890-0>

The lace expansion and its applications : Ecole d'Été des Probabilités de Saint-Flour XXXIV - 2004 ¤ The lace expansion is a powerful and flexible method for understanding the critical scaling of several models of interest in probability, statistical mechanics, and combinatorics, above their upper critical dimensions. These models include the self-avoiding walk, lattice trees and lattice animals, percolation, oriented percolation, and the contact process. This volume provides a unified and extensive overview of the lace expansion and its applications to these models. Results include proofs of existence of critical exponents and construction of scaling limits. Often, the scaling limit is described in terms of super-Brownian motion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162442-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112609-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4323583-9>
Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis : Israel Seminar (GAFA) 2017-2019 Volume II ¤ Continuing the theme of the previous volume, these seminar notes reflect general trends in the study of Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis, understood in a broad sense. Two classical topics represented are the Concentration of Measure Phenomenon in the Local Theory of Banach Spaces, which has recently had triumphs in Random Matrix Theory, and the Central Limit Theorem, one of the earliest examples of regularity and order in high dimensions. Central to the text is the study of the Poincaré and log-Sobolev functional inequalities, their reverses, and other inequalities, in which a crucial role is often played by convexity assumptions such as Log-Concavity. The concept and properties of Entropy form an important subject, with Bourgain's slicing problem and its variants drawing much attention. Constructions related to Convexity Theory are proposed and revisited, as well as inequalities that go beyond the Brunn–Minkowski theory. One of the major current research directions addressed is the identification of lower-dimensional structures with remarkable properties in rather arbitrary high-dimensional objects. In addition to functional analytic results, connections to Computer Science and to Differential Geometry are also discussed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018916-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156708-0>

Pulsar astrophysics : the next fifty years : proceedings of the 337th Symposium of the International Astronomical Union, held at Jodrell Bank Observatory, United Kingdom, September 4-8, 2017 ¤ Ever since their discovery in 1967, pulsars and neutron stars have provided an unprecedented opportunity to study the extremes of physics. This started with the very rapid identification of pulsars as rotating neutron stars with extremely strong magnetic fields and, selecting just a few highlights from the following decades, was followed by the discovery of the Hulse–Taylor binary, millisecond pulsars, the first pulsars in globular clusters, the pulsar planets and the double pulsar. In the last decade alone, we have made some amazing discoveries and observations with an impact across all areas of astronomy. With these proceedings of IAU Symposium 337, the 50th anniversary of the discovery of pulsars is celebrated by reflecting on what we have learned from these remarkable physical laboratories and by casting our eyes forward to the exciting opportunities they will provide for physical and astrophysical studies in the coming decades. -- Publisher description	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047828-2>
Thomas Mann and Shakespeare : something rich and strange ¤ The first ever comparative reading of Shakespeare and Thomas Mann in view of key questions in modern culture – "In Doktor Faustus, Thomas Mann associated Shakespeare with the Devil and the demonic guilt of Nazism. Bringing together major scholars from diverse disciplines and countries, this is the first ever book-length study to explore the always fascinating if sometimes disturbing connections between Shakespeare and Mann. It establishes startling resonances between the central works of these two authors, pairing, for instance, Der Zauberberg with The Tempest, Der Tod in Venedig with The Merchant of Venice, Tonio Kröger with Othello, as well as Love's Labour's Lost with Doktor Faustus. It shows how the conjunction of Shakespeare and Mann affords new, alternative perspectives on fundamental issues such as modernity, irony, art, desire, authorship and religion. In the process, it demonstrates the scope for new ways of reading in literary studies in general, by renewing European intellectual connections in the wake of postcolonialism, and challenging the increasingly walled-in specialism of literary topics and periodization"	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049716-1>

Arithmetic and Geometry of K3 Surfaces and Calabi–Yau Threefolds ¤ In recent years, research in K3 surfaces and Calabi–Yau varieties has seen spectacular progress from both the arithmetic and geometric points of view, which in turn continues to have a huge influence and impact in theoretical physics—in particular, in string theory. The workshop on Arithmetic and Geometry of K3 surfaces and Calabi–Yau threefolds, held at the Fields Institute (August 16–25, 2011), aimed to give a state-of-the-art survey of these new developments. This proceedings volume includes a representative sampling of the broad range of topics covered by the workshop. While the subjects range from arithmetic geometry through algebraic geometry and differential geometry to mathematical physics, the papers are naturally related by the common theme of Calabi–Yau varieties. With the large variety of branches of mathematics and mathematical physics touched upon, this area reveals many deep connections between subjects previously considered unrelated. Unlike most other conferences, the 2011 Calabi–Yau workshop started with three days of introductory lectures. A selection of four of these lectures is included in this volume. These lectures can be used as a starting point for graduate students and other junior researchers, or as a guide to the subject. .-Preface.-Introduction -- List of Participants -- K3 and Enriques Surfaces (S.

Antisemitism and Islamophobia in Europe : a shared story?  ¤ This is the first book to examine the relationship between European antisemitism and Islamophobia from the Crusades until the twenty-first century in the principal flashpoints of the two racisms. With case studies ranging from the Balkans to the UK, the contributors take the debate away from politicised polemics about whether or not Muslims are the new Jews. Much previous scholarship and public discussion has focused on comparing European ideas about Jews and Judaism in the past with contemporary attitudes towards Muslims and Islam. This volume rejects this approach. Instead, it interrogates how the dynamic relationship between antisemitism and Islamophobia has evolved over time and space. The result is the uncovering of a previously unknown story in which European ideas about Jews and Muslims were indeed connected, but were also ripped apart. Religion, empire, nation-building, and war, all played their part in the complex evolution of this relationship. As well as a study of prejudice, this book also opens up a new area of inquiry: how Muslims, Jews, and others have responded to these historically connected racisms. The volume brings together leading scholars in the emerging field of antisemitism-Islamophobia studies who work in a diverse range of disciplines: anthropology, history, sociology, critical theory, and literature. Together, they help us to understand a Europe in which Jews and Arabs were once called Semites, and today are widely thought to be on two different sides of the War on Terror Introduction : the shared story of Europe's ideas of the Muslim and the Jew-- a diachronic framework / James Renton and Ben Gidley -- Part I.

In the Temple of the Self: The Artist's House as a Total Work of Art; Europe and America 1800-1948 ¤ As treasure troves of creativity, the homes of artists reflect the intellectual worlds of their creators. Starting with the Villa Stuck in Munich--the aesthetic, conceptual cosmos and life's work of the aristocratic artist Franz von Stuck--this volume integrates the artist's house as a category into the international context and is the first to assign these buildings the status of major works. About twenty examples bring to life the fascination that these artistic fantasies hold for art lovers, including both existing projects and some which, although they have been lost, were of unique importance in their day and still retain their charisma. Along with paintings, sculptures, and photographs closely related to the houses, plans and models convey the correlation between art and life as well as the kind of harmony of the arts expressed in Richard Wagner's historical concept of the total work of art	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033423-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4023693-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138356-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156925-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4466237-3>

Natural Disasters, Cultural Responses: Case Studies toward a Global Environmental History ; [Conference "Natural Disasters and Cultural Strategies: Responses to Catastrophe in Global Perspective" at the German Historical Institute in Washington, D.C. in February 2004"] ¤ Description BEGIN: This collection of essays testifies to the profound impact that earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and other such events have had on humans throughout history in every part of the world. Several contributors argue that the experience of catastrophe has changed humans' behavior and perceptions over time without necessarily reducing their degree of exposure or risk. The book includes case studies from Western Europe, Scandinavia, Algeria, the Middle East, China, India, the Philippines, Argentina, Mexico, and the East Coast of the United States, ranging from the medieval through the modern period. While natural disasters occur around the globe, different cultures, societies, and regions have adopted specific methods and technologies for managing local hazards and for surviving catastrophic natural events. Indeed, how humans deal with catastrophes depends largely on social and cultural patterns, values, belief systems, political institutions, and economic structures. The roles that natural disasters play in society and the meanings they are given vary from one political and geographic space to the next. The essays collected here help us to understand not only how people across the centuries have learned to cope with disaster but also how communities in different parts of the world have developed cultural, social, and technological strategies for doing so.

Surface and apparition : the immateriality of modern surface ¤ Surface is one of the most intensely debated topics in recent arts, humanities and social science scholarship. The changing technologies which manufacture the actual and virtual surfaces of today are radically altering our perception of thresholds and borders. In this volume, international scholars of design and the arts explore a different meaning and function of the material and immaterial qualities of 'surface'. Case studies include various surfaces from computer screens, 'artisanal' engines and glass architecture to gauzy veils, the planetary surface of supply chain capitalism, and spatial embodiment in street markets -- Folds of fashion : unravelled and the planetary surface / (Jussi Parikka) -- Surface-making in nuclear decommissioning : a narrative of sludge, plutonium and their whereabouts / (Petra Tjitske Kalshoven) -- Surface eruption : machine creativity and emotive data objects / (Barbara Rauch) -- The depth of surface / (Lesley Halliwell) -- Where surface meets depth : virtuality in textile and material design / (Elaine Igoe) -- Growing surface between textiles and electrochemistry / (Joanne Horton) -- David Pye's Fluting Engine / (Benedict Carpenter van Barthold) -- Journal (2016-2018) : conversations on looms, cloth and weaving / (Max Mosscrop and Benedict Carpenter van Barthold) -- On drawing : transmission from the lifeworld to paper at Namdaemun Market, Seoul / (Ray Lucas) -- Archive surface / (Jane Birkin) -- Experience, poverty, transparency : the modern surface of interwar glass / (Freyja Hartzell) -- On genealogy of translucent screen and rehabilitation of ephemeral : post-cinema, installation, performance / (Oksana Chefranova).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000626-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042907-6>

Martyrdom in the modern Middle East ¤ This volume assembles contributions from different academic perspectives (religious and Islamic studies, literary and theatre studies, theology, sociology and history) on modern manifestations of martyrdom in the diverse Middle Eastern religious traditions, including Islam, Christianity, Judaism and the Baha'i-faith. The latter is considered in more detail since it is often not included in comparative studies on the monotheistic religions. An excursus into the farer East composes the contribution on Mahatma Ghandi. The volume considers central sociological, philosophical and theological problems which lie at the heart of the phenomenon of martyrdom, the significance of martyrdom in different conflicts, the competing martyr figures which develop in the course of these conflicts as well as the accompanying representations in art and ritual. Special attention is directed to the transitions of traditional forms of martyr representation and the emergence of a global discourse on martyrdom, which can be noticed both in the dissemination of martyr practices as in the reactions to certain martyr events on a global scale.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049396-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4168985-9>
Standards and Delimitations in International Family Law ¤ The second ‘Dialog Internationales Familienrecht’, a conference on international family law, was held in Marburg in May 2019.

The contributions deal, inter alia, with the interests of children in family proceedings, situations of conflict in proceedings dealing with the legal consequences of divorce, the amendment of the Brussels IIbis Regulation as well as the new EU regulations on matrimonial property regimes. The publication is rounded off by an overview of the Federal Court of Justice's case law on international family law, as well as with deliberations on the violation of the personality rights of children on social networks and on the protection of adults in cross-border constellations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027426-3>
Postcolonialism cross-examined : multidirectional perspectives on imperial and colonial pasts and the neocolonial present ¤ Taking a strikingly interdisciplinary and global approach, Postcolonialism Cross-Examined reflects on the current status of postcolonial studies and attempts to break through traditional boundaries, creating a truly comparative and genuinely global phenomenon. Drawing together the field of mainstream postcolonial studies with post-Soviet postcolonial studies and studies of the late Ottoman Empire, the contributors in this volume question many of the concepts and assumptions we have become accustomed to in postcolonial studies, creating a fresh new version of the field. Divided into 3 main sections: Defending the Postcolonial Territory; Political Positions in Light of Unchanged Symmetries; Towards a Multidirectional Approach to the Postcolonial, the contributors look at topics such as humanism, nationalism, multiculturalism, nostalgia and the Anthropocene in order to piece together a new, broader vision for postcolonial studies in the twenty-first century.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035964-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077575-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4566658-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046514-7>

Recurrence Plots and Their Quantifications: Expanding Horizons : Proceedings of the 6th International Symposium on Recurrence Plots, Grenoble, France, 17-19 June 2015 ¤ Towards visual analytics for the exploration of large sets of time series -- Applications of transient signal analysis concept of recurrence plot analysis -- Multi-lag phase diagram analysis for transient signal characterization -- Analysis of non-stationary signals by recurrence dissimilarity -- New insights for testing linearity and complexity with surrogates: a Recurrence Plot approach -- Approximate recurrence quantification analysis (aRQA) in code of best practice -- Splayed recurrence analysis of iterated dynamical systems. The chapters in this book originate from the research work and contributions presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Recurrence Plots held in Grenoble, France in June 2015. Scientists from numerous disciplines gathered to exchange knowledge on recent applications and developments in recurrence plots and recurrence quantification analysis. This meeting was remarkable because of the obvious expansion of recurrence strategies (theory) and applications (practice) into ever-broadening fields of science. It discusses real-world systems from various fields, including mathematics, strange attractors, applied physics, physiology, medicine, environmental and earth sciences, as well as psychology and linguistics. Even readers not actively researching any of these particular systems will benefit from discovering how other scientists are finding practical non-linear solutions to specific problems. The book is of interest to an interdisciplinary audience of recurrence plot users and researchers interested in time series analysis in particular, and in complex systems in general.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1122376863>

Human capital, trade, and public policy in rapidly growing economies : from theory to empirics ¤ Human Capital, Trade and Public Policy in Rapidly Growing Economies argues that only two centuries ago, no society had ever enjoyed sustained growth in living standards. The contributors to this book aim to discover why the world today exhibits a predilection for perpetual self-improvement. In particular, the book focuses on the forces underlying long-lasting growth in East Asia's Newly Industrialized Countries (NICs). Drawing from the experiences of Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, it questions whether public policy can contribute to removing barriers towards accumulation of wealth, and if so, what development policy should be put in place to remedy the existing distortions or market failure problems. Theoretical and empirical analyses are also used to broach other important issues, such as: * Why do some economies experience growth while others decline? * What are the major determinants of long-term growth and development? * Is human capital the main driving force? * Does international trade play a crucial role? This book will appeal to those with an interest in development and public policy	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066527-6>

Air Pollution Modeling and Its Application XV ¤ In 1969 the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) established the Committee on Challenges of Modern Society (CCMS). The subject of air pollution was from the start, one of the priority problems under study within the framework of various pilot studies undertaken by this committee. The organization of a periodic conference dealing with air pollution modelling and its application has become one of the main activities within the pilot study relating to air pollution. These international conferences were successively organized by the United States (first five); Federal Republic of Germany (five); Belgium (five); The Netherlands (four) and Denmark (five). With this one Portugal takes over the duty. This volume contains the papers and poster abstracts presented at the NATO/CCMS International Technical Meeting on Air Pollution Modelling and Its Application held in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, during 15-19 October 2001. This ITM was jointly organized by the University of Aveiro, Portugal (Pilot country) and by the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium (host country). The ITM was attended by 78 participants representing 26 countries from Western and Eastern Europe, North and South America, Asia, Australia and Africa. The main topics of this ITM were : Role of Atmospheric Models in Air Pollution Policy and Abatement Strategies; Integrated Regional Modelling; Global and Long-Range Transport; Regional Air Pollution and Climate; New Developments; and Model Assessment and Verification.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074381-0>

Advances in decision making under risk and uncertainty ¤ Whether we like it or not we all feel that the world is uncertain. From choosing a new technology to selecting a job, we rarely know in advance what outcome will result from our decisions. Unfortunately, the standard theory of choice under uncertainty developed in the early forties and fifties turns out to be too rigid to take many tricky issues of choice under uncertainty into account. The good news is that we have now moved away from the early descriptively inadequate modeling of behavior. This book brings the reader into contact with the accomplished progress in individual decision making through the most recent contributions to uncertainty modeling and behavioral decision making. It also introduces the reader into the many subtle issues to be resolved for rational choice under uncertainty.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070864-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4225781-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066506-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113446-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274923-2>
Dealing with interests, values and knowledge in managing risk : workshop proceedings, Brussels, Belgium 18 - 21 November, 2003  ; [the fourth workshop of the OECD/NEA Forum on Stakeholder Confidence] ¤ Radioactive waste management is an area of public interest in which stakeholder involvement has largely proven itself to be beneficial to all parties and processes concerned. With growing experience, sharing best practice can be useful at the international level. These workshop proceedings deal with the local partnership methodology employed in Belgium in order to develop an integrated proposal to the national Government to construct and operate a disposal facility for low-level radioactive waste that is adapted to local conditions.

Serious fun : architecture & games ¤ Serious Fun is about architecture and urban design games that have been conceived and created by architects, urban designers, artists and game developers since the end of the twentieth century -- from doll's houses to construction games and city building games, from SimCity to Block by Block. The games are looked at from both a game technical and an architectural-critical point of view. As much attention is paid to the games themselves (the way they look, their construction and rules) as to their playing -- in particular, to the space that players receive or take for their personal, spontaneous, unexpected and especially subversive moves and ideas. What perception of, and interaction with, the built environment do they express? What messages do the games communicate? How critical and innovative are the underlying concepts: Are stereotypes confirmed or broken? Do they address environmental and social issues? Serious Fun presents games and playfulness as serious tools for every architect and urban designer. This book concludes a triptych about alternative forms of representation and communication in architecture and urban design.

Phytate destruction : consequences for precision animal nutrition ¤ Incorporating research chapters from academic authors around the world, this book focuses on the most recent scientific advances in understanding phytate; both IP6 and its esters. It examines phytate degradation patterns in the gastrointestinal tract, and investigates the relevance of gut microbiome and endogenous phosphatases on phytate breakdown, as well as regulation and functions of inositol diphosphates IP3, IP4, and IP7, IP8. It also identifies recommendations for formulating for minerals and amino acids in the presence of phytate, including the effects of phytase on protein bioavailability, and the impact of digestible Ca and P in both swine and poultry. This leading science and research is coupled with real-world pragmatism, including a focus on what industry stakeholders are currently doing to counter dietary phytate, and an overview of the role of nutrition in respect of bone health, meat quality, welfare, and antibiotic free production. As such, the content is relevant for scientists, nutritionists and producers alike	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4473842-0>

An Introduction to the Kähler-Ricci Flow ¤ The (real) theory of fully non linear parabolic equations -- The KRF on positive Kodaira dimension Kähler manifolds -- The normalized Kähler-Ricci flow on Fano manifolds -- Bibliography. This volume collects lecture notes from courses offered at several conferences and workshops, and provides the first exposition in book form of the basic theory of the Kähler-Ricci flow and its current state-of-the-art. While several excellent books on Kähler-Einstein geometry are available, there have been no such works on the Kähler-Ricci flow. The book will serve as a valuable resource for graduate students and researchers in complex differential geometry, complex algebraic geometry and Riemannian geometry, and will hopefully foster further developments in this fascinating area of research. The Ricci flow was first introduced by R. Hamilton in the early 1980s, and is central in G. Perelman’s celebrated proof of the Poincaré conjecture. When specialized for Kähler manifolds, it becomes the Kähler-Ricci flow, and reduces to a scalar PDE (parabolic complex Monge-Ampère equation). As a spin-off of his breakthrough, G. Perelman proved the convergence of the Kähler-Ricci flow on Kähler-Einstein manifolds of positive scalar curvature (Fano manifolds). Shortly after, G. Tian and J. Song discovered a complex analogue of Perelman’s ideas: the Kähler-Ricci flow is a metric embodiment of the Minimal Model Program of the underlying manifold, and flips and divisorial contractions assume the role of Perelman’s surgeries.

Jews and Protestants : From the Reformation to the Present ¤ Frontmatter -- Acknowledgements -- Table of Contents -- Introduction -- The Impact of the Reformation on Early Modern German Jewry -- Edom versus Edom -- Eschatology and Conversion in the Sperling Letters -- The Legacy of Anti-Judaism in Bach's Sacred Cantatas -- A New Model of Christian Interaction with the Jews -- The Vernacular Bible between Jews and Protestants -- Christian Images of the Jewish State -- Standard-bearers of Hussitism or Agents of Germanization? -- Luther's Shadow -- Exclusive Space as a Criterion for Salvation in German Protestantism during the Third Reich -- Nazi Racism, American Anti-Semitism, and Christian Duty -- Lutheran Churches and Luther's Anti-Semitism -- German Guilt and Hebrew Redemption -- List of Contributors -- Index The book sheds light on various chapters in the long history of Protestant-Jewish relations, from the Reformation to the present. Going beyond questions of antisemitism and religious animosity, it aims to disentangle some of the intricate perceptions, interpretations, and emotions that have characterized contacts between Protestantism and Judaism, and between Jews and Protestants. While some papers in the book address Luther's antisemitism and the NS-Zeit, most papers broaden the scope of the investigation: Protestant-Jewish theological encounters shaped not only antisemitism but also the Jewish Reform movement and Protestant philosemitic post-Holocaust theology; interactions between Jews and Protestants took place not only in the German lands but also in the wider Protestant universe; theology was crucial for the articulation of attitudes toward Jews, but music and philosophy were additional spheres of creativity that enabled the process of thinking through the relations between Judaism and Protestantism. By bringing together various contributions on these and other aspects, the book opens up directions for future research on this intricate topic, which bears both historical significance and evident relevance to our own time	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047538-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4536893-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114087-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002333-3>

Integration and globalization : challenges for developed and developing countries ¤ The main challenges the European Single Market is facing in the 21st century result from the enlargement to Central and Eastern Europe, the EMU, and the globalization of trade and investment that has aided the rise of competitive emerging markets. This state-of-the-art book provides fresh theoretical and empirical evidence on the challenges presented by integration and globalization for both developed and developing countries. The authors demonstrate how the European Single Market remains a work in progress with many critical issues still to be addressed. These include the rigidities in product and labor markets, the need for innovation and quality upgrading, and the rapid catch-up of new member countries. They go on to show how firms use the opportunities provided by integration and globalization to fragment their production processes internationally, which brings gains but also requires structural adjustment. The book also argues that global environmental coordination may be less detrimental to the growth prospects of developing countries than is commonly believed. Illustrating a number of methodologies, this book will be a great resource tool for postgraduates and undergraduates in the fields of international economics and business, as well as researchers and policy-makers	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4557997-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066410-7>
Anderson Localization and Its Ramifications : Disorder, Phase Coherence and Electron Correlations ¤ The phenomenon of localization of the electronic wave function in a random medium can be regarded as the key manifestation of quantum coherence in a condensed matter system. As one of the most remarkable phenomena in condensed matter physics discovered in the 20th century, the localization problem is an indispensable part of the theory of the quantum Hall effects and rivals superconductivity in its significance as a manifestation of quantum coherence at a macroscopic scale. The present volume, written by some of the leading experts in the field, is intended to highlight some of the recent progress in the field of localization, with particular emphasis on the effect of interactions on quantum coherence. The chapters are written in textbook style and should serve as a reliable and thorough introduction for advanced students or researchers already working in the field of mesoscopic physics	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142388-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4286827-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4280799-2>

Evolution and path dependence in economic ideas : past and present ¤ Since the 1980s there has been a renewed interest in attempts to introduce a sense of history into economic literature. In this book, the authors argue that it is not possible to explain a state of the world without first analysing the processes that lead to that state. The contributions collected in this volume share a critical stance towards the timelessness and a historical theorizing of mainstream economics. Past states in the development of an economic process set the range of possibilities for future development and can be used to construct theories based on the irreversibility of economic time. Many of these notable contributors argue that the study of the history of economic thought is important in two ways. Firstly, because it provides important insights into the ways that economists of the past attempted to address the problems of history and secondly, because it helps us to understand the present state of economics as being itself the outcome of a path dependent process. Evolutionary economists, economic theorists and historians, as well as economists interested in the evolution of economic and other social institutions, will find this challenging collection of papers essential reading	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132813-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4232912-7>

The Iberian challenge: creole languages beyond the plantation setting ¤ Creole languages lexified by Spanish and Portuguese have played a relatively small role in theories of creole genesis, and as a result the histories of vernaculars such as Palenquero, Papiamentu, Cape Verdean Creole, and the Gulf of Guinea creoles (e.g., São Tomense or Annobonese) have typically been considered distinct evolutionary events. In contrast, English and French-based creoles (e.g., Hawaiian Pidgin English or Haitian French), formerly spoken on large-scale plantations, have always been viewed as the "default" or prototypical kind. This volume takes issue with this traditional view by arguing that there is no a priori reason to give plantation creoles this preferential treatment. As the ten articles assembled here show, the plantation scenario is only one of many a realization that poses special challenges to theories of creole genesis that seek to be maximally comprehensive. Overall, Iberian-based creoles thus demonstrate a diversity of complex circumstances that any overarching theory of creole genesis ought to take into account.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133928-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133929-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182539-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182511-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077623-2>

Ultrafast imaging of photochemical dynamics : Royal Society of Edinburgh, UK, 31 August-2 September 2016 ; Chair: Adam Kirrander (University of Edinburgh), Russell Minns (University of Southampton) ¤ This volume focuses on ultrafast imaging of photochemical dynamics covering the development of new techniques and advances in theoretical modelling of quantum dynamics. Photochemical reactions have tremendous scientific importance, ranging from photosynthesis to atmospheric reactions, and technologies such as sensors or displays. Due to the intrinsic complexity of photochemical reactions, they remain the least understood type of chemical process. Nonadiabatic dynamics, ultrafast time-scales, quantum effects and conical intersections are known to be important, but a detailed comprehension remains elusive. However, new experimental techniques capable of monitoring photochemical processes in unprecedented detail are appearing. This includes the development of intense-laser techniques, the construction of freeelectron lasers such as the XFEL in Europe and the LCLS in the USA, new sources of pulsed electrons, advanced detection techniques, and important advances in theoretical modelling of quantum dynamics. Many of these techniques are developed by research communities not traditionally concerned with photochemistry, but provide an opportunity to shed new light on photochemical dynamics	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034613-4>

Book tower images : visualizing Henry van de Velde's Ghent University library tower ¤ The Ghent University library with its famous 'Book Tower' was designed by Henry van de Velde in the 1930s. It re-opened recently after a long restoration process under the supervision of Robbrecht en Daem architecten.0Book Tower Images focuses on the rich artistic imagery of the monument. Over the years, leading artists and photographers such as Frans Masereel, Lucien Hervé, Candida Höfer, and Carl De Keyzer have visualized it abundantly. Jan De Cock, Marie-Jo Lafontaine, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker and others realized installations or dance performances in the building that were documented with the help of photographs and films.0Juxtaposing multiple images of the same building, Book Tower Images deals with various models of architectural representation: from typical modernist architectural photographs by Emile Sergysels from the 1940s to recent explorations by Dirk Braeckman, Geert Goiris, Aglaia Konrad, and Walter Vorjohann among many others.0'Book Tower Images' combines architectural photography with a myriad of other artistic and photographic practices such as documentary photography, street photography, fashion shoots, photojournalism, amateur photography, painting, drawing, video, film et cetera - with, of course, the Book Tower as leitmotiv.00Exhibition: Vandenhove - Ghent University, Belgium (20.04. - 17.06.2023)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114333-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049716-1>
Shifts in Mapping : Maps as a Tool of Knowledge ¤ Klappentext: Depicting the world, territory, and geopolitical realities involves a high degree of interpretation and imagination. It is never neutral. Cartography originated in ancient times to represent the world and to enable circulation, communication, and economic exchange. Today, IT companies are a driving force in this field and change our view of the world; how we communicate, navigate, and consume globally. Questions of privacy, authorship, and economic interests are highly relevant to cartography's practices. So how to deal with such powers and what is the critical role of cartography in it? How might a bottom-up perspective (and actions) in map-making change conception of a geopolitical space?

The evolution of markets for water : theory and practice in Australia ¤ This book presents a detailed picture of the evolutionary processes at work in water markets with a particular focus on theory and practice in Australia. Policymakers are striving to strike a balance between the pros and cons of a property rights/market based approach to the allocation of water resources, as opposed to an approach that centres on government regulation. The current movement in Australia is toward the use of markets, and numerous reforms are either underway or under consideration in that direction. This provides an ideal opportunity to observe the factors at play in determining the balance and hence the mix of policy instruments at work. The distinguished contributors offer a range of perspectives--economic, legal, environmental--and combine conceptual analysis with evidence from real policy decisions 1. Markets and government--an evolving balance -- 2. Principles and issues for effective Australian water markets -- 3. The historical variation in water rights -- 4. State administration versus private innovation : the evolution of property rights to water in Victoria, Australia -- 5. A property framework for water markets : the role of law -- 6.

A new architecture for functional grammar ¤ This volume, which represents a major advance on Simon Dik's final statement of the theory (1997), lays the foundation for the future evolution of FG towards a Functional Discourse Grammar. It rises to the double challenge of specifying the interface between discourse and grammar and of detailing the expression rules that link semantic representation and morphosyntactic form. The opening chapter, by Kees Hengeveld, sets out in programmatic form a new architecture for FG which both preserves the best of the traditional model and offers a place for numerous recent insights. The remaining chapters are devoted to refining and developing the programme laid down by Hengeveld, bringing in data from a range of languages as well as theoretical insights inspired by adjoining frameworks. Of special interest are an account by Matthew Anstey of how current proposals arise from the history of FG and various chapters in which the model is brought much closer to an account of real-time language production, notably including the first ever detailed account of the workings of expression rules, by Dik Bakker and Anna Siewierska. The final chapter, also by Hengeveld, draws together the findings of the various chapters, culminating in an elaborated model that represents the most sophisticated statement of Functional Grammar currently available. The volume thus gives a coherent account of FG as a theory which combines formal explicitness with a broad account of language functions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194747-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125092-8>

Decolonial Legal Critique and Legal Practice ¤ The first collection of key texts on post- and decolonial legal theory and TWAIL in German translation. The theoretical portion of the book is supplemented by practice-based reflections from activists and lawyers, which serve to consider, add to or challenge the theoretical approaches. These links to specific struggles for law, power, social justice, material equality and resources can help to show the extent to which contemporary situations of exploitation and inequality are an expression or consequence of historically contingent power dynamics, and the extent to which they can be read in light of processes of colonisation. The book, which seeks to challenge epistemic violence, is meant to spark critical debate on its contents and more. It aims to further productive dialogues and unsettle ostensibly settled fundamental assumptions, including those from the sphere of legal theory.

Demystifying the Sacred : Blasphemy and Violence from the French Revolution to Today ¤ Demystifying the Sacred: Blasphemy and Violence from the French Revolution to Today offers a much-needed analysis of a subject that historians have largely ignored, yet that has considerable relevance for today's world: the powerful connection that exists between offences against the sacred and different forms of violence. Drawing on cases from revolutionary France to the Russia of Vladimir Putin, the international authors probe the nature and agency of local blasphemy accusations, the historical and legal framework in which they were expressed and the violence, both physical and symbolic, accompanying them. In doing so, the volume reveals how cultures of blasphemy, and related acts of heresy, apostasy and sacrilege, were a companion to or acted as a trigger for physical action but also a form of how violence was experienced. More generally, it shows the importance of religious sensibilities in modern society and the violent potential contained in criticism or ridicule of the sacred and secular alike	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020832-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157953-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046514-7>
Social security of migrants in the European Union of tomorrow : [symposium in April 1995 ...] ¤ The coordination of the various social security systems of the EU Member States is one of the most important achievements of European integration. This regime became a model for the whole world. Nevertheless, it has some shortcomings which are analysed in this book. Bent Greve (Roskilde) outlines the economic effects of coordination, Jos Berghman (Tilburg) defines the impact on the domestic social security systems, Michael Adler (Edinburgh) gives an enquiry into the administrative problems, Giancarlo Perone (Rome) reports from an Italian point of view. Lotta Westerhäll (Lund) examines the changes initiated by EU law to the Swedish legislation. Ludwik Florek (Warsaw) outlines the given relation on social security between Poland and the EU. Philippe Langlois (Paris) outlines a model on the coordination of employees' pensions. Danny Pieters (Leuven) clarifies the role of third states nationals in the EU coordination regime. Reports and analyses of the book offer insights into scopes of action and structuring prospects.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032393-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170174-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055732-7>
Protostellar jets in context ¤ This volume contains the proceedings of the Conference Protostellar Jets in Context held by the JETSET Marie Curie Research Training Network in July 2008. This meeting not only served to showcase some of the network`s achievements but was also a platform to hear from, discuss and debate the recent findings of world-class astrophysicists in the field of protostellar jet research. Jets from young stars are of course not an isolated astrophysical phenomenon. It is known that objects as diverse as young brown dwarfs, planetary nebulae, symbiotic stars, micro-quasars, AGN, and gamma-ray bursters produce jets. Thus in a series of talks, protostellar jets were put in context by comparing them with their often much larger brethren and also by considering the ubiquitous accretion disks that seem to be necessary for their formation. With this spectrum of contributions on observations and the theory of astrophysical jets and accretion disks, this book serves as a comprehensive reference work for researchers and students alike.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176032-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4228852-6>
Transport and climate change ¤ Transport accounts for 23% of global carbon dioxide emissions and is one of the few industrial sectors where emissions are still growing. There is a pressing need for transport to begin reducing emissions to mitigate the impacts of climate change. The world is already committed to some degree of climate change and there is an additional need to adapt transport networks to cope with the future climate. This book examines the relationship between transport and climate change at a range of scales and from a series of different perspectives. The complex post-Kyoto international situation is covered before the discussion at national and then regional levels. It is clear that every country needs strong national policy to deliver the required greenhouse gas emission reductions. The UK has been the first country to implement a legally binding agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This book uses a range of UK examples to provide a timely record of progress to date in meeting the demands of the agreement in terms of the mitigation of climate change. The importance of climate and socio-economic scenarios forms the basis of a series of additional discussions on climate change adaptation, underlining the need for a holistic framework to tackle climate change in the transport sector.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062901-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1>

From revolution to uncertainty : the year 1990 in Central and Eastern Europe ¤ Throughout Eastern Europe, the unexpected and irrevocable fall of communism that began in the late 1980s presented enormous challenges in the spheres of politics and society, as well at the level of individual experience. Excitement, uncertainty and fear predicated the shaping of a new order, the outcome of which was anything but predetermined. Recent studies have focused on the ambivalent impact of capitalism. Yet, at the time, parliamentary democracy had equally few traditions to return to, and membership in the European Union was a distant dream at best. Nowadays, as new threats arise, Europe's current political crises prompt us to reconsider how liberal democracy in Eastern Europe came about in the first place. This book undertakes an analysis of the year 1990 in several countries throughout Europe to consider the role of uncertainty and change in shaping political nations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175047-0>

Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis : Israel Seminar (GAFA) 2014–2016 ¤ As in the previous Seminar Notes, the current volume reflects general trends in the study of Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis, understood in a broad sense. A classical theme in the Local Theory of Banach Spaces which is well represented in this volume is the identification of lower-dimensional structures in high-dimensional objects. More recent applications of high-dimensionality are manifested by contributions in Random Matrix Theory, Concentration of Measure and Empirical Processes. Naturally, the Gaussian measure plays a central role in many of these topics, and is also studied in this volume; in particular, the recent breakthrough proof of the Gaussian Correlation Conjecture is revisited. The interplay of the theory with Harmonic and Spectral Analysis is also well apparent in several contributions. The classical relation to both the primal and dual Brunn-Minkowski theories is also well represented, and related algebraic structures pertaining to valuations and valent functions are discussed.

European transformations : the long twelfth century ; [papers from a conference hosted by the Medieval Institute of the University of Notre Dame, October 26 - 28, 2006] ¤ Verlagsinfo: The 'long twelfth century' - 1050 to 1215 - embraces one of the transformative moments in European history: the point, for some, at which Europe first truly became 'Europe.' Historians have used the terms 'renaissance', 'reformation', and 'revolution' to account for the dynamism of intellectual, religious, and structural renewal manifest across schools, monasteries, courts, and churches. Complicating the story, more recent historical work has highlighted manifestations of social crisis and oppression. In European Transformations: The Long Twelfth Century, nineteen accomplished medievalists examine this pivotal era under the rubric of 'transformation': a time of epoch-making change both good and ill, a release of social and cultural energies that proved innovative and yet continuous with the past. Their collective reappraisal, although acknowledging insights gained from over a century of scholarship, fruitfully adjusts the questions and alters the accents. In addition to covering such standard regions as England and France, and such standard topics as feudalism and investiture, the contributors also address Scandinavia, Iberia, and Eastern Europe, women's roles in medieval society, Jewish and Muslim communities, law and politics, and the complexities of urban and rural situations. With their diverse and challenging contributions, the authors offer a new point of departure for students and scholars attempting to grasp the dynamic puzzle of twelfth-century Europe.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077587-2>

His public persona, his self-portrait as model of Roman prose, philosopher, and statesman, has exerted a durable and profound impact on the educational system and the formation of the ruling class over the centuries. Joining up with recent studies on the reception of Cicero, this volume approaches the figure of Cicero from a 'biographical', more than 'philological', perspective and considers the multiple ways by which different ages reacted to Cicero and created their 'Ciceros'. From Cicero's lifetime to our times, it focuses on how the image of Cicero was revisited and reworked by intellectuals and men of culture, who eulogized his outstanding oratorical and political virtues but, not rarely, questioned the role he had in Roman politics and society. An international group of scholars elaborates on the figure of Cicero, shedding fresh light on his reception in late antiquity, Humanism and Renaissance, Enlightenment and modern centuries. Historians, literary scholars and philosophers, as well as graduate students, will certainly profit from this volume, which contributes enormously to our understanding of the influence of Cicero on Western culture over the times	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049716-1>

Crisis of the Future I : Apocalyptic Discourses in Interdisciplinary Discussion ¤ Negative expectations saturate the current debates about the future, and apocalyptic images are omnipresent. Are there other reasons for this than mere facts? The interdisciplinary studies by the fellows of the ZRWP’s Basler Forschungskolleg (Basel Research School) that are collated here address this question—and find surprising answers. The future seems uncertain, yes threatening. Whether climate change, possible collapse of the markets or the development of Western democracies: omnipresent one sees oneself confronted with possible catastrophes. With the intensive discussions about the future, the authors of this interdisciplinary volume deal with, namely in analytical-historical perspectives. For the way one looks at the future is neither arbitrary nor general, but strongly shaped by religious-apocalyptic thought patterns and worlds of imagination.

Ancient Egypt in the modern imagination : art, literature and culture ¤ Ancient Egypt has always been a source of fascination to writers, artists and architects in the West. This book is the first study to address representations of Ancient Egypt in the modern imagination, breaking down conventional disciplinary boundaries between fields such as History, Classics, Art History, Fashion, Film, Archaeology, Egyptology, and Literature to further a nuanced understanding of ancient Egypt in cultures stretching from the eighteenth century to the present day, emphasising how some of the various meanings of ancient Egypt to modern people have traversed time and media. Divided into three themes, the chapters scrutinise different aspects of the use of ancient Egypt in a variety of media, looking in particular at the ways in which Egyptology as a discipline has influenced representations of Egypt, ancient Egypt's associations with death and mysticism, as well as connections between ancient Egypt and gendered power. The diversity of this study aims to emphasise both the multiplicity and the patterning of popular responses to ancient Egypt, as well as the longevity of this phenomenon and its relevance today	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114333-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035964-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049716-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4319898-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125698-0>

Being material ¤ Code as material / Ben Fry, Casey Reas -- Frugal science in the age of curiosity / Manu Prakash, Jim Cybulski, Rebecca Konte -- Team foldscope and global foldscope community machine agency / Nadya Peek. "In 1995, MIT's Nicholas Negroponte predicted that "being digital" would have us entering a realm increasingly unconstrained by the materiality of the world. Two decades later, our everyday lives are indeed ever more suffused by computation and calculation. But unwieldy materiality persists and even reasserts itself. At the intersection of art, science and technology, "Being Material" revisits Negroponte's prediction by exploring new and unexpected convergences between the digital and the material in the practices of artists, designers, engineers and scientists who work with programmable matter, self-assembling structures, 3D/4D printing, wearable technologies and bio-inspired design. This book will radically intervene into the understanding of how material dynamics limit, expand, transform, and/or vivify our biological, social and political lives. "Being Material" will revisit the history of material science (particularly at MIT), contribute to "new materialism" in critical theory, and place both projects in dialogue with kindred and contrasting philosophy, art practice and critique. The editors and contributors refine and expand on such cross-field investigations by developing a contrast among five different material genealogical lineages: programmable, wearable, livable, invisible, and audible	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011510-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000626-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045791-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7854804-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139399-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4196910-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069794-0>

British women's writing, 1930 to 1960 : between the waves ¤ This volume contributes to the vibrant, ongoing recuperative work on women’s writing by shedding new light on a group of authors commonly dismissed as middlebrow in their concerns and conservative in their styles and politics. The neologism ‘interfeminism’ – coined to partner Kristin Bluemel’s ‘intermodernism’ – locates this group chronologically and ideologically between two ‘waves’ of feminism, whilst also forging connections between the political and cultural monoliths that have traditionally overshadowed them. Drawing attention to the strengths of this ‘out-of-category’ writing in its own right, this volume also highlights how intersecting discourses of gender, class and society in the interwar and postwar periods pave the way for the bold reassessments of female subjectivity that characterise second and third wave feminism.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014777-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113622-6>
Innovation and technological change in Eastern Europe : pathways to industrial recovery ¤ Research suggests that innovation and technological change are crucial for the economic recovery of the former centrally planned countries in Central and Eastern Europe. This book analyses the development of innovation systems and technology policy in this region from various perspectives, demonstrating not only its importance but also its complexity. Included in the book are discussions on: * the process of transforming the innovation systems in Central and Eastern Europe * a comparison of R&D between 'East' and 'West' * gradualism versus 'Big Bang' as the preferable strategy for reform * innovation at the firm level * productivity and competitiveness * the ability to identify and exploit external knowledge in adopting up-to-date technology The authors conclude that rebuilding innovation systems in Central and Eastern Europe will require considerable time, and that there is no 'best practice' or ideal strategy which can be clearly recommended. This book will be warmly welcomed by scholars working in the fields of transition studies, innovation and technology, as well as policy makers involved in designing technology policy in transition economies	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059252-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066512-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4431027-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027089-0>

Capital liberalization in transition countries : lessons from the past and for the future ¤ This significant new book provides a succinct overview of the essential policy issues surrounding capital liberalization. The book compares the experiences of transition economies in Europe with those of advanced nations, allowing the reader to examine the changing international economic and financial environment within which transition countries have to liberalize. The book first deals with the critical issues concerning liberalization, including sequencing and financial market development. The authors move on to present an overview of the early liberalization experiences of advanced economies and East-Asian countries. This provides the context for a series of chapters reviewing liberalization progress in transition economies, in which international experts and senior officials analyze their own countries' experiences. The authors also emphasise the importance of financial market reform and the construction of a sound institutional framework if countries are to attract and productively use capital inflows. A stable financial system, whilst not infallible, is also crucial for minimizing the risk of financial crises of the type experienced by a number of countries during the 1980s and 1990s. The comprehensive scope of the subject matter and international contributions from a range of different perspectives will ensure this book is warmly received by academics and researchers with an interest in EU accession, transition economics and financial market reform. It will also serve as a useful guide to governments involved in capital liberalization in other parts of the world such as Latin America and Asia	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4163279-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132737-8>

Carmen : from silent film to MTV ; ¤ Since Prosper Mérimée and Georges Bizet (with his librettists Meilhac and Halévy) brought the figure of the Spanish Carmen to prominence in the nineteenth century an astonishing eighty or so film versions of the story have been made. This collection of essays gathers together a unique body of scholarly critique focused on that Carmen narrative in film. It covers the phenomenon from a number of aspects: cultural studies, gender studies, studies in race and representation, musicology, film history, and the history of performance. The essays take us from the days of silent film to twenty-first century hip-hop style, showing, through a variety of theoretical and historical perspectives that, despite social and cultural transformationsparticularly in terms of gender, sexuality and raceremarkably little has changed in terms of basic human desires and anxieties, at least as they are represented in this body of films. The conception of Carmens independent sexuality as a source of danger both to men (and occasionally women) and to respectable society has been a constant. Nor has sexual and ethnic otherness lost its appeal. On the other hand, the corpus of Carmen films is more than a simple recycling of stereotypes and each engages newly with the social and cultural issues of their time.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017102-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049716-1>

Europe's invisible migrants ¤ Following the decolonization movements that swept the globe after World War II, between four and six million people were 'returned' to Europe from the colonies. From an exporter of people, Europe turned to a site of immigration for the first time in the twentieth century. Until now, these migrations have been overlooked as scholars have highlighted instead the parallel migrations of former 'colonized' peoples. Europe's Invisible Migrants corrects this bias. This multidisciplinary volume presents essays by prominent sociologists, historians, and anthropologists on their research with these 'invisible' migrant communities. Their work highlights the experiences of colonists returning to France, Portugal and the Netherlands, the intersection of race, citizenship, and colonial ideologies, and the ways these migrations reflect the return of the 'colonial' to Europe. This volume offers fresh insights into immigration, racism and ethnic conflict in post-colonial Europe by presenting colonial repatriates as another 'immigrant' population.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031790-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050863-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0>

Enlightenment Today : Sapere aude! - Have courage to use your own understanding : : Proceedings of the International Congress October 19th-22nd 2017 in Graz ¤ “Enlightenment is man's release from his self-incurred tutelage“, says Kant. And continues: „Tutelage is man's inability to make use of his understanding without direction from another.“ The question of enlightenment is not only relevant in Kant's time, but also today. Might the enlightened, responsible and autonomous subject be endangered? Where are the most inhibitions on the way to independent thinking? Are radicalization, emotions and irrationality taking the lead? Why debate on enlightenment today? The International Congress for the Philosophy of Children devoted itself to these questions. The complexity of the modern world, the variety of choices, the scientific progress, the emergence of numerous expert cultures, the complexity of the conditions present us with enormous challenges. So, how about education and enlightenment?

Since the early eighties, Ali Süleyman Üstünel has been one of the main contributors to the field of Malliavin calculus. In a workshop held in Paris, June 2010 several prominent researchers gave exciting talks in honor of his 60th birthday. The present volume includes scientific contributions from this workshop. Probability theory is first and foremost aimed at solving real-life problems containing randomness. Markov processes are one of the key tools for modeling that plays a vital part concerning such problems. Contributions on inventory control, mutation-selection in genetics and public-private partnerships illustrate several applications in this volume. Stochastic differential equations, be they partial or ordinary, also play a key role in stochastic modeling. Two of the contributions analyze examples that share a focus on probabilistic tools, namely stochastic analysis and stochastic calculus. Three other papers are devoted more to the theoretical development of these aspects. The volume addresses graduate students and researchers interested in stochastic analysis and its applications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132272-1>

Organic metal and metalloid species in the environment : analysis, distribution, processes and toxicological evaluation ; [International Workshop on Organometallics in the Environment at the University of Essen in 2002 ; workshop proceedings supplemented with additional data] ¤ Subsequent to the profiling of organometal(loid) compounds in important biogeogenic and anthropogenic deposits, the importance of this class of compounds for human health are evaluated by the analysis of both physicochemical and biological formation, distribution and transformation processes. Multidisciplinary articles written by experts from disciplines as diverse as biogeochemistry, ecotoxicology, analytical chemistry, microbiology and genetics estimate the global levels of biogeogenic and anthropogenic emissions of organometal(loid) compounds, and thus obtain an insight to processes which influence the genesis, as well as the distribution and stability of organometal(loid) species and their interaction with each other and other matrix compounds. The authors evaluate various environmentally relevant sources from a toxicological point of view, in order to identify potential "hot spots" of organometal(loid)s, which can negatively influence ecosystems and human health.

Multispeak before the gates of the EU ¤ Research about multispeak has not yet provided enough insight as to represent a sound basis for a corresponding didactics. Therefore, it makes sense to discuss theory and practice from the viewpoint of a particular project and under different aspects. On the occasion of the completion of EmpoR a project developed by Oldenburg linguists and intercultural education specialists the institute for German studies of the Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg organized a one-day symposium in December 2003. It had been EmpoR's explicit and political aim to make Kosovar returnees' linguistic skills, which they had acquired abroad (mostly in German speaking countries), a resource for social reconstruction. In the discussion, this aim was to be checked for its soundness and sustainability. Experts from social science, linguistics and language didactics as well as practitioners in the fields of German as a foreign language and intercultural language didactics and from the EmpoR-management were discussing these subjects. All papers and contributions are documented here.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038403-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018424-9>

Probing the meaning of quantum mechanics : superpositions, dynamics, semantics and identity : Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Information: Physical, Philosophical and Logical Approaches, Cagliari, Italy, 23-25 July 2014 ¤ This book provides an interdisciplinary approach to one of the most fascinating and important open questions in science: What is quantum mechanics really talking about? In the last decades quantum mechanics has given rise to a new quantum technological era, a revolution taking place today especially within the field of quantum information processing; which goes from quantum teleportation and cryptography to quantum computation. Quantum theory is probably our best confirmed physical theory. However, in spite of its great empirical effectiveness it stands today still without a universally accepted physical representation that allows us to understand its relation to the world and reality. The novelty of the book comes from the multiple perspectives put forward by top researchers in quantum mechanics, from Europe as well as North and South America, discussing the meaning and structure of the theory of quanta. The book comprises in a balanced manner physical, philosophical, logical and mathematical approaches to quantum mechanics and quantum information. Going from quantum superpositions and entanglement to dynamics and the problem of identity; from quantum logic, computation and quasi-set theory to the category approach and teleportation; from realism and empiricism to operationalism and instrumentalism; the book considers from different angles some of the most intriguing questions in the field. From Buenos Aires to Brussels and Cagliari, from Florence to Florianópolis, the interaction between different groups is reflected in the many different articles. This book is interesting not only to the specialists but also to the general public attempting to get a grasp on some of the most fundamental questions of present quantum physics -- On the notion of truth in QM: a category-theoretic standpoint -- A logical account of quantum superpositions -- Mixing categories and modal logics in the quantum setting -- A possible solution to the second entanglement paradox -- 'Probabilistic knowledge' as 'objective knowledge' in quantum mechanics: potential immanent powers instead of actual properties -- The GTR model: a universal framework for quantum-like measurements -- Binary gates in three valued quantum computational logics -- Entanglement of formation for Werner states and isotropic states via logical gates -- Fuzzy approach for CNOT gate in quantum computation with mixed states -- On when a semantics is not a good semantics: the algebraisation of orthomodular logic -- Von Neumann, empiricism and the foundations of quantum mechanics -- The born rule and free will: why libertarian agent-causal free will is not	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4409616-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047989-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045791-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4705961-8>

The role of music in European integration : conciliating eurocentrism and multiculturalism ¤ The volume focuses on music during the process of European integration since the Second World War. Often music in Europe is defined by its relation to the concept of Occidentalism (Musik im Abendland; western music). The emphasis here turns rather to recent manifestations of its evolvement in ensembles, events, musical organisations and ideas; questions of unity and diversity from Bergen to Tel Aviv, from Lisbon to Baku; and deals with the tension between local, regional and national music within the larger confluence of European music. The status of classical and avante-garde music, and to a degree rock and pop, during Europe's development the past sixty years are also reviewed within the context of eurocentrism – the domination of European music within world music, a term propagated by anthropologists and ethnomusicologists several decades ago and based on multiculturalism. Conversely, the search for a musical European identity and the ways in which this search has in turn been influenced by multiculturalism is an ongoing, dynamic process.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040802-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071013-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033542-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4214151-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200132-8>

Conceptual Structures: Inspiration and Application : 14th International Conference on Conceptual Structures, ICCS 2006, Aalborg, Denmark, July 16-21, 2006, Proceedings ¤ The 14th International Conference on Conceptual Structures (ICCS 2006) was held in Aalborg, Denmark during July 16 – 21, 2006. Responding to the Call for Papers, we received 62 papers from 20 different countries, representing six different continents. This clearly indicates the international nature of the ICCS community as well as the widespread interest which was spawned by the previous conferences. By a thorough review process, 24 papers were selected to be included in this volume. In addition, six invited speakers made contributions which can be found in the first section of this volume. The theme of ICCS 2006––Conceptual Structures: Inspiration and Application–– points to a dual focus of interest that is also reflected in the constellation of papers. From the beginning of the planning of this conference, we focused on inspirational sources that have led to the current state of research in our community, by tracing important historical influences which daily effect work in representing knowledge and in handling representations of conceptual structures. At the same time, we also focused on ways in which these legacies are employed to further advance theory and practice in the field of knowledge representation and processing. With this volume, we believe that a valuable contribution to both aspects of this field is being made. We wish to express our appreciation to all the authors of submitted papers, to the members of the Editorial Board and the Program Committee for all their work and valuable comments.

German-speaking exiles in Ireland 1933-1945 ; [the 7th Limerick Conference in Irish-German Studies on German-Speaking Exiles in June 2004, the basis for this volume ...] ¤ Klappentext: "German-speaking Exiles in Ireland 1933-1945" is a pioneering study of the impact the German-speaking exiles of the Hitler years had on Ireland as the first large group of immigrants in the country in the twentieth century. It therefore adds an important yet hitherto virtually unknown Irish dimension to international exile studies. After providing an overview of the topic and an analysis of current developments in exile studies the volume devotes two chapters to Jewish refugees and another to the considerable number of Austrian exiles, investigates the relationship between Irish government policy and public opinion, and explores the problems of identity faced by so many in exile. It then focuses on some eminent refugees - Erwin Schrödinger, Ludwig Bieler, Robert Weil, Ernst Scheyer, and Hans Sachs - before concluding with personal accounts by Ruth Braunizer (the daughter of Erwin Schrödinger, excerpts from whose diaries are published here for the first time), Monica Schefold (the daughter of John Hennig), and Eva Gross. The fourteen contributors to the volume are Wolfgang Benz, Ruth Braunizer, John Cooke, Horst Dickel, Eva Gross, Gisela Holfter, Dermot Keogh, Wolfgang Muchitsch, Siobhán O'Connor, Hermann Rasche, Monica Schefold, Birte Schulz, Raphael V. Siev, and Colin Walker.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028808-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015959-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070334-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075594-0>

Computational Mathematical Programming ¤ This book contains the written versions of main lectures presented at the Advanced Study Institute (ASI) on Computational Mathematical Programming, which was held in Bad Windsheim, Germany F. R., from July 23 to August 2, 1984, under the sponsorship of NATO. The ASI was organized by the Committee on Algorithms (COAL) of the Mathematical Programming Society. Co-directors were Karla Hoffmann (National Bureau of Standards, Washington, U.S.A.) and Jan Teigen (Rabobank Nederland, Zeist, The Netherlands). Ninety participants coming from about 20 different countries attended the ASI and contributed their efforts to achieve a highly interesting and stimulating meeting. Since 1947 when the first linear programming technique was developed, the importance of optimization models and their mathematical solution methods has steadily increased, and now plays a leading role in applied research areas. The basic idea of optimization theory is to minimize (or maximize) a function of several variables subject to certain restrictions. This general mathematical concept covers a broad class of possible practical applications arising in mechanical, electrical, or chemical engineering, physics, economics, medicine, biology, etc. There are both industrial applications (e.g. design of mechanical structures, production plans) and applications in the natural, engineering, and social sciences (e.g. chemical equilibrium problems, christollography problems).
