Three-dimensional integrated circuit design
Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuit Design, Second Eition, expands the original with more than twice as much new content, adding the latest developments in circuit models, temperature considerations, power management, memory issues, and heterogeneous integration. 3-D IC experts Pavlidis, Savidis, and Friedman cover the full product development cycle throughout the book, emphasizing not only physical design, but also algorithms and system-level considerations to increase speed while conserving energy. A handy, comprehensive reference or a practical design guide, this book provides effective solutions to specific challenging problems concerning the design of three-dimensional integrated circuits. Expanded with new chapters and updates throughout based on the latest research in 3-D integration: Manufacturing techniques for 3-D ICs with TSVsElectrical modeling and closed-form expressions of through silicon viasSubstrate noise coupling in heterogeneous 3-D ICsDesign of 3-D ICs with inductive linksSynchronization in 3-D ICsVariation effects on 3-D ICs Correlation of WID variations for intra-tier buffers and wires
