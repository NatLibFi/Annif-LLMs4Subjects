Global Commons im 20. Jahrhundert : Entwürfe für eine globale Welt
With its international perspective and by situating itself "beyond the market and state," this volume promises to generate many new insights for readers. Space and territorialization, global integration and statehood, law and international organizations – these dimensions of the global commons enrich our perspectives on the Cold War, decolonization, and North-South conflicts.
