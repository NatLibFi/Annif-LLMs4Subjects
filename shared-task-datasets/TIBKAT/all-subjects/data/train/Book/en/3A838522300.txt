The modern house
The modern House reflects upon the complicated relationship architecture has with the terms Modernist, Modernism and Modern specifically in relation to the potent concept of the home, reflecting in part the narrative of how some of the most important examples of Modern houses were commissioned and built in the UK. These special examples of British Modernism include such progressive experiments on communal urban living as London s Isokon Building, completed in 1934 by eminent architect Wells Coates, and Berthold Lubetkin s Highpoint, which is today considered one of the most prominent examples of the early International Style. Compared with these urban enormities are private houses, such as the Laslett House in Cambridge, 1958, by the architect Trevor Dannatt, or the Winter House, designed by John Winter as his own residence. Included are an extended introductory essay by acclaimed architectural journalist Jonathan Bell, former architecture editor for Wallpaper* and contributing editor at Blueprint, and projects such as those designed by renowned architect Carl Turner, responsible for the low energy Slip House, a cantilevered sculptural abode of translucent glass, steel and concrete. With images of yet to be seen interiors and restorations, The Modern House illuminates the convergent characteristics of functionalism, truth to materials, flowing space and natural light within the Modern home as a space for living."
