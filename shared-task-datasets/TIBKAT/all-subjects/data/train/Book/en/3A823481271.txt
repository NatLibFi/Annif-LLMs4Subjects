The Japanese house reinvented
This overview of fifty recently built Japanese houses includes projects by three Pritzker Prize-winners-- Tadao Ando, Shigeru Ban and Kazuyo Sejima --as well as by lesser-known emerging architects. Each house is clearly illustrated with color photographs and plans, and is lucidly described by Philip Jodidio, who has traveled extensively around Japan and is deeply familiar with these projects and their creators. His book is a powerful demonstration of Japan's enduring commitment to design innovation
