Basic   1  H- and   13  C-NMR spectroscopy
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful and theoretically complex analytical tool. Basic 1H- and 13C-NMR Spectroscopy provides an introduction to the principles and applications of NMR spectroscopy. Whilst looking at the problems students encounter when using NMR spectroscopy, the author avoids the complicated mathematics that are applied within the field. Providing a rational description of the NMR phenomenon, this book is easy to read and is suitable for the undergraduate and graduate student in chemistry. * Describes the fundamental principles of the pulse NMR experiment and 2D NMR spectra * Easy to read and written with the undergraduate and graduate chemistry student in mind * Provides a rational description of NMR spectroscopy without complicated mathematics
