Modern operating systems
Modern Operating Systems incorporates the latest developments and technologies in operating systems (OS) technologies. Author Andy Tanenbaum's clear and entertaining writing style outlines the concepts every OS designer needs to master. In-depth topic coverage includes processes, threads, memory management, file systems, I/O, deadlocks, interface design, multimedia, performance tradeoffs, and trends in OS design. Case studies explore popular OS and provide real-world context. Tanenbaum also provides information on current research based on his experience as an operating systems researcher. The 5th Edition keeps pace with modern OS with a new chapter on Windows 11, new security coverage, an emphasis on flash-based solid-state drives and more.
