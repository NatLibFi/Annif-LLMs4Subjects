Photography and science
Photography and Science describes how photography first established its legitimacy through close association with key scientific ideas and practices, such as objectivity, observation, archiving and experimentation. Wilder then charts how photography returned the favour by serving as a powerful influence in various scientific disciplines, such as biology and astronomy. The book digs into the controversial debates over photography's 'success' in the sciences, its use in practical fields such as medical imaging and x-raying, and the complicated relationship between scientific theory and art practice. --from publisher description
