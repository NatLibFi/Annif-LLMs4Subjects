Handbook of non-ferrous metal powders : technologies and applications
The manufacture and use of the powders of non-ferrous metals has been taking place for many years in what was previously Soviet Russia, and a huge amount of knowledge and experience has built up in that country over the last forty years or so. Although accounts of the topic have been published in the Russian language, no English language account has existed until now. Six prominent academics and industrialists from the Ukraine and Russia have produced this highly-detailed account which covers the classification, manufacturing methods, treatment and properties of the non-ferrous metals (aluminium, titanium, magnesium, copper, nickel, cobalt, zinc, cadmium, lead, tin, bismuth, noble metals and earth metals). The result is a formidable reference source for those in all aspects of the metal powder industry. * Covers the manufacturing methods, properties and importance of the following metals: aluminium, titanium, magnesium, copper, nickel, cobalt, zinc, cadmium, noble metals, rare earth metals, lead, tin and bismuth. * Expert Russian team of authors, all very experienced * English translation and update of book previously published in Russian
