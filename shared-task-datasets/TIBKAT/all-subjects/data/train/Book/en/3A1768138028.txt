Young Chinese migrants : compressed individual and global condition
"In China, strong economic growth over the past four decades, accelerated urbanisation and multiple inequalities between urban and rural worlds have driven the escalation of internal and international migrations. The internal migration of workers represents a unique phenomenon since the reform and opening of China.

The young Chinese migrant incarnates the Global Individual, what we labeled here as the Compressed Individual"--
