Love hurts, lit helps : how English class can teach teens to improve their relationships, friendships, and communities
"Through discussions of literature, assessment ideas, teaching anecdotes, and student insights, this book outlines how a rigorous and relevant English class can also heal, empower, and provide wisdom for teens weathering social turbulence. Widely taught novels brim with lessons about courtship, love, heartbreak, sexuality, bonds, and belonging. Learning to tell stories, reflect, argue, speak confidently, and listen critically gives students necessary tools for self-expression, advocacy, and empathy in a world that too often feels unsafe and bereft of compassion"--
