Molecular approaches for sustainable insect pest management
This book offers a range of environmentally benign molecular mechanisms which are safer alternative strategies for effective insect pest management. In modern era of biotechnology, there has been much advancement in the field of molecular biology, where many more techniques have evolved which can be helpful in the field of pest management too. Plant resistance, development of transgenic plants, and many more techniques are being considered the panacea to pest problems. On the other hand, there are wide spread concerns of the safety of biotechnological interventions with nontarget organisms including humans. While the world stands divided on the ethical issues of these approaches and the many safety concerns, scientists believe that well thought of biotechnological interventions are probably the only safest ways possible for reducing pest attacks on crops. It explores various techniques and aspects related to molecular pathways for crop pest control. This book is a useful resource for postgraduate students and researchers of agriculture sciences, plant pathology and plant physiology. It is also useful for policy planners in agriculture. .
