Finite element analysis : method, verification and validation
"Finite Element Analysis: Method, Verification and Validation, Second Edition comprehensively covers the theoretical foundation of the of the finite element method with particular focus on the fundamentals of verification, validation and uncertainty quantification. It illustrates the techniques and procedures of quality assurance in numerical simulation through examples and exercises and describes the technical requirements for the formulation and application of design rules. Finite Element Analysis: Method, Verification and Validation, Second Edition bridges the gap between theory and numerical results in a unique and accessible way and is accompanied by a website hosting a solutions manual, powerpoint slides for instructors and a link to finite element software"--
