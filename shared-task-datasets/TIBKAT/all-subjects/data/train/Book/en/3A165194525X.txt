Fundamentals of the physical theory of diffraction
Fundamentals of the Physical Theory of Diffraction; Contents; Foreword; Preface; Acknowledgments; Introduction; 1. Basic Notions in Acoustic and Electromagnetic Diffraction Problems; 2. Wedge Diffraction: Exact Solution and Asymptotics; 3. Wedge Diffraction: The Physical Optics Field; 4. Wedge Diffraction: Radiation by the Nonuniform Component of Surface Sources; 5. First-Order Diffraction at Strips and Polygonal Cylinders; 6. Axially Symmetric Scattering of Acoustic Waves at Bodies of Revolution; 7. Elementary Acoustic and Electromagnetic Edge Waves
This book is the first complete and comprehensive description of the modern Physical Theory of Diffraction (PTD) based on the concept of elementary edge waves (EEWs). The theory is demonstrated with the example of the diffraction of acoustic and electromagnetic waves at perfectly reflecting objects
