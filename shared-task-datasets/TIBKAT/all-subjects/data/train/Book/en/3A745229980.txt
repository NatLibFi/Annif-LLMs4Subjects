China and the environment : the green revolution
The trajectory of China's growth is leading many environmentalists to ask how the state and its people really engaging with environmental issues? This book provides access to otherwise unknown stories of environmental activism and forms the first real-life account of China and its environmental tensions. China and Environment provides a unique report on the experiences of participatory politics that have emerged in response to environmental problems, rather than focusing only on macro-level ecological issues and their elite responses. Featuring previously untranslated short interviews, extracts from reports and other translated primary documents. The authors argue that going green in China isn't just about carbon targets and energy policy; China's grassroots green defenders are helping to change the country for the better
