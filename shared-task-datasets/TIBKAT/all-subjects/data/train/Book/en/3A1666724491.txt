Laser-Tissue interactions : fundamentals and applications
Laser-Tissue Interactions by Prof. Dr. Markolf H. Niemz (Heidelberg University) has become the standard reference book in this fast growing field. It addresses basic concepts such as optical and thermal tissue properties, hard and soft tissue ablation, and photobiomodulation. Clinical applications are reviewed according to the latest references. The last chapter covers today's standards of laser safety with a careful selection of essential guidelines published by the Laser Institute of America. This fourth edition has been completely revised and updated. Color illustrations, summaries, and questionnaires with solutions transform this book into a useful guide for graduate students, scientists, and medical practitioners.
