Complex Function Theory, Operator Theory, Schur Analysis and Systems Theory : A Volume in Honor of V.E. Katsnelson
This book is dedicated to Victor Emmanuilovich Katsnelson on the occasion of his 75th birthday and celebrates his broad mathematical interests and contributions.Victor Emmanuilovich’s mathematical career has been based mainly at the Kharkov University and the Weizmann Institute. However, it also included a one-year guest professorship at Leipzig University in 1991, which led to him establishing close research contacts with the Schur analysis group in Leipzig, a collaboration that still continues today. Reflecting these three periods in Victor Emmanuilovich's career, present and former colleagues have contributed to this book with research inspired by him and presentations on their joint work. Contributions include papers in function theory (Favorov-Golinskii, Friedland-Goldman-Yomdin, Kheifets-Yuditskii) , Schur analysis, moment problems and related topics (Boiko-Dubovoy, Dyukarev, Fritzsche-Kirstein-Mädler), extension of linear operators and linear relations (Dijksma-Langer, Hassi-de Snoo, Hassi -Wietsma) and non-commutative analysis (Ball-Bolotnikov, Cho-Jorgensen).
