Religious education in a plural western society : problems and challenges
Plurality is a decisive characteristic of the modern Western world. Plurality also exists with regard to religion. When plurality is spoken of, not only the historically established religions such as Christianity, Islam, and Judaism are meant; we also encounter plurality in the religious attitudes of people. Their beliefs and practices can have religious character without having to understand themselves within the context of a religious community - religion is not to be found only in the churches anymore. Plurality also exists within each religion. Yet plurality reigns even within one specific church. This book reflects on the premises and goals of Religious Education. It takes up the diversity of religions and the diversity of worldviews. In this book the concept of plurality is worked out as a challenge: Religious learning processes are constitutive at their beginning already characterized by plurality. In encountering and interacting with what one considers to be strange, allen, and other, he begins to ponder the question of who he himself is.
