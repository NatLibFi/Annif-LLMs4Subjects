Supramolecular amphiphiles
"An amphiphile is a molecule that contains a hydrophilic part and a hydrophobic part, linked by covalent bonding. Supramolecular amphiphiles (supra-amphiphiles) are amphiphiles linked by non-covalent interactions. As they employ non-covalent interactions, these species demonstrate adaptability and reversibility in conformational transformation, making them one of the most important emerging species in supramolecular chemistry. They have proven important in bridging the gap between molecular architecture and functional assembly.This book is written and edited by the current leaders in the topic and contains a foreword from Professor Jean-Marie Lehn, a father of the supramolecular chemistry field. Bringing together supramolecular chemistry and colloidal and interfacial science, the book provides a detailed and systematic introduction to supramolecular amphiphiles. Chapters explain how to employ non-covalent interactions to fabricate supra-amphiphiles. The book opens with an introduction to the history and development of the field, followed by chapters focussing on each type of interaction, including host-guest interaction, electrostatic interaction, charge-transfer interaction, hydrogen bonding and dynamic covalent bonds.This book will be a valuable resource for students new to this field and experienced researchers wanting to explore the wider context of their work."--
