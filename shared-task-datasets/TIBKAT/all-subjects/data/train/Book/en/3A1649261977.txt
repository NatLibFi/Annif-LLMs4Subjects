Computational Discrete Mathematics : Advanced Lectures
This book is based on a graduate education program on computational discrete mathematics run for several years in Berlin, Germany as a joint effort of theoretical computer scientists and mathematicians in order to support doctoral students and advanced ongoing education in the field of discrete mathematics and algorithmics.The 12 selected lectures by leading researchers presented in this book provide recent research results and advanced topics in a coherent and consolidated way. Among the areas covered are combinatorics, graph theory, coding theory, discrete and computational geometry, optimization, and algorithmic aspects of algebra
