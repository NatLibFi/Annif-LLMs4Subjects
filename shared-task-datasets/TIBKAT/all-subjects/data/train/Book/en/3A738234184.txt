System dynamics
"System dynamics deals with mathematical modeling and analysis of devices and processes for the purpose of understanding their time-dependent behavior. While other subjects, such as Newtonian dynamics and electrical circuit theory, also deal with time-dependent behavior, system dynamics emphasizes methods for handling applications containing multiple types of components and processes such as electromechanical devices, electrohydraulic devices, and fluid-thermal processes. Because the goal of system dynamics is to understand the time-dependent behavior of a system of interconnected devices and processes as a whole, the modeling and analysis methods used in system dynamics must be properly selected to reveal how the connections between the system elements affect its overall behavior. Because systems of interconnected elements often require a control system to work properly, control system design is a major application area in system dynamics"--"System Dynamics includes the strongest treatment of computational software and system simulation of any available text, with its early introduction of MATLAB® and Simulink®. The text's extensive coverage also includes discussion of the root locus and frequency response plots, among other methods for assessing system behavior in the time and frequency domains as well as topics such as function discovery, parameter estimation, and system identification techniques, motor performance evaluation, and system dynamics in everyday life"--
