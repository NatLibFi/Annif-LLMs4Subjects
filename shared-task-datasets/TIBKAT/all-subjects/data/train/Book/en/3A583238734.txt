Guide to intelligent data analysis : how to intelligently make sense of real data
"Each passing bear bears witness to the development of ever more powerful computers, increasingly fast and cheap storage media, and even higher bandwidth data connections. This makes it easy to believe that we can now - at least in principle - solve any problem we are faced with so long as we only have enough data." "Yet this is not the case. Although large databases allow us to retrieve many different single pieces of information and to compute simple aggregations, general patterns and regularities often go undetected. Furthermore, it is exactly these patterns, regularities and trends that are often most valuable." "To avoid the danger of "drowning in information, but starving for knowledge" the branch of research known as data analysis has emerged, and a considerable number of methods and software tools have been developed. However, it is not these tools alone but the intelligent application of human intuition in combination with computational power, of sound background knowledge with computer-aided modeling, and of critical reflection with convenient automatic model construction, that results in successful intelligent data analysis projects. Guide to Intelligent Data Analysis provides a hands-on instructional approach to many basic data analysis techniques, and explains how these are used to solve data analysis problems." "This practical and systematic textbook/reference for graduate and advanced undergradate students is also essential reading for all professionals who face data analysis problems. Moreover, it is a book to be used following one's exploration of it."--BOOK JACKET
