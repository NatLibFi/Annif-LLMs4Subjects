Structural design against deflection
"As buildings become taller, bridges longer and floors wider, deflections become more significant. This book presents qualitative relationships between internal forces and deflection, and demonstrates principles and measures, based on these internal forces, for designing structures against deflection in order to achieve more effective, efficient and elegant structures. Hand calculation examples, with and without using these relationships, are provided to enhance understanding. Practical examples are given and several well-known structures are examined to show their rationality from a structural point of view. The book suits a range of students studying architecture and civil engineering as well as practicing architects and structural engineers who need more than rule-of-thumb methods"--
