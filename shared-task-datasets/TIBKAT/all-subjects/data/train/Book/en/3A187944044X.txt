International business in Korea : the evolution of the market in the globalization era
O. Yul Kwon uses an institutional framework to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the environmental and operational dynamics of international business in South Korea from the rapid growth period 1963-1996, through recovery from the 1997 financial crisis, to the present. The study assesses that the South Korean market and business practices will maintain some sui generis characteristics because of the country's idiosyncratic culture and singular form of institutional development in the recent past. The book contains comprehensive analysis of macro-level topics (such as business opportunities, cultural influence, country risk and market configuration) and micro-level topics (including business negotiation, business ethics, management of international joint ventures and the management system). This book delivers a wealth of valuable information for a scholarly audience including undergraduate and postgraduate students and academics in international business, as well as for firms considering market entry into South Korea
