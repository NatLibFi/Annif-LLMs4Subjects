Asynchronous Pulse Logic is a comprehensive analysis of a newly developed asynchronous circuit family. The book covers circuit theory, practical circuits, design tools and an example of the design of a simple asynchronous microprocessor using the circuit family. Asynchronous Pulse Logic will be of interest to industrial and academic researcher working on high-speed VLSI systems. Graduate students will find this useful reference for computer-aided design of asynchronous or related VLSI systems.
