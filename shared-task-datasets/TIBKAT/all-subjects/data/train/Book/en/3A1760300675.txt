The internal heat of the planet Earth represents an inexhaustible reservoir of thermal energy known as Geothermal Energy. The 2nd edition of the book covers the geologic and technical aspects of developing all forms of currently available systems using this "renewable" green energy. The book presents the distribution and transport of thermal energy in the Earth. Geothermal Energy is a base load energy available at all times independent of climate and weather. The text treats the efficiency of diverse shallow near surface installations and deep geothermal systems including hydrothermal and petrothermal techniques and power plants in volcanic high-enthalpy fields. The book also discusses environmental aspects of utilizing different forms of geothermal energy, including induced seismicity, noise pollution and gas release to the atmosphere. Chapters on hydraulic well tests, chemistry of deep hot water, scale formation and corrosion, development of geothermal probes, well drilling techniques and geophysical exploration complete the text. This book, for the first time, covers the full range of utilization of Geothermal Energy.
