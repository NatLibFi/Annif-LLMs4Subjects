Infrared Holography for Optical Communications : Techniques, Materials, and Devices
The aim of this book is to exploit the advantages of holographic technology, namely the high storage capacity and fast access times, in order to implement optical devices for infrared fiber communication applications. The covered methods range from two-lambda to gated recording techniques, all of which can be applied to a variety of materials such as photorefractive crystals and photopolymers. Both techniques and materials are strictly related to the practical realization of signal processing devices, showing their feasibility and discussing their role in a realistic telecoms network. Research scientists, engineers and graduate students will benefit equally from the combined coverage of technological features, optical communications components, and network perspectives
