Digital Informatics and Isotopic Biology discusses self-organization and the emergence of order at the atomic scale with a particular emphasis on the digital information that can be carried by proper ordering of stable isotopes. This ushers in the concept of isotopic biology as a complimentary level to the "common" biology. The book discusses the area of isotopic randomness (isotopicity) and numerous implications of it for physics, biology, biomedicine, informatics, and other areas of science. It offers a unique and original view and may be the first milestone of this novel emerging area. The character of the book is highly interdisciplinary with numerous philosophical and historical discourses and comments
