Time, Quantum and Information
This collection of essays presented to Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker on the occasion of his 90th birthday addresses a wide readership interested in astronomy, physics, and the&nbsp;history and philosophy of science. The articles&nbsp;treat subjects such as the social responsibility of scientists, thermonuclear processes in stars and stellar neutrinos, turbulence and the emergence of planetary systems. Furthermore,&nbsp;considerable attention is paid to the unity of nature, the nature of time, and to&nbsp;information about, and interpretation of, the structure of quantum theory, all important philosophical problems of our times. The last section describes von Weizsäcker's ur-hypothesis and how it will theoretically&nbsp;permit&nbsp;the construction of&nbsp;particles and interactions from quantized bits of information
