Advances in control technologies for brushless doubly-fed induction generators
This book presents advances in control technologies for efficient operation of the brushless doubly-fed induction generator (BDFIG). For robust and low-cost operation of BDFIGs, it is required to keep high-quality output voltage and eliminate the speed/position encoder under different loads and operation conditions. Some advanced control technologies, from the authorsâ€™ latest work on these topics, are presented to achieve this goal with simple and accurate texts, illustrations, and tables. The qualified outcomes obtained from this book assure the high-performance operation of BDFIGs and also give the readers a straight insight toward challenges in this research area in the future.
