Evaluation of the moisture susceptibility of WMA technologies
"TRB's National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 763: Evaluation of the Moisture Susceptibility of WMA Technologies presents proposed guidelines for identifying potential moisture susceptibility in warm mix asphalt (WMA). The report also suggests potential revisions to the Appendix to AASHTO R 35, "Special Mixture Design Considerations and Methods for WMA" as a means to implement the guidelines."--publisher's description
