Archi.pop : mediating architecture in popular culture
"Popular culture has become one of the foremost ways for trends to emerge in contemporary life. With a myriad number of viewers, the mediums of film, television and music have an unprecedented effect on how we live and arrange the spaces in which we live and work. Archi.Pop: Architecture and Design in Popular Culture offers the first contemporary critical overview of how architecture and design are represented within a variety of mediums of popular culture. The public is introduced to canonical architecture and design through a range of mass media and as a consequence is taught to recognise desire and consumption. This volume responds to this argument, exploring the different ways architecture and design are presented, represented and reflected within mass media. How can we read the contemporary design of Suburban American through the visual aesthetic of The Sopranos? How are housing projects represented and reflected through Hip-Hop? What significance has modern car design on contemporary interior design? What is Hollywood's role in the construction of domestic space? How did Shag carpeting influence modern design to the point of total saturation? Featuring a wide range of case studies from television, film, music, domestic interiors, magazines and many more, Archi.Pop brings the study of architecture and culture firmly to the contemporary world, offering a unique critical investigation into how this dynamic relationship has shaped the way we live and the way we interact with the constructed world around us"--
