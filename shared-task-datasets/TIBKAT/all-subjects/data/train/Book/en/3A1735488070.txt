Augmentative and alternative communication : models and applications for educators, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, caregivers, and users
Augmentative and Alternative Communication: Models and Applications for Educators, Speech-Language Pathologists, Psychologists, Caregivers, and Users aims to be the primary text for graduate courses in augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). The book contains 13 chapters - the ideal length for a 13-week semester course - that provide an in-depth overview of the subject. The author, Filip Loncke, PhD, has practiced and conducted research in AAC and AAC-related matters since 1990 and has taught AAC courses at the graduate level since 2000. Dr. Loncke recognized that due to the ever-evolving nature of the field, which in many ways is linked to developing technology, it was crucial to develop a book that details the framework of how communication is shaped by internal and external factors (including technology) and how communication affects social functioning as well as other (mainly cognitive) functions. The text references psycholinguistics, communication sciences, social psychology, and other disciplines to explain AAC and provide students with a thorough review of the subject. -- From back cover
