Thermal design : heat sinks, thermoelectrics, heat pipes, compact heat exchangers, and solar cells
"The second edition of this book continues the goal of serving as a senior or first-year graduate textbook on thermal design with engineering applications. Students should be expected to have basic knowledge of fluid mechanics, heat transfer, electric circuits, and numerical analysis. In the second edition, I have made two particular efforts: one is that I made many example problems and homework problems for student exercises. The other is that I have completely replaced the previous thermoelectric chapter with Chapter 5, "Thermoelectric Design," and Chapter 6, "Thermoelectric Materials," in the depth of a graduate level course. The material of the seven chapters can be selectively presented in a one-semester course or in multiple semesters. At the author's institution, the text is used in a senior and first-year graduate course with the introductory contents of Chapters 1-4, which have, as an elective, a one-semester course in thermal design. The text is also used in two graduate courses with Chapter 5, "Thermoelectric Design," and Chapter 6, "Thermoelectric Materials." Chapter 4, "Compact Heat Exchangers," can be used in a senior or first-year graduate course. Chapter 7, "Solar Cells," is used as a reference for students' projects"--
