It offers timely updates on how traditions like case studies, ethnographies, historical methods, narrative approaches, and critical research are practiced today and how emerging trends, including increasing legitimacy and feminization, are impacting the domain. The final chapters provide templates for engaging with the future as well as essays that critically assess how qualitative inquiry has evolved within organization studies. Readers will become acquainted with contemporary tools for conducting qualitative studies, learning to appreciate the emerging domains of qualitative inquiry within a dynamic and complex organizational world.Doctoral students and early-career researchers in organizational studies, especially those engaged with general management, organizational behavior, human resource management, innovation, entrepreneurship, and strategy, will enjoy this relevant and inclusive handbook.
