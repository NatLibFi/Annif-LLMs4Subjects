Guide to modern physics : using Mathematica for calculations and visualizations
"This is a "how to guide" for making beginning calculations in modern physics. The academic level is second year college physical science and engineering students. The calculations are performed in Mathematica, and stress graphical visualization, units, and numerical answers. The techniques show the student how to learn the physics without being hung up on the math. There is a continuing movement to introduce more advanced computational methods into lower-level physics courses. Mathematica is a unique tool in that code is written as "human readable" much like one writes a traditional equation on the board"--
