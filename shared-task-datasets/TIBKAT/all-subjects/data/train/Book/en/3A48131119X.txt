Keeping track : how schools structure inequality
"Selected by the American School Board Journal as a "Must Read" book when it was first published and named one of sixty "Books of the Century" by the University of South Carolina Museum of Education for its influence on American education, this provocative, carefully documented work shows how tracking - the system of grouping students for instruction on the basis of ability - reflects the class and racial inequalities of American society and helps to perpetuate them. For this new edition, Jeannie Oakes has added a new Preface and two new final chapters in which she discusses the "tracking wars" of the past twenty years, wars in which Keeping Track has played a central role."--Jacket
