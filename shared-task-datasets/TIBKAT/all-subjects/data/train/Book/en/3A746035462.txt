Transnational history
"Although some historians have been researching and writing history from a transnational perspective for more than a century, it is only recently that this approach has gained momentum. But what is transnational history? How can a transnational approach be applied to historical study?

Saunier surveys the key concepts, methods and theories used by historians, helping students to find their own way in this vibrant area. "--
