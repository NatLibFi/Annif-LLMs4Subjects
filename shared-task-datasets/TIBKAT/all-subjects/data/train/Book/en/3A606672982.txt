From interculturalism to transculturalism : mediating encounters in cosmopolitan contexts
"Recent trends in postcolonial and intercultural studies have led to a marked development towards concepts of transculturalism and cosmopolitanism. The articles collected in this volume discuss how cultural and literary theories are related to these much-debated issues. Experts from Germany, Austria and Italy have collected their theoretical approaches to and case studies of pertinent literary texts in this volume. The invitation to join in the project was occasioned by the 70th birthday of RÃ¼diger Ahrens, himself a much-travelled scholar in this field, and extended to scholars with whom he has collaborated over many years."--Publisher's description
