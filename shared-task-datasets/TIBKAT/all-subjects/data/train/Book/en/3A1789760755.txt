Damaging effects of weapons and ammunition
"This book outlines a range of issues related to the damaging effects of weapons and ammunition. The basic concepts of the theory of efficiency, the physical foundations of the functioning and the damaging effects of fragments, shaped charges, high-explosive and penetrating weapons are considered. Calculation formulas are given that make it possible to evaluate the parameters of the lesion fields and their interaction with various objects. Of particular interest to specialists in explosion safety, the book describes criteria for the defeat of explosives, characteristics of the vulnerability of objects with respect to various damaging factors, dependencies for assessing the safe distances, and resistance of various structures to the effects of explosion and impact. Issues related to the use of numerical modeling of explosion and impact processes are also covered"--
