Also included are the clay-microbe interaction, layered double hydroxides, zeolites, cement hydrates, genesis of clay minerals as well as the history and teaching of clay science. The second edition adds new infomation from the intervening six years and adds some important subjects to make this the most comprehensive and wide-ranging coverage of clay science in one source in the English language.
