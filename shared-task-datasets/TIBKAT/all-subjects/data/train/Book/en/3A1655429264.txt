Groups, Rings and Fields
David Wallace has written a text on modern algebra which is suitable for a first course in the subject given to mathematics undergraduates. It aims to promote a feeling for the evolutionary and historical development of algebra. It assumes some familiarity with complex numbers, matrices and linear algebra which are commonly taught during the first year of an undergraduate course. Each chapter contains examples, exercises and solutions, perfectly suited to aid self-study. All arguments in the text are carefully crafted to promote understanding and enjoyment for the reader
