The political economy of destructive power
1. Three types of power -- 2. The meaning of destructive power -- 3. The social nature of destructive power -- 4. The value of destructive power -- 5. Sources of destructive power
Economic science has extensively studied the creative power of individuals and social groups, but it has largely ignored the destructive power of economic agents. This highly original book redresses the balance and, for the first time, looks at how much an agent can destroy. Destructive power is conceptualised in a unique way, covering all types of deliberate (violent and non-violent) social conflict behaviour. The theoretical arguments in the book are skilfully linked to burning political issues of our time such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the Second Gulf War
