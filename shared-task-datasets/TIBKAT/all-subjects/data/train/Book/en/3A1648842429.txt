Brillouin-Wigner Methods for Many-Body Systems
Brillouin-Wigner Methods for Many-Body Systems gives an introduction to many-body methods in electronic structure theory for the graduate student and post-doctoral researcher. It provides researchers in many-body physics and theoretical chemistry with an account of Brillouin-Wigner methodology as it has been developed in recent years to handle the multireference correlation problem. Moreover, the frontiers of this research field are defined. This volume is of interest to atomic and molecular physicists, physical chemists and chemical physicists, quantum chemists and condensed matter theorists, computational chemists and applied mathematicians.
