In this volume readers will find for the first time a detailed account of the theory of symplectic reduction by stages, along with numerous illustrations of the theory. Special emphasis is given to group extensions, including a detailed discussion of the Euclidean group, the oscillator group, the Bott-Virasoro group and other groups of matrices. Ample background theory on symplectic reduction and cotangent bundle reduction in particular is provided. Novel features of the book are the inclusion of a systematic treatment of the cotangent bundle case, including the identification of cocycles with magnetic terms, as well as the general theory of singular reduction by stages.
