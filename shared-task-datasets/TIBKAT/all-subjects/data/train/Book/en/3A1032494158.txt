Nonlinear control and filtering for stochastic networked systems
"The book covers control and filtering problems for several classes of stochastic networked systems including stability, robustness, reliability, consensus performance, and/or disturbance attenuation levels within a unified theoretical framework. It derives sufficient conditions for systems to achieve the prescribed design requirements"--
