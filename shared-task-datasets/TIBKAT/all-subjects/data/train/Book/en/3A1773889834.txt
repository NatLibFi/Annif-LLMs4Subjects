Feedback Amplifiers: Theory and Design deals with feedback and feedback amplifiers. Although this topic has been extensively investigated over the years, theoretically exact and at the same time sufficiently simple and well organized material is not, to the authors' judgement, present today in literature. After describing the fundamental properties of feedback, the book illustrates techniques of analysis for greater insight into feedback amplifiers and design strategies to optimise their performance. The book has two main targets 1) a tutorial purpose since its aim is first to introduce and then to bring the reader to in-depth analysis and design of feedback circuits; 2) to present original material on the topic of feedback circuits. In particular, a new comprehensive approach for the frequency compensation of two-stage and three-stage amplifiers is adopted, and insightful new results are reported for harmonic distortion in the frequency domain.
