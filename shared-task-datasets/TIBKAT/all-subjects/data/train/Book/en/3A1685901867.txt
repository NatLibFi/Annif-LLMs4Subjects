How can HR drive growth?
The ten up-to date research reviews that are presented in this book provide new insights into the HR academic literature. The chapters provide clear lessons that can be learnt from, along with strategies, approaches and processes in which HR could be used by both practitioners and policy makers to drive growth. The book shows how suitable strategy can increase workforce knowledge, leadership skills, entrepreneurial spirit, organizational involvement, safety and well-being and how HR can enhance performance within small and large, private and public, single-site and multi-site firms. This book explores cross-disciplinary human resources literature and up-to-date trends and directions relevant to academics, research students, policy makers, the business world and other stakeholders
