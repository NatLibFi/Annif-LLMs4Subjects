The problem-centred interview : principles and practice
"Interviewing is among the most commonly used methods in qualitative research. It is a pragmatic and reliable tool for collecting information and can be adapted to diverse situations and purposes. The discursive-dialogic reconstruction of relevant issues in the perspective of the interview partner is one of these purposes - it is at the core of the program of the technique of the problem-centered interview (PCI). Andreas Witzel and Herwig Reiter present the first English book about this popular and widely recognized method and introduce it to the international research community. The comprehensive and hands-on introduction to methodology, principles and practice of this particular technique is organized along the logical steps of preparing, doing and processing PCIs. The authors use many practical examples from their own problem-centered research to illustrate each stage as well as common interviewing pitfalls and errors. The book also demonstrates how to work with sensitizing prior knowledge in the context of interview research."--Publisher's website
