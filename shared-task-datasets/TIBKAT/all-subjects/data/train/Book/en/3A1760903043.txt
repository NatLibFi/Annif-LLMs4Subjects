Secret places : the architect's guide to distinctive buildings in and around Copenhagen
What should lovers of architecture seek out in Copenhagen once they've done the world-famous iconic buildings such as Amalienborg, Grundtvig's Church and Danmarks Nationalbank? Copenhagen is home to a wealth of marvellous, yet oft-overlooked buildings. With her book Secret Places, architect Marie-Louise Høstbo wishes to expand the readers' horizons, inspiring them to go explore fifty special buildings in and around the Danish capital. All of them are distinctive places that are sure to surprise, engage and challenge visitors. The book features examples of Danish architecture ranging from Arne Jacobsen's pavilion in Enghaveparken, designed during his time with the Copenhagen City Architect's office, to the Tårnby City Hall, stringently adhering to the "less is more" philosophy, and onwards to Kindt-Larsen's delightful summer residence at Hornbæk, merging architecture and furniture design to create a truly unique unity
