The elements of operator theory
"This fully revised, updated, and corrected edition of the Elements of Operator Theory includes a significant expansion of problems and solutions used to illustrate the principles of operator theory. Written in a user-friendly, motivating style, it covers the fundamental topics of the field in a systematic fashion while avoiding a formula-calculation approach. The book maintains the logical and linear organization of the title's first edition, progressing through set theory, algebraic structures, topological structures, Banach spaces, and Hilbert spaces before culminating in a discussion of the Spectral Theorem."--
