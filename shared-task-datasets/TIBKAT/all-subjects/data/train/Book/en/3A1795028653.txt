Morphosyntax : constructions of the world's languages
"This textbook provides a general survey of the morphosyntactic constructions of the world's languages. The textbook is directed towards advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students studying syntax. At the University of New Mexico, I have taught this course as a one-semester course, following on an introductory undergraduate course in syntax where I present the same basic framework but apply it only to English until the second half of that course. However, a more leisurely journey through the material could be done in two semesters, or certain sections could be skipped or assigned as background reading in a one-semester course"--
