Gas turbine diagnostics : signal processing and fault isolation
"A discussion of the different methods in data filtering, trend shift detection, and fault isolation developed over the past decade, this book provides a variety of new research tools for use in the condition monitoring of jet engines. Each method is demonstrated through numerical simulations which can be easily done using worksheets such as MS Excel or through Matlab. The algorithms presented will be useful to engineers and scientists working on fault diagnosis of gas turbine engines. The data cleaning algorithms based on nonlinear signal processing provided are also applicable to condition and health monitoring problems in general. "--
