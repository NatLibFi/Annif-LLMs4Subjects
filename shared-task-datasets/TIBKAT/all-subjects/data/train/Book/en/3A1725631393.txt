"Ecolinguistics: Language, ecology and the stories we live by is a ground-breaking book which reveals the stories that underpin unequal and unsustainable societies and searches for inspirational forms of language that can help rebuild a kinder, more ecological world. This new edition has been updated and expanded to bring together the latest ecolinguistic studies with new theoretical insights and practical analyses. The book presents a theoretical framework and practical tools for analysing the key texts which shape the society we live in. The theory is illustrated through examples including the representation of environmental refugees in the media; the construction of the selfish consumer in economics textbooks; the parallels between climate change denial and coronavirus denial; the erasure of nature in the Sustainable Development Goals; creation myths and how they orient people to towards the natural world; and inspirational forms of language in nature writing, Japanese haiku and Native American writing. This edition provides an improved theoretical framework, new example analyses, and an additional chapter on narratives. Accompanied by a free online course with videos, PowerPoints, notes and exercises (www.storiesweliveby.org.uk), as well as a comprehensive glossary, this is essential reading for undergraduates, postgraduates and researchers working in the areas of Discourse Analysis, Environmental Studies and Communication Studies"--
