Irregular migration in Europe : myths and realities
"Irregular Migration in Europe" contributes to our knowledge of the scale and nature of the much discussed but under-researched phenomenon of irregular migration in Europe, whilst improving our understanding of the dynamics of irregular migration and its relation to European societies and economies. Presenting a comparative analysis of the experiences and policies of different EU member states, this book draws on an extensive range sources, many of which have so far been absent from English-language analyses, to offer an overall picture of irregular migration in twelve EU member states. This volume will be of interest to policy makers and researchers within the fields of migration, sociology and social anthropology, political science, European integration and European studies, political science and public administration.
