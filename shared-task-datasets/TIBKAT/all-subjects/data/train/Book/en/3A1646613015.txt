Transendoscopic Ultrasound for Neurosurgery
Endoscopic neurosurgery has not yet reached the safety and applicability of microsurgery. Endo-neuro-sonography is a new technique aimed at making endoscopy safer by real-time imaging and navigation capacity (brain-radar). The endo-neurosonographic image is a sonographic scan at the tip of the endoscope (mini-CT) providing additional information to the endoscopic view. Endo-Neuro-Sonography is the first book on this new topic, presenting techniques and equipment, anatomical features, and the first clinical series. Schematic drawings, tables and 237 figures (122 in color) offer a precise overview of this technique. The final chapter is dealing with future concepts on minimally invasive neurosurgery and specific reference to ergonomics in neurosurgery.
