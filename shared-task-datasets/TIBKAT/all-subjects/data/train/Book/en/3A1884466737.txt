Bioelectrochemical systems : the way forward / edited by Durga Madhab Mahapatra, Smita S. Kumar, Lakhveer Singh ; volume 3: Algae based bioelectrochemical systems for carbon sequestration, carbon storage, bioremediation and bioproduct generation
Algae Based Bioelectrochemical Systems for Carbon Sequestration, Carbon storage, Bioremediation and Bioproduct Generation explores the integration of carbon capture, storage and sequestration technologies with bioelectrochemical fuels cells (BEFC), showing how conventional technologies can be renovated to aid in the reduction in GHG emissions and simultaneously optimize BEFC performance. The book focuses on the integration of algal biogas upgradation with electrochemical systems, providing a guide to the renovation of conventional technologies to combine energy production and carbon sequestration. Chapters discuss the latest advancements in carbon sequestration biocatalyst and microbial platforms and integrations for rapid carbon biotransformations. In addition, the book highlights the potential of algae and chemolithotrophs as candidates for carbon delivery, biocatalyst orientation and architecture for optimal BEFC performance.- Addresses the modification of carbon materials in the strengthening and application of bioelectrochemical fuel cells- Highlights the application of bioelectrochemical systems in carbon sequestration and utilization- Discusses the frontiers of carbon storage biocatalysts such as algae and chemlithotrophs- Includes content supported by analytical tools and detailed schematics and process diagrams that outline the integration of carbon sequestration with bioelectrochemical systems
