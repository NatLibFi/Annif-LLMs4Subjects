Fractal geometry : mathematical foundations and applications
"This comprehensive, accessible and very popular textbook presents fractal geometry at a level accessible to a final year undergraduate mathematician or physicist whilst also providing a useful primer or reference for the research mathematician or scientist"--
"This comprehensive and popular textbook makes fractal geometry accessible to final-year undergraduate math or physics majors, while also serving as a reference for research mathematicians or scientists. This up-to-date edition covers introductory multifractal theory, random fractals, and modern applications in finance and science. New research developments are highlighted, such as porosity, while covering other much more sophisticated topics, such as fractal aspects of conformal invariance, complex dimensions, and non-commutative fractal geometry. The book emphasizes dimension in its various forms, but other notions of fractality are also prominent"--
