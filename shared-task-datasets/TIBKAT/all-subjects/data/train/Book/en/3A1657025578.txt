Probability for Physicists
This book is designed as a practical and intuitive introduction to probability, statistics and random quantities for physicists. The book aims at getting to the main points by a clear, hands-on exposition supported by well-illustrated and worked-out examples. A strong focus on applications in physics and other natural sciences is maintained throughout. In addition to basic concepts of random variables, distributions, expected values and statistics, the book discusses the notions of entropy, Markov processes, and fundamentals of random number generation and Monte-Carlo methods.
Basic Terminology -- Probability Distributions -- Special Continuous Probability Distributions -- Expected Values -- Special Discrete Probability Distributions -- Convolution -- Samples -- Estimation of Parameters and Statistical Tests -- Regression -- Entropy -- Markov Processes -- Generation of Pseudorandom Numbers -- Monte Carlo Method -- Stochastic Population Modeling.
