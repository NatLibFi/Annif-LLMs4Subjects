Nitrogen cycle : ecology, biotechnological applications and environmental impacts
"The book presents a new vision of the nitrogen cycle and analyzes how the biological knowledge of the different processes involved in it can be used to reduce the environmental risk that nitrogen pollution exerts on the environmental quality of our planet. Problems such as contamination of groundwater or surface waters by nitrates or ammonium and how they can be mitigated by different biotechnologies are discussed in this book. The book will be a useful reference work for scientists, academic faculty and graduate students"--
