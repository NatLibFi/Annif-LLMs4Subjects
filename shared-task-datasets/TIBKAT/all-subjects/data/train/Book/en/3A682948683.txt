Leveraging information technology for optimal aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO)
"Aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) requires unique information technology to meet the challenges set by today's aviation industry. How do IT services relate to aircraft MRO, and how may IT be leveraged in the future? Leveraging information technology for optimal aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) responds to these questions, and describes the background of current trends in the industry, where airlines are tending to retain aircraft longer on the one hand, and rapidly introducing new genres of aircraft such as the A380 and B787, on the other. This book provides industry professionals and students of aviation MRO with the necessary principles, approaches and tools to respond effectively and efficiently to the constant development of new technologies, both in general and within the aviation MRO profession. This book is designed as a primer on IT services for aircraft engineering professionals and a handbook for IT professionals servicing this niche industry, highlighting the unique information requirements for aviation MRO and delving into detailed aspects of information needs from within the industry."--
