Security and privacy in mobile social networks
This book focuses on three emerging research topics in mobile social networks (MSNs): privacy-preserving profile matching (PPM) protocols, privacy-preserving cooperative data forwarding (PDF) protocols, and trustworthy service evaluation (TSE) systems. The PPM helps two users compare their personal profiles without disclosing the profiles. The PDF helps users forward data to their friends via multiple cooperative relay peers while preserving their identity and location privacy. The TSE enables users to locally share service reviews on the vendors such that users receive more valuable information about the services not only from vendors but also from their trusted social friends. The authors address both theoretic and practical aspects of these topics by introducing the system model, reviewing the related works, and presenting the solutions. Security and Privacy for Mobile Social Networks further provides the security analysis and the performance evaluation based on real-trace simulations. It also summarizes the future research directions for this rapidly growing area of research. The book will be valuable for researchers and practitioners who work with mobile social networks, communication platforms, wireless communication techniques, and internet applications. --
