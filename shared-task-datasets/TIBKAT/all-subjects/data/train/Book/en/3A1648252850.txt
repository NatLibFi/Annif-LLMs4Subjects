Flavor Physics and the TeV Scale
This monograph treats the usefulness of flavor physics as probes of the TeV scale, with the aim of providing a timely introduction to the emerging LHC era. By concentrating only with the TeV scale connection, a large part of the B factory output can be bypassed. The emphasis here is on loop-induced processes, which enables the probing of virtual TeV scale physics through quantum processes. Two-thirds of the book is concerned with b s or bs bs transitions. It takes an experimental perspective resulting in selecting processes, rather than the theories or models, as the basis to explore flavor ph
