For this purpose, the data have to be interpreted, translated, into a physical model of the subsurface. .. This book describes some ofthe most important common features of different geophysical data sets. (fromthe Introduction) Users at universities but also practitioners in exploration, physics or environmental sciences, wherever signal processing is necessary, will benefit from this textbook
