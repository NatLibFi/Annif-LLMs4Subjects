Nanomaterials and nanocomposites : characterization, processing, and applications
"This book discusses the most recent research in nanomaterials and nanocomposites for a range of applications, as well as modern characterization tools and techniques. It deals with nanocomposites that contain a dispersion of nanosized particulates and carbon nanotubes in their matrices (polymer, metal, and ceramic). This book enables an efficient comparison of properties and capabilities for these advanced materials, making it relevant for academic research and industrial R&D into nanomaterials processing and application"--
