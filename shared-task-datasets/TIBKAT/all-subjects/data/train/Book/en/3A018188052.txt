Ayi Kwei Armah's Africa : the sources of his fiction
Wright (English, Northern Territory Univ., Darwin, Australia) challenges the view that criticizes the controversial Ghanian writer's dependence on Western literary models. He traces the roots of Armah's early short fiction to Fanon and to native ritual, devotes a chapter each to three major novels, and follows themes down through his journalistic writing of the 1980s. Includes a very thorough bibliography. Annotation(c) 2003 Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)
