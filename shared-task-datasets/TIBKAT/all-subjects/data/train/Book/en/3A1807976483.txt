The tiling book : an introduction to the mathematical theory of tilings
"Mathematics is often seen as a collection of subjects, each learned one at a time. Although those fields rarely overlap, they are all subsumed under the heading of mathematics as they all rely on rigorous logical deductions from a set of axioms. But in fact, there are numerous overlaps and interconnections between fields. And often the most interesting mathematics comes about when connections are made across the sub-disciplines. Tiling theory happens to be an area where many of the sub-fields of mathematics overlap. Tools can be applied from linear algebra, algebra, analysis, geometry, topology, and combina- torics. In this book, all of these fields make an appearance. Tiling theory provides an opportunity to demonstrate the interconnectedness of mathematics"--
