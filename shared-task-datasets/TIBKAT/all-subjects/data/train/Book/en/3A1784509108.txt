Deregulated electricity structures and smart grids
"The power sector restructuring aims to bring competition and operating efficiency in the power industry that results in reliable, economical, and quality power supply to consumers. This comprehensive reference text provides an in-depth insight into these topics. The text discusses issues including renewable energy integration, reliability assessment, stability analysis, reactive power compensation in smart grid, and harmonic mitigation, in the context of the deregulated smart electricity market. It covers important concepts including AC and DC grid modeling under smart grid structure, extraction of energy from renewable energy sources under the deregulated electricity market with the smart grid, and harmonics mitigation and reactive power compensation in the deregulated smart grid. The text will be useful for graduate students and professionals in the fields of electrical engineering, electronics and communication engineering, renewable energy, and clean technologies"--
