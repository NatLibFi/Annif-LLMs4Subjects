Chromosome and genomic engineering in plants : methods and protocols
This volume assembles protocols for chromosome engineering and genome editing in two recently developed approaches for manipulating chromosomal and genomic DNA in plants. The first approach is a 'plant chromosome vector' system, which allows the introduction of desired genes or DNA into target sites on the chromosome vector, particularly by sequence-specific recombination.--
