It did happen here : the rise of fascism in contemporary society
"This book argues and demonstrates that fascism did happen in contemporary society such as especially America, as during post-2016. It classifies and discusses the main elements of fascism to see if these reveal and replicate themselves in America post-2016. It discovers the specific syndromes of fascism in America post-2016 that reveal and replicate universal fascist features. It detects the main social causes of fascism in America post-2016. It identifies primary counterforces to fascism in America and elsewhere. Lastly, the book constructs a composite fascism index and calculates fascism indexes for Western and comparable societies like OECD countries. These indexes provide suggestive evidence that fascism happened in America and other OECD countries, even if not in Western Europe, especially Scandinavia"--
