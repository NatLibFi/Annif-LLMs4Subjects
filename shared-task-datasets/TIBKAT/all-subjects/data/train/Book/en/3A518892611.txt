Chemically reacting flow : theory and practice
"Computer simulation of reactive systems is highly effective in the development, enhancement, and optimization of chemical processes. Chemically Reacting Flow helps prepare both students and professionals to take practical advantage of this powerful capability."--Jacket
Complex chemically reacting flow simulations are commonly employed to develop quantitative understanding and to optimize reaction conditions in systems such as combustion, catalysis, chemical vapor deposition, and other chemical processes. Although reaction conditions, geometries, and fluid flow can vary widely among the applications of chemically reacting flows, all applications share a need for accurate, detailed descriptions of the chemical kinetics occurring in the gas-phase or on reactive surfaces. Chemically Reacting Flow: Theory and Practice combines fundamental concepts in fluid mechan
