Sustainable development in Europe : concepts, evaluation and applications
Evaluating sustainable development is becoming increasingly important in policy making, evaluation practice and the scientific world in general.

Sustainable Development in Europe addresses these issues and presents an important and concise analysis of state-of-the-art sustainable development evaluation policies, programmes and projects currently at work in Europe
