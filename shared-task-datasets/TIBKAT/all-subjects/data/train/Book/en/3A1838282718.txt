Intelligent methods with applications in volcanology and seismology
This book presents intelligent methods like neural, neuro-fuzzy, machine learning, deep learning and metaheuristic methods and their applications in both volcanology and seismology. The complex system of volcanoes and also earthquakes is a big challenge to identify their behavior using available models, which motivates scientists to apply non-model based methods. As there are lots of seismology and volcanology data sets, i.e., the local and global networks, one solution is using intelligent methods in which data-based algorithms are used
