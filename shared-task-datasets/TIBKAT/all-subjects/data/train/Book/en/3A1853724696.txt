Diatoms : ecology and biotechnological applications
"This reference book covers the ecological impact and biotechnological applications of diatoms. Diatoms contribute to forty percent of primary productivity in aquatic ecosystems. They have a unique biomonitoring ability and sensitivity towards different pollutants in wastewater, thereby a tool for ecotoxicological monitoring. The book discusses the need for newer diatoms-based indices for wastewater quality analysis. It describes the nutraceutical value of the myriad compounds like omega 3 fatty acids-DHA, polysaccharides, phenols in diatoms. It also elaborates on the challenges in sustainable diatom biorefinery. This book is meant for microbiologists, biotechnologists, and marine biologists"--
