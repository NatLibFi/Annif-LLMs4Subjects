High-energy astrophysics : a primer
This textbook is designed to serve as a link between the basic disciplines of physics and the frontier topics within high energy astrophysics, aiming at a level of difficulty congruent with that of other physics topics studied at undergraduate level. Therefore, this preparatory and introductory text serves as a gateway to a more detailed study of many of the most interesting and complex phenomena being investigated by contemporary astrophysics. Among others, these include: the evolution of stars, supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, solar neutrinos, and - importantly - the exciting new field of gravitational wave astronomy. The book is supplemented by a collection of problems with which students can test their understanding of the material presented.
