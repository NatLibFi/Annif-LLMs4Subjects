Steven Holl
This comprehensive monograph on Steven Holl, one of America's greatest living architects, offers an extensive overview of both realized and unrealized works from 1974 to today... This book examines the architect's most important works through in-depth analysis of his design processes and ideas, as well as his methods and materials of construction. Experiential 'walk-throughs' of Holl's buildings place the reader within the spaces and describe how they act to engage the senses"--Inside front cover
