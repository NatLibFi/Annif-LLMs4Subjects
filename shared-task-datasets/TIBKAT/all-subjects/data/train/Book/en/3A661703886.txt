Impact investing : transforming how we make money while making a difference
"A ground-breaking book on the transformative power of impact investingThis is the first book to chart the catalytic path of this new industry, explaining how it is and can be a positive disruptive force. It shows how impact investing is a transformational vehicle for delivering "blended value" throughout the investment spectrum, giving a single name to a set of activities previously siloed in enclaves, revealing how they are linked within what is becoming a new field of investing. Written by two leaders in the growing field of impact investing, the book defines this emerging industry for participants on all sides of the funding equation (investors, funders and social entrepreneurs).  Filled with illustrative examples of impact investing success stories  Reveals how the field can expand in order to address the most critical social and environmental issues of our day  Explores the wide-ranging applications of impact investing as well as entrepreneurial opportunities  The authors do not take a normative approach to argue how investors should behave like an investment guide might but show how entrepreneurial people and institutions are already offering an integrated alternative."
