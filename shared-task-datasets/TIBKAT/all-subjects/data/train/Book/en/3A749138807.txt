Noninterracting Control with Stability for Nonlinear Systems
The noninteracting control problem with stability consists of rendering a nonlinear system noninteractive while achieving internal stability. With the exception of systems with outputs partitioned into given blocks or when the state of the system is not available for feedback, this problem is well understood. However, this book provides a useful supplement to the standard texts on the nonlinear control theory and collects all the existing results on the nonlinear noninteracting control problem into a self-contained and extensive concept
