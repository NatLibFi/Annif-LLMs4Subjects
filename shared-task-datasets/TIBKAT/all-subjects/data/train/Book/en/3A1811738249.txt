Introductory science of alcoholic beverages : beer, wine, and spirits
"Introductory Science of Alcoholic Beverages provides readers an engaging introduction to the science behind beer, wine, and spirits. It illustrates not only the chemical principles that underlie what alcoholic beverages are, why they are the way they are and what they contain, but also frames them within the context of historical and societal developments. Discussed chapter topics include introductions to beer, wine, and spirits; the principles behind fermentation and distillation; and overviews of how each beverage class is made. The chapters highlight the unique chemistries that lend beer, wine, and spirits their individuality, as well as the key chemicals that impart their characteristic aroma and flavor profiles. This book goes beyond focused descriptions of individual alcoholic beverages by summarizing their common chemical lineage and illuminating the universal scientific principles that underpin them. It will be of interest to students of physics and chemistry, as well as enthusiasts and connoisseurs of beer, wine, and spirits"--
