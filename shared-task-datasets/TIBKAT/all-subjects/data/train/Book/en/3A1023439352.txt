The economic growth of emerging markets has been unparalleled in recent history, accounting for 50 per cent of global economic output. Despite this reality, this much-needed Handbook is the first contemporary book on human resource management (HRM) research and practice in emerging markets. World-leading emerging markets scholars, Frank Horwitz and Pawan Budhwar, bring together a diverse set of key HRM themes, including talent management, global careers and employee engagement, in contributions from 40 leading experts from across the world. Wide-ranging and path-breaking, this Handbook addresses thematic issues of rapid growth, diversity, complexity and volatility in emerging market environments at a global level. Based on leading-edge research and practice in more than 20 emerging markets, this book explores the remarkable intricacy of emerging markets, their differing socio-economic and political trajectories as well as the exciting and challenging critical policy and human resource practice choices that these create. The editors' strategic aim is to identify future HRM challenges and how these are addressed, particularly by rapidly growing multinational companies (MNCs) from emerging markets as well as by MNCs investing directly in these markets. Horwitz and Budhwar's unique collection will appeal to students, scholars and policymakers interested in international and comparative HRM, employment relations and business
