Carbon nanotubes : reinforced metal matrix composites
"This book highlights seminal findings in CNT-MMC research and includes several tables listing processing methods, associated CNT states, and resulting properties in order to aid the next generation of researchers in advancing the science and engineering of CNT-MMCs. In addition, a survey of the patent literature is presented in order to shed light on what the first wave of CNT-MMC commercialization may look like and the challenges that will have to be overcome both technologically and commercially"--
