Number theory, Fourier analysis and geometric discrepancy
"The first part of this book is dedicated to the first goal. The reader will find some topics typically presented in introductory books on Number Theory: factorization, arithmetic functions and integer points, congruences and cryptography, quadratic reciprocity, and sums of two and four squares. Starting from the first few pages we introduce some simple and captivating findings, such as Chebyshev's theorem and the elementary results for the Gauss circle problem and for the Dirichlet divisor problem, which may lead the reader to a deeper study of Number Theory, particularly students who are interested in Calculus and Analysis"--
