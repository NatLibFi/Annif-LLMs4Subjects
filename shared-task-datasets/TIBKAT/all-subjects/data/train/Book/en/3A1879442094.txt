The economics of regulating road transport
The regulation of road transport externalities - environmental pollution, noise annoyance, accidents and congestion - is one of the most important issues in contemporary transport policies. The Economics of Regulating Road Transport explores welfare economic evaluations - in terms of efficiency as well as equity and social feasibility - of regulatory policies and policy mixes directly aimed at, or indirectly connected to the containment of market failures in road transport. The discussion ranges from static analyses at the level of individual actors and firms to the dynamic behaviour of large spatio-economic systems. Part one explores the economic rationale behind regulating road transport, part two investigates issues of efficiency in the regulation of road transport and part three discusses the issue of equity and social feasibility versus efficiency. This book will be of interest to students of environmental economics and transport economics and to transport and environmental policymakers at the local, regional, national and international level
