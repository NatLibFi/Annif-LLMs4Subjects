Power and communication cables : theory and applications
Power and communication cables are frequently installed adjacent to each other, and hybrid cables that contain both power conductors and communication lines are increasingly popular. Power and Communication Cables is a convenient, single-source volume written for utility maintenance engineers, cable production and design engineers, and students to expand their knowledge of both types of cables in the power and communications fields. With contributions from leaders in the field, this book presents a detailed treatment of solid-liquid, polymeric, compressed gas, and cryogenic cables used in power transmission and distribution. In the area of communication, the contributors address the use of metallic conductor multipair and coaxial cables, as well as optical fiber cables. Power and Communication Cables provides in-depth discussion of the design, manufacture, testing, installation, and operation of power and communication cables. You will find essential information on the properties of materials and learn how they influence cable characteristics. Moreover, this interdisciplinary reference provides theoretical and practical insights into various aspects of cable engineering in both power and communication systems
