International marketing and the country of origin effect : the global impact of 'Made in Italy'
The country of origin of goods and services can have positive or negative effect on customers’ intentions to purchase. This book analyzes the impact of this effect on the international development of Italian companies in emerging markets. -- The chapters refer to a wide range of issues, including made-in effects in relation to ethnocentrism and to corporate social responsibility in small and medium-sized enterprises; the interactions and synergistic effects between product-related made-in images and the images of places as tourism destinations; distribution channel issues; ‘made-in topics’ in relation to emerging markets; and a review of the relevant literature on country of origin effects. The contributors propose strategies and tools that companies might leverage to develop their international marketing and suggest policies that might strengthen these efforts. -- This original work will prove to be a valuable resource for students and researchers of international marketing and strategy as well as policy makers.
