Electrochemistry of technetium
Introduction: General Information on Technetium -- Comprehensive electrochemistry of Tc and its periodic table neighbors -- Technetium coordinated by inorganic ligands in aqueous and nonaqueous solutions -- Technetium coordinated by organic ligands in aqueous and non-aqueous solutions -- Metallic technetium, corrosion, technetium alloys and its behavior in spent nuclear fuel -- Determination of trace amounts of Tc by electrochemical methods.
This book provides detailed information on the electrochemistry of technetium compounds. After a brief physico-chemical characterization of this element, it presents the comparative chemistry of technetium, manganese and rhenium. Particular attention is paid to the stability, disproportionation, comproportionation, hydrolysis and polymerization reactions of technetium ions and their influence on the observed redox systems. The electrochemical properties of both inorganic as well as organic technetium species in aqueous and non-aqueous solutions are also discussed. The respective chapters cover the whole spectrum of topics related to the application of technetium in nuclear medicine, electrochemistry of technetium in spent nuclear fuel (including corrosion properties of technetium alloys), and detecting trace amounts of technetium with the aid of electrochemical methods. Providing readers with information not easily obtained in any other single source, the book will appeal to researchers working in nuclear chemistry, nuclear medicine or the nuclear industry.
