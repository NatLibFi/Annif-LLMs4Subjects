Microscope Design / Dmitry N. Frolov ; volume 1: Principles
This book traces the historical development of microscopy instruments from their invention to the current state of the art. New concepts and engineering solutions are presented for modern light microscopes, with a focus on the practical construction of optical systems. Real design parameters of dioptric objectives and other systems are provided to supply readers with basic information for independent designs. Full-color photomicrographs of real objects illustrate the quality of aberration correction that is required from optics.
