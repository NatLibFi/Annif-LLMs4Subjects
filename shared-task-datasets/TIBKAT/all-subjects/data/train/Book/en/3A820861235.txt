Fall prevention through design in construction : the benefits of mobile computing
"The role of designers has traditionally been to design a building so that it conforms to accepted local building codes. The safety of workers is left up to the contractor building the designs. Research shows, however, that designers can have an especially strong influence on construction safety during the concept, preliminary and detailed design phases. This book establishes the new knowledge and conceptual frameworks necessary to develop a mobile computing-enabled knowledge management system that can help reduce the high rate of construction falls. There are three main objectives of this book: 1. To create a new Prevention through Design (PtD) knowledge base to model the relationships between fall risks and design decisions; 2. To develop a PtD mobile App to assist building designers in fall prevention through design; 3. To evaluate the practical implications of the PtD mobile App for the construction industry, especially for building designers and workers. The cutting edge technologies explored in this book have the potential to significantly reduce the rate of serious injuries that occur in the global construction industry. This is essential reading for researchers and advanced students of construction management with an interest in safety or mobile technologies"--
