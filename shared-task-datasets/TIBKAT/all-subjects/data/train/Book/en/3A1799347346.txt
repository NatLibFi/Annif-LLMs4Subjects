Nonlinear control technology of vehicle chassis-by-wire system
This book belongs to the field of intelligent vehicle control, which is dedicated to the research of nonlinear control problems of intelligent vehicle chassis-by-wire systems. Through the nonlinear stability control of the steer-by-wire system and the consistency optimization control of the brake-by-wire system, the performance of the vehicle subsystem is improved. Then, the decoupling control of the nonlinear inverse system is used to realize the decoupling of the chassis-by-wire system. Finally, this book further adopts nonlinear rollover prevention integrated control to improve the rollover prevention performance of the vehicle.
