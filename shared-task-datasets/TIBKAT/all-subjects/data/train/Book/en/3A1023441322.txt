The new global political economy : from crisis to supranational integration
The 2008 financial crisis is arguably the most dramatic outcome of globalization. International economic integration, if unregulated, can bring about huge inequalities and the destruction of the environment. This thought-provoking book illustrates why the ‘old’ international order is unable to provide crucial global public goods such as monetary and financial stability in the fight against mass poverty and climate change. -- The expert authors provide an in-depth analysis of the causes of the financial crisis and the political economy measures required to build a safer and more stable international order. They show how the financial crisis is deeply rooted in the flaws of the dollar standard and explain why the dollar and globalization should be considered together to understand the present challenges. By way of conclusion, the authors propose the creation of a ‘World Eco-Monetary Union’ with the power to regulate the global economy and to promote sustainable development. -- The new macroeconomic approach presented contributes to the development of a more comprehensive supranational political economy. As such, this challenging book will prove a stimulating read for academics, researchers and students with an interest in economics, heterodox economics, and international economics.
