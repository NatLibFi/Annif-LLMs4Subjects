Plant cytogenetics and cytogenomics : methods and protocols
This book provides an up-to-date account of the most widespread methods used by specialists in the field of plant cytogenetics and the emerging field of cytogenomics that will likely soon be adapted by more labs. From the classical basic karyological approaches to the most recent genomics-informed and computational methods, the volume explores genome size and ploidy level estimation, chromosome fixation, preparation, and manipulation, banding and staining techniques, in situ hybridization, as well as numerous methods that integrate cytogenetics with bioinformatics and computational genomics. Written for the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step and readily reproducible laboratory protocols, as well as tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Authoritative and practical, Plant Cytogenetics and Cytogenomics: Methods and Protocols serves as an ideal resource for plant scientists interested in molecular and evolutionary biology, breeding, systematics, and plant -omics in general.
