Modern characterization of electromagnetic systems and its associated metrology
"This book describes new method of characterization of electromagnetic wave dynamics and measurement, which are based on modern computational and digital signal processing techniques. The book introduces modern computational concepts in electromagnetic system characterization and introduce modern signal processing algorithms not only to enhance the resolution but also extract information from electromagnetic systems that is not currently possible, for example, generation of the non-minimum phase or for that matter the transient response given amplitude only data. The author covers model based parameter estimation and planar near field to far field transformation, as well as spherical near field to far field transformation. Electromagnetism is the physics of the electromagnetic field: a field, encompassing all of space, which exerts a force on those particles that possess a property known as electric charge, and is in turn affected by the presence and motion of such particles. The design of circuits that use the electromagnetic properties of electrical components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes and transistors to achieve a particular functionality."--
