Globalisation, regionalism, and economic activity
The processes of globalisation and increased economic regionalism have had profound, often destabilising, effects on modern economic and financial systems. In recognition of this fact, the editors of this fine book have collected together a diverse range of heterodox ideas surrounding the complex relationships and interactions between globalisation, regionalism and economic activity. The book promotes real-world economic issues and explores them without adopting any particular methodological, ideological or theoretical agenda. A number of influential economists explore the inter-relationships between globalisation, regionalism, finance, economic growth and development from a global perspective. Amongst other topics, the book includes comprehensive discussions on fixed versus flexible exchange rates; international liquidity; the WTO dispute settlement system; the eastward expansion of the European Union; crowding-out in export led growth; demand and supply in the New Economy; the national origin of financial liberalisation in the US; and the relationship between savings and investment. The range and depth of analysis makes this book a timely and useful contribution to current policy debates. Academics, students and scholars with an interest in globalisation, international economics and macroeconomics will do well to read this eclectic and stimulating volume
