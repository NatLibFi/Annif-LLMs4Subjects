The golden age of pantomime : slapstick, spectacle and subversion in Victorian England
In Victorian England, everyone went to the pantomime, from Queen Victoria and her family to the humblest of her subjects. The English Pantomime is one of the most popular, least examined of all theatrical forms. It's been the festive mainstay of the English stage since the eighteenth century, and it has survived by its ability to evolve. This continual evolution is traced by Jeffrey Richards in the first history of panto through its 'Golden Age' in Victorian England. He explores the spectacle, the slapstick, and the talent for subversion that nineteenth-century pantomime had - and still has today. He shows the panto, with its remarkable actors, managers, producers and punters across the country from Drury Lane to Blackpool, to be a remarkable cultural barometer of its times. This is a treat as rich as turkey and Christmas pudding.
