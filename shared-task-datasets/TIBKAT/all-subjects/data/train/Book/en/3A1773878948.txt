Fundamentals of Semiconductor Lasers
Fundamentals of Semiconductor Lasers explains the physics and fundamental characteristics of semiconductor lasers with regards to systems applications. The detailed and comprehensive presentation is unique in that it encourages the reader to consider different semiconductor lasers from different angles. Emphasis is placed on recognizing common concepts such operating principles and structure, and solving problems based on individual situations. The treatment is enhanced by an historical account of advances in semiconductor lasers over the years, discussing both those ideas that have both persisted over the years and those that have faded out. The first four chapters cover the basics of semiconductors, including band structures, optical transitions, optical waveguides, and optical resonators. The remaining chapters discuss operating principles and basic characteristics of semiconductor lasers, and advanced topics including dynamics single-mode lasers, quantum well lasers, and control of spontaneous emission. The reader need only be familiar with undergraduate-level electromagnetism and quantum mechanics. After reading this book, the student will be able to think critically about semiconductor lasers, and be able to read and understand journal papers in the field. This book will be essential to any advanced undergraduate or graduate student of semiconductor lasers, and any professional physicist or engineer looking for a good overview of the subject.
