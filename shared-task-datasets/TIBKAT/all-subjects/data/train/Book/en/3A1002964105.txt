Advanced nonlinear optics
Introduction to nonlinear optics -- Fundamental knowledge of nonlinear polarization of a medium -- Second-order nonlinear (three-wave) frequency mixing -- Third-order nonlinear (four-wave) frequency mixing -- Intense light-induced refractive-index changes -- Self-focusing, self-phase modulation, and spectral self-broadening -- Stimulated scattering of intense coherent light -- Optical phase conjugation -- Optical coherent transient effects -- Nonlinear laser spectroscopic effects -- Optical bistability -- Multi-photon nonlinear optical effect -- Principle of fast and slow light propagation -- Detailed theory of nonlinear susceptibilities
"Covering a broad scope of modern nonlinear optics. Presenting both schemes of semiclassical theory of nonlinear susceptibility and quantum theory of radiation. Emphasizing equally the fundamental theories, key experimental results, and various special applications"--
