Programming Elm : build safe and maintainable front-end applications
The Elm language offers safer applications and fewer errors that come with functional programming, while being type-safe and easy to use. Run-time errors are nearly impossible, and it compiles to JavaScript for easy web deployment. Take advantage of this new language in your web site development. Use a simple static application to get started with the syntax, Elm modules, and the virtual DOM, and create a full web UI using functions. Manage state with the Elm Architecture's update process. Use JSON and HTTP requests for communication in larger applications. Communicate in real-time with WebSockets. Integrate your Elm applications with JavaScript resources. Write code more effectively using Test-driven development with Elm's testing framework. Deploy quickly and easily with Elm's built-in tooling. Make your web UIs faster, safer, and easier to develop with Elm
