Séminaire de Probabilités L
This milestone 50th volume of the "Séminaire de Probabilités" pays tribute with a series of memorial texts to one of its former editors, Jacques Azéma, who passed away in January. The founders of the "Séminaire de Strasbourg", which included Jacques Azéma, probably had no idea of the possible longevity and success of the process they initiated in 1967. Continuing in this long tradition, this volume contains contributions on state-of-art research on Brownian filtrations, stochastic differential equations and their applications, regularity structures, quantum diffusion, interlacing diffusions, mod-Ø convergence, Markov soup, stochastic billiards and other current streams of research
