Capital cities : varieties and patterns of development and relocation
"This book studies capital city relocation concepts, paradigms and methodologies of analysis as well as the assessment of outcomes, motivations and decision-making models relevant to these projects. Capital cities' relocations are not singular and unique but are relatively wide-spread political phenomena evolving in universal ways and governed by homogeneous laws. Some of these laws apply both to ancient and modern precedents, while others are peculiar to different transnational regions of the world or specific political regimes. Vadim Rossman analyzes the more recent precedents to reveal the common and unique elements in their relocation solutions determined by the path-dependent political and economic situations of different countries"--Provided by publisher
