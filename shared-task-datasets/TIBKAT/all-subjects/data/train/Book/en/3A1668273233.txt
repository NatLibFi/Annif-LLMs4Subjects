Fundamentals of gas dynamics
"Fundamentals of Gas Dynamics, Third Edition is a new edition of the popular textbook and has been comprehensively updated throughout. Gas flows below Mach 5 are covered, providing cohesive and rigorous exposure to the practical engineering problems in this gas dynamics flow regime. The one-dimensional flow approach is presented and the role of temperature-entropy diagrams is highlighted. Fundamentals of Gas Dynamics, Third Edition includes new sections on the shock tube, the aerospike nozzle and the gas dynamic laser. Applications to aircraft and rockets are covered and new problems and examples are included. Also included are behavioral objectives, summaries and check tests to aid with learning, and a companion website hosting solutions manual and open source software"--
