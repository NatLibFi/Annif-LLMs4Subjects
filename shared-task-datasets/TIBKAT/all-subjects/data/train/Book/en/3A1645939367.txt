Einstein's Struggles with Quantum Theory : A Reappraisal
Einstein s Struggles with Quantum Theory: A Re-Appraisal, presents an account of all aspects of Einstein s encounter with quantum theory. Until recently it was accepted that, after important early work, Einstein was simply unable to follow Niels Bohr s approach to quantum theory, and that Einstein s own views, centered on realism, were of no interest. This book follows modern scholarship arguing that Einstein s arguments were well constructed, in the Einstein-Bohr debate his position was legitimate, and his pragmatic approach to realism stimulated John Bell and encouraged the emergence of quantum information theory. The book provides a readable account of Einstein s achievements in quantum theory, his own views, and the progress his work has stimulated since his death. While some chapters use mathematics at an undergraduate physics level, a path is provided for the reader more concerned with ideas than equations, and the book should be of interest to anybody interested in Einstein and his approach to the quantum.
