The Europeanisation of cities : policies, urban change & urban networks
"Sheds light on the complex interplay between cities and the EU, both how cities engage with the EU and how the EU engages with cities. In particular, the book considers how EU policies and programmes are acting as a driving force for urban change, and what motivates cities to be present on the EU stage. Furthermore, it addresses the roles of cities in the process of European integration (e.g., social policy). This book explores different approaches (mainly institutionalist concepts) to understand the Europeanization of cities and gives empirical evidence for chanfges on the local level (e.g., Budapest, Amsterdam, Vienna, Birmingham), related to the process of European integration and to the extension of networks between European cities."--P.
