Foundations of the Classical Theory of Partial Differential Equations
From the reviews of the first printing, published as volume 30 of the Encyclopaedia of Mathematical Sciences: ".. I think the volume is a great success and an excellent preparation for future volumes in the series. .. the introductory style of Egorov and Shubin is . attractive. .. a welcome addition to the literature and I am looking forward to the appearance of more volumes of the Encyclopedia in the near future. .." The Mathematical Intelligencer, 1993 ".. According to the authors .. the work was written for nonspecialists and physicists but in my opinion almost every specialist will find something new .. in the text. The style is clear, the notations are chosen luckily. The most characteristic feature of the work is the accurate emphasis on the fundamental notions .." Acta Scientiarum Mathematicarum, 1993 ".. On the whole, a thorough overview on the classical aspects of the topic may be gained from that volume." Monatshefte f√ºr Mathematik, 1993 ".. It is comparable in scope with the great Courant-Hilbert "Methods of Mathematical Physics", but it is much shorter, more up to date of course, and contains more elaborate analytical machinery. A general background in functional analysis is required, but much of the theory is explained from scratch, anad the physical background of the mathematical theory is kept clearly in mind. The book gives a good and readable overview of the subject. .. carefully written, well translated, and well produced." The Mathematical Gazette, 1993
