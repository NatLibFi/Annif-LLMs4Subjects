The geology of the Arabian-Nubian shield
­This richly illustrated book reviews the geology, tectonics and mineralization of the Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS) in 27 chapters. It starts with an examination of the ANS lithospheric scale features, explores Mesoproterozoic units and deals with the ANS oceanic stage. Arc volcanism and plutonism, post-collision basins and volcanics are discussed, as well as the younger granitoid magmatism and the deformation history of the ANS. The book provides information on ANS glacial stages and late magmatism. Chapters are devoted to review the transition between ANS and the reworked continent to its south. Finally, it discusses how ANS structures influenced the overall East African Rift System.
