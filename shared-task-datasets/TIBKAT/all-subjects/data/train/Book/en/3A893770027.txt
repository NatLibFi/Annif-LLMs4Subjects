Functional polymers : design, synthesis, and applications
"In recent years, large numbers of polymerization techniques have been reported on. Though some functional monomers give direct polymerization, it's always a challenge to polymerize the different functional monomers. Nowadays, the most challenging task for the researcher is not only to synthesize polymers in laboratories using different techniques of functional groups but also to synthesize those polymers on the industrial scale with their application. This book provides the solution this problem. This new book covers the synthetic as well application aspects of functional polymers. It highlights modern trends in the field and showcases the recent characterization techniques that are being employed in the field of polymer science. The chapters are written by top-notch scientists who are internationally recognized in the field. The chapters will highlight the modern trend in the field. The book covers various synthetic methodologies for making functional polymers, such as, for example, the ATRP, RAFT, and ROMP techniques. The synthesis of a new class of monomers and its polymerization followed by a thorough characterization by modern techniques is discussed as well as the self-assembled structures from newly developed functional polymers. Finally, the application of these polymers in the biomedical and electronic fields are presented in detail. Functional Polymers: Design, Synthesis, and Applications will be useful for the chemists with no background of polymer and recent cutting-edge research and will be useful as a classroom text at the collegiate level."--
