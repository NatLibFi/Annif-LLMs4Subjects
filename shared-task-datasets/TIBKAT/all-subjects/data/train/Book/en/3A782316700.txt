The Linguistic Worldview : Ethnolinguistics, Cognition, and Culture
Main description: The book is concerned with the questions posed in Jerzy Bartmi?skiâ€™s (Lublin, Poland) linguistic worldview program: What is the linguistic worldview? Does one language contain one worldview? Are there literary, poetic, or auctorial worldviews? Some chapters have been inspired by this approach but do not follow it in detail, a few present independent but related research, while others still offer a critical reappraisal.
Biographical note: The editors are specialists in English and Slavic linguistics, cognitive linguistics, and language-and-culture interface.
