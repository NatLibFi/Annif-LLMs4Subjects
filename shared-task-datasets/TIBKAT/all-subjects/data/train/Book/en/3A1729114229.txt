Dairy fat products and functionality : fundamental science and technology
This work highlights a new research area driven by a material science approach to dairy fats and dairy fat-rich products where innovative dairy products and ingredients can be tailor-made. Cutting edge topics such as tribology of dairy fats and dairy products, manipulation of differentiated-sized milk fat globules, milk fat interesterification for infant formula, structuring of lipids in dairy products and production of human milk fat substitutes by including dairy fats are featured in dedicated chapters authored by international scientific experts from across the globe. The text also presents in-depth research on proteomic characterization, digestion and the nutritional functionality of milk fat globule membrane. The biosynthesis, chemistry, digestion and nutritional roles of milk lipids, physics of dairy fats, structure and functionality of the milk fat globule membrane, analytical methods, materials science, technology and manufacturing of dairy fat-rich products such as butter, dairy fat spreads, dairy creams, cream powders and ghee are also covered in-depth. Dairy Fat Products and Functionality: Fundamental Science and Technology is a useful reference text for technologists and scientists interested in advancing their fundamental knowledge of dairy fat and dairy products as well as using a materials science and technology approach to guide efforts or widen research opportunities in optimizing the functionality of these products. From their physics and chemistry to their nutritional values and methodologies, this comprehensive and innovative text covers all the necessary information needed to understand the new methods and technologies driving the modern production of milk fat products.
