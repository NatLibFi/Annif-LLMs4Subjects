Saarinen houses
"The iconic Finnish-American father-son architects Eliel and Eero Saarinen may be most famous for buildings such as the Helsinki Central Railway Station (Eliel), the Cranbrook Academy of Arts (Eliel), The Gateway Arch in St. Louis (Eero), the TWA terminal in JFK Airport (Eero), and many other landmarks, but they also designed a number of remarkable houses, including Eero Saarinen's Miller House, one of the most significant examples of modern domestic architecture in the United States.
