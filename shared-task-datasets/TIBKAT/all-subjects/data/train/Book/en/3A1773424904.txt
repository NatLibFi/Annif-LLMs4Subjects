Navier-stokes equations and their applications
"In physics, Navier-Stokes equations are the partial differential equations that describe the motion of viscous fluid substances. In this book, these equations and their applications are described in detail. Chapter One analyzes the differences between kinetic monism and all-unity in Russian cosmism and Newtonian dualism of separated energies. Chapter Two presents a model for the numerical study of unsteady gas dynamic effects accompanying local heat release in the subsonic part of a nozzle for a given distribution of power of energy. Chapter Three describes a study of relationships between integrals and areas of their applicability. Lastly, Chapter Four defines the exact solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations characterizing movement in deep water and near the surface"--
