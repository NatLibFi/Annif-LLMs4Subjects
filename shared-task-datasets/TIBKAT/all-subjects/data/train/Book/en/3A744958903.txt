Aharonov-Bohm and other Cyclic Phenomena
The Aharonov-Bohm effect is associated with cyclic motion. It is one of a number of anholonomic effects, and this means that the dynamical description depends on the current position of the system and on the path by which it reached that position.This book is written for theoretical physicists and covers topics such as motion around a solenoid, flux measurements, and other phenomena involving movement on a closed circuit. The Aharonov-Bohm effect is not only anholonomic but it also connects quantum theory and magnetic fields in a remarkable fashion. A variety of physical phenomena where the A-B phase is a basic feature are discussed
