Mixed Motives and Their Realization in Derived Categories
The conjectural theory of mixed motives would be a universal cohomology theory in arithmetic algebraic geometry. The monograph describes the approach to motives via their well-defined realizations. This includes a review of several known cohomology theories. A new absolute cohomology is introduced and studied. The book assumes knowledge of the standard cohomological techniques in algebraic geometry as well as K-theory. So the monograph is primarily intended for researchers. Advanced graduate students can use it as a guide to the literature
