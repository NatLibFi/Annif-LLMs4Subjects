Handbook of nanoencapsulation : preparation, characterization, delivery, and safety of nutraceutical nanocomposites
"This book presents a comprehensive look at various nanosystems/nanocarriers, physical and chemical techniques used in encapsulation of various nutraceuticals and the targeted delivery of nutraceutics. It discusses multiple applications of nanoencapsulation techniques used on nutraceuticals derived from plants, animals as well as microalgae"--
"The ingredients commonly encapsulated are vitamins, minerals, flavours, fragrances, salts, enzymes, acidulants, coloring and leavening agents, essential oils and other bio active compounds like carotenoids, antioxidants, dietary fibres etc."--Introduction
