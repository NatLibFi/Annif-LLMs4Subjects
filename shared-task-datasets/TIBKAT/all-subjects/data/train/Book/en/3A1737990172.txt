Essentials in fermentation technology
This textbook teaches the principles and applications of fermentation technology, bioreactors, bioprocess variables and their measurement, key product separation and purification techniques as well as bioprocess economics in an easy to understand way. The multidisciplinary science of fermentation applies scientific and engineering principles to living organisms or their useful components to produce products and services beneficial for our society. Successful exploitation of fermentation technology involves knowledge of microbiology and engineering. Thus the book serves as a must-have guide for undergraduates and graduate students interested in Biochemical Engineering and Microbial Biotechnology
