This book discusses the application of quantum mechanics to computing. It explains the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and then goes on to discuss various elements of mathematics required for quantum computing. Quantum cryptography, waves and Fourier analysis, measuring quantum systems, comparison to classical mechanics, quantum gates, and important algorithms in quantum computing are among the topics covered. The book offers a valuable resource for graduate and senior undergraduate students in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields with an interest in designing quantum algorithms. Readers are expected to have a firm grasp of linear algebra and some familiarity with Fourier analysis. .
