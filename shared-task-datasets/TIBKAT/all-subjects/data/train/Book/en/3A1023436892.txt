pt. I. Extent and nature of the shadow economy -- pt. II. Policy approaches -- pt. III. Direct controls -- pt. IV. Indirect controls
'This is a very stimulating book which should be read by everyone who wants to gain an understanding of the latest developments in the shadow economy.'--Friedrich Schneider, Johannes Kepler University of Linz, Austria. 'Professor Williams is to be congratulated for this timely contribution - a fresh addition to the literature. As he explains, the recognition that the shadow economy is diverse and extensive has led to a rethinking of how to tackle it. In a reader-friendly fashion, the author explains the variable magnitude of and variable character of the shadow economy; he then discusses policy approaches, deterrence measures and incentives. The result is of interest to the policy-maker as well as to academics.'--LÃ©o-Paul DANA, Groupe Sup de Co Montpellier Business School, France. This authoritative monograph explores the effectiveness and transferability of the rapidly expanding range of policy approaches and measures available as weaponry in the fight against the shadow economy. Beginning with a review of the extent of undeclared work, the author discusses the discrepancies between regions and the potential impacts of the economic crisis, comparing the nature of the potential solutions available with those actually adopted. The way forward, the book concludes, is to move away from increasing the costs of engaging in hidden work using repressive measures, and concentrate more on developing initiatives that enhance the benefits of engaging in declared work and increase the likelihood of compliance by engendering a commitment to tax morality. This insightful and unique exposition will have considerable appeal to academics, practitioners and policy-makers across the globe involved in the fight against undeclared work
