Symmetry and Pattern in Projective Geometry
Symmetry and Pattern in Projective Geometry is a self-contained study of projective geometry which compares and contrasts the analytic and axiomatic methods.The analytic approach is based on homogeneous coordinates. Brief introductions to Pl√ºcker coordinates and Grassmann coordinates are also presented. This book looks carefully at linear, quadratic, cubic and quartic figures in two, three and higher dimensions. It deals at length with the extensions and consequences of basic theorems such as those of Pappus and Desargues. The emphasis throughout is on special configurations that have particularly interesting symmetry properties.  The intricate and novel ideas of H S M Coxeter, who is considered one of the great geometers of the twentieth century, are also discussed throughout the text. The book concludes with a useful analysis of finite geometries and a description of some of the remarkable configurations discovered by Coxeter.  This book will be appreciated by mathematics undergraduate students and those wishing to learn more about the subject of geometry. Subject and theorems that are often considered quite complicated are made accessible and presented in an easy-to-read and enjoyable manner. .
