Innovation in aeronautics
Annotation, Aerospace engineering is a very competitive environment and yet highly regulated, so innovation and change, while essential, must be carefully managed. The editors and contributors look at aircraft engineering in terms of how innovation is promoted or inhibited and what "drives" the innovative design of aircraft and their systems.After an introduction to innovation in aeronautics, part one reviews developments including biologically-inspired technologies, morphing aerodynamic concepts, jet engine design drivers, and developments underpinned by digital technologies. Chapters go on to explore the environment and human factors in innovation and trends in supersonic passenger air travel. Part two examines change and the processes and management involved in innovative technology development. Challenges faced in aeronautical production are the focus of part three which reviews topics such as intellectual property and patents, risk mitigation and the use of lean engineering. Finally, the concluding section summarizes key issues in what makes successful innovation in this sector
