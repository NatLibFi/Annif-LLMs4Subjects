Radiology : The Oral Boards Primer
A concise and comprehensive review of findings and differential diagnoses found on the oral board examination for diagnostic radiology. Drawing on pertinent and key differential diagnoses, the authors have assembled and organized the diagnoses most likely to appear on the exam and illustrated them with essential images to reinforce the findings associated with each differential. Additionally, with each finding set is provided a mnemonic to augment recall of any missing components of the differential that would be considered important. Because of their concise presentation, many cases can be examined, interpreted, completed, and memorized very rapidly in a single sitting. Since the majority of cases contain prototypical representations of pathology, the book also serves as an excellent reference source for many years after the reader has taken and passed the oral board examination. A CD-ROM edition of the book (ISBN: 1-58829-928-7), sold separately, is available for use on the reader's PC or PDA.
