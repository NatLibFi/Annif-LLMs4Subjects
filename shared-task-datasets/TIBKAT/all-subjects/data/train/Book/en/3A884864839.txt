The Routledge companion to picturebooks
Containing forty-eight chapters, The Routledge Companion to Picturebooks is the ultimate guide to picturebooks. It contains a detailed introduction, surveying the history and development of the field and emphasizing the international and cultural diversity of picturebooks. Divided into five key parts, this volume covers: • Concepts and topics – from hybridity and ideology to metafiction and emotions; • Genres – from baby books through to picturebooks for adults; • Interfaces – their relations to other forms such as comics and visual media; • Domains and theoretical approaches, including developmental psychology and cognitive studies; • Adaptations. With ground-breaking contributions from leading and emerging scholars alike, this comprehensive volume is one of the first to focus solely on picturebook research. Its interdisciplinary approach makes it key for both scholars and students of literature, as well as education and media.
