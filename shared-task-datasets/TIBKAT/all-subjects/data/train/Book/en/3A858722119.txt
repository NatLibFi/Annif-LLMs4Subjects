"A presentation of micro-scaled contemporary residences that demonstrate domesticity can be both compact and beautiful. Urban areas across the globe are experiencing a renaissance, with once-forgotten downtowns and neighborhoods becoming increasingly popular for redevelopment. The houses, apartments, and multifamily buildings and developments included make great architecture out of challenging locations and narrow sites. The projects range from a 344-square-foot studio apartment in Hong Kong with movable walls, transformable furniture, and hidden storage that can be configured into twenty-four unique scenarios in a single space, to a townhouse-like London residence built in an old alley between two stately homes." --
