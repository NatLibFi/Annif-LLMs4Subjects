A deeper learning companion for CLIL : putting pluriliteracies into practice
Designed as a companion to the influential volume Beyond CLIL, this highly practical book offers step-by-step instructions for designing and implementing innovative tasks and materials for pluriliteracies development in Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) - a transformative teaching approach where students study subjects in a different language. It contains annotated case studies of deeper learning episodes (DLEs) across a wide range of school subjects, using an innovative and proven template, to help teachers explore the potential of Pluriliteracies Teaching for Deeper Learning (PTDL) inside their own classrooms.
