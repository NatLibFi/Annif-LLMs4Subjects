Human factors in automotive engineering and technology
"Offering a unique perspective on vehicle design and on new developments in vehicle technology, this book bridges the gap between engineers, who design and build cars, and human factors, as a body of knowledge with considerable value in this domain. The work that forms the basis of the book represents more than 40 years of experience by the authors. It offers actionable design guidance, combined with a set of case studies highly relevant to current technological challenges in vehicle design"--Provided by publisher
