Intelligent Integrated Media Communication Techniques : COST 254 & COST 276
Intelligent Integrated Media Communication Techniques contains many examples and applied methods explaining the basic architecture of the mobile terminals. It contains sufficient introductory material enabling also non-expert readers to understand the topics and to make a step towards system integration of complex future applications. Intelligent Integrated Media Communication Techniques is to stimulate developers, researchers, and marketing specialists for new and critical technologies and system concepts, which can be applied in intelligent personal terminals. All those participating in the area like service providers, consumer electronics designers and researchers from industrial development labs and from academia are invited to find practical approaches and concepts for easier design of mobile intelligent personal terminals.
