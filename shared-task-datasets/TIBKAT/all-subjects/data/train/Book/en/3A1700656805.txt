Reviewing the past : the presence of ruins
"Though constantly in decay, ruins continue to fascinate the observer.

It looks at the general aspects of architectural decay and its classical forms of admiration and then turns towards ruins from both classical and contemporary periods, from both Western and non-Western areas, and with examples from "high art" as well as popular culture.
