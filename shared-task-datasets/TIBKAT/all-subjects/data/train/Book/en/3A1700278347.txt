High-temperature superconducting devices for energy applications
"This book presents novel concepts in the development of High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) devices and discusses the technologies involved in producing efficient, economically feasible energy technologies around the world. It covers the application of high temperature superconductors in clean energy production and allied cooling technologies. In addition, it presents the compatibility of other materials involved in the construction of various devices at cryogenic temperatures. It also summarizes Superconducting Fault Current Limiters (SFCL) and related grid stabilization. The book addresses the need for lower losses to be incurred with efficient power transmission. The aim of this book is to serve the needs of the industry professional, researchers, and doctoral students studying energy technologies"--
