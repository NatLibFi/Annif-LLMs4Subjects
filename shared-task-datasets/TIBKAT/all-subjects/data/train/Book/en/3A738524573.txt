Is there a European common good?
The common good and how it can be pursued is a contested question. It touches upon the core principles of a society and challenges political processes, institutional logics and constitutional settings. The nature and finality of the European transformation cannot be understood without taking these questions into account.

Is there a European Common Good? The publication reflects the struggle of defining the common good within the European Union from different disciplinary perspectives. The contributions explore the potential for a systematic approach to a European understanding of a common good. One can hardly deny that the strictures of Economic and Monetary Union and their impact on security-, health-, social- and environmental politics require the Europeanization of our understanding of a common good. Hence, a discussion of the common good within the European context is strongly suggested by current controversies over collective responsibilities and values
