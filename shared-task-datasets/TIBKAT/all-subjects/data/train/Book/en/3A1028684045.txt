Contesting Religion : The Media Dynamics of Cultural Conflicts in Scandinavia
As Scandinavian societies experience increased ethno-religious diversity, their Christian-Lutheran heritage and strong traditions of welfare and solidarity are being challenged and contested. This book explores conflicts related to religion as they play out in public broadcasting, social media, local civic settings, and schools. It examines how the mediatization of these controversies influences peopleâ€™s engagement with contested issues about religion, and redraws the boundaries between inclusion and exclusion.
