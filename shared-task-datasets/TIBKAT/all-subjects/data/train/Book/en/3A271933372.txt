Vertebrate flight : mechanics, physiology, morphology, ecology and evolution
Vertebrate Flight presents the basic principles of animal flight including the main requirements for body functions and morphology and the main correlations between structure, form and function in ecological and evolutionary perspectives. The main topics cover such aspects as flight mechanics and aerodynamics, power requirements for gliding and flapping flights, energy-saving flight modes and calculation of optimal flight speeds and power.
