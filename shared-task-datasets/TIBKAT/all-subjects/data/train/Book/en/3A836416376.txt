Introduction to metrology applications in IC manufacturing
Metrology has grown significantly, especially in semiconductor manufacturing, and such growth necessitates increased expertise. Until now, this field has never had book written from the perspective of an engineer in a modern IC manufacturing and development environment. The topics in this Tutorial Text range from metrology at its most basic level to future predictions and challenges, including measurement methods, industrial applications, fundamentals of traditional measurement system characterization and calibration, measurement system characterization and calibration, semiconductor-specific applications, optical metrology measurement techniques, charged particle measurement techniques, x-ray and in situ metrology, hybrid metrology, and mask making. Includes example spreadsheets of measurement uncertainty analysis--specifically, precision, matching, and relative accuracy
