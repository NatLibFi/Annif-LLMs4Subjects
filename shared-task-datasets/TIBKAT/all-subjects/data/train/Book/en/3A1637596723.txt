High-level language proficiency in second language and multilingual contexts
"This volume has its background in a large-scale research programme, High-level Proficiency in Second Language Use, carried out at Stockholm University, the purpose of which was to broadly develop our understanding of the conditions for the attainment of highly advanced L2 proficiency: cognitively/psycholinguistically, linguistically- structurally, and socio-psychologically/societally. The main idea of the volume is to provide a succinct and coherent picture of the empirically based theoretical knowledge that, to date, has been gained within the programme"--
