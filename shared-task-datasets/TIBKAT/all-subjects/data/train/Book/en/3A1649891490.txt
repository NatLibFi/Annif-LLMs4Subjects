Introduction to Computational Cardiology : Mathematical Modeling and Computer Simulation
Introduction to Computational Cardiology provides a comprehensive, in-depth treatment of the fundamental concepts and research challenges involved in the mathematical modeling and computer simulation of dynamical processes in the heart, under normal and pathological conditions. About this textbook: - Presents descriptions of models used in both biology and medicine for discovering the mechanisms of heart function and dysfunction on several physiological scales across different species. - Provides several examples throughout the textbook and exercises at the end which facilitate understanding of basic concepts and introduces, for implementation, treated problems to parallel supercomputers. Introduction to Computational Cardiology serves as a secondary textbook or reference book for advanced-level students in computer science, electrical engineering, biomedical engineering, and cardiac electrophysiology. It is also suitable for researchers employing mathematical modeling and computer simulations of biomedical problems.
