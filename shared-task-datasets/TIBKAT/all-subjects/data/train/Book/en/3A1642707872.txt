Lexical grammar : activities for teaching chunks and exploring patterns
This book is for anyone interested in the relationship between grammar and vocabulary and who is looking for activities which focus on units of language, such as chunks and patterns. The introduction looks at recent developments in corpus linguistics and second language acquisition research, and outlines the important role which chunks play in textual cohesion and in fluency, as well as in grammar acquisition. The practical part of the book provides practitioners with a large number of classroom suggestions and activities for making grammar teaching more lexical, and for making vocabulary practice more grammatical. Activities move from receptive to productive and can be used on their own or to supplement and enhance coursebook content
