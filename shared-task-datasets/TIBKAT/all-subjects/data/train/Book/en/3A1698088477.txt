Automotive power systems
"The main challenge in vehicle electrification consists of replacing the engine-based mechanical, pneumatic, or hydraulic ancillary energy sources with electrical energy processed through an electromagnetic device. The book illustrates this evolutionary process with numerous series-production examples for either of body or chassis systems, from old milestones to futuristic luxury vehicles. The first part of the book describes automotive technologies for generation and distribution of electrical power, as well as its usage within body systems, chassis systems, or lighting. The second part explores deeper into the specifics of each component of the vehicle electric power system"--
