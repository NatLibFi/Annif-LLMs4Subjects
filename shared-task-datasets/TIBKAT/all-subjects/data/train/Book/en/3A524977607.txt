Intellectual Property Protection in VLSI Designs : Theory and Practice
Design Security: From the Point of View of an Embedded System Designer -- Protection of Data and Privacy -- Constraint-Based Watermarking for VLSI IP Protection -- Fingerprinting for IP USERâ€™S Right Protection -- Copy Detection Mechanisms for IP Authentication -- Conclusions.
Intellectual Property Protection in VLSI Designs: Theory and Practice provides an overview of the security problems in modern VLSI design with a detailed treatment of our newly developed constraint-based protection paradigm for the protection of VLSI design IPs from FPGA design to standard-cell placement, from high-level synthesis solutions to gate-level netlist place-and-rout, and from advanced CAD tools to physical design algorithms. The problem of VLSI design IP protection is much more challenging than the protection of multimedia contents or software, and our protection paradigm is also conceptually different from the state-of-the-art approaches in those domains. Intellectual Property Protection in VLSI Designs: Theory and Practice contains the mathematical foundations for the developed IP protection paradigm, detailed pseudo-code and descriptions of its many techniques, numerous examples and experimental validation on well-known benchmarks, and clear explanations and comparisons of the many protection methods.
