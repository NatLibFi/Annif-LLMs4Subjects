Molecular mechanism of cruciferâ€™s host-resistance
The book is a comprehensive compilation of applied knowledge for developing resistant varieties to all the major biotrophs, hemibiotrophs and necrotrophs pathogens of crucifers through the use of latest biotechnological approaches. The book includes, multi-component resistance, incorporation of non-host resistance gene, function of particular gene in resistance, expression of age related resistance, enhanced gene resistance, sources of alternative gene which enhance disease resistance, through the use of latest biotechnical approaches like proteomics, omics, transcriptomics and metabolomics. The book also explores the molecular basis of disease resistance, its biometabolomics activities in response to infection and interaction by the various biotrophs, hemibiotrophs and necrotrophs pathogens. The identification of R genes and its incorporation into agronomically superior varieties through use of molecular mechanisms is also explained. This compilation is immensely useful to the researchers especially Brassica breeders, teachers, extension specialists, students, industrialists, farmers, and all others who are interested to grow healthy, and profitable cruciferous crops all over the world.
