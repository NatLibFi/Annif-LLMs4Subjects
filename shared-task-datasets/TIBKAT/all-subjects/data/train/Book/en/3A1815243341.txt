Developments in cognitive radio networks : future directions for beyond 5G
This book provides holistic yet concise information on what modern cognitive radio networks are, how they work, and the possible future directions for them. The authors first present the most generic models of modern cognitive radio networks while taking their different architectural designs and classifications into consideration. While the spectrum resource is shown to be the most important resource for the cognitive radio networks, the book exposes the importance of the other resources that are needed to help drive the technology. The book then discusses in-depth the key tools (such as optimization and queuing theory) and techniques (such as cooperative diversity and relaying) that are being employed to formulate resource problems, investigate solutions, and interpret such solutions for useful and practical modern cognitive radio networks realization. Further, the book studies the impact of modern cognitive radio networks on other emerging technologies — such as 5G, Internet of Things, and advanced wireless sensor networks — and discusses the role that cognitive radio networks play in the evolution of smart cities and in the realization of a highly interconnected world. In discussing the future of the cognitive radio networks, the book emphasizes the need to advance new or improved tools, techniques, and solutions to address lingering problems in the aspects of resource realization and utilization, network complexity, network security, etc., which can potentially limit the cognitive radio networks in their stride to becoming one of the most promising technologies for the immediate and near future. Presents a concise yet detailed in study, interpretation, and evaluation of modern cognitive radio networks; Includes topics such as stochastic geometry approach and deep learning in cognitive radio networks; Provides direction for further research engagements and makes recommendations for practical cognitive radio network implementation.
