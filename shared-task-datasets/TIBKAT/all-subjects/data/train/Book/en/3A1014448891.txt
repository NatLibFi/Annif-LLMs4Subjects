Applications of lock-in amplifiers in optics
"Lock-in amplifiers are key devices in several instruments used in the optical sciences or in optical equipment in the industry. In many experimental configurations, they represent the means to reliably detect and record small signals. The purpose of this text is to provide a step-by-step introduction to this technique. The book explains how modulation is used to extract a signal from noise and describes lock-in amplifier applications in optics. The book is intended for readers who want to better understand instruments and experiments based on lock-in detection and/or to design (and perform) new experiments in which lock-in amplifiers are applied"...
