Mm-wave silicon technology : 60 GHz and beyond
"mm-Wave Silicon Technology: 60GHz and Beyond covers silicon-based millimeter wave circuits and systems. It provides in depth coverage of advanced silicon processing technologies including CMOS and SiGe as well as modeling of active and passive devices on silicon at millimeter waves. It also provides coverage of mm-wave circuit building blocks such as low noise amplifiers, mixers, voltage controlled oscillators, frequency dividers, and power amplifiers that are suitable for integration in silicon. The book contains information on highly integrated mm-wave transceiver architectures with several silicon-based case studies. The book also includes advanced topics such as antenna arrays and beam-forming on silicon." "mm-Wave Silicon Technology: 60GHz and Beyond is written for practicing RF and analog circuit designers who are interested in this growing field. The chapters are self-contained and include short tutorials on important concepts before delving into details."--BOOK JACKET
