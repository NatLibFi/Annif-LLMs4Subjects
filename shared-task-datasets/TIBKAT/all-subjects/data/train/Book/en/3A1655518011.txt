A Senior moment : cultural mediations of memory and ageing
Ageing and memory - two aspects of life everybody has to face eventually. The contributions to this volume explore the cultural mediations of these categories. Through a series of approaches focused on practices and acts of memory, narratives, reminiscence, representation and collective memory, they seek to better understand and critically reflect on how ageing is experienced in variegated ways across the lifespan. By covering a variety of phenomena, from biopics, music by the elderly, and artefacts, among other, they all contribute to further the understanding of memory as a cultural process always in the making - situated in particular contexts, and shaped by its material conditions of existence.
