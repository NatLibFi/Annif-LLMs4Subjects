Process integration in biochemical engineering
Process integration has been one of the most active research fields in Biochemical Engineering over the last decade and it will continue to be so if bioprocessing is to become more rational, efficient and productive. This volume outlines what has been achieved in recent years. Written by experts who have made important contributions to the European Science, Foundation Program on Process Integration in Biochemical Engineering, the volume focuses on the progress made and the major opportunities, and in addition on the limitations and the challenges in bioprocess integration that lie ahead. The concept of bioprocess integration is treated at various levels, including integration at the molecular, biological, bioreactor and plant levels, but also accounting for the integration of separation and mass transfer operations and biology, fluid dynamics and physiology, as well as basic science and process technology
