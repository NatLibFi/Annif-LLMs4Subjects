A collection of Latin American modern architecture
A Collection of Latin American Modern Architecture is part of an ongoing series by one of the leading architectural photographers worldwide, Leonardo Finotti. It presents roughly one hundred of Finotti's photographs of undiscovered Latin American modern architecture he took over the past eight years and offers an important overview of the region. The way the photographs are taken and presented, the architecture is subject to an objective evaluation. This non-judgmental approach allows the viewer to get an insight into the richness and variety of Latin American architecture - from stadiums, to public buildings and private housing
