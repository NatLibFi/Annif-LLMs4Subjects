Computational Multiscale Modeling of Fluids and Solids : Theory and Applications
Devastatingly simple, yet hugely effective, the concept of this timely text is to provide a comprehensive overview of computational physics methods and techniques used for materials modeling on different length and time scales. Each chapter first provides an overview of the physical basic principles which are the basis for the numerical and mathematical modeling on the respective length scale. The book includes the micro scale, the meso-scale and the macro scale.
