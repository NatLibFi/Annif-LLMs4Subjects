Encryption for Digital Content
Encryption for Digital Content is an area in cryptography that is widely used in commercial productions (e.g., Blu-Ray and HD-DVDs). This book provides a comprehensive mathematical treatment of combinatorial encryption techniques used in digital content distribution systems and related attack models. A complete description of broadcast encryption with various revocation and tracing functionalities is included.Encryption for Digital Content introduces the subset cover framework (currently used in AACS, Blu-Ray and HD-DVDs,) and tracking/revocation mechanisms in various attack models. Pirate evolution attacks are covered in depth, providing an extensive treatment of the complexity of the revocation problem for multi-receiver (subscriber) encryption mechanisms, as well as the complexity of the traceability problem. This volume also illustrates the manner that attacks affect parameter selection, and how this impacts implementations.
