Nonparametric methods in statistics with SAS applications
"Preface This book has been written as a textbook for the second-year graduate course taught by the author in the Master's program in Applied Statistics at California State University, Long Beach. The goal of this course is to teach applications of nonparametric methods in statistics, starting with the hypotheses testing and moving on to regression, time-to-event analysis, density estimation and resampling methods. Being a textbook, this book is abundant with examples and exercises. The settings were taken from various scientific disciplines: health sciences, psychology, social sciences, education, clinical trials, to name a few. The settings and properly disguised data came from consulting projects that the author had been involved in over the past decade. All examples and exercises require the use of SAS 9.3 software. In the text, complete SAS codes are given for all examples. To prevent typing errors, the data sets for exercises are available on the book website. Instructors' solutions manual for all exercises is available to instructors upon request on the same website. Olga Korosteleva March, 2013"--
