Compressor performance : aerodynamics for the user
Introduction to aerodynamics -- Thermodynamics -- Aerodynamic components -- Compressor characteristics -- Equipment selection -- Operation -- Field performance testing -- Troubleshooting -- Flow meters -- Multi-section compressors
Compressor Performance is a reference book and CD-ROM for compressor design engineers and compressor maintenance engineers, as well as engineering students. The book covers the full spectrum of information needed for an individual to select, operate, test and maintain axial or centrifugal compressors. It includes basic aerodynamic theory to provide the user with the "how's" and "why's" of compressor design. Maintenance engineers will especially appreciate the troubleshooting guidelines offered. Includes many example problems and reference data such as gas properties and flow meter calculations to enable easy analysis of compressor performance in practice. Includes companion CD with computer programs. M. Theodore Gresh has been with the Elliot Company in Jeannette, Pennsylvania, since 1975, initially working on the mechanical and aerodynamic design and application of centrifugal compressors. Unrivalled coverage of the theory and practical use of all kinds of compressors in industrial use from an industry-leading company source Complete subject reference and learning resource in one stop, suitable for newly graduated engineers and experienced professional reference use Includes companion CD-ROM
