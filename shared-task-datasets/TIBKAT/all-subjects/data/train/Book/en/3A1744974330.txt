Innovation and the growth of cities
This new and original book by Zoltan Acs explores the relationship between industrial innovation and economic growth at the regional level, and reaches conclusions as to why some regions grow but others decline. While the analysis draws on industrial organization, labor economics, regional science, geography and entrepreneurship, the book focuses on innovation and the growth of cities by the use of endogenous growth theory
