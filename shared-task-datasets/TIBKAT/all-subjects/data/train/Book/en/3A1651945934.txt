Electromagnetic fields in cavities : deterministic and statistical theories
The first book of its kind, Electromagnetic Fields in Cavities presents a unique combination of rigorous solutions to Maxwells equations with conservation of energy to solve for the statistics of many quantities of interest: penetration into cavities (and shielding effectiveness), field strengths far from and close to cavity walls, and power received by antennas within cavities. Including all modes, rather than just the dominant mode, as well as wall losses and a special treatment of the current source region, the book is a valuable tool for researchers, practicing engineers, professors, and graduate students
A thorough and rigorous analysis of electromagnetic fields in cavities This book offers a comprehensive analysis of electromagnetic fields in cavities of general shapes and properties. Part One covers classical deterministic methods to conclude resonant frequencies, modal fields, and cavity losses; quality factor; mode bandwidth; and the excitation of cavity fields from arbitrary current distributions for metal-wall cavities of simple shape. Part Two covers modern statistical methods to analyze electrically large cavities of complex shapes and properties. Electromagnetic Fields in Cavities com
