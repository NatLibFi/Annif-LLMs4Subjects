Climate and development
"The 2015 Paris Accord stated the aim to limit the increase in global mean temperatures to 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels and if possible, keep it down to 1.5°C. Achieving this is possible, but the costs incurred are uncertain and the distribution of costs among nations is indistinct. Furthermore, even if the goal is realised, significant impacts from climate change can be expected. Evidence indicates that these will be felt most severely in countries that are relatively poor. These effects of climate change will be added to by the measures taken to reduce GHGs. Together, they will determine how climate change affects theprospects for development across the globe. The analysis of the interplay between climate change and policies to combat it on the one hand and development on the other are the focus of this book."
