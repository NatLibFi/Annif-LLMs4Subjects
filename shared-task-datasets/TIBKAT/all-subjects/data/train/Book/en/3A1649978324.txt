Layer-Adapted Meshes for Reaction-Convection-Diffusion Problems
One dimensional problems -- The Analytical Behaviour of Solutions -- Finite Difference Schemes for Convection-Diffusion Problems -- Finite Element and Finite Volume Methods -- Discretisations of Reaction-Convection-Diffusion Problems -- Layer-Adapted Meshes -- Two dimensional problems -- The Analytical Behaviour of Solutions -- Reaction-Diffusion Problems -- Convection-Diffusion Problems
This book on numerical methods for singular perturbation problems - in particular, stationary reaction-convection-diffusion problems exhibiting layer behaviour is devoted to the construction and analysis of layer-adapted meshes underlying these numerical methods. A classification and a survey of layer-adapted meshes for reaction-convection-diffusion problems are included. This structured and comprehensive account of current ideas in the numerical analysis for various methods on layer-adapted meshes is addressed to researchers in finite element theory and perturbation problems. Finite differences, finite elements and finite volumes are all covered
