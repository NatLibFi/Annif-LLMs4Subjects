Handbook of detailing : the graphic anatomy of construction
This Handbook is not predicated on the exemplary rendering of details but on the best presentation of the information required for the respective purpose â€“ whether at the construction site or the office. The author zeros in on frequent weaknesses in detailing and shows positive examples. He consciously does without modifying copies of actual details and offers examples and comments that can be adjusted to create the optimal effect for the circumstances of any project. Ralph W. Liebing, RA, CSI, has been active in every phase of architectural practice from document production to contract administration, on-site observation and specifications writing. He served as a building code official, and has taught college level courses on architecture, construction, documentation, practice, and regulations. He is also the author of seven textbooks; a monograph, several magazines articles and is a website columnist for the Construction Specifications Institute (www.csinet.org).
