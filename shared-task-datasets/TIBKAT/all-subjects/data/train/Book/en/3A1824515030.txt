Biodegradable polymers : concepts and applications
"The book on biodegradable polymer science dwells on the basic concepts of biodegradable polymer science, describing the techniques, standards and analysis to be performed to characterize biodegradable polymeric materials, highlighting that it is important to further develop and/or innovate processes considering the environment. All applications are shown from a sustainability and sustainability approach, it is important to highlight that biodegradability has a great burden when it involves substituting, modifying and/or designing existing processes in harmful and polluting processes. The book concludes with a reflection on the development of biodegradable polymers in different fields"
