Wireless physical layer network coding
Discover a fresh approach for designing more efficient and cooperative wireless communications networks with this systematic guide. Covering everything from fundamental theory to current research topics, leading researchers describe a new, network-aware coding strategy that exploits the signal interactions that occur in dense wireless networks directly at the waveform level. Using an easy-to-follow, layered structure, this unique text begins with a gentle introduction for those new to the subject, before moving on to explain key information-theoretic principles and establish a consistent framework for wireless physical layer network coding (WPNC) strategies. It provides a detailed treatment of Network Coded Modulation, covers a range of WPNC techniques such as Noisy Network Coding, Compute and Forward, and Hierarchical Decode and Forward, and explains how WPNC can be applied to parametric fading channels, frequency selective channels, and complex stochastic networks. This is essential reading whether you are a researcher, graduate student, or professional engineer--
