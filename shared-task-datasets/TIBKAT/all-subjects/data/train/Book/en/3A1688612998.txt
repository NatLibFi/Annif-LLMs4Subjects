The ecolaboratory : environmental governance and economic development in Costa Rica
"Despite its tiny size and seeming marginality to world affairs, the Central American republic of Costa Rica has long been considered an important site for experimentation in cutting-edge environmental policy. This book frames Costa Rica as an "ecolaboratory" and asks what lessons we can learn for the future of environmental governance and sustainable development both within the country and elsewhere."
