Physics of Neutrinos : and Application to Astrophysics
This book provides a survey of the current state of research into the physics of neutrinos. It is presented in a form accessible to non-specialists and graduate students, but will also be useful as a handbook for researchers in this field. The reader finds here a global view of the areas of physics in which neutrinos play important roles, including astrophysics and cosmology. The book is intended to be self-contained: Starting from the standard theory of electroweak interactions, the key notions are explained in detail and the fundamental equations are derived explicitly, so that readers can understand their precise content. Prime emphasis is given to the mass of neutrinos and its implications. The first eight chapters deal mostly with well-established knowledge whilst later chapters probe into research problems
