Handbook of qualitative research techniques and analysis in entrepreneurship
One of the most challenging tasks in the research design process is choosing the most appropriate data collection and analysis technique. This Handbook provides a detailed introduction to five qualitative data collection and analysis techniques pertinent to exploring entrepreneurial phenomena. Techniques for collecting and analysing data are rarely addressed in detail in published articles. In addition, the constant development of new tools and refinement of existing ones has meant that researchers often face a confusing range from which to choose. The experienced and expert group of contributors to this book provide detailed, practical accounts of how to conduct research employing focus groups, critical incident technique, repertory grids, metaphors, the constant comparative method and grounded theory. This Handbook will become the starting point for any research project. Scholars new to entrepreneurship and doctoral students as well as established academics keen to extend their research scope will find this book an invaluable and timely resource
