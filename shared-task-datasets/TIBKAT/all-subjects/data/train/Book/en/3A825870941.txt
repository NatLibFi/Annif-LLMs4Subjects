Bioconjugate techniques
Bioconjugate Techniques, 2e provides highly detailed information on the chemistry, reagent systems, and practical applications for creating labeled or conjugate molecules. It also describes dozens of reactions with details on hundreds of commercially available reagents and the use of these reagents for modifying or crosslinking peptides and proteins, sugars and polysaccharides, nucleic acids and oligonucleotides, lipids, and synthetic polymers. *A one-stop source for proven methods and protocols for synthesizing bioconjugates in the lab, allowing for fast retrieval of tried and tested techniques for synthesizing bioconjugates. *Step-by-step presentation makes the book an ideal source for researchers who are less familiar with the synthesis of bioconjugates. *Includes more than 600 figures that visually describe the complex reactions associated with the synthesis of bioconjugates, giving researchers a better understanding of how the commercially available reagents facilitate the crosslinking of peptides and proteins, sugars and polysaccharides, nucleic acids and oligonucleotides, lipids, and synthetic polymers. *Includes entirely new chapters on the latest areas in the field of bioconjugation as follows: Microparticles and nanoparticles Silane coupling agents Dendrimers and dendrons Chemoselective ligation Quantum dots Lanthanide chelates Cyanine dyes Discrete PEG compounds Buckyballs, fullerenes, and carbon nanotubes Mass tags and isotope tags Bioconjugation in the study of protein interactions
