A glossary of literary and cultural theory
"The Glossary of Literary and Cultural Theory provides researchers and students with an up-to-date guide through the vibrant and changing debates in literary and cultural studies. In a field where meanings are frequently complex and ambiguous, this text is remarkable for its clarity and usefulness. This third edition includes more literary studies in the mix and has 25 brand new entries, as well as many updates to existing entries. These include: World Literature, Affect, Trauma, New Materialisms - including ecocriticism, animal studies and thing theory, 21st Century and future developments in theory - including technology, digital humanities and 'post-theory' and new theorists, such as Agamben and Badiou."--
