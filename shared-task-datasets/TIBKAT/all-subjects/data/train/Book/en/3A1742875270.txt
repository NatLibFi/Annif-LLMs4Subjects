Heterogeneous optoelectronics integration
Numerous efforts are directed at investigating the use of optics at short distances--for example, at the chip-to-chip and board-to-board levels of the interconnection hierarchy. This book provides an overview of the state of the art in heterogeneous integration of electronics, optoelectronics, and micro-optics for short-distance optical interconnections
