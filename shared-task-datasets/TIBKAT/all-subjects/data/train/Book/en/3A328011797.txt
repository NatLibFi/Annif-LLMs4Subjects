Virginia Woolf and the visible world
"In Virgina Woolf and the Visible World, Emily Dalgarno argues that Woolf's subject emerges from a conflict in codes of the visible. She examines how Woolf's writing engages with visible and non-visible realms of experience, and draws on ideas from the diverse fields of psychoanalytic theory, classical Greek tragedy, astronomy, photography and photojournalism. Dalgarno offers analyses of Woolf's individual works, including To the Lighthouse, The Waves and Three Guineas, arguing for the importance of her ongoing interest in translation from the Greek and exploring the theory of the subject that is apparent in her autobiography."--BOOK JACKET
