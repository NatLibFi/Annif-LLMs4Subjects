Mathematical methods in interdisciplinary sciences
"This book examines the interface between mathematics and applied sciences. The editor examines the present and future needs for the interaction between various science and engineering areas. This edited book brings together the cutting-edge research on mathematics, combining various fields of science and engineering. The book begins with an introduction to computing and modeling. Next, computation and modeling trends are covered, along with chapters on structural static and vibration problems, heat conduction and diffusion problems, and fluid dynamics problems. Soft computing and machine intelligence based modeling are also discussed, along with bio medical problems. The book concludes with a chapter on modeling in mining, electrical, electronics, and chemical problems. This book is a reference for students and researchers in various fields of engineering such as computer, mechanical, civil, aerospace, electrical, and chemical, as well as and other sciences such as applied mathematics, physics, chemistry, and life sciences"--
