Signal processing and integrated circuits
This book provides a balanced account of analog, digital and mixed-mode signal processing with applications in telecommunications. Part IPerspective gives an overview of the areas of Systems on a Chip (Soc) and mobile communication which are used to demonstrate the complementary relationship between analog and digital systems. Part II Analog (continuous-time) and Digital Signal Processing contains both fundamental and advanced analysis, and design techniques, of analog and digital systems. This includes analog and digital filter design; fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms; stochastic signa
