Quantum Neural Computation
Quantum Neural Computation is a graduate-level monographic textbook. It presents a comprehensive introduction, both non-technical and technical, into modern quantum neural computation, the science behind the fiction movie Stealth. Classical computing systems perform classical computations (i.e., Boolean operations, such as AND, OR, NOT gates) using devices that can be described classically (e.g., MOSFETs). On the other hand, quantum computing systems perform classical computations using quantum devices (quantum dots), that is devices that can be described only using quantum mechanics. Any information transfer between such computing systems involves a state measurement. This book describes this information transfer at the edge of classical and quantum chaos and turbulence, where mysterious quantum-mechanical linearity meets even more mysterious brain's nonlinear complexity, in order to perform a super-high-speed and error-free computations. This monograph describes a crossroad between quantum field theory, brain science and computational intelligence.
