Handbook of engineering and speciality thermoplastics ; Vol. 2: Water soluble polymers
"This book focuses on common types of polymers belonging to the class of water soluble polymers. It covers a wide range of applications: food, cosmetic, medical, lithography and ink jet printing, agricultural, wastewater cleaning, and oilfield. The text is arranged according to the chemical constitution of polymers and reviews the developments that have taken place in the last decade. Each chapter follows the same template. A brief introduction to the polymer type is given and previous monographs and reviews dealing with the topic are listed for quick reference. The text continues with monomers, polymerization, fabrication techniques, properties, application, as well safety issues. Following this, suppliers and commercial grades are presented. A review of the patent literature is an integral part of the text and this will be helpful for the engineer who is developing new products. Four indices conclude the volume. An extensive tradenames index contains information that is fairly unique; the index of chemicals will be helpful to find certain applications of a particular substance; an index of acronyms and a general index conclude this section"--
