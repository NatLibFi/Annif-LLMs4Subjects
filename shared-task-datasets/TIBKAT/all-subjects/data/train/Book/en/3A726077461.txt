Europan 11! : [in Nederland] ; [de nieuwste Generatie Europan-Architecten]
"Great changes took place during the period in which the eleventh Europan competition was held. If, during the formulation of the assignment, there was still some talk of a "temporary dip" in the economy, during the adjudication - almost two years later - a transformation had evidently taken place and a new era had dawned for the planning of the urban environment. The change can be summarised in the creed "from master plan to strategy". This is clearly manifest in the entries for 'Europan 11', accounts of which are presented in this publication. The various plans for the Dutch sites in Almere, Amsterdam, Capelle aan den IJssel, Deventer, Eindhoven and Leeuwarden are displayed and members of the jury and other prominent experts examine the results of the competition and their significance for the spatial quality of the built environment - now and in the future. This publication includes interviews with the winners in which they disclose their motives and insights."--P. [4] of cover
