Classical and Quantum Dynamics : from Classical Paths to Path Integrals
Graduate students who want to become familiar with advanced computational strategies in classical and quantum dynamics will find here both the fundamentals of a standard course and a detailed treatment of the time-dependent oscillator, Chern-Simons mechanics, the Maslov anomaly and the Berry phase, together with many worked examples throughout the text. This second edition has been enlarged by a new chapter on topological phases in planar electrodynamics and a discussion of the Aharonov-Bohm effect
