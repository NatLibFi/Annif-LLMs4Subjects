Social research methods by example : applications in the modern world
"Social Research Methods by Example sharpens students' understanding of the research process and the essential methods and tools that researchers utilize to perform their work on the cutting edge of the social sciences. The authors break the textbook into two major sections, the first of which provides a foundation for conducting research and forming a research inquiry. The second section guides students through major types of social research, with each chapter's focus set on a different technique. Engaging and illustrative examples from real research are shown throughout to introduce students to key aspects of the process and make the material on methods more relatable and applicable to their own future projects. The new edition features updated examples across the chapters, reflecting new directions within the social sciences and both a diversity of voices and research output in recent years. The authors also expand their chapter overviews on surveys, interviews and focus groups, and multivariate analysis, and weave discussion of validity and ethical considerations more carefully into the fabric of each chapter's focus. Far more than an introduction to the principles of social science research, this book leaves students with the skills and the applied know-how to carry out their own. It is an excellent resource for methods courses across the social sciences"--
