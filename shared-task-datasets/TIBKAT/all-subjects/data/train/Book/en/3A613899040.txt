Entropy and information
" The book ""Entropy and Information"" deals with the thermodynamical concept of entropy and its relationship to information theory. It is successful in explaining the universality of the term ""Entropy"" not only as a physical phenomenon, but reveals its existence also in other domains. E.g., Volkenstein discusses the ""meaning"" of entropy in a biological context and shows how entropy is related to artistic activities. Written by the renowned Russian bio-physicist Mikhail V. Volkenstein, this book on ""Entropy and Information"" surely serves as a timely introduction to understand entropy from a thermodynamic perspective and is definitely an inspiring and thought-provoking book that should be read by every physicist, information-theorist, biologist, and even artist.
