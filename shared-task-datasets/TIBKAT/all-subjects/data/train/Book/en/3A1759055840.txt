Springer handbook of surface science
This handbook delivers an up-to-date, comprehensive and authoritative coverage of the broad field of surface science, encompassing a range of important materials such metals, semiconductors, insulators, ultrathin films and supported nanoobjects. Over 100 experts from all branches of experiment and theory review in 39 chapters all major aspects of solid-state surfaces, from basic principles to applications, including the latest, ground-breaking research results. Beginning with the fundamental background of kinetics and thermodynamics at surfaces, the handbook leads the reader through the basics of crystallographic structures and electronic properties, to the advanced topics at the forefront of current research. These include but are not limited to novel applications in nanoelectronics, nanomechanical devices, plasmonics, carbon films, catalysis, astrochemistry and biology. The handbook is an ideal reference guide and instructional aid for a wide range of physicists, chemists, materials scientists and engineers active throughout academic and industrial research
