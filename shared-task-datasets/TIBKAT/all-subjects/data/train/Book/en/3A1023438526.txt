Economic diplomacy and the geography of international trade
pt. 1. Economic diplomacy and trade uncertainty -- pt. 2. Economic diplomacy and commercial policy -- pt. 3. Economic statecraft : the case of sanctions -- pt. 4. Policy conclusions and further research
The book presents an overview of the general aspects of trade uncertainty, a central element in the analysis of economic diplomacy, illustrating that some instruments, such as sanctions (both positive and negative), increase trade uncertainty, whilst others--multilateral trade policy, for instance--aim to reduce this uncertainty. Commercial policy and bilateral economic diplomacy are explored, and economic sanctions analysed. An extensive review of the literature and empirical investigations of 161 sanctions and the commercial relationships of 37 countries provide topical and empirical perspectives on how international diplomacy may both be a cost and a benefit of the key drivers of productivity growth. Finally, policy conclusions are drawn, and a future research agenda presented
