This volume covers new and informative topics including how to use discourse to: Establish classroom activity and interaction; Build and assess scientific content knowledge; Organize and evaluate scientific narrative; Enact scientific practices; Coordinate the use of multimodal representations. Building on more than 10 years of research on classroom discourse, Discourse Strategies for Science Teaching and Learning is an ideal text for science teacher educators, preservice science teachers, scholars, and researchers"--
