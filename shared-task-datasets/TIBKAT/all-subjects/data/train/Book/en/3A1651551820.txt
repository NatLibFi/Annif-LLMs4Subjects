Biotreatment of industrial effluents
With increasing government regulation of pollution, as well as willingness to levy punitive fines for transgressions, treatment of industrial waste is a important subject. This book is a single source of information on treatment procedures using biochemical means for all types of solid, liquid and gaseous contaminants generated by various chemical and allied industries. This book is intended for practicing environmental engineers and technologists from any industry as well as researchers and professors. The topics covered include the treatment of gaseous, liquid and solid waste from a large number of chemical and allied industries that include dye stuff, chemical, alcohol, food processing, pesticide, pharmaceuticals, paint etc. Information on aerobic and anaerobic reactors and modeling and simulation of waste treatment systems are also discussed. * Compares chemical and biochemical means of industrial waste treatment * Provides details of technology (i.e. reactors, operating conditions etc) with regard to the biochemistry aspects. * Can be used as a teaching aid for graduate courses and a reference material by practicing environmental scientists and engineers. * Researchers can extract synergy between treatment procedures and various effluents
