Virtual and augmented reality for automobile industry: innovation vision and applications
This book presents the augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) automotive applications. It unites automobile with a leading technology i.e. augmented and virtual reality and uses the advantages of the latter to solve the problems faced by the former. The book highlights the reasons for the growing abundance and complexity in this sector. Virtual and augmented reality presents a powerful engineering tool that finds application in various engineering fields. It brings new possibilities that result is increasing of productivity and reliability of production, quality of products and processes. The book further illustrates the possible challenges in its applications and suggests ways to overcome them. The book includes nine chapters focusing on automobile collision avoidance, self-driving cars, autonomous vehicles, navigation systems, and many more applications.
Automotive Collision Avoidance System: A Review -- Autonomous vehicle assisted by heads up display (HUD) with augmented reality based on Machine learning techniques -- Optimal Stacked Sparse Autoencoder based Traffic Flow Prediction in Intelligent Transportation Systems -- Hand Gesture Recognition for Real-Time Game Play using Background Elimination and Deep Convolution Neural Network.
