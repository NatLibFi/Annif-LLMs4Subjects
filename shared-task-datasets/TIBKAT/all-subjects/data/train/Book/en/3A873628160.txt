Take one building : interdisciplinary research perspectives of the Seattle Central Library
This book evaluates how we perceive buildings in different ways depending upon our academic and professional background. With reference to the Seattle Central Library, it illustrates a range of different methods available through its application. By seeing such a variety of different methods applied to one setting, it allows the opportunity for researchers to understand how tools can highlight various aspects of a building and how those different methods can augment, or complement each other. Unique to this book are contributions from internationally renowned academics from fields including architecture, ethnography, architectural criticism, phenomenology, sociology, environmental psychology and cognitive science, all of which are united by a single, real-world application, the Seattle Central Library. This book will be of interest to architects and students of architecture as well as disciplines such as ethnography, sociology, environmental psychology, and cognitive science that have an interest in applying research methods to the built environment
