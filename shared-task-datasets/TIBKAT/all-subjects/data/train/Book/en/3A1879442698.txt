The economics of pollution havens
A pollution haven may arise if environmental stringency differs between countries, when capital is mobile, and when trade rules allow firms to relocate and still sell their products to the same customers. This cohesive volume analyzes how country characteristics determine environmental rules, how those rules affect production costs, trade, and investment flows, how those flows affect pollution, prices, and incomes, and finally how all of these last considerations feed back into environmental rules. The sixteen papers collected here represent the most recent and significant advancements of knowledge on the subject. The contributors, all well-known scholars in the area, investigate how polluter location decisions respond to pollution policies, how local environmental rules respond to those location decisions, and how trade liberalization affects the incentives of governments to regulate dirty industries. The volume begins with a comprehensive overview by M. Scott Taylor and goes on to explore how the usual effects of pollution havens can be reversed. Also covered are the ways in which managed trade and trade liberalization, the regulation of multinationals, political stability and emissions controls impact pollution havens. Written for a multidisciplinary audience, The Economics of Pollution Havens will be of interest to those working in the areas of economics, international trade, political science, public policy, and environmental studies
