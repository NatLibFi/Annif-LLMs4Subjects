African agriculture : the critical choices
"In this volume African scholars examine the current grave agricultural situation in many parts of Africa. Starting from the proposition that agriculture must be central in any African development strategy, the authors assess the diverse experiments and experiences of Algeria, Ethiopia, the Ivory Coast, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania and Tunisia and seek pointers for the future. Why have some countries' agricultural policies been mote successful than others? What should be the relationship between food production and export-oriented agriculture? What sort of industrialization should be pursued? How can industry best contribute to agriculture without producing a yet greater exodus from the land? What kind of planning has been effective and where? They argue that greater African autonomy from the international system--politically, economically, technologically and financially--is vital to the achievement of autocentred development. A new development strategy of this kind would be geared primarily to the needs of the people in each country rather than to the world's demand for African raw materials. To be realized in practice this needs greater democratization of society internally, along with co-operation and unity among African states."--Publisher description
