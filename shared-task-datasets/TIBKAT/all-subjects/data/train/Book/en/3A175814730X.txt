American sociology and Holocaust studies : the alleged silence and the creation of the sociological delay
Sociological thinking about the Holocaust in the postwar years, 1945-1960s -- The destruction of the Jews in a sociological perspective during the 1970s -- Toward a sociology of genocide, 1980-1989 -- The problem of the Holocaust after 1989.
Filled with new elements that challenge common scholarly theses, this book acquaints the reader with the "Jewish problem" of sociology and provides what this academic discipline urgently needs: a one-volume history of the Sociology of the Holocaust. The story of why and how sociologists as well as the schools of sociological thought came to confront the Holocaust has never been entirely told. The volume offers original insights on the nature of American sociology with implications for the post-Holocaust sociology development
