Cognitive Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia : A Session-by-Session Guide
Cognitive behavior therapy which has been adapted to treat so many problems, has also brought data-driven and data-yielding treatment to insomnia. Focusing on this evidence-based modality, Cognitive Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia is a much-needed treatment manual that provides clinicians with the why's and how's of this approach in concise and practical terms. This book, which is written as a reader-friendly guide, is intended for clinical trainees, non-insomnia sleep specialists, and for expert CBT clinicians from outside the sleep medicine field who wish to begin the process of learning to provide empirically validated CBT-I. The Book is organized into seven parts: definition of insomnia, review of the conceptual, framework for treatment, overview of the components of therapy, session-by-session guide, dialogues, assessment and eligibility for CBT-I, and sample documentation. The organizing principles for the guide can best be expressed as two seemingly simple questions: 'Who is appropriate for CBT-I?' 'What does one need to know to set up a Behavioral Sleep Medicine service?' The guide provides all that one needs to confidently answer these questions.
