Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are opening up exciting new applications in the area of lighting and displays. OLEDs are self emissive and by careful materials and device design can generate colours across the visible spectrum. Together with simple monolithic fabrication on a range of different substrates, these diverse material properties give OLEDs key advantages over existing display and lighting technology. This important book summarises key research on materials, engineering and the range of applications of these versatile materials. Part one covers materials for OLEDs. Chapt
