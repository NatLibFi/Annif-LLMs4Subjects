Rooftop garden
'Rooftop Garden' is the first comprehensive look at green rooftops around the world. Rooftop spaces are a unique and exciting opportunity to enhance urban living. The large-scale projects in 'Rooftop Garden' span the globe and have a variety of aesthetic and utilitarian functions. Design considerations include the weight of materials, site dimensions, climate, seasonality of foliage, irrigation systems, insulation, day and night lighting conditions, and the spectrum of changing colors during the seasons. Elevated green roofs provide better air quality and allow for amazing panoramic views of the city. --
