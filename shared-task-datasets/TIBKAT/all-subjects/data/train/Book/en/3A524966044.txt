Computational Mechanics of Composite Materials : Sensitivity, Randomness and Multiscale Behaviour
Composite materials play a vital role in modern engineering from aerospace to nuclear devices. Computational mechanics endeavours to provide precise numerical models of composites. More recently, it has been necessary to take account of the stochastic nature of their behaviour indicated by experiment. The approach of Computational Mechanics of Composite Materials lays stress on the advantages of combining theoretical advancements in applied mathematics and mechanics with the probabilistic approach to experimental data in meeting the practical needs of engineers. Features: Programs for the probabilistic homogenisation of composite structures with finite numbers of components allow composites to be treated as homogeneous materials with simpler behaviours. Allows treatment of defects in the interfaces within heterogeneous materials and those arising in composite objects as a whole by stochastic modelling. Provides new models for the reliability of composite structures. Propounds novel numerical algorithms for more effective Monte-Carlo simulation. Computational Mechanics of Composite Materials will be of interest to academic and practising civil, mechanical, electronic and aerospatial engineers, to materials scientists and to applied mathematicians requiring accurate and usable models of the behaviour of composite materials.
