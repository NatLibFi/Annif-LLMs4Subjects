Xylem : methods and protocols
This second edition provides detailed techniques used for the study and characterization of the plant vascular system, with a central focus on the xylem tissue. Chapters are organized in three main sections covering; analysis of xylem development, xylem characterization though imaging techniques, and analysis of the xylem composition. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and key tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Authoritative and cutting-edge, Xylem: Methods and Protocols, Second Edition aims to be a useful and practical guide to new researchers and experts looking to expand their knowledge. .
