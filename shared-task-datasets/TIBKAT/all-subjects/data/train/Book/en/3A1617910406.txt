Instabilities of flows and transition to turbulence
"This book covers material ranging from classical hydrodynamic instability to contemporary research areas, including bluff body flow instability and mixed convection flows. It also examines applications in aerospace and other branches of engineering such as fluid mechanics. The author addresses classical material as well as new perspectives and presents comprehensive coverage of receptivity to complement the instability material. This book presents a concise, up-to-date treatment of theory and applications of viscous flow instability, providing both current knowledge and techniques"--
