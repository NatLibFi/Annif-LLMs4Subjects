Children and everyday life in the Roman and late antique world
A New Paradigm for the Social History of Childhood and Children in Antiquity / Christian Laes and Ville Vuolanto -- Agency, Experience, and the Children in the Past : the Case of Roman Childhood / Ville Vuolanto -- Setting the Scene : Experiences and Environments -- What Did the Roman Children Actually Do? -- Religious Practices and Sacred Spaces -- A Cruel World : Accidents, Disability and Death
"Children and Everyday Life in the Roman and Late Antique World explores what it meant to be a child in the Roman world--what were children's concerns, interests and beliefs--and whether we can find traces of children's own cultures. By combining different theoretical approaches and source materials, the contributors explore the environments in which children lived, their experience of everyday life, and what the limits were for their agency. The volume brings together scholars of archaeology and material culture, classicists, ancient historians, theologians, and scholars of early Christianity and Judaism, all of whom have long been involved in the study of the social and cultural history of children"--Provided by publisher
