Introduction to the Theory of Lie Groups
This textbook covers the general theory of Lie groups. By first considering the case of linear groups (following von Neumann's method) before proceeding to the general case, the reader is naturally introduced to Lie theory. Written by a master of the subject and influential member of the Bourbaki group, the French edition of this textbook has been used by several generations of students. This translation preserves the distinctive style and lively exposition of the original. Requiring only basics of topology and algebra, this book offers an engaging introduction to Lie groups for graduate students and a valuable resource for researchers
Topological Groups -- Simply Connected Spaces and Groups -- Analytic Properties of Linear Groups -- Manifolds and Lie Group -- The Lie Algebra of a Lie Group -- The Exponential Map for Lie Groups
