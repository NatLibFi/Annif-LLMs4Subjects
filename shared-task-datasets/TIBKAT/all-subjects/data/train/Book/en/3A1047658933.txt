Principles of space-time-matter : cosmology, particles and waves in five dimensions
Standard general relativity -- Space-time-matter theory -- Cosmology in 5D -- Astrophysics in 5D -- The solitons -- Electromagnetism in 5D -- Canonical space -- Particles, waves and the vacuum -- The fifth dimension
"This book is a summing up of the prospects for unification between relativity and particle physics based on the extension of Einstein's theory of General Relativity to five dimensions. This subject was first established by Paul Wesson in his previous best-seller, Space-Time-Matter, and discussed from a different perspective in Five-Dimensional Physics, both published by World Scientific in 1999 and 2006 respectively. This third book brings the field up to date and details many new developments and connections to particle theory and wave mechanics in particular. It was in largely finished form at the time of Paul Wesson's untimely death in 2015, and has been completed and expanded by his former student and longtime collaborator, James Overduin"--
