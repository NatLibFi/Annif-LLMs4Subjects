The Cambridge edition of the works of Joseph Conrad / general editors J.H. Stape and Allan H. Simmons (St. Mary's University, Twickenham, London): Victory : an island tale
"The present volume contains critical texts of Conrad's novel Victory, An Island Tale and of its two prefaces. The Cambridge text of the novel, apart from the coda to the final chapter, is based on the first revised typescript, held in the Free Library of Philadelphia. The coda to the final chapter, present fragmentarily in the Philadelphia typescript, has the manuscript as its copy-text. The copy-texts are emended to incorporate authorial revisions drawn from earlier and later authoritative documents as well as editorial emendations to correct errors. The copy-text of the 'Note to the First Edition' is the manuscript, preserved at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin, and that for the 'Author's Note' is the extant revised typescript held in a private collection"--
"Published in 1915, Victory: An Island Tale holds a special place in Conrad's later writings as a bold experiment in genre. The novel variously draws upon realism, allegory and melodrama to explore large themes: commitment and solidarity, the individual's relationship to society and the power of love. The Introduction situates the novel in Conrad's career and traces its sources and contemporary reception. The essay on the text and the apparatus lay out the history of the work's composition and publication, and detail the extensive interventions by Conrad's typists, compositors and editors. Also included are notes explaining literary and historical references, a glossary of nautical terms, illustrations including pictures of early drafts, and appendixes. Established through modern textual scholarship, this edition of Victory presents the novel in a form more authoritative than any so far printed, and restores a text that has circulated in highly defective forms since its original publication"--
