Yeast genetics : methods and protocols
"Yeast Genetics: Methods and Protocols is a collection of methods to best study and manipulate Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a truly genetic powerhouse. The simple nature of a single cell eukaryotic organism, the relative ease of manipulating its genome, and the ability to interchangeably exist in both haploid and diploid states have always made it an attractive model organism. Genes can be deleted, mutated, engineered, and tagged at will. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has played a major role in the elucidation of multiple conserved cellular processes including MAP kinase signaling, splicing, transcription, and many others. Written in the successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible protocols, and notes on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Authoritative and easily accessible, Yeast Genetics: Methods and Protocols will provide a balanced blend of classic and more modern genetic methods relevant to a wide range of research areas and should be widely used as a reference in yeast labs"--
