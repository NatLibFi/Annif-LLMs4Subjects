Prospects for CO2 Capture and Storage
Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technologies can drastically reduce future CO2 emissions.  This IEA study introduces a scenario analysis of the future role of CCS and presents the main uncertainties that surround a CCS policy strategy.  It provides detailed estimates of the likely CO2 reductions available from CCS under a variety of technological and economic scenarios and suggests policies designed to achieve significant reduction of emissions.
