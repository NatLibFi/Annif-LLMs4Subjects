Diffusion in Hydrogen Storage Alloys
This volume presents a summary of relevant diffusion data. Enormous amount of research has been expended on the option of storing the hydrogen in solid metal alloys. The loading of metals with hydrogen, and its extraction, depends upon several processes. It is found that the slowest, and therefore the rate-determining process is hydrogen diffusion in the solid. Keywords: Chromium-Based Alloys, Magnesium-Based Alloys, Manganese-Based Alloys, Nickel-Based Alloys, Titanium-Based Alloys, Vanadium-Based Alloys, Zirconium-Based Alloys Fisher summarizes diffusion data relevant to storing hydrogen in metal to keep it from exploding during storage, transport or use as a fuel. The ability of certain meals to occlude hydrogen in a reversible manner—thus making the storage of the gas as practical as the storage of electrical energy by conventional batteries—was discovered in laboratories during the 19th century, he says, but not until 1967 did research begin to transform that phenomena into practical, large-scale storage for hydrogen as a fuel. He covers alloys based on chromium, magnesium, manganese, nickel, titanium, vanadium, and zirconium.  — Engineering— Materials science— Metals
