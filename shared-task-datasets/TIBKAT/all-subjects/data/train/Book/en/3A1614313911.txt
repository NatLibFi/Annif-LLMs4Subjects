Location, transport and land use : modelling spatial-temporal information; with ... 113 tables
This book identifies the underlying principles that govern siting, community dvelopment, and product/service delivery. Included are step-by-step procedures to perform: site location, land-use planning, location-routing, competitive allocation of products/services & spatial forecasting. The treatment goes well beyond the state-of-the-art, suggesting emerging techniques that are able to adress the following sample problems: emergency- response to natural & manmade hazards, environmental planning, infrastructure management, intelligent transportation systems, real-estate development, remote-sensing, supply-chain management and urban land-use plans. Mindful of the cross-disciplinary nature of today's practice, this book equips professionals and researchers with the necessary techniques and software to work effectively with other members of the team from different background. The text is supplemented by many examples, case studies and solutions
