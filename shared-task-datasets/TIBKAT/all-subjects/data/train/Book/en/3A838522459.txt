Listening : Bohlin Cywinski Jackson : houses 2009-2015
In the tradition of the tremendously successful Arcadian Architecture, this lavishly photographed book is an opulently produced showcase of the most recent residential work of Bohlin Cywinski Jackson, one of today's most acclaimed architectural firms. This handsome volume takes up where the celebrated books Arcadian Architecture and Bohlin, Cywinski, Jackson: The Nature of Circumstance left off, presenting the firm's most recent work since 2010--houses designed in a profoundly beautiful and humane architectural idiom that celebrates a sense of place, context, ecological sensitivity and an innovative use of materials.
