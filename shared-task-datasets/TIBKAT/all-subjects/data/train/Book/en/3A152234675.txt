Yanomami warfare : a political history
"Re-evaluation of Yanomamo warfare defends a material motivation hypothesis grounded in an etic behavioral approach. Elaborating a method previously applied to the study of Pacific Northwest warfare patterns, author develops a formal analytic model and applies it to histories of Yanomamo conflicts, political relations among villages, and warfare strategies. Effects of Western contact - especially the introduction of manufactured goods - on warfare patterns are discussed"--Handbook of Latin American Studies, v. 57
