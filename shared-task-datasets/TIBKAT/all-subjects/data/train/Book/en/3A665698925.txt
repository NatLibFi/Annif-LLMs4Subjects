Die Deutsche Indien-Expedition 1955 - 1958 : unter Leitung von Gustav Adolf Baron von Maydell
"The German India-Expedition 1955-58, led and managed by Gustav Adolf Baron von Maydell, was probably the last 'universal' collection expedition which started from Hamburg, namedly by order of the Zoological Institute and Museum.  Tha main focus of the expedition lay on the fields of zoology, botany and ethnology.  baron von Maydell collected scientific material for quite a number of further museums, instiutes and scientists within and outside Hamburg and in Germany, especially for the Zoological Garden, Wupppertal, the Zoological Research Institute and Museum Alexander Koenig, Bonn, the Linden-Museum, Stuttgart, and the Overseas Museum, Bremen, and in India for the Zoological Survey of India, Calcutta. The expedition didn't only want to collect animals, plants and ethnological items but it had planned to work on ecological, bio-geographical and sociological questions. The aim which v. Maydell had taken up was to visit marginal habitats, take samples, and analyze them ecologically and bio-geographically."--P. [226]
