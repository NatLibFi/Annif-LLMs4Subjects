2D monoelemental materials (Xenes) and related technologies : beyond graphene
"This book describes the structure, properties, and applications of monoelemental 2D materials (Xenes) by classification and section. The first section covers the structure and classification of single-element 2D materials, according to the different main groups of monoelemental materials of different components of the properties and applications of detailed description. The second discusses the structure, properties, and applications of advanced 2D Xenes materials. Aimed at researchers and advanced students in materials science and engineering, this book offers a broad view of current knowledge in the emerging and promising field of 2D monoelemental materials"--
