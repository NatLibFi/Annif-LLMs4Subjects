Harmonic analysis and applications
This edited volume presents state-of-the-art developments in various areas in which Harmonic Analysis is applied. Contributions cover a variety of different topics and problems treated such as structure and optimization in computational harmonic analysis, sampling and approximation in shift invariant subspaces of L2(ℝ), optimal rank one matrix decomposition, the Riemann Hypothesis, large sets avoiding rough patterns, Hardy Littlewood series, Navier–Stokes equations, sleep dynamics exploration and automatic annotation by combining modern harmonic analysis tools, harmonic functions in slabs and half-spaces, Andoni –Krauthgamer –Razenshteyn characterization of sketchable norms fails for sketchable metrics, random matrix theory, multiplicative completion of redundant systems in Hilbert and Banach function spaces. Efforts have been made to ensure that the content of the book constitutes a valuable resource for graduate students as well as senior researchers working on Harmonic Analysis and its various interconnections with related areas.
