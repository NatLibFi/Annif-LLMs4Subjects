Microwave radiometer systems : design and analysis
Annotation Microwave radiometers are tools used for passive microwave remote sensing--"a technological process that allows for the measurement of important parameters that help professionals understand and predict climate and weather patterns. Written by leading experts in industry and academia, this authoritative resource offers practitioners a solid understanding of radiometer systems and explains how to design a system based on given specifications, taking into account both technical aspects and geophysical realities. This second edition has been thoroughly updated to reflect the numerous advances that have been made in the field since the original edition was published in 1989. New material covered includes two of today's hottest microwave radiometry topics--"polarimetric measurements and aperture synthesis
