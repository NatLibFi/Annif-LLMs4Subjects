Postcontinental realism : ontology and epistemology for the twenty-first century
Ist die Philosophie noch lebendig? Gibt es Alternativen zum einseitigen postmodernen Denken? Ist es sinnvoll, uralte Fragen nach der Existenz der Wirklichkeit und der Möglichkeit von Wissen, nach Sein (Ontologie) und Wissen (Epistemologie) zu stellen? Ernesto Castro beantwortet diese und viele andere Fragen, die die Philosophie heute beschäftigen, mit einem klaren »Ja.Inhalts&uuml;bersichtForeword by José Luis VillacañasPreface§ 1.

Is philosophy still alive? Are there any alternatives to univocal postmodernist thought? Is there any point in asking age-old questions about the existence of reality and the possibility of knowledge, about being (ontology) and knowing (epistemology)? In this book, Ernesto Castro issues a resounding yes to these and many other questions plaguing philosophy today. »Postcontinental realism” is the term coined by Castro to designate a group of realist thinkers who have overcome contemporary philosophy's time-honored division between the analytic tradition (concerned with epistemological and scientific questions) and the continental tradition (concerned with artistic and ontological questions). Written in a perfectly plain style that is accessible to readers from all walks of life, including those without a previous academic education, the author introduces the readers to the works and ideas of important, living philosophers such as Quentin Meillassoux, Ray Brassier, Graham Harman, Iain Hamilton Grant, Maurizio Ferraris, or Markus Gabriel.
