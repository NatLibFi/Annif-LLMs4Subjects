Electroweak Precision Tests at LEP
This review gives a brief discussion of the structure of the Standard Model and its quantum corrections. The predictions for the vector boson masses, the neutrino scattering cross-sections and the Z0 resonance observables are presented. The influence of virtual new physics effects on the observables is discussed with the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model taken as an example. Experimental measurements of electroweak observables are described with reference to studies performed at the e+e- collider LEP at energies close to the Z0 peak. The theoretical predictions are compared with experimental data and their implications for the Standard Model are discussed
