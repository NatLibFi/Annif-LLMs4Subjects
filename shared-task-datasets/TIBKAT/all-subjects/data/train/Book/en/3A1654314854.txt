Irresistible Apps : Motivational Design Patterns for Apps, Games, and Web-based Communities
When you create an app, a website, or a game, how do you get users, and perhaps more importantly, how do you keep them? Irresistible Apps explains exactly how to do this using a library of 27 motivational design patterns and real-world examples of how they work. As a developers, you need to retain users in the new economy of advertisements, subscriptions, and in-app purchases, but you may be difficult to understand exactly how to do this. For example, what is so appealing about Angry Birds? Why do people get addicted to games like World of Warcraft? What makes Amazon users keep buying from Amazon? Why do so many people love Khan Academy? Why do people care about Reddit karma? The answers are found in Gameful patterns, Social patterns, Interface patterns, and Information patterns. Not only will you learn about these patterns, you'll also learn why they work using psychological theories of intrinsic motivation, behavioral psychology, and behavioral economics. Using this knowledge, good and bad implementations of the patterns are shown so practitioners can use the patterns effectively and avoid pitfalls along the way
