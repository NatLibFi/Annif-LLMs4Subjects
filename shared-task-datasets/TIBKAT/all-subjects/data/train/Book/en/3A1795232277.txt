Audience Participation in Classical Contemporary Music
Professional musicians who perform in hospitals, retirement homes, and prisons, creatively stimulated by the residents; babies crawling over exercise mats, enjoying classical music together with their parents; concert-goers who take their seats between the musicians in order to experience music with all their senses up close - the opportunities to make and experience music are almost unlimited. Various actors in the field of classical music have taken this as a chance to develop a wide range of new artistic and educational practices over the last two decades, aiming to facilitate in-depth aesthetic experiences, to bond with new audiences, and to encourage active cultural participation.
