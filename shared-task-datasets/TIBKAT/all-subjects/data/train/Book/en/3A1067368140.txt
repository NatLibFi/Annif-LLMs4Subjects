Mathematical Models of Higher Orders : Shells in Temperature Fields
This book offers a valuable methodological approach to the state-of-the-art of the classical plate/shell mathematical models, exemplifying the vast range of mathematical models of nonlinear dynamics and statics of continuous mechanical structural members. The main objective highlights the need for further study of the classical problem of shell dynamics consisting of mathematical modeling, derivation of nonlinear PDEs, and of finding their solutions based on the development of new and effective numerical techniques. The book is designed for a broad readership of graduate students in mechanical and civil engineering, applied mathematics, and physics, as well as to researchers and professionals interested in a rigorous and comprehensive study of modeling non-linear phenomena governed by PDEs
