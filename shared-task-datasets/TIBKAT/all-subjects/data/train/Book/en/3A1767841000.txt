Company laws of the EU : a handbook
The book aims to fill a gap in the process of confrontation between the disciplines, case laws and literatures of the central EU member states and in particular to address the difficulty of finding sources for scholars and professionals explaining the rules and guidelines of corporate law in the different European states. The main features of the discipline of Corporate Law in Germany, the UK, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Romania and the Netherlands is illustrated. The objective of the work is not only to describe the main features of the discipline, but especially to highlight the most important critical profiles, and particularly those under the scrutiny of case law and most studied (as problematic) by the doctrine.
