Energy-efficient distributed computing systems
"The energy consumption issue in distributed computing systems raises various monetary, environmental and system performance concerns. Electricity consumption in the US doubled from 2000 to 2005.  From a financial and environmental standpoint, reducing the consumption of electricity is important, yet these reforms must not lead to performance degradation of the computing systems.  These contradicting constraints create a suite of complex problems that need to be resolved in order to lead to 'greener' distributed computing systems.  This book brings together a group of outstanding researchers that investigate the different facets of green and energy efficient distributed computing.Key features:  One of the first books of its kind   Features latest research findings on emerging topics by well-known scientists   Valuable research for grad students, postdocs, and researchers   Research will greatly feed into other technologies and application domains   "--
