Wavelet applications in engineering electromagnetics
Written from an engineering perspective, this unique resource describes the practical application of wavelets to the solution of electromagnetic field problems and in signal analysis with an even-handed treatment of the pros and cons. A key feature of this book is that the wavelet concepts have been described from the filter theory point of view that is familiar to researchers with an electrical engineering background. The book shows you how to design novel algorithms that enable you to solve electrically, large electromagnetic field problems using modest computational resources. It also provi
