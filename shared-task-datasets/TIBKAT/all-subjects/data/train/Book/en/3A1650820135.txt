Pediatric Neuropathology : A Text-Atlas
Neuropathology is the foundation for understanding developmental neuroscience, pediatric neurology, and neurosurgery, but until now a comprehensive volume covering all aspects of pediatric neuropathology was not available. This atlas is thus a unique, comprehensive reference providing the fundamentals of developmental brain disorders of the nervous system that can affect fetuses, infants and young children, as well as the essentials of diagnosis in developmental brain pathology and neuroimaging. With an emphasis on the characteristic morphology and a concise summary of clinical features, pathogenesis, and genetics, the generously illustrated atlas presents more than 100 disorders, including the common diseases of the peripheral nervous system as well as genetically determined metabolic and storage diseases. This compilation is a valuable resource for pathologists, pediatric neurologists and neurosurgeons, geneticists, neonatologists, radiologists, and pediatricians.
