Group theory for physicists
"This textbook explains the fundamental concepts and techniques of group theory by making use of language familiar to physicists. Calculation methods in the context of physics are emphasized. New materials drawn from the teaching and research experience of the author are included. The generalized Gel'fand's method is presented to calculate the matrices of irreducible representations of the simple Lie algebra and its Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. This book is for graduate students and young researchers in physics, especially theoretical physics. It is also for graduate students in theoretical chemistry."--
