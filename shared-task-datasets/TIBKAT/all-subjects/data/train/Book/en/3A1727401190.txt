"Progressive Studio Pedagogy provides guidance to educators in all design fields by questioning processes and assumptions about teaching and learning, utilising examples from architecture, landscape architecture, and interior design. Through a series of case studies, this book presents innovative approaches to learning and teaching in design studio. Traditionally, design education is perceived to be a process for acquiring skills and a site for developing creative potential. However, contemporary higher education is embracing issues that include widening participation, managing transition, fostering independent learning and graduate employability. This book situates design learning within this varied context, and offers insights into how to confront the challenge of facilitating learning through divergent contexts by presenting projects and courses that use a range of approaches that require students to think and act critically and evaluatively. Progressive Studio Pedagogy presents new practices that readers can adapt into their own creative education, making it an ideal read for those interested in teaching design"--
