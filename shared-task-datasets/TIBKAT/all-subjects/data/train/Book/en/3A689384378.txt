Social media and religious change
Amongst books on religion and the internet, this collection is distinctive in addressing the interaction between social and mass media in the construction of contemporary religion and spirituality, and public understandings of them. Topics discussed include the implications of social media for religious authority, the implications of mediatisation for community relations, and the challenges of social media for traditionally bounded religious communities.
