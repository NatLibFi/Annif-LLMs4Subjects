Museum De Lakenhal, a portrait : Happel Cornelisse Verhoeven, Julian Harrap Architects
Since its reopening, 380 years to the day from its original completion, Museum de Lakenhal in Leiden has been hailed as a landmark project, both for its radical and meticulous approach to weaving 21st century architecture into a centuries old fabric, as well as for its fully integrated vision of what a present day museum experience can be. Young Dutch architecture bureau Happel Cornelisse Verhoeven Architects teamed up with internationally renowned restauration specialists Julian Harrap Architects to deliver a fully reinvented, high-performing and future oriented museum that nevertheless honours history. They crafted a fourfold miracle: the restoration of the 17th-century Laecken-Halle, the creation of space within the building for first-rate visitor facilities, the addition of a new exhibition wing, and the behind-the-scenes provision of necessary logistics, building services and staff workspace. This book documents the result, with stunning images by photographer Karin Borghouts and a thoughtful essay by architecture critic Koen van Synghel and museum director Meta Knol. Meticulously designed and with finely crafted plans and illustrations, this book is an inspiration for any aspiring architect and a pleasure for every museum enthusiast
