Neurology Oral Boards Review : A Concise and Systematic Approach to Clinical Practice
For neurologists, especially those who have just graduated and are preparing for certification, Ubogu (medicine, Case Western Reserve University) offers a review text of important topics and test-taking methods for passing the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology Part II Oral Examination. Ubogu gives an overview of the exam, then devotes the majority of the book to case studies similar to ones in the exam involving emergencies and general neurology. Some of the studies include epilepsy, spinal cord and infectious diseases, movement and toxic-metabolic disorders, behavioral neurology, neuromuscular disorders, neuroimmunology, sleep disorders, and pediatric neurology. The book contains a brief bibliography.
