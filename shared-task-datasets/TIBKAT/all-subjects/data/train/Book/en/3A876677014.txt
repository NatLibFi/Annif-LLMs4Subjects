Understanding the nervous system : an engineering perspective
"Providing a fascinating alternative to the unwieldy life science sources, this book describes how the nervous system (including the brain) communicates with, sends signals to, and receives input from the sensory organs. Starting with the basic principles and components of the nervous system with sensory receptors, neurons and dendrites, and the skeletal muscle circuits the authors unfold the mystery of this communication with simple, elegant mathematical formulas to enhance your understanding of how the nervous system functions in complicated auditory and visual systems, and the brain. Includes extensive references at the end of each chapter!" Sponsored by: IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society
