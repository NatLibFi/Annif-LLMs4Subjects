Stochastic models in queueing theory
This is a graduate level textbook that covers the fundamental topics in queuing theory. The book has a broad coverage of methods to calculate important probabilities, and gives attention to proving the general theorems. It includes many recent topics, such as server-vacation models, diffusion approximations and optimal operating policies, and more about bulk-arrival and bull-service models than other general texts. * Current, clear and comprehensive coverage * A wealth of interesting and relevant examples and exercises to reinforce concepts * Reference lists provided after each chapter for further investigation
