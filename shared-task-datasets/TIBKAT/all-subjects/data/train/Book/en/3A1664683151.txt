Introduction to quantum field theory
"This book is meant as a two-semester course in quantum field theory, skipping some material that can be studied independently. The chapters with asterisk I have not taught in my class, and can be skipped in a first reading, or when teaching the material. The book and the corresponding course is supposed to follow a course in classical field theory, however, I have tried to make the book self-contained. That means that only a thorough knowledge of classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and electromagnetism is really needed, though it is preferrable to have firrst classical field theory. I will only review classical field theory, without going in great detail"--
