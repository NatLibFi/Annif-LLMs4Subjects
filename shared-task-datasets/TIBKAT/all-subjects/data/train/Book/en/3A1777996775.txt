This updated and expanded edition explores key methodologies to study the fascinating phenomenon of how plants readjust their growth toward gravity. In addition to the protocols delivering broad applications for gaining insight into other plant physiological processes, this new volume also focuses on techniques involving plants in space or the use of microgravity analogs to study plant biological phenomenon. Written for the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Authoritative and cutting-edge, Plant Gravitropism: Methods and Protocols, Second Edition serves as an ideal guide for researchers studying the cellular, molecular, and biochemical networks that plants use to translate environmental stimuli into a growth response.
