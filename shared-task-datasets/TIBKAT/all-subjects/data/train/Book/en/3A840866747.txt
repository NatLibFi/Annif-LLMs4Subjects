Architekturphotographien
The work of Klaus Kinold, born 1939 in Essen, Germany is part of a tradition of architectural photography.It was self-evident for him to explore the period whose very name included the term objectivity - the New Objectivity. The accuracy of observation, the precision in detail, the translation of three-dimensional objects into a convincingly construed image are among his virtues. Predominant in his work, we find photographs of buildings by architects whom he could expect to have such qualities: classic Modernists like Walter Gropius, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and contemporaries like Alvar Aalto, Hans DÃ¶llgast, Herman Hertzberger, Louis I. Kahn, Karljosef Schattner, Rudolf Schwarz, Alvaro Siza
