An injection mold is the heart of any plastics molding workcell. Understanding the principles of an injection mold design and its importance to a successful plastic part is fundamental to the success of the product. This book helps guide the designer, engineer, project manager, and production manager in making sure that the injection mold to be designed will work as intended. This book will take the reader through the process of conceptualizing and designing an injection mold that will produce the desired plastic part. Since it all starts with the plastic part, the book will first focus on key features and details of the plastic part which are necessary for good mold design. The design of the main components of an injection mold will be discussed and good design practices will be shared. Finally the process of testing and gaining customer acceptance of the mold for production will be detailed. A comprehensive appendix and detailed drawings will provide the required detail for completing a mold design.
