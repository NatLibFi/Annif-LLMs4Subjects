"This insightful book offers a comprehensive analysis of how macroeconomics can steer development and reduce poverty. It untangles how developing countries can apply effective economic policies in spite of the challenges they face. With an aim to design a macroeconomic strategy which would provide a stable and long-term growth plan, Basil Oberholzer explores the multiple constraints which prevent developing countries from reducing poverty. The author reveals how countries' scope of action is strongly limited by international economic dynamics, including current account imbalances, capital flight, foreign debt accumulation, and exchange rate fluctuations. His detailed examination of how international payments take place within the current monetary structure also illuminates fundamental flaws that are harmful for developing countries. Applying a newly developed monetary macroeconomic model, Oberholzer suggests a reform of countries' international payments as a solution to these key problems. This book will prove to be a valuable resource for students and scholars of development economics and macroeconomics. Its analysis of how appropriate macroeconomic strategies can be established, pragmatic policy recommendations, and explanation of critical macroeconomic constraints will also be beneficial for policy-makers in progressive governments"--
