CRISPR/CAS-mediated genome editing in plants
"Key features: Explains the differences between conventional breeding, genetically modified crops, and genome editing approaches using CRISPR/Cas. Introduces the tools of genome editing, such as ZFNS (zinc finger nucleases), mega nucleases, and TLENS (transcription activator-like effector nucleases). Covers the history, origin, discovery, structure, and classification of CRISPR/Cas. Discusses the mechanisms of action of CRISPR/Cas9, CRISPR/Cas12 and CRISPR/Cas systems. Examines the databases and computational approaches of CRISPR/Cas. Highlights genome editing of important crop plants with CRISPR/Cas systems, including wheat, maize. tomato, Brassica crops, rice, fruits. Explores potential applications of CRISPR/Cas systems for climate smart crops. This important volume provides valuable insight into the revolutionary technology of CRISPR/Cas for plant and crop enhancement for researchers, academicians, and students"--
