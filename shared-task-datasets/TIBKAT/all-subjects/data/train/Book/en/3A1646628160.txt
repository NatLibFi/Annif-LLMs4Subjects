Perioperative and Critical Care Medicine : Educational Issues 2005
Continuing medical education and specialty training procedures represent highly dynamical processes, with a continuously evolving content. The specific teaching methods available (micro-teaching, team teaching, mastery learning, simulation, and e-learning) are essential elements of this process to promote professional updating and teaching at the bedside, aimed at providing an excellent clinical practice. The didactic laboratory is the core of this process: teachers, students and the School must be able to integrate in order to encourage this trend, and following this trend, the Trieste School of Medicine has long recognised the importance of supporting educational aspects and teaching programmes that promote our discipline. This volume is the result of the co-operation of the Trieste School of Medicine with experts at a national and international level who, in 2005, took part in seminars or micro-teaching sessions held at the Cattinara University Hospital.
