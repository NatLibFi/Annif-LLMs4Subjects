Turkish Jews in contemporary Turkey
The present volume consists of a selection of articles by scholars on the social and cultural situation of Turkish Jews in the last two decades. The tensions created by political events in Turkey and/or by the Israeli-Palestian conflict, the bursts of anti-Semitism which result from these tensions are some of the many aspects studied in this volume. Others aspects such as the cultural life and the cultural heritage of a demographically dwindling community are also studied. This book is indispensable for the general readership and scholars who would like to grasp and understand better the reality of a very small community living in a country which for the last two decades has been going through a transformation from a so-called secular society into one where Islamist and conservative values are dominant. Collection of articles 7 in French, 6 in English
