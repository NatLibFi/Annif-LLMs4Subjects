Advances in silicon carbide processing and applications
Annotation Learn the latest advances in SiC (Silicon Carbide) technology from the leading experts in the field with this new cutting-edge resource. The book is your single source for in-depth information on both SiC device fabrication and system-level applications. This comprehensive reference begins with an examination of how SiC is grown and how defects in SiC growth can affect working devices. Key issues in selective doping of SiC via ion implantation are covered with special focus on implant conditions and electrical activation of implants. SiC applications discussed include chemical sensors, motor-control components, high-temperature gas sensors, and high-temperature electronics. By cutting through the arcane data and jargon surrounding the hype on SiC, this book gives an honest assessment of today's SiC technology and shows you how SiC can be adopted in developing tomorrow's applications
