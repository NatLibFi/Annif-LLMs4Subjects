Concrete permeability and durability performance : from theory to field applications
"This text provides insight into the permeability of concrete, moving from theory to practice, and includes over twenty real cases. It stresses the importance of site testing for a realistic durability assessment and details the 'Torrent Method' for non-destructive measurement of air-permeability"--
