International assessment of research and development in simulation-based engineering and science
Simulation-Based Engineering and Science (SBE&S) cuts across disciplines, showing tremendous promise in areas from storm prediction and climate modeling to understanding the brain and the behavior of numerous other complex systems. In this groundbreaking volume, nine distinguished leaders assess the latest research trends, as a result of 52 site visits in Europe and Asia and hundreds of hours of expert interviews, and discuss the implications of their findings for the US government. The authors conclude that while the US remains the quantitative leader in SBE&S research and development, it is very much in danger of losing that edge to Europe and Asia.
