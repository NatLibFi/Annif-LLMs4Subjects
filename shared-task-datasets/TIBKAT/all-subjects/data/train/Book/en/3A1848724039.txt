Nanotechnology-enhanced solid materials : design, synthesis, properties, applications, and perspectives
"This new volume provides some of the latest information on the emergence and rapid development of nanotechnology-enhanced solid materials and the ways they have impacted almost every aspect of nanoengineering. The chapters explore the role of nanomaterials in industries in diverse applications, such as insulations and reinforcement of composite materials. The book focuses on the design, synthesis, and properties of solid materials, presenting updated, practical, and systematic knowledge on the modification of nanomaterials. A wide range of solid material formulations and self-assemblies are covered. This book describes a host of carbon nanomaterials, including fullerenes, nanotubes, whiskers, cones, and nanodiamonds. The topics include photovoltaic applications of solid carbons, carbon nanotubes, mesoporous silica nanomaterials, smart biopolymer composites and polymer solids, graphene oxide as an emerging solid-based nanocomposite material, steady state creep deformation in rotating discs and cylinders, and more. The volume will be an excellent resource for senior postgraduate students with backgrounds in materials science and technology, physics, and chemistry. Because of the integral nature of the topics, it will also be of interest to a broad spectrum of audiences, including industrial scientists, industrial engineers, nanotechnologists, materials scientists, chemists, physicists, biologists, chemical engineers, and all those who are involved and interested in the future frontiers of nanomaterials science"--
