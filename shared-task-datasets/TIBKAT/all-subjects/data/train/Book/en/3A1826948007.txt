Intumescent coating and fire protection of steel structures
"Intumescent coating insulates structural steel from fire damage. This book for fire and structural engineers shows how to predict the temperature elevation of steel structures in fire, how the state and thickness of the porous char formed change, and how the coating's organic ingredients age as its components are dissolved by moisture in the air and affect the design life of the structure. The constant effective thermal conductivity is defined. Hydrothermal aging, along with the influence of topcoat on insulation and aging, are presented, with a practical method for calculating the temperature of the protected steel structures and the fire safety of a structure"--
