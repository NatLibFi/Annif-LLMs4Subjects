Learning MIT App Inventor : a hands-on guide to building your own android apps
"With MIT's App Inventor 2, anyone can build complete, working Android apps--without writing code! This complete tutorial will help you do just that, even if you have absolutely no programming experience. Unlike books focused on the obsolete Google version, Learning MIT App Inventor is written from the ground up for MIT's dramatically updated Version 2. The authors guide you step-by-step through every task and feature, showing you how to create apps by dragging, dropping, and connecting puzzle pieces--not writing code. As you learn, you'll also master expert design and development techniques you can build on if you ever do want to write code. Through hands-on projects, you'll master features ranging from GPS to animation, build high-quality user interfaces, make everything work, and test it all with App Inventor's emulator. (You won't even need an Android device!)" --
