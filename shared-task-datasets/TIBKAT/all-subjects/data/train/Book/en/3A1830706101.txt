Metamaterial for microwave applications
"The metamaterial is unleashing a broader range of application scope for researchers and the upcoming smart technologies. Artificial composite material, which is the building block of metamaterial, expedites the suitability for microwave sensing, antenna and imaging technique. Metamaterial with tunable microwave frequency and absorption property is especially suitable for microwave sensing. particularly left-handed metamaterial (LHM) can be adapted to be used in sensor applications, including industrial, healthcare system and Nanosatellite applications"--
