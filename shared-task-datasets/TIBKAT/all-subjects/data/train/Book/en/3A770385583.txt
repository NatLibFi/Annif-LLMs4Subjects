Fast chemical reactions in turbulent flows : theory and practice
This book describes the fundamentals of fast liquid-phase chemical reactions and the principles of their scientific foundation, technical implementation and industrial application of new technologies. In addition, the equipment required to perform these reactions, in a turbulent mode in the chemical, petrochemical and petroleum industries, is also discussed. The macrokinetic approach has been developed with consideration of the diffusion, hydrodynamics, and heat transfer processes. Due to the advancement of fundamental knowledge, equations of practical engineering importance have been obtained
