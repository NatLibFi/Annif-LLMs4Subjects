African water cities
African Water Cities' presents research on how African cities by waterfronts deal with two of the most significant trends of our time: urbanization and a changing climate.00On the African continent, the impact of climate change is now the day-to-day reality. Coastal and waterfront cities in particular experience loss and damage due to significant increases in sea level rise, rainfall and flooding. At the same time, Africa is the second most rapidly urbanizing continent, after Asia. The intersections between water and cities are therefore critical for understanding the future of urban and rural developments in Africa.00Through deeper understanding of the innovative and resourceful way of life of the informal water communities such as Makoko and coastal cities like Abidjan, African Water Cities reveals key factors, challenges and opportunities shaping human, physical and economic dynamics.00The result is a vivid collection of essays, stories, research and photographs of these places ? inhabited by people who are redefining our understanding of cities through innovative adaptations of spaces, materials and infrastructure
