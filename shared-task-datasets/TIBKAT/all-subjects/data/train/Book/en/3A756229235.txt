Research methods in second language psycholinguistics
"This timely volume provides up-to-date overviews of methods used in psycholinguistic research with second languages. Included are chapters on self-paced reading and listening, textual eye-tracking, visual world eye-tracking, ERPs, FMRI, translation recognition tasks, and cross-modal priming. Each contribution is authored by an expert researcher who offers experienced insight into not only the history of the method, but what is measured, how it is measured, issues in research and stimuli design, and the pros and cons of the method. These contributions are bookended by an introductory chapter on various models and issues that inform psycholinguistic inquiry into second language learning, and a final chapter that offers comments on the various methods described in addition to issues related to research design. Intended as a text to be used with advanced undergraduate and graduate students, Research Methods in Second Language Psycholinguistics will be useful to researchers wishing to understand more about the various methods represented and how they are used to investigate psycholinguistic processes in the second language context"--
