Numerical methods for atmospheric and oceanic sciences
"Numerical Methods for Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences deals with various numerical methods that are applied to fluid systems like the atmosphere and hydrosphere. With a detailed and comprehensive overview of the various numerical methods that are applied to fluid systems in general and atmospheric and oceanic science, this book will be useful for students of atmospheric and oceanic sciences in both senior undergraduate and graduate courses. It provides details of the application of the finite difference methods to various problems that involve processes like advection, barotropic, shallow water, baroclinic, oscillation, and decay. The concepts of consistency, stability, and convergence are also emphasized. There is a conscious effort to simplify the Eulerian method of solution used in solving nonlinear partial differential equations, which is usually difficult to understand. The book also provides broad details and applications of advanced numerical methods such as spectral method, finite element method, and finite volume method"--
