Speculation : within and about science
"Newton urged scientists never to speculate, only to prove by establishing experimental facts. By contrast, Einstein encouraged scientists to speculate freely, since only daring speculations, not experimental facts, can advance science. Who, if either, is right? Is speculation a legitimate part of science, even in the absence of testing? If so can, speculations can be evaluated without testing? How?" --From publisher description
