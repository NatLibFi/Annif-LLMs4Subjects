Naphthalenediimide and its congeners : from molecules to materials
Supramolecular chemistry of napthalenediimide and its congeners -- NDI as a DNA intercalator -- NDI foldamers, assemblies and conformational switching -- Napthalenediimide in modular columnar liquid crystals: key component of donor-acceptor columnar liquid crystals -- Napthalene-diimide (NDI) nanofibre, gel, and mesoscopic material -- Polymeric materials based on NDI and its congeners -- Tunable electronic interactions between aromatic diimides and anions -- Napthalene diimide-based photovoltaics -- Perylenetetracarboxylic diimide and its covalently-linked molecular arrays
The past decade has seen significant advances in napthalenediimide and rylene diimide chemistry. This book discusses the recent advances in this field, and highlights potential and real applications for the molecules. Such applications include organic photovoltaics, anionsiides, DNA binders, and building blocks for complex molecular topologies.--
