Scanning Force Microscopy of Polymers
This lab manual introduces the reader to scanning force microscopy of polymers based on a practice-oriented approach. It begins with a broad introduction to the necessary background of SFM, including intermolecular forces and various SFM imaging modes. "Scanning Force Microscopy of Polymers" is developed in a didactically clear and easily understandable style. The application of SFM to visualize and study polymers is exemplified by numerous case studies, including experimental protocols. In addition, the book helps the reader to develop a conscious and critical understanding of SFM data. This approach enables the reader to acquire the knowledge and experimental skills that are necessary to understand and obtain good and reliable SFM results within the shortest time possible.
