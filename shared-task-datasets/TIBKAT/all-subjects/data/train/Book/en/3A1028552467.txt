Applied thermal measurements at the nanoscale : a beginner's guide to electrothermal methods
What is in your toolbox? -- Which tool should you choose? -- How to prepare for a successful experiment? -- Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis
"This book can serve as a practical guide for novices to design and conduct measurements of thermal properties at the nanoscale using electrothermal techniques. An outgrowth of the authors' tutorials for new graduate students in their own labs, it includes practical details on measurement design and selection, sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, and pitfalls and verifications. The information is particularly helpful for a novice setting up their own experiment for the first time. How to use thermal analysis to design an experiment for best sensitivity is shown, as well as how to configure the laboratory instruments accordingly. The emphasis is on the measurements of thermal conductivity, though thermal diffusivity and thermal boundary resistance (thermal contact resistance) are also briefly covered, and many of the principles can be generalized to other challenging thermal measurements. The reader is only expected to have the basic familiarity with electrical instruments typical of a graduate in science or engineering, and an acquaintance with the elementary laws of heat transfer by conduction, convection, and radiation"--
