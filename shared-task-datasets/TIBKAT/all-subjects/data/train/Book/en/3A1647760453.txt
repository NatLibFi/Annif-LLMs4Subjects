Health Services Marketing : A Practitioner's Guide
Despite the growing importance of marketing for health professionals, there is no concise how-to guide available on the topic for use by physician practices, hospitals and other healthcare organizations. Although the industry has become increasingly market driven, healthcare administrators and marketers are left with little guidance with regard to the concepts, techniques, and data appropriate for healthcare marketing. The proposed book would serve as a convenient reference for health professionals who want to understand the marketing process, develop marketing initiatives or interface with marketing professionals. Marketing theory and the history of marketing in healthcare will be minimized in an attempt to provide a practical guide for everyday use. The focus will be on how to do marketing, with the reader introduced to supporting aspects such as market research, marketing planning, and evaluation. The author also discusses marketing techniques for social marketing. Health Services Marketing: A Practitioner's Guide will cover broad topics appropriate for any healthcare organization and provide enough specifics to tailor marketing activities to the needs of particular practitioners. This book will be useful for both for-profit and not-for-profit organizations.
