Mobility data management and exploration
This text integrates different mobility data handling processes, from database management to multi-dimensional analysis and mining, into a unified presentation driven by the spectrum of requirements raised by real-world applications. It presents a step-by-step methodology to understand and exploit mobility data: collecting and cleansing data, storage in Moving Object Database (MOD) engines, indexing, processing, analyzing and mining mobility data. Emerging issues, such as semantic and privacy-aware querying and mining as well as distributed data processing, are also covered. Theoretical presentation is smoothly interchanged with hands-on exercises and case studies involving an actual MOD engine. The authors are established experts who address both theoretical and practical dimensions of the field but also present?valuable prototype software. The background context, clear explanations and sample exercises make this an ideal textbook for graduate students studying database management, data mining and geographic information systems.--
