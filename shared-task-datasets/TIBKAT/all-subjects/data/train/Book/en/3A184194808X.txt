Careers of the Professoriate : Academic Pathways of the Linguists and Sociologists in Germany, France and the UK
This book examines career patterns of the professoriate. Professors may appear as specialised individualists in their fields, and yet they follow pathways which are anything but unique. Drawing from a unique data set, the authors analyse the trajectories of the almost 2000 linguists and sociologists who hold full professorships in Germany, France and the UK in 2015. With a background in social theory, they reveal models, structures and rules that organise the professional lives and biographies of the most senior academics. This book presents the results of a systematic empirical study, which will be of interest to specialists in higher education studies as well as to linguists and sociologists, and to all academics more generally. Johannes Angermuller is Professor in the School of Languages and Applied Linguistics at the Open University, UK. Philippe Blanchard is Associate Professor in the Department of Politics and International Studies at the University of Warwick, UK.
