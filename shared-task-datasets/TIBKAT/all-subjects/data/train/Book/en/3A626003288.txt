Valuation of Biodiversity Benefits : Selected Studies
The importance of biodiversity valuation is widely understood in academia and is increasingly used in policy making and other fora. For example, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), through the Conference of the Parties (COP), recognises that &quot;economic valuation of biodiversity and biological resources is an important tool for well-targeted and calibrated economic incentive measures&quot;. Further, it encourages the Parties to &quot;take into account economic, social, cultural and ethical valuation in the development of relevant incentive measures&quot; (CBD COP Decision IV/10)
