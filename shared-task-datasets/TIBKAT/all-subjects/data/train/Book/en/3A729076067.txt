"This Companion maps the dynamic literary landscape of the American South. From pre- and post-Civil War literature to modernist and civil rights fictions, and writing by immigrants in the 'global' South of the late-twentieth and twenty-first centuries, these newly commissioned essays from leading scholars explore the region's established and emergent literary traditions. Touching on poetry and song, drama and screenwriting, key figures such as William Faulkner and Eurdora Welty, and iconic texts such as Gone with the Wind, chapters investigate how issues of class, poverty, sexuality, and regional identity have textured Southern writing across generations.
