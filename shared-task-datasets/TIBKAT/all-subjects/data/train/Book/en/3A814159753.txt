Extended finite element method : theory and applications
Introduces the theory and applications of the extended finite element method (XFEM) in the linear and nonlinear problems of continua, structures and geomechanicsExtended Finite Element Method: Theory and Applicationsintroduces the theory and applications of the extended finite element method (XFEM) in the linear and nonlinear problems of continua, structures and geomechanics. The XFEM approach is based on an extension of standard finite element method based on the partition of unity method.Extended Finite Element Method: Theory and Applicationsbegins by introducing the concept of partition of unity, various enrichment functions, and fundamentals of XFEM formulation. It then covers the theory and application of XFEM in large deformations, plasticity and contact problems. The implementation of XFEM in fracture mechanics, including the linear, cohesive, and ductile crack propagation is also covered. The theory and applications of the XFEM in multiphase fluid flow, including the hydraulic fracturing in soil saturated media and crack propagation in thermo-hydro-mechanical porous media, is also discussed in detail.Introduces the theory and applications of the extended finite element method (XFEM) in the linear and nonlinear problems of continua, structures and geomechanicsExplores the concept of partition of unity, various enrichment functions, and fundamentals of XFEM formulation.Covers numerous applications of XFEM including fracture mechanics, large deformation, plasticity, multiphase flow, hydraulic fracturing and contact problemsAccompanied by a website hosting source code and examples
