Women and music in the age of Austen
"Highlighting women's central role in the performance, composition, reception, and representation of music, Women and Music in the Age of Austen analyzes their formative and lasting effect upon Georgian culture. This interdisciplinary collection of essays from the fields of musicology, literary studies, and gender studies challenges the categories that populate conventional histories of Austen's time and marginalize the experience of women: dismantling the divisions between professional and amateur musicians, public and domestic sites of musical production, and performers and composers of music, the contributors reveal how women's widespread involvement in the Georgian musical scene allowed for their self-expression, artistic influence, and access to communities that transcended the boundaries of gender, class, and nationality. This volume's breadth of focus advances our understanding of a period that witnessed a flourishing of music, much of it brought to life by female hands and voices"
