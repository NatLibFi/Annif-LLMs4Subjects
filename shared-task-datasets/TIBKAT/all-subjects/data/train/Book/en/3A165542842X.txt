The Analysis of Categorical Data Using GLIM
This book shows how to apply log linear and logistic models to categorical data using GLIM. Each model is illustrated by a numerical example. All of the necessary programs in the GLIM macro language are supplied, as well as all data for the examples. The material has been the contents of a course for social science students, but would also be useful for applied statistics courses in such varied fields as medicine, geography, economics, biology,.. It should also be extremely useful for research workers in these and other fields where such models are applied, since it provides a step by step explanation of how to analyse such data using these models. Almost all of the GLIM macro programs are new and have not previously appeared in the literature. Nor have many of the logistic/log linear models been applied using GLIM before
