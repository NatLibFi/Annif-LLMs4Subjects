Competition policy and global competitiveness in major Asian economies
In this book, Tran Van Hoa reveals how competition policy and competitiveness are essential for contemporary economic, financial and trade management as well as national and international governance. Containing new in-depth studies of these issues and their development, the book focuses on major Asian economies encountering increasing globalisation and the prevailing influence of the WTO. In major Asian economies, competition policy, while being important for trade, development and growth, is nascent. Competition Policy and Global Competitiveness in Major Asian Economies surveys the fundamentals of competition policy and investigates how, in practice, it has been developed in major economies in the Asian region. It also contains previous lessons and experiences in the formulation and implementation of competition policy and the pitfalls that may be avoided in similar future developments. Suggesting solutions in economic development and policy reform for Asian economies in the face of increasing globalisation and WTO membership requirements, this important book will be of enormous interest to economic policymakers and advisers, academics, government officials, business executives and tertiary students
