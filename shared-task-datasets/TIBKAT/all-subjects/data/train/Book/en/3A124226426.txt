Zoos and animal rights : the ethics of keeping animals
Zoos and animal rights would appear to be in conflict, yet Stephen Bostock argues that this need not and should not be so. Examining the diverse ethical and technical issues involved, including human cruelty, human domination over animals outside their natural habitat, and the nature of wild and domestic animals, Bostock analyzes areas in which misconceptions abound. A timely and controversial book, it explores the long history of zoos, as well as current philosophical debates, to argue for a controversial view of their role in the modern world. Anyone concerned with humanity's relationship with other animals and the natural world should find this a thought-provoking book.
