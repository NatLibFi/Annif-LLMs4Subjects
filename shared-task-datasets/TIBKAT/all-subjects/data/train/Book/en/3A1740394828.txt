Nuclear materials science
Concerns around climate change and the drive to net-zero carbon energy have led to a nuclear renaissance in many countries. The nuclear industry continues to warn of the increasing need for a highly trained workforce and men and women are needed to perform R&D activities in a range of areas from healthcare and radiation detection to space exploration and advanced materials as well as for the nuclear power industry. Here Karl Whittle provides an overview of the intersection of nuclear engineering and materials science at a level approachable by students from materials, engineering and physics. The text explains the unique aspects needed in the design and implementation of materials for use in demanding nuclear settings. In addition to material properties and their interaction with radiation, the book covers a range of topics including reactor design, fuels, fusion, future technologies and lessons learned from past incidents. Featuring animated figures, this extensively updated and extended edition also includes a new chapter on materials characterisation.
