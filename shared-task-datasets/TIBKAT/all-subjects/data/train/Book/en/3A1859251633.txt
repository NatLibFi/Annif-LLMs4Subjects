Nanocarbon allotropes beyond graphene : synthesis, properties and applications
This research text presents the synthesis, characterisation, and advanced technological applications of novel nanocarbons, with a focus on graphane, graphyne, graphdiyne, graphene nanoribbon, onion like carbons and carbon nanotori. The book covers the various applications of novel nanocarbons, such as in solar cells and flexible electronics, provides updates on the effects of doping and electronic properties of electrode materials based on novel nanocarbons, and references further research and application-oriented innovations using these new carbon nanostructures. It also provides new updates on the effect of doping and structural twist on the electrochemical performance of electrode materials based on novel nanocarbons. This book will appeal to researchers and graduate students working with novel nanocarbon allotropes, including disciplines such as physics, chemistry, materials science, and chemical engineering.
