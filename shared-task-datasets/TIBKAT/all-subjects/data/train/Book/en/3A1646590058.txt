Biomedical Informatics : Computer Applications in Health Care and Biomedicine
The practice of modern medicine requires sophisticated information technologies with which to manage patient information, plan diagnostic procedures, interpret laboratory results, and conduct research. This book, inspired by a Stanford University training program developed to introduce health professionals to computer applications in modern medical care, fills the need for a high quality text in computers and medicine, and meets the growing demand by practitioners, researchers, and students for a comprehensive introduction to key topics in the field. The work is designed for a broad audience interested in the intersection of computer science and medicine. Completely revised and expanded, the Third Edition includes several new chapters filled with brand new material. This book will provide both a conceptual framework and a practical approach for the implementation and management of IT used to improve the delivery of health care. Designed for use by professors and students of medical informatics and for practicing professionals, this book will focus on the role of computers in the provision of medical services. Biomedial Informatics, Third Edition, provides the conceptual base needed to comprehend and utilize medical informatics through easy to understand examples that demonstrate how computers assist in the delivery of health care. This text also includes pointers to additional literature, chapter summaries, and concise definition of recurring terms for self-study or classroom use.
