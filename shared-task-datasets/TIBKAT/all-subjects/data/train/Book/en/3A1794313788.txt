Green catalysis and reaction engineering : an integrated approach with industrial case studies
"Discover tools to perform Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) and develop sustainable chemical technologies in this valuable guide for chemists, engineers and practitioners. Tackling one of the key challenges of modern industrial chemical engineering, this book introduces tools to assess the environmental footprint and economics of key chemical processes that make the ingredients of everyday products such as plastics, synthetic fibers, detergents and fuels. Describing diverse industrial processes in detail, it provides process flow diagrams including raw material sourcing, catalytic reactors, separation units, process equipment and recycle streams. The book clearly explains elements of LCA and how various software tools, available in the public domain and commercially, can be used to perform LCA. Supported by real-world practical examples and case studies provided by industrial and academic chemists and chemical engineers, this is an essential tool for readers involved in implementing LCA, and developing nextgeneration sustainable chemical technologies"--
