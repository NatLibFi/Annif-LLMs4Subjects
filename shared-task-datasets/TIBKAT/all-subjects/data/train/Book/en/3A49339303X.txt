Masters of modern design : a critical assessment
Joy to the maker -- Line is a force -- House should stand as a perfect whole -- Face to face with the machine -- Type-objects and type-furniture -- Art and technology, a new unity -- Never leave well enough alone -- Method of action -- Formal qualities of the industrial product -- Way of discussing life, sociality, politics, food, even design -- I don't propose anything or try to instruct -- To open the gates to people's imagination.
