Permanent Magnetic Materials and their Applications
Permanent magnets play an increasingly important role in modern society because they are vital components of numerous domestic and industrial devices. The last few decades have witnessed a quite extraordinary development in the use of hard magnetic materials, especially after the advent of rare earth permanent magnets. The rare earth permanent magnets are unequalled because they combine a high magnetization with an extraordinary magnetic hardness which allows the use of such magnets having the extreme shapes and small dimensions as required in modern devices. In the present work, the progress made in the past years is reviewed; including new developments in manufacturing routes as well as in the physical principles upon which these new developments are based. A succinct summary of the field as it stands after extraordinary developments over the past few decades, particularly the advent of rare-earth permanent magnets, which combine a high magnetization with a magnetic hardness that allows magnets to be formed into the extreme shapes and small dimensions required in the modern devices that are increasingly being used both domestically and industrially.
