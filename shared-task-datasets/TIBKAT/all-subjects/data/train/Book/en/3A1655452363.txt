Activity-Based Statistics : Student Guide
This book presents a collection of hands-on activities for students taking introductory statistics, and is designed to engage the student as a participant in the learning process. Intended as a lab manual and organized around the major topics covered in most introductory courses, this book contains more activities than can possibly be covered in one course, allowing flexibility for individual course requirements. Packaged in an inexpensive paperback format, the pages are perforated and 3-hole punched for easy removal of individual activities. The 50+ experiments, models, and simulations included in this book are explained succinctly, giving students a clear description of the activities without extra reading. Many activities are compatible with technology
