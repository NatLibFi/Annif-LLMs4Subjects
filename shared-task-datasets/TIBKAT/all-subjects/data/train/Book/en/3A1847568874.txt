Actinomycetes in marine and extreme environments : unexhausted sources for microbial biotechnology
"Mankind is in search of new and potent therapeutic agents to combat ever increasing antibiotic resistance problem as well as to feed the market of biotechnology in terms of new enzymes and other microbial secondary metabolites sought after by industry. Microorganisms at extreme environments might be the resource in this search as they are continuously subjected to extreme pressures and their metabolic changes in these environments might provide new chemical scaffolds industry needs desperately. The proposed book will cover microorganisms that inhabit in extreme environments and reveal their potential as novel sources of new drugs and other industrially useful metabolites"--
