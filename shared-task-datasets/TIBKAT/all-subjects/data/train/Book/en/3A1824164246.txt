Light polarization and multiple scattering in turbid media
This book is aimed at description of recent progress in studies of multiple and single light scattering in turbid media. Light scattering and radiative transfer research community will greatly benefit from the publication of this book.
Multiple-path model of reflection and transmission for a turbid slab -- Laboratory measurements of multi-spectral, polarization, and angular characteristics of light reflected from particulate samples -- Spectropolarimetry of snow and ice surfaces: measurements and radiative transfer calculations -- Light scattering by large densely packed clusters of particles -- Light backscattering by atmospheric particles: from laboratory to field experiments.
