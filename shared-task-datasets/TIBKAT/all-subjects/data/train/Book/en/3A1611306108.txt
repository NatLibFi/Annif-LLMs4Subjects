Essential principles of image sensors
"Providing an introduction to the systemization of image sensor technology and perspective on its various noise sources and signal processes, this book delivers a detailed description of image information and its four factors: light intensity, space, wavelength, and time. It discusses how image sensors convert optical image information into image signals. It tackles CCD, MOS, and CMOS, as well as key techniques such as BSI. It also considers the influences of in-system digitized coordinate points and explains sampling theorem, presenting unique figures demonstrating the importance of phase"--
