European integration theory
The only up-to-date overview of the major approaches to European integration, giving students insights on the most current debates and topical developments. With contributions from world-leading experts, the text is an authoritative guide to each theory. Considers the development, achievements, and problems of each theory alongside historical and current issues in European integration. Uses the multiple crises in the EU over the past decade as case studies to demonstrate the relevance of theory to practice. New to this Edition: Each chapter includes a referent case on recent crises in the EU: the financial crisis and the migration crisis. Each chapter now includes both study questions to help students test their understanding and discussion questions to promote critical thinking and class debate. Professor Tanja A. BÃ¶rzel and Professor Thomas Risse join the editorial team, bringing fresh expertise and insights to the volume.
