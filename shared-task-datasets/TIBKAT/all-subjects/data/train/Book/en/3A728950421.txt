Parallel robots : mechanics and control
"Using a systematic approach and illustrative examples, this book examines dynamic and control for parallel robotics through three methods--Newton-Euler, principle of virtual work, and Lagrange formulations. It also presents a method for formulating dynamics equations into closed form, leading to more tractable dynamics matrices and easier verification. The author presents a concise overview of kinematic, static, and singularity analysis that should be required in any text on parallel robotics. The book also contains numerous case studies to empower readers to implement controllers in challenging situations. Contains all analysis and design tools required to create a parallel robot. Combines coverage of kinematics, dynamics, and control. Presents numerous illustrative case studies and many challenging chapter-end problems. Discusses cable-driven robots. Covers advanced topics such as dynamics model verification, redundancy resolution, and adaptive and robust control"--
