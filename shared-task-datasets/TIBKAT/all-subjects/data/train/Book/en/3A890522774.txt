Windows internals / Pavel Yosifovich, Alex Ionescu, Mark E. Russinovich, and David A. Solomon ; part 1: System architecture, processes, threads, memory management, and more
Delve inside Windows architecture and internals - and see how core components work behind the scenes. This classic guide has been fully updated for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2, and now presents its coverage in three volumes: Book 1, User Mode; Book 2, Kernel Mode; Book 3, Device Driver Models. In Book 1, you'll plumb Windows fundamentals, independent of platform - server, desktop, tablet, phone, Xbox. Coverage focuses on high-level functional descriptions of the various Windows components and features that interact with, or are manipulated by, user mode programs, or applications. You'll also examine management mechanisms and operating system components that are implemented in user mode, such as service processes. As always, you get critical insider perspectives on how Windows operates. And through hands-on experiments, you'll experience its internal behavior firsthand - knowledge you can apply to improve application design, debugging, system performance, and support. Planned chapters: Concepts & Tools; System Architecture; Windows Application Support; Windows Store Apps; Graphics & the Desktop; Management Mechanisms; User Mode Memory Management; Security; Storage; Networking; Hyper-V.
