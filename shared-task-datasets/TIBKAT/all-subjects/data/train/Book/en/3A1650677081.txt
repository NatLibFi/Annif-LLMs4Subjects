Quantized Vortex Dynamics and Superfluid Turbulence
This book is primarily concerned with turbulence in superfluid helium. Quantized vorticity has traditionally generated great interest among physicists but there are now also important engineering applications, such as liquid helium cooling of superconducting magnets. Presently much research is done on the relationship between superfluid turbulence and classical turbulence, as intense turbulence can be generated in liquid helium due to its small kinematic viscosity. There is also a close relationship between superfluid behaviour and quantized vorticity in liquid helium and in atomic Bose--Einstein condensates. Putting special emphasis on the interplay between the different disciplines involved, this readable account of recent research will appeal not only to established researchers but also to newcomers and graduate students wishing to enter the field
