Principles of Fluid Mechanics : fundamentals, Statics and Dynamics of Fluids
This mature textbook brings the fundamentals of fluid mechanics in a concise and mathematically understandable presentation. In the current edition, a section on dissipation and viscous potential flows has been added. Exercises with solutions help to apply the material correctly and promote understanding. This book is a translation of the original German 11th edition Grundzüge der Strömungslehre by Jürgen Zierep & Karl Bühler, published by Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH, part of Springer Nature in 2018. The translation was done with the help of artificial intelligence (machine translation by the service DeepL.com). A subsequent human revision was done primarily in terms of content, so that the book will read stylistically differently from a conventional translation. Springer Nature works continuously to further the development of tools for the production of books and on the related technologies to support the authors.
Introduction -- Hydro-aerostatics -- Hydro-aerodynamics -- Streamline theory -- Frictionless flows -- Plane spatial flows -- Flows with friction.
