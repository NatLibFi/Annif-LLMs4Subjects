The Regulation, which is directly applicable in all Member States, is the legal basis for cross-border insolvencies within the European Union. Paving the way for a new European insolvency law, the Heidelberg-Luxembourg-Vienna Report carries out a comprehensive legal and empirical evaluation of European insolvency law practice in the Member States. Based on thorough analyses the general reporters evaluate the Regulation and provide recommendations for its current revision." - - Extracted from website
