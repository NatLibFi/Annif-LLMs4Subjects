Physics of digital photography
Physics is fundamental to all aspects of digital photography. This book works through the physics underlying the photographic imaging chain, from image capture through to the production of a viewable output digital image. It provides an invaluable insight into the connections between imaging science and photographic practice and is intended for use by both graduate students and established researchers. In this updated and expanded new edition, the material has been reorganised and extensively rewritten and the figures have been enhanced.
