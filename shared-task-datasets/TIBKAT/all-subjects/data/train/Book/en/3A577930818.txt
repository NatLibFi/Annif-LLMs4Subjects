Concepts in biotechnology : history, science and business
The authors present a systematic, yet concise, overview of the field, science and application, of biotechnology and how it developed. This includes some history, with roots going back several thousand years, highlighting great achievements in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It illustrates how progress actually occurs, driven by ideas and human activity with individuals playing decisive roles. The traditional fields of biochemical engineering and industrial biotechnology, as well the most recent progress in biosystems engineering, modern pharmaceutical and plant biotechnology are covered. The recent dramatic explosion in knowledge from genetics and cell biology have revolutionized biotechnology causing fundamental changes in related medical fields: e.g., from intervention to preventive and regenerative medicine. How this occurred, the prime movers, the principle developments, the concepts, science and applications are described. As the application of biotechnology impacts on society relevant questions in the area of economics, ethics and patenting are addressed in dedicated chapters. The involvement of the authors each with some 40 years as scientists and contemporary witnesses of these events gives the text an historical authenticity which the reader may find make the more recent events come to life. The book should be an introductory guide for students as well as scientists and engineers engaged in, or intending to work in biotechnology --
