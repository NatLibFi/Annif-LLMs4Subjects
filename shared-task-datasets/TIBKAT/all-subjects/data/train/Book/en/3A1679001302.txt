Deep data analytics for new product development
"This book presents and develops the deep data analytics for providing the information needed for successful new product development. Deep Data Analytics for New Product Development has a simple theme: information about what customers need and want must be extracted from data to effectively guide new product decisions regarding concept development, design, pricing, and marketing. The benefits of reading this book are two-fold. The first is an understanding of the stages of a new product development process from ideation through launching and tracking, each supported by information about customers. The second benefit is an understanding of the deep data analytics for extracting that information from data. These analytics, drawn from the statistics, econometrics, market research, and machine learning spaces, are developed in detail and illustrated at each stage of the process with simulated data. The stages of new product development and the supporting deep data analytics at each stage are not presented in isolation of each other, but are presented as a synergistic whole. This book is recommended reading for analysts involved in new product development. Readers with an analytical bent or who want to develop analytical expertise would also greatly benefit from reading this book, as well as students in business programs"--
