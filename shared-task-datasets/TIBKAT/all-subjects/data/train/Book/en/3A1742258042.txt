Consumer behavior : buying, having, and being
"For consumer behaviour courses. A #1 best-selling text for consumer behaviour courses, Solomonâ€™s Consumer Behavior: Buying, Having, and Being covers what happens before, during, and after the point of purchase. It investigates how having (or not having) certain products affects our lives; specifically, how these items influence how we feel about ourselves and each other, especially in the canon of social media and the digital age. In the 13th Edition, up-to-date content reflects major marketing trends and changes that impact the study of consumer behavior. Since we are all consumers, many of the topics have both professional and personal relevance to students. This makes it easy to apply the theory outside of the classroom and maintain an edge in the fluid and evolving field of consumer behaviour."
