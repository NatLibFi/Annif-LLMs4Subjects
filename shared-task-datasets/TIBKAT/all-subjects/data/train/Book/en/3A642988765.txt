Up and running with Autodesk Inventor Simulation 2011 : a step-by-step guide to engineering design solutions; [digital prototyping with Autodesk Inventor]
Autodesk∫ơ Inventor∫ơ Simulation is an essential element in the Autodesk Digital Prototyping workflow that enables engineers, designers and manufacturers to transition from traditional design and physical prototyping methods to the innovative use of 3D modeling for evaluating form, fit and function. This allows virtual exploration and testing of objects, components and products before they are made, saving critical development time and cost. Autodesk Inventor Simulation provides the dynamic tools required to revolutionize the product design process, but these tools are complex to learn and use to their full potential. Up and Running with Autodesk∫ơ Inventor∫ơ Simulation 2011 is dedicated to the requirements of Inventor users who need to quickly learn or refresh their skills and apply the dynamic simulation, stress analysis, frame analysis, and optimization capabilities of Inventor Simulation 2011. Providing clear guidance and all-important real-world tutorials, the step-by-step, heavily-illustrated approach of this book will help designers, engineers, and manufacturers of all skill levels become Simulation experts. Get up to speed fast with real-life, step-by-step design problems-3 new to this edition! Discover how to convert CAD models to working digital prototypes, enabling you to enhance designs and simulate real-world performance without creating physical prototypes Learn all about the frame analysis environment-new to Autodesk Inventor Simulation 2011-and other key features of this powerful software, including modal analysis, assembly stress analysis, parametric optimization analysis, effective joint creation, and more Manipulate and experiment with design solutions from the book using datasets provided on the book's companion website and move seamlessly onto tackling your own design challenges with confidence New edition features enhanced coverage of key areas, including stress singularities, h-p convergence, curved elements, mechanism redundancies, FEA and simulation theory, with hand calculations, and more
