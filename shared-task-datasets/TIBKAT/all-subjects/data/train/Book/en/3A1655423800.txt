Parametric and Nonparametric Inference from Record-Breaking Data
This book provides a comprehensive look at statistical inference from record-breaking data in both parametric and nonparametric settings, including Bayesian inference. A unique feature is that it treats the area of nonparametric function estimation from such data in detail, gathering results on this topic to date in one accessible volume. Previous books on records have focused mainly on the probabilistic behavior of records, prediction of future records, and characterizations of the distributions of record values, addressing some inference methods only briefly. The main purpose of this book is to fill this void on general inference from record values. Statisticians, mathematicians, and engineers will find the book useful as a research reference and in learning about making inferences from record-breaking data. The book can also serve as part of a graduate- level statistics or mathematics course, complementing material on the probabilistic aspects of record values. For a basic understanding of the statistical concepts, a one-year graduate course in mathematical statistics provides sufficient background. For a detailed understanding of the convergence theory of the nonparametric function estimators, a course in measure theory or probability theory at the graduate level is useful.
