Landed internationals : planning cultures, the academy, and the making of the modern Middle East
"The book studies the international culture of postwar urban planning via the case of the Middle East Technical University (METU) in Ankara, Turkey. It studies "a series of legitimacy battles" between bureaucrats, academics, and other professionals "in multiple theaters across the political geography of the cold war"; Erdim concludes by looking at how METU went on to become an important force in transnational housing, planning, and preservation in its own right"--
