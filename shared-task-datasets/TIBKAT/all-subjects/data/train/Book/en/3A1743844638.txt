Essentials of thermal processing
"The new edition of this definitive modern-day reference on thermal processing has been fully revised and updated throughout. It provides essential information regarding the preservation of food products by heat, and includes all types of food product, from those high in acid and given a mild heat process to the low-acid sterilised foods that require a full botulinum cook. Chapters deal with the manufacturing steps from raw material microbiology, through various processing regimes, validation methods, packaging, incubation testing and spoilage incidents. Due to the rising importance of Heat Transfer Distribution, two new chapters on temperature and heat distribution, and heat penetration are included, as well as more worked and practical examples throughout the book. This book is directed at scientists and technologists in the food manufacturing industry as well as researchers and students of food science and technology"--
