City planning in India, 1947-2017
"This book is a comprehensive history of city planning in post-independence India. It explores how the conceptualization of city-planning, the challenges of urban development and policymaking have evolved in the changing socio-political context over the past hundred years in India and the global south. The book situates India's experience within a historical framework in order to illustrate continuities and disjunctions between the pre and post-independent Indian laws, policies, and programmes for city planning and development. It focuses on the development, scope and significance of professional planning work in the midst of rapid economic transition, migration, social disparity, and environmental degradation. The volume also highlights the need for inclusive planning processes which can provide clean air, water and community spaces to large, diverse, and fast-growing communities. Detailed and insightful, this volume will be of interest to researchers and students of public administration, civil engineering, architecture, geography, economics, and sociology. It will also be useful for policymakers and professionals working in the areas of town and country planning"--
