Handbook of knot theory
This book is a survey of current topics in the mathematical theory of knots. For a mathematician, a knot is a closed loop in 3-dimensional space: imagine knotting an extension cord and then closing it up by inserting its plug into its outlet. Knot theory is of central importance in pure and applied mathematics, as it stands at a crossroads of topology, combinatorics, algebra, mathematical physics and biochemistry. * Survey of mathematical knot theory * Articles by leading world authorities * Clear exposition, not over-technical * Accessible to readers with undergraduate background in mathematics
