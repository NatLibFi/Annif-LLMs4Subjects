The Elgar companion to Ronald H. Coase
Ronald H. Coase, one of the most innovative and provocative economists of the twentieth century, has had a lasting influence in economics, law and economics, organization theory, management and political science. In this comprehensive Companion, 31 leading economists, social scientists and legal scholars, including two Nobel Laureates, offer the first global assessment of the initial impact of Coase's work and the continuing inspiration that researchers and policy makers find in his contributions. The book presents a review of the continuing power of Coase's work, including the reshaping of public policies with particular respect to public utilities and network industries. Further chapters explore research programmes that he initiated including the concept of transaction costs and the analysis of property rights, especially in terms of the regulation of the communications industry and the creation of markets for the right to pollute. The book clearly demonstrates the originality of Coase's work and the challenge that it posed to conventional perspectives which has been a hallmark of his research throughout his life, from his initial view on the nature of the firm to his recent analysis of the development of capitalism in China. Less well-known features of Coase's research going beyond his famous papers on 'The Nature of the Firm' and 'The Problem of Social Cost' are also explored in detail. From economics to public policy, this complete and thorough assessment of Coase's vast contribution will be an invaluable reference to all those interested in the many areas influenced by this great economist
