Nanoplatform-based molecular imaging
"Nanoplathform-Based Molecular Imaging provides rationale for using nanoparticle-based probes for molecular imaging, then discusses general strategies for this underutilized, yet promising, technology. It addresses general strategies of particle synthesis and surface chemistry, applications in computed tomography optical imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, multimodality imaging, theranostics, and finally, the clinical perspectives of nanoimaging. This comprehensive volume summarizes the opinions of those in the forefront of research and describes the latest developments by emphasizing fundamentals and initiating hands-on application"--Provided by publisher
