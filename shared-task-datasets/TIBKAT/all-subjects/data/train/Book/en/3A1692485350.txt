Making LA modern : Craig Ellwood : myth, man, designer
"Craig Ellwood, the 'Cary Grant of architecture', was one of the most visible faces of California mid-century modernism. He was known as much for his exquisitely designed, minimalist structures as he was for his exuberant lifestyle. This book celebrates and explores the glamour of Ellwood's work, life, myth, and career. Through photographs, primarily of the iconic houses he designed in Southern California during the 1950s and 60s, we see a life of refined decadence, expressed through gorgeous architecture, fast cars, beautiful women, Hollywood style, palm trees, swimming pools, and minimalist design all in the context of the Southern California postwar building boom."--
