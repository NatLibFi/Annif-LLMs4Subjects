Byzantine childhood : representations and experiences of children in middle byzantine society
"Byzantine Childhood examines the intricacies of growing up in Medieval Byzantium, children's everyday life experiences, and their agency. Piecing together a wide range of sources and utilising several methodological approaches inspired from intersectionality, history from below and microhistory, it analyses the life course of Byzantine boys and girls and how medieval Byzantine society perceived and treated them according to societal and cultural expectations surrounding age, gender, and status. Ultimately, it seeks to reconstruct a more plausible picture of the everyday life of children, one of the most vulnerable social groups throughout history and often a neglected subject in scholarship. Written in a lively and engaging manner, this book is necessary reading for scholars and students of Byzantine history, as well as those interested in the history of childhood and the family"--
