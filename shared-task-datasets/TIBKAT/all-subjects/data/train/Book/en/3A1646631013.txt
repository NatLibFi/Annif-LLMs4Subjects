Natriuretic Peptides : The Hormones of the Heart
Modern cardiovascular science has produced a revolutionary new idea: the heart acts not merely as a pump, but as a 'gland', that is as a regulator of circulatory homeostasis and salt-water balance. This book combines the classical heamodynamic view with the new neuro-hormonal paradigm, in all its potential clinical implications. The book will interest physiologists and clinicians involved in the study of the cardiovascular system and care of heart patients.
" The rapid knowledge in the field of neuro-humoral regulation of cardiovascular pathophysiology is changing the picture of current diagnosis and treatment of cardiac patients. The emerging conceptual revolutionary idea is that heart acts not as a pump, merely, but as a ""gland"", that is as a regulator of circulatory homeostasis and salt-water balance. Cardiovascular pathophysiology has to be written, indeed, on this basis: this physiology textbook gives an up-to-date description of the complexity and novelty of actual knowledge, with all its potential clinical implications."
