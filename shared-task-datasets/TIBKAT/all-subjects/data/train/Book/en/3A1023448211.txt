Evolutionary economics is a vital, expanding field of research focusing on the incessant transformation of the economy and its driving forces. Exploring the most recent research trends in the field, this volume presents a high quality set of papers indispensable to scholars and researchers interested in the evolutionary approach. Highlighting a variety of pressing economic problems, explaining causes and arriving at innovative remedies, the broad coverage considers developments in: innovations, knowledge transfer, industrial dynamics, structural change, international competitiveness, evolutionary game theory, new applications of evolutionary thought in finance, economic geography and ecological economics
