Bone cement : from simple cement concepts to complex biomimetic design
This book provides an overview of the composition of polymeric and ceramic bone cements. It also discusses complex, biomimetic structures based on biomaterials, such as cells and bioactive molecules, which more closely resemble natural bone The first chapter describes the main concepts of the cementation process and the parameters affecting it, while the second chapter focuses on the composition and structure of candidate biomaterials. Lastly, the third and fourth chapters present recent research aimed at improving the ability of naked biomaterials to enhance bone healing by adding cells and bioactive agents.
Cement Concept -- Conductivity: Material Design -- Productivity: Cells -- Inductivity: Bioactive Agents.
