Mathematical Modeling of Biosensors : An Introduction for Chemists and Mathematicians
This book presents biosensor development and modeling from both a chemical and a mathematical point of view. It contains unique modeling methods for catalytical (amperometric, potentiometer and optical) biosensors. It examines processes that occur in the sensors' layers and at their interface, and it provides analytical and numerical methods to solve enzymatic kinetic and diffusion equations. The action of single enzyme as well as polyenzyme biosensors is studied, and the modeling of biosensors that contain perforated membranes and multipart mass transport profiles is critically investigated
