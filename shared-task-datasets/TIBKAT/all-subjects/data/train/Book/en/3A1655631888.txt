The reparations controversy : the Jewish State and German money in the shadow of the Holocaust 1951 - 1952
This book about the reparations issue ('Wiedergutmachung' in German; 'shilumim' in Hebrew) brings together selected protocols of all debates held in the Knesset, in its Foreign Affairs and Security Committee, in the Government and in the high councils of the ruling party Mapai, regarding conducting negotiations with the West German Government. This is the first book documenting confidential protocols lately opened to the public. With the elaborate introduction by Yehiam Weitz, this book will serve as a basic textbook for an important chapter not only in Israeli and German history, but also in post-war history in general. Yaakov Sharett, Moshe Sharett Heritage Society, Tel Aviv, Israel."This is the most interesting boring book I have read in the past few years. [...] I am certain that, without it, learned readers will be denied the best means of learning about the most dramatic, incisive, painful debate ever held in Israel." Yossi Sarid (fromer member of the Knesset and former Israelian Minister),in: Haaretz Literary Supplement, August 1 2007 (review of the Hebrew edition of the book)
