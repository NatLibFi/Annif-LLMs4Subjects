Distillation : The Theory
Distillation basedon Mass Transfer Processes, starting from the basic equation of ternary distillation published by Hausen in 1932 and exploiting the properties of this equation covering all modes of distillation. The material is intended as a graduate textbook for an advanced course on distillation but will also help the practicing engineer to better understand the complex interrelationships of multi-component distillation
