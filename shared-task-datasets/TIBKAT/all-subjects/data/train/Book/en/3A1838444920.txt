Aerodynamics of Tandem Wing Aircraft : From Dinosaurs to UAVs and Supersonic Planes
This book contains extensive data about tandem wing aircraft. It includes a review of modern flying vehicles with four fixed wings, a review of analytical, numerical and experimental methods; results of the studies about aerodynamics; dependencies between geometrical parameters and aerodynamic characteristics, practical recommendations in development and optimizing of tandem wing aircraft to provide high lift-to-drag ratio, stability, and controllability. This is an ideal book for graduate students, researchers, and engineers working in fields of aerodynamics and conceptual design of the aircraft especially UAVs, ground-effect vehicles, and convertiplanes. Reviews a wide range of aircraft with four wings, providing insights and best practices; Explains how to choose layout and geometrical parameters of tandem wing aircraft; Maximizes reader understanding of many important facets of aerodynamics using relatively simple terms.
