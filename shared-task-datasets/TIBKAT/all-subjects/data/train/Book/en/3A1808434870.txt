Ordinary differential equations with applications
"- Besides giving rigorous proofs for basic theorems of ODE, it also provides numerous examples arising from physical and biological science for readers to understand the theorems and their applications - Exercises are given at the end of each chapter for the reader to practice; some are challenging - This is also a good textbook for students aiming for applied mathematics with applications in Engineering - Some knowledge in Nonlinear Analysis in which we think is necessary for the students is presented in the book - For oscillatory solutions which occur in nature, we introduce the Poincare-Bendixson Theorem and its applications, Monotone Dynamical Systems, especially three-dimensional competitive systems and Hopf bifurcations in n-dimensional space - This text also provides a friendly introduction to Hamiltonian systems, written by co-author Kuo-Chang Chen, an expert in celestial mechanics"--
