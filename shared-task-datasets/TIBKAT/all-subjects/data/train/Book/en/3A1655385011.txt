Quantum Groups and Their Primitive Ideals
The primary aim of this book is an in-depth study of the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantization Uq(g) of the enveloping algebra U(g) of a semisimple Lie algebra g and of the Hopf dual Rq (G) of Uq(g). The focus is on determining the primitive spectra of these rings. A systematic use of Hopf algebra structure, and in particular of adjoint action, is to be made. There will be an emphasis on "quantum phenomena" which are new features of Uq(g) and on how these can be used to even simplify the study of U(g). The reader will learn how the quantum viewpoint has revitalized the study of enveloping algebras and will become acquainted with proofs which have been developed over the last 20 years into a particularly efficient form. Many of the results are now only just being published in research journals
