Handbuch Staat und Migration in Deutschland seit dem 17. Jahrhundert
States configure and shape migration processes, channel migratory movements, and categorize migrants. This handbook surveys the genesis of the relationship between state and migration in Germany and examines the changes in ideological and political principles, government-established rules, and administrative decision-making processes that have affected emigration and immigration.
