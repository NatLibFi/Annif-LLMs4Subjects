Minstrel traditions : mediated blackface in the Jazz Age
""Mediated Blackface" is a series of interlocking case studies which surveys racial and racist inscriptions of the 1920s and 1930s in the United States. Kevin Byrne's study takes us through the late work of Bert Williams, Aunt Jemima advertising, amateur minstrel performances, vaudeville touring circuits, and African American Broadway musicals. All reflecting, and sometimes incorporating, the mass-culture technologies of the time, either in their subject matter or method of distribution. The book project oscillates between two different types of performances: the live and the mediated. This book will be of great interest to scholars and researchers in theatre studies, communication studies, race and media, and musical scholarship"--
