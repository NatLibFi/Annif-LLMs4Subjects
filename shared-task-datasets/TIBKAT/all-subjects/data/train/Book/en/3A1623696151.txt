Water safety plan manual : step-by-step risk management for drinking-water suppliers
In 2004, the WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality recommended that water suppliers develop and implement Water Safety Plans (WSPs) in order to systematically assess and manage risks. Since this time, governments and regulators, water suppliers and practitioners have increasingly embraced this approach, but they have also requested further guidance. This workbook answers describes how to develop and implement a WSP through 11 learning modules, each representing a key step in the WSP development and implementation process.--Publisher's description
