Contemporary computational mathematics : a celebration of the 80th birthday of Ian Sloan
Preface -- Family Perspectives -- A Fortunate Scientific Life -- Publications of Professor Sloan -- Contents -- Index
This book is a tribute to Professor Ian Hugh Sloan on the occasion of his 80th birthday. It consists of nearly 60 articles written by international leaders in a diverse range of areas in contemporary computational mathematics. These papers highlight the impact and many achievements of Professor Sloan in his distinguished academic career. The book also presents state of the art knowledge in many computational fields such as quasi-Monte Carlo and Monte Carlo methods for multivariate integration, multi-level methods, finite element methods, uncertainty quantification, spherical designs and integration on the sphere, approximation and interpolation of multivariate functions, oscillatory integrals, and in general in information-based complexity and tractability, as well as in a range of other topics. The book also tells the life story of the renowned mathematician, family man, colleague and friend, who has been an inspiration to many of us. The reader may especially enjoy the story from the perspective of his family, his wife, his daughter and son, as well as grandchildren, who share their views of Ian. The clear message of the book is that Ian H. Sloan has been a role model in science and life
