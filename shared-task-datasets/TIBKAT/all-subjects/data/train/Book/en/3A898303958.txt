Problems and solutions in special relativity and electromagnetism
"Field theory is an important topic in theoretical physics, which is studied in the physical and physico-mathematical departments of universities. Therefore, lecturers are faced with the urgent task of not only providing students with information about the subject, but also to help them master the material at a deep qualitative level, by presenting the specific features of general approaches to the statement and the solution of problems in theoretical physics. One of the ways to study field theory is the practical one, where the students can deepen their knowledge of the theoretical material and develop problem-solving skills. This book includes a concise theoretical summary of the main branches of field theory and electrodynamics, worked examples, and some problems for the student to solve. The book is written for students of theoretical and applied physics, and corresponds to the curricula of the theoretical courses "Field theory" and "Electrodynamics" for physics undergraduates. It can also be useful for students of other disciplines, in particular, those in which physics is one of the base subjects"--
