Signal processing in digital communications
This is the first book to introduce and integrate advanced digital signal processing (DSP) and classification together, and the only volume to introduce state-of-the-art transforms including DFT, FFT, DCT, DHT, PCT, CDT, and ODT together for DSP and communication applications. You get step-by-step guidance in discrete-time domain signal processing and frequency domain signal analysis; digital filter design and adaptive filtering; multirate digital processing; and statistical signal classification. It also helps you overcome problems associated with multirate A/D and D/A converters
