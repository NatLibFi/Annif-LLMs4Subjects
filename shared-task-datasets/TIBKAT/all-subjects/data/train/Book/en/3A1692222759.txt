Modern C
Getting started -- The principal structure of a program -- Everything is about control -- Expressing computations -- Basic values and data -- Derived data types -- Functions -- C library functions -- Style -- Organization and documentation -- Pointers -- The C memory model -- Storage -- More involved processing and IO -- Performance -- Function-like macros -- Variations in control flow -- Threads -- Atomic access and memory consistency.
"Modern C introduces you to modern day C programming, emphasizing the unique and new features of this powerful language. For new C coders, it starts with fundamentals like structure, grammar, compilation, and execution. From there, you'll advance to control structures, data types, operators, and functions, as you gain a deeper understanding of what's happening under the hood. In the final chapters, you'll explore performance considerations, reentrancy, atomicity, threads, and type-generic programming. You'll code as you go with concept-reinforcing exercises and skill-honing challenges along the way." --
