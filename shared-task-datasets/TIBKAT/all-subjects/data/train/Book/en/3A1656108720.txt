C-H and C-X bond functionalization : transition metal mediation
Cross-coupling reactions involving C-H and C-X bond functionalisation are commonplace in natural product synthesis and natural products, therapeutic agents, biological probes, and advanced materials. Much attention has been given to understanding the mechanistic strategies used to achieve this, making this a hot topic in recent years. In this edited book, contributions from across the globe examine these strategies, with a particular focus on palladium and copper, as well as iron u an emerging element in this field. Reviewing the recent literature, the book presents an in-depth understanding o
