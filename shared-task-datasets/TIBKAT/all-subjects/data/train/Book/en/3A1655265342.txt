Minimax and Monotonicity
Focussing on the theory (both classical and recent) of monotone multifunctions on a (possibly nonreflexive) Banach space, this book looks at the big convexification of a multifunction; convex functions associated with a multifunction; minimax theorems as a tool in functional analysis and convex analysis. It includes new results on the existence of continuous linear functionals; the conjugates, biconjugates and subdifferentials of convex lower semicontinuous functions, Fenchel duality; (possibly unbounded) positive linear operators from a Banach space into its dual; the sum of maximal monotone operators, and a list of open problems. The reader is expected to know basic functional analysis and calculus of variations, including the Bahn-Banach theorem, Banach-Alaoglu theorem, Ekeland's variational principle
