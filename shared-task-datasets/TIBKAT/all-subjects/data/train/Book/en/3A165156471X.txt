Statistical orbit determination
1 Orbit Determination Concepts -- 2 The Orbit Problem -- 3 Observations -- 4 Fundamentals of Orbit Determination -- 5 Square-root Solution Methods -- 6 Consider Covariance Analysis -- A Probability and Statistics -- B Review of Matrix Concepts -- C Equations of Motion -- D Constants -- E Analytical Theory for Near-Circular Orbits -- F Example of State Noise and Dynamic Model Compensation -- G Solution of the Linearized Equations of Motion -- H ECI and ECF Transformation
This book presents fundmentals of orbit determination--from weighted least squares approaches (Gauss) to today's high-speed computer algorithms that provide accuracy within a few centimeters. Numerous examples and problems are provided to enhance readers' understanding of the material. *Covers such topics as coordinate and time systems, square root filters, process noise techniques, and the use of fictitious parameters for absorbing un-modeled and incorrectly modeled forces acting on a satellite. *Examples and exercises serve to illustrate the principles throughout each chapter. *Detailed solutions to end-of-chapter exercises available to instructors
