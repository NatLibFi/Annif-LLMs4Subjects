Although extensively studied for more than a hundred years, an explosion of ideas related to composite materials in the last four decades has dramatically increased our understanding of the relationship between the properties of the constituent materials, the underlying microstructure of a composite, and the overall effective (electrical, thermal, elastic) moduli which govern the macroscopic behavior. This book surveys these exciting developments at the frontier of mathematics and presents many new results
