Applied linear algebra, probability and statistics : a volume in honour of C.R. Rao and Arbind K. Lal
This book focuses on research in linear algebra, statistics, matrices, graphs and their applications. Many chapters in the book feature new findings due to applications of matrix and graph methods. The book also discusses rediscoveries of the subject by using new methods. Dedicated to Prof. Calyampudi Radhakrishna Rao (C.R. Rao) who has completed 100 years of legendary life and continues to inspire us all and Prof. Arbind K. Lal who has sadly departed us too early, it has contributions from collaborators, students, colleagues and admirers of Professors Rao and Lal. With many chapters on generalized inverses, matrix analysis, matrices and graphs, applied probability and statistics, and the history of ancient mathematics, this book offers a diverse array of mathematical results, techniques and applications. The book promises to be especially rewarding for readers with an interest in the focus areas of applied linear algebra, probability and statistics.
