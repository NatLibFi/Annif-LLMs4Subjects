Mesoscale-convective processes in the atmosphere
"This is the first modern textbook devoted solely to mesoscale-convective processes in the atmosphere. Such processes are realized in the form of thunderstorms and associated phenomena. Thunderstorms are dynamic and fast evolving, and can have high societal impact. For this reason it is becoming increasingly important that current and future generations of atmospheric scientists have a deep understanding of the dynamics, observations, and prediction of these phenomena. The book presents in-depth descriptions of the formation, dynamics, and qualitative characteristics of convective phenomena such as supercell thunderstorms and mesoscale convective systems. Although the descriptions pertain largely to the extratropical atmosphere, examples of related tropical phenomena are given for comparison and contrast. To provide a further holistic perspective, separate chapters are also included on mesoscale observations and data analysis, numerical modelling, and the theoretical predictability and actual numerical prediction of mesoscale weather. An additional chapter on interactions and feedbacks addresses ways in which convective storms affect and are affected by external processes, particularly on the synoptic and planetary scale. This textbook provides advanced students, researchers and weather professionals with a modern, accessible treatment of the convective processes that lie within the range of the atmospheric mesoscale"--Provided by publisher
