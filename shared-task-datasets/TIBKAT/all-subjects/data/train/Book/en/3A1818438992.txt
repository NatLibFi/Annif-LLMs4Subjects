Optics of the human eye
"This book describes the optical structure and optical properties of the human eye. For ease of reference, the most commonly useful topics are at the beginning and topics with narrower appeal are placed towards the end. The book is divided into five sections, covering: basic optical structure of the eye, including the refracting components, the pupil, axes, and simple models of the eye; image formation and refraction of the eye, including refractive errors, measurement, and correction; interactions between light and the eye, considering transmission, reflection, and scatter in the media and at the fundus; and aberrations and retinal image quality, and depth-of-field and age-related changes in the optics of the eye. The book concludes with five appendices; these cover mathematics relating to paraxial optics, aberration theory, image quality criteria and refraction across the pupil, and they provide construction data and optical parameters of several schematic eyes"--
