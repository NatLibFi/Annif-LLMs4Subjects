Industrial relations in the new Europe : enlargement, integration and reform
pt. 1. The impact of European integration on industrial relations in member states -- pt. 2. The impact of public management reform ideas in Europe on public sector industrial relations.
This book presents an evidence-based assessment of the impact of EU enlargement on industrial relations and social standards in old and new EU Member States. It combines chapters which give an overview of the process of enlargement/integration and comparative socio-economic data at EU and national level, with chapters that present an in-depth analysis of the impact of European integration on national industrial relations. These in-depth analyses cover both a number of old EU Member States in Western Europe and new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe. The book combines supranational European, Western and Eastern perspectives on the impact of European integration
