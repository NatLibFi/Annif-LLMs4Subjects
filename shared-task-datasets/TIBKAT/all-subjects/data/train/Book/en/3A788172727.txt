The Routledge handbook of environmental economics in Asia
"Problems of climate change, biodiversity, air pollution are clearly growing in globally, but more particularly in Asia because of its economic importance and richness in nature. The growing increasing interest in the environmental and resource economics applied in regions of Asia will make this book an outstanding resource to the existing literature particularly in the fields of environmental and resource economics and the integration of applied content in traditional agricultural and development. At present there is no single handbook or text on the state of current knowledge in environmental economics in Asia or which offers a comprehensive guide to students and academics on the subjects of environmental economics research. This book will help to fill the gap in the existing literature"--
