The impossible Jew : identity and the reconstruction of Jewish American literary history
Introduction: The school of criticism I wouldn't be caught dead in: a polemic on theorizing the field -- 1. Toward a critical semitism: on not answering the Jewish question in literary studies -- 2. Against the dialectic of nation: Abraham Cahan and desire's spectral Jew -- 3. The negative desire of Jewish representation; or, why were the New York intellectuals Jewish? -- 4. Why Jews aren't normal: the unrepresentable future of Philip Roth's the counterlife -- 5. 9/11's stealthy Jews: Jonathan Safran Foer and the irrepresentation of identity
