Anglo-American Cultural Studies
The third edition of Skinner's introduction to Anglo-American cultural studies has been thoroughly revised to include Brexit, Trump, the pandemic, and the war in Ukraine. This standard textbook now includes new full-color graphics as well as updated recommendations for further reading and watching at the end of each chapter. Anglo-American Cultural Studies refreshingly breaks with the tradition of dry impersonal summaries of facts and figures to provide German students with first-hand experience of the personal tone and humor that can characterize academic discourse in Britain and the US.
