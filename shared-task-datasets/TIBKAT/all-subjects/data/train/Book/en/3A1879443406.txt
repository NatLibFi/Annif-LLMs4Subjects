Technological change and mature industrial regions : firms, knowledge and policy
Technological Change and Mature Industrial Regions explicitly adopts an inter-disciplinary approach to analysing the structural transformation of mature regions. The major focus of the book is from an economics perspective, but it also employs sociological analyses, business history approaches and technological analyses. It critically considers the identification and development of regional capabilities and regional policy initiatives for mature industrial areas in the context of globalisation and technological change. Specific cases from a range of different countries help to distinguish which aspects of mature regions' technology, knowledge or structure are region-specific, and which are more generally applicable to mature industrial regions throughout the world. The book will prove to be invaluable for academic researchers as well as government and policy communities
