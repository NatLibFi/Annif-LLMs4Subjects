The sociology of Islam : collected essays of Bryan S. Turner
“Taking a thematic approach, Bryan S. Turner draws together his writings which explore the relationship between Islam and the ideas of Western social thinkers. Turner engages with the broad categories of capitalism, orientalism, modernity, gender, and citizenship among others, as he examines how Muslims adapt to changing times and how Islam has come to be managed by those in power.” (Publisher's description)
