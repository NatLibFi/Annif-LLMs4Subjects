Guide through the nanocarbon jungle : buckyballs, nanotubes, graphene and beyond
"Buckyball, onion, nanobud, peapod -- what are these buzzwords about?" was a question posed to me many times over the last decade or two. This concise glossary is designed to provide the first answer to these and similar questions, and be a guide through the jungle of the jargon that has evolved in the busy field of carbon nanostructures. It does not provide a complete review of the nanocarbon field nor should it be mistaken for a textbook. The main intention is to provide useful information about keywords and explain basic concepts in nanocarbon science to all interested parties.
