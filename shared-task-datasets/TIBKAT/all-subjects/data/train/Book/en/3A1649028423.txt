Severe Injuries to the Limbs : Staged Treatment
Modern weapons and high-energy accidents inflict devastating damage to soft tissue and bone. The gold standard for stabilizing high-energy fractures is immediate external fixation followed by thorough debridement of soft tissues and dead bone and irrigation, since these injuries are always grossly contaminated. The next stage of treatment ? the coverage of exposed bone by vital soft tissue and definitive skeletal stabilization and reconstruction ? can be a complex surgical challenge. The protocol of staged external fixation developed by the authors: primary temporary unilateral tubular stabili
This book details the protocol of staged external fixation developed by the authors: primary temporary unilateral tubular stabilization followed by definitive circular Ilizarov (hybrid) fixation. Coverage explains and fully illustrates the rationale and advantages of a logical progression of surgical steps. The book draws from an archive of clinical photographs and X-ray documentation that cover all steps in a large variety of complex cases.
