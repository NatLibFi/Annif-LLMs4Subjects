International perspectives on university efficiency
Resource efficiency and economic considerations are a major topic in higher education systems. Universities are urged to improve their outputs as well as their processes. This book provides a multi-perspective collection of research approaches regarding university efficiency. Though based in Germany and connected to the BMBF research project HELENA at the University of Duisburg-Essen, many contributions provide international comparisons and analysis approaches. Also, most contributions are associated with the annual conferences of EAIR, the European Higher Education Society.
