Responsive human rights : vulnerability, ill-treatment and the ECtHR
"Who is a vulnerable person in human rights law? The question, much examined in international law, is surprisingly under explored in European human rights law. This important new work remedies that by assessing the treatment of vulnerability by the European Court of Human Rights. It explores legal-philosophical understandings of the topic, providing a theoretical foundation to the question. Not confining itself to the abstract, however, it provides a bridge from the theoretical to the practical by undertaking a comprehensive examination of the Court's approach under art. 3. It pays particular attention to its understanding of human dignity. Well written and compellingly argued, this is an important new book for all scholars of European human rights."--
