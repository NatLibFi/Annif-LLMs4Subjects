Advanced Statistical Steganalysis
Steganography is the art and science of hiding information in inconspicuous cover data so that even the existence of a secret message is kept confidential, and steganalysis is the task of detecting secret messages in covers. This research monograph focuses on the role of cover signals, the distinguishing feature that requires us to treat steganography and steganalysis differently from other secrecy techniques. The main theoretical contribution of this book is a proposal to structure approaches to provably secure steganography according to their implied assumptions on the limits of the adversar
