Handbuch Sprache im urbanen Raum
"This handbook discusses urbanity as a communicative and linguistically constituted concept. Special focus is placed on the integration of urban linguistics into the traditional disciplines of linguistic research and the presentation of urbanity as an interdisciplinary phenomenon. Covering relevant concepts from international research with reference to empirical data, the handbook imparts basic knowledge on a key theme in contemporary linguistics."--Publisher's website
