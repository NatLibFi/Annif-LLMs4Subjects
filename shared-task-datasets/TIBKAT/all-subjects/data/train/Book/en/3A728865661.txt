Reinforcement and systemic machine learning for decision making
"Reinforcement and Systemic Machine Learning for Decision Making explores a newer and growing avenue of machine learning algorithm in the area of computational intelligence. This book focuses on reinforcement and systemic learning to build a new learning paradigm, which makes effective use of these learning methodologies to increase machine intelligence and help us in building the advance machine learning applications. Illuminating case studies reflecting the authors' industrial experiences and pragmatic downloadable tutorials are available for researchers and professionals"--
Reinforcement and Systemic Machine Learning for Decision MakingThere are always difficulties in making machines that learn from experience. Complete information is not always available--or it becomes available in bits and pieces over a period of time. With respect to systemic learning, there is a need to understand the impact of decisions and actions on a system over that period of time. This book takes a holistic approach to addressing that need and presents a new paradigm--creating new learning applications and, ultimately, more intelligent machines. The first book of its kind in this new and g
