"Alan Turing, the brilliant mathematician who cracked the German Enigma code, enabled a group of British code breakers to shorten World War II by years. That alone would be enough to secure Turing's place in history, but his genius did not stop there. He launched modern computer science through his creation of the universal Turing machine and the Imitation Game, an artificial-intelligence test that is still in use today."--
