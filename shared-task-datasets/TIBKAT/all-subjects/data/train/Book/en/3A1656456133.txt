In this challenging book, the authors demonstrate that economists tend to misunderstand capital. Frank Knight was an exception, as he argued that because all resources are more or less durable and have uncertain future uses they can consequently be classed as capital. Thus, capital rather than labor is the real source of creativity, innovation, and accumulation. But capital is also a phenomenon in time and in space. Offering a new and path-breaking theory, they show how durable capital with large spatial domains - infrastructural capital such as institutions, public knowledge, and networks - can help explain the long-term development of cities and nations. This is a crucial book for spatial and institutional economists and anyone working outside the neoclassical mainstream. Academics and students of economic history, urban and regional planning, and economic sociology will also find it an illuminating and accessible exploration of time, space and capital
