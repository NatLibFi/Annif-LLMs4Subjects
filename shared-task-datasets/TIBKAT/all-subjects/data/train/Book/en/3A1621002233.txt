Gas phase NMR
This book covers the recent NMR studies with the application of gaseous molecules. Among the comprehensively discussed aspects of the area it includes in particular: new multinuclear experiments that deliver spectral parameters of isolated molecules and provide the most accurate values of nuclear magnetic shielding, isotropic spinspin coupling and relaxation times; advanced, precise and correct theoretical descriptions of spectral parameters of molecules as well as the application of gas-phase NMR measurements to chemical analysis and medicine. The progress of research in these fields is enormous and has rapidly changed our knowledge and understanding of molecular parameters in NMR spectroscopy. For example, accurate studies of the shielding for isolated molecules allow the exact determination of nuclear magnetic dipole moments, the calculated values of spectral parameters can be verified by precise gas-phase NMR measurements, and the application of hyperpolarized noble gases provides excellent MRI pictures of lungs. Aimed at graduates and researchers in spectroscopy, analytical chemistry and those researching the applications of NMR in medicine, this book presents the connections between sophisticated experiments, the theory of magnetic parameters and the exploration of new methods in practice
