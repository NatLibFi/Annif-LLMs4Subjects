Ageing and Employment Policies/Vieillissement et politiques de l'emploi: Czech Republic 2004
This report, part of a series covering around 20 OECD countries, contains a survey of the Czech Republic's main barriers to employment for older workers, an assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of existing measures to overcome these barriers, and a set of policy recommendations to further action by public authorities and social partners.  These recommendations are designed to alleviate some of the pension and health care pressures governments are facing because of ageing populations.
