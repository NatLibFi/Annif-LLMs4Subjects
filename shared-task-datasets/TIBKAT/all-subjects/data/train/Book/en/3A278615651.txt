The Cambridge handbook of contemporary China
The paradox of contemporary China - its openness to Western technology, yet its rejection of Western democratic ideals - serves to make China appear remote and inaccessible to those outside. The country's vast area and population only accentuate these difficulties. The Cambridge Handbook of Contemporary China presents up-to-date information on all aspects of Chinese life since 1949, with particular emphasis on the 1980s; its major strength is its contemporary focus and easy-to-use format. Useful maps and tabled statistics accompany the text, which is divided into clearly defined categoried. Designed for students, specialists, educationalists, journalists and those in business and government as well as the general reader, the Handbook provides easy access to information on all areas of Chinese life and is a good starting-point for research.
