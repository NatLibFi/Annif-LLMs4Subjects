Protein kinases and stress signaling in plants : functional genomic perspective
"In the post-genomic era, one of the major challenges is investigation and understanding of multiple genes and gene families regulating a particular physiological and developmental aspect of plant life cycle. One of the important physiological processes is regulation of stress response, which leads to adaptation or adjustment in response to adverse stimuli. With the holistic understanding of the signaling pathways involving kinases, one gene family or multiple genes or gene families, plant biologists can lay a foundation for designing and generating future crops, which can withstand the higher degree of environmental stresses (especially abiotic stresses, which are the major cause of crop loss throughout the world) without losing crop yield and productivity. In this proposed book, leading plant biologists in the field of stress mediated phosphorylation by kinases will detail the important tasks to elucidate aspects of stress signaling using geneomics and functional genomic approaches"--
