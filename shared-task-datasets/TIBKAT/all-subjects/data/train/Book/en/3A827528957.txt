The Oxford handbook of the literature of the U.S. South
"The Oxford Handbook to the Literature of the U.S. South brings together contemporary views of the literature of the U.S. South in a series of essays employing critical tools not traditionally used in approaching southern literature. It assumes ideas of the South-global, multicultural, plural: more Souths than South-that would not have been embraced two or three decades ago, and it similarly expands the idea of literature itself" --
