The Collegial Tradition in the Age of Mass Higher Education
This book explores the development of the collegial tradition within the context of mass higher education. Although the collegial tradition has been determined above all by the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, in its various forms it has found sustenance in many different systems and institutions of higher education. Most critical are the integral values and practices that shape both institutional governance and the pursuit of teaching, learning and research
This book examines the contemporary pressures to which models of higher education have to respond. Within this broad context the book analyses the challenges that the collegial tradition faces and how, within differing national systems, it is responding to those challenges. The underlying purpose is to ask the question whether the collegial tradition is intrinsic to the idea of the university. Will it survive and, if so, in what form? --Book Jacket
