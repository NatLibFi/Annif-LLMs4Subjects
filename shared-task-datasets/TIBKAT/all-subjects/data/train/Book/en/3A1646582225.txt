The Local Cardiac Renin Angiotensin-Aldosterone System
Until recently, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has been considered a systemic endocrine hormonal system exclusively. It is now known that each component of the renin-angiotensin system is produced, synthesized and indeed, present in many organisms including the heart and vessels. This volume presents the most recent clinical and laboratory experiences of the leading physicians and investigators in the field of the local cardiac renin-angiotensin aldosterone system. Cardiovascular, renal and hypertension oriented physicians, investigators and scientists would find this book of interest.
