Fiber-optic communication systems
"The fifth edition introduces new developments in fiber optics communications not covered or not sufficiently covered in the previous edition. Chapters 1 through 9 have relatively minor updates or changes. The major updates are found in Chapters 10, 11, and 12, where topics relating to coherence detection, space division multiplexing, and more advanced topics are extensively discussed. In particular, in Chapter 10 the author has systematically organized the knowledge generated in recent years due to the explosive commercial adoption of coherence detection. In addition, space division multiplexing is a technology that has attracted major research and development efforts but is still in need of comprehensive treatment for new learners."--
