Deployable structures
"Deployable structures can expand and contract due to their geometrical, material and mechanical properties - offering the potential to create truly transforming environments. This book looks at the cutting edge of the subject, examining the different types of deployable structures and numerous design approaches." Includes two- and three-dimensional structures, colloapsible (klappbare), kinetic (kinetische), inflatable (aufblasbare) structures, origami and paper pleating techniques, biomimetics of plants and animals ...
