Human-in-the-loop : probabilistic modeling of an aerospace mission outcome
Improvements in safety in the air and in space can be achieved through better ergonomics, better work environments, and other efforts of the traditional avionic psychology that directly affect human behaviors and performance. Not limited to just the aerospace field, this book discusses adaptive probabilistic predictive modeling in human-in-the-loop situations. This involves situations where human performance and equipment reliability contributes jointly to the success and safety of a mission. This book gets you familiar with a new, powerful, flexible, and effective approach to making outcomes from missions successful and safe--
