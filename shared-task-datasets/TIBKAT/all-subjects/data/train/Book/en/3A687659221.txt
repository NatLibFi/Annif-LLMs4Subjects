Two-dimensional nanostructures
"Discussing different fabrication methods for developing 2-D nanostructures, this book is the first of its kind to focus on the "size effect" of 2-D nanostructures. Using accessible language and simple figures, it classifies different methods by their ability to control the sizes of 2-D nanostructures and thus the relative properties of the resulting materials. The book also presents applications in both nanotechnology and materials science and covers mechanical, electrochemical, and physical properties and usage, including thin films and nanostructured coatings"--
