Geospatial data analytics and urban applications
This book highlights advanced applications of geospatial data analytics to address real-world issues in urban society. With a connected world, we are generating spatial at unprecedented rates which can be harnessed for insightful analytics which define the way we analyze past events and define the future directions. This book is an anthology of applications of spatial data and analytics performed on them for gaining insights which can be used for problem solving in an urban setting. Each chapter is contributed by spatially aware data scientists in the making who present spatial perspectives drawn on spatial big data. The book shall benefit mature researchers and student alike to discourse a variety of urban applications which display the use of machine learning algorithms on spatial big data for real-world problem solving
