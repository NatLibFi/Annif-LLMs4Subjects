Plasma Polarization Spectroscopy
You'll learn all the underlying science and how to perform all the latest analytical techniques that plasma polarization spectroscopy (PPS) offers with this new book. The authors report on recent results of laboratory experiments, keeping you current with all the latest developments and applications in the field. There is also a timely discussion centered on instrumentation that is crucial to your ability to perform successful PPS experiments.
Plasma Polarization Spectroscopy (PPS) is now becoming a standard diagnostic technique for working with laboratory plasmas. This new area needs a comprehensive framework, both experimental and theoretical. This book reviews the historical development of PPS, develops a general theoretical formulation to deal with this phenomenon, along with an overview of relevant cross sections, and reports on laboratory experiments so far performed. It also includes various facets that are interesting from this standpoint, e.g. X-ray lasers and effects of microwave irradiation. It also offers a timely discus
