Security and law : legal and ethical aspects of public security, cyber security and critical infrastructure security
Security and law against the backdrop of technological development.00Few people doubt the importance of the security of a state, its society and its organizations, institutions and individuals, as an unconditional basis for personal and societal flourishing. Equally, few people would deny being concerned by the often occurring conflicts between security and other values and fundamental freedoms and rights, such as individual autonomy or privacy for example. While the search for a balance between these public values is far from new, ICT and data-driven technologies have undoubtedly given it a new impulse. These technologies have a complicated and multifarious relationship with security. This book combines theoretical discussions of the concepts at stake and case studies following the relevant developments of ICT and data-driven technologies.
