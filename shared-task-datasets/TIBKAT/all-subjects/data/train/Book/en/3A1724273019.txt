Progress in Ultrafast Intense Laser Science XV
Femtosecond laser filamentation induced phenomena and applications -- Population inversion mechanism in air-lasing -- Bichromatic control of free electron wave packets -- Light-dressed spectroscopy of Na2 -- Coherent nonlinear processes in metal-semiconductor hybrid nanostructures -- Coherent control of nonadiabatic dynamics of electron-phonon systems by quantized light Ô¨Åeld -- Application of CR-39 solid state nuclear track detectors to laser-driven ion acceleration experiments -- Towards laser intensity calibration using high-field ionization.
This book covers a diverse cross section of this interdisciplinary research field, with contributions grouped into four categories: laser-induced filamentation; atoms and molecules in a laser field; interaction of solid materials with a coherent light field; and ion acceleration and ionization of atoms in super intense laser fields. This book series presents up-to-date reviews of advances in this interdisciplinary research field, spanning atomic and molecular physics, as well as molecular and optical science, which have been stimulated by the recent developments in ultrafast laser technologies. Each book compiles peer-reviewed articles by researchers at the forefront of their particular subfields. All the chapters include an overview to allow graduate students and researchers unfamiliar with the subfield to grasp the importance and attractions of the topic covered, followed by reports of cutting-edge discoveries.
