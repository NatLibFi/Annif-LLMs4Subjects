Membrane desalination : from nanoscale to real world applications
"This book aims to provide details about membrane desalination processes, starting from basic concepts leading to real world implementation. Chapters cover novel research topics such as biomimetic and nanocomposite membranes, nanostructured fillers for mixed matrix membranes, advanced characterization techniques and molecular modelling. Additionally, engineering and economical aspects of desalination as well as the exploitation of green energy sources are also thoroughly presented. This books targets in bridging the gap between the everyday research laboratory practices with practical application demands, so that the readers gain a global perspective of all desalination challenges"--
