MRI in Clinical Practice
MRI is a continually evolving and expanding subject making an ever-increasing impact on medical practice. There are many comprehensive large MRI textbooks on the market but there is a distinct lack of short pocket-sized reference books to suit the growing number of people from various disciplines working in the medical imaging field today. This book provides an easily accessible source of reference material to supplement existing large texts.
"MRI in Clinical Practice"provides an easily accessible source of reference material to supplement existing texts, distilling a wide breadth of theoretical and practical information into a pocket-sized manual.The book covers the basic Physics behind MRI, quality assurance, up-to-date safety guidelines and a useful gallery of image artefacts. Part of the book focuses on the specific areas of the body in which MRI is currently exploited, describing how MRI is performed in practice.  As well as covering routine clinical techniques, the latest advanced methods (e.g. spectroscopy, fMRI, diffusion, high field MRI) are discussed and placed into the context of clinical application.Written from both a Physics and Radiological point-of-view, the book has a wide multidisciplinary appeal and is specifically targeted at MRI practitioners or trainees, as well as post-graduate students, physicists, radiographers and radiologists.
