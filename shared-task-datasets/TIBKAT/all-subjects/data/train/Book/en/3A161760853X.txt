Evaluating gas network capacities
"This book deals with a simple sounding question whether a certain amount of gas can be transported by a given pipeline network. While well studied for a single pipeline, this question gets extremely difficult if we consider a meshed nation wide gas transportation network, taking into account all the technical details and discrete decisions, as well as regulations, contracts, and varying demand. This book describes several mathematical models to answer these questions, discusses their merits and disadvantages, explains the necessary technical and regulatory background, and shows how to solve this question using sophisticated mathematical optimization algorithms."--
