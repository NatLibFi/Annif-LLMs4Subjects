Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics and Fluctuation Kinetics : Modern Trends and Open Questions
This book addresses research challenges in the rapidly developing area of nonequilibrium thermodynamics and fluctuation kinetics. This cross-disciplinary field comprises various topics, ranging from fundamental problems of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and thermodynamics to multiple applications in plasma, fluid mechanics, nonlinear science, systems of dissipative particles, and high-Q resonators. The purpose of this book is to bring together world-leading experts in the above fields to initiate a cross-fertilization among these active research areas. The book is dedicated to and honours the memory of Professor Slava Belyi who passed away unexpectedly on May 20, 2020. He was pioneering the theory of nonequilibrium fluctuations, in particular the application of the Callen-Welton fluctuation-dissipation theorem to nonequilibrium systems and its generalization. This and related problems also feature in the book.
