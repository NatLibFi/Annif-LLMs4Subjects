Computational and Instrumental Methods in EPR
Computational and Instrumental Methods in EPR is devoted to both instrumentation and computation aspects of EPR, while addressing applications such as spin relaxation time measurements. However, this is the first comprehensive volume to offer practical, non-invasive spectroscopic methods of analyzing the rheology of biopolymers: comparative studies of polymer fluidity using traditional methods (e.g. viscosity) and nuclear magnetic resonance.
The foundation for understanding the function and dynamics of biological systems is not only knowledge of their structure, but the new methodologies and applications used to determine that structure. Electron magnetic resonance has been greatly facilitated by the introduction of advances in instrumentation and better computational tools, such as the increasingly widespread use of the density matrix formalism. Computational and Instrumental Methods in EPR is devoted to both instrumentation and computation aspects of EPR, while addressing applications such as spin relaxation time measurements, the measurement of hyperfine interaction parameters, and the recovery of Mn(II) spin Hamiltonian parameters via spectral simulation.
