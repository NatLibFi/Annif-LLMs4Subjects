Snow crystals : a case study in spontaneous structure formation
"Despite substantial, cross-disciplinary interest in the subject as a scientific case study, surprisingly little has been written on the science of snowflakes and their formation. For materials scientists, snowflakes constitute archetypal examples of crystal growth; for chemists, the site of complex molecular dynamics at the ice surface. Physicists can learn from snowflake symmetry and self-assembly; geologists study snow as mineral crystals; and biologists can even gain insight into the creation of shape and order in organisms. In the humble snowflake are condensed many of the processes-many of them still not fully understood-that govern the organization of classical systems at all levels of the natural world. This book by Kenneth Libbrecht-inarguably the world's foremost expert on the subject-will be the authoritative text on the science of snow crystals. It will cover all of the physical processes that govern the life of a snowflake, including how snowflakes grow and why they have the shapes they do. It will also outline techniques for creating and experimenting with snow crystals, both with computer models and in the lab. Featuring hundreds of color illustrations, the book will be comprehensive and is sure to become definitive resource for researchers for years, if not decades, to come"--
