The infinity puzzle : [the personalities, politics, and extraordinary science behind the Higgs boson]
"The second half of the 20th century was a febrile time in theoretical physics. Quantum electrodynamics - the great achievement of the 1930s - was in trouble, yielding meaningless answers about the electron. How to resolve this 'infinity puzzle' and unify electromagnetism, the Weak Force, and the Strong Force? In this vivid account, Frank Close describes the personalities, the intense competition, the frustrations and sudden insights, and the high politics and vagaries of chance that led to the world's most expensive experiment."--P.
