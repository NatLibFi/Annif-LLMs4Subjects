Oxide dispersion strengthened refractory alloys
"Refractory metals such as W, Mo, Ta, Nb, Re have immense potential for application in plasma facing material in nuclear reactors, defense materials, aviation counterweights, heating elements in furnaces, and so forth. This book presents a wide perspective of oxide dispersion strengthened refractory alloys fabrication and critical properties. It provides a comprehensive road map for an appropriate basis for alloy design, process parameter selection, fabrication route, and deformation behavior for oxide dispersion strengthened refractory alloys. It further covers achievement of application-oriented properties and critical process regulating parameters for development of sustainable materials. Features: covers development of oxide dispersion strengthened sustainable material to withstand high temperature environment, describes stimulating application oriented final mechanical properties, illustrates fabrication of alloys through effective route to achieve desired properties, presents in-depth comprehension of deformation behavior at ambient and high temperature, and explores critical applications of the alloys in nuclear reactors, defense, and aviation sectors. This book is geared towards graduate students and researchers in in high temperature materials, mechanics, metallurgy, powder metallurgy, and physical metallurgy"--
