Vaginal surgery for incontinence and prolapse
Vaginal Surgery for Incontinence and Prolapse provides the most up-to-date and comprehensive information on vaginal anatomy and physiology, practical guidelines for office evaluation of incontinence and prolapse, and a series of detailed chapters on reconstructive procedures for urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence and prolapse. Other vaginal procedures involving urethral reconstruction, fistula, diverticulum, among other topics, will be covered as these entities also relate to urinary incontinence. The challenging topic of 'recurrence' is also addressed. This book has an immediate appeal to both urological and gynecological surgeons involved in training or currently delivering surgical care to women with pelvic floor dysfunction.
