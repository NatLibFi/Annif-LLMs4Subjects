Dendroecology : principles and practice
"This volume is a must have for professionals and students in forestry, ecology, dendrochronology, biology, geomorphology, and anyone else interested in tree-ring analysis as a practical research tool in land-use planning and natural resource management. This volume has a logic to it that starts at square one, including the collection and processing of cores, and then illustrates how and which data can be applied to questions in the field. The emphasis on using basal area increment (BAI), rather than ring-width indices alone, sets the book apart, and provides an extremely useful methodology. Discussions of growth trajectories based on BAI, changes in growth form, the measurement and applicability of complacent versus sensitive ring series, and the impact of environmental variables upon ring anatomy are discussed with practical examples provided. A wide range of applications include forest stand dynamics, archaeological dating, hydrology, and geomorphic phenomena. Give someone an increment core and a way to measure rings, and this book will guide them to the attainment of useful ecological information"--
