Wisdom on the move : late antique traditions in multicultural conversation : essays in honor of Samuel Rubenson
Wisdom on the Move' explores the complexity and flexibility of wisdom traditions in Late Antiquity and beyond. This book studies how sayings, maxims and expressions of spiritual insight travelled across linguistic and cultural borders, between different religions and milieus, and how this multicultural process reshaped these sayings and anecdotes. 'Wisdom on the Move' takes the reader on a journey through late antique religious traditions, from manuscript fragments and folios via the monastic cradle of Egypt, across linguistic and cultural barriers, through Jewish and Biblical wisdom, monastic sayings, and Muslim interpretations. Particular attention is paid to the monastic 'Apophthegmata Patrum', arguably the most important genre of wisdom literature in the early Christian world
