Factorization Method in Quantum Mechanics
This book introduces the factorization method in quantum mechanics at an advanced level, with the aim of putting mathematical and physical concepts and techniques like the factorization method, Lie algebras, matrix elements and quantum control at the reader's disposal. For this purpose, the text provides a comprehensive description of the factorization method and its wide applications in quantum mechanics which complements the traditional coverage found in quantum mechanics textbooks.
