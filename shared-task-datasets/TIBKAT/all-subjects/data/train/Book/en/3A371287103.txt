Simulating and generating motions of human figures
This book focuses on two issues related to human figures: realtime dynamics computation and interactive motion generation. In spite of the growing interest in human figures as both physical robots and virtual characters, standard algorithms and tools for their kinematics and dynamics computation have not been investigated very much. "Simulating and Generating Motions of Human Figures" presents original algorithms to simulate, analyze, generate and control motions of human figures, all focusing on realtime and interactive computation. The book provides practical methods for contact/collision simulation essential for the simulation of humanoid robots and virtual characters and ageneral framework for online, interactive motion generation of human figures based on the dynamics simulation algorithms. TOC:Introduction.- Inverse and Forward Dynamics of General Closed Kinematic Chains.- Link Connectivity Description for Structure- Varying Kinematic Chains.- Parallel O (logN) Formulation of Forward Dynamics.- Interactive Computation of Contact Force for Rigid Collision/Contact Model.- Implicit Integration for Soft Collision/Contact Model.- Interactive Motion Generation via Dynamics Filter.- Synergetic Choreography of Human Figures.- Synergetic Choreography with Dynamics.- Controlling a Marionette with Human Motion Capture Data.- Conclusion and Future Work
