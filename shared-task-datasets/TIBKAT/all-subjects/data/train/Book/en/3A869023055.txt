Molecular pathology of diabetes mellitus
Diabetes, already a prevalent disease worldwide, is increasing at a rate consistent with a global epidemic. The number of people affected is expected to double in the next 15 years to about 200 million. The disease is already one of the commonest causes of kidney failure, blindness and amputations. There is an urgent need to prevent either the development of these complications or the disease itself. Dramatic advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetes have led to the hope that diabetes can indeed be prevented. Several major international collaborative projects have been initiated with this aim. In this book, an outstanding group of international scientists provide a broad outline of the advances in basic science which underpin these projects. The book offers a clear, comprehensive and up-to-date account for the interested clinician and scientist, and will be invaluable as a reference book for those working in the field.
