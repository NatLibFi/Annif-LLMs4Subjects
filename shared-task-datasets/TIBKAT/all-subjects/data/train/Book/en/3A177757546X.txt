Human behavior in the social environment : perspectives on development and the life course
"The new, sixth edition of Human Behavior in the Social Environment: Perspectives on Development and the Life Course deepens students' understanding of the major theories, themes, and issues related to people and how they interact and change over the life span and with respect to their social environments. The new edition has been updated to reflect and build on new developments and awareness related to systemic racism and social justice and mental health and health-related concerns that were exacerbated and exposed by the pandemic. The text also comes with a rich companion website that includes support materials and six unique cases that encourage students to learn by doing and to apply their knowledge of human behavior to practice. The book works to:  Provide balanced, thorough, and accessible coverage of the major theories and perspectives that social workers utilize to understand and address the myriad problems their clients encounter. Integrate crucial information on life course development, associated development phases, and related problem areas into a single, engaging framework. Stimulate classroom discussion and application around key concepts, themes, and issues. The content in this text is supported by a range of fully updated instructor-led and student resources - including presentations; sample test questions; recommended readings; and links for further study/applications to current events - that are available on its companion website, www.routledgesw.com. Comprehensive, engaging, and filled with examples for students to learn how to apply their burgeoning knowledge to realistic practice issues, the new edition of Human Behavior in the Social Environment remains invaluable as a tool for courses by the same name in undergraduate and graduate curriculums"--
