Single-use technology in biopharmaceutical manufacture
"This book gives an overview of commonly-used disposables in the manufacture of biopharmaceuticals, their working principles, characteristics, engineering aspects, economics, and applications. With this information, readers will be able to come to an easier decision for or against disposable alternatives and to choose the appropriate system. The book is divided into two parts -- the first is related to basic knowledge about disposable equipment; and the second discusses applications through case studies that illustrate manufacturing, quality assurance, and environmental influence. This revision updates existing information with developments that have taken place since the prior edition as well as presents the latest developments in the field of single-use technology. For example, there is considerable interest in applying single-use devices for microorganisms, human mesenchymal stem cells, and T-cells"--Provided by publisher
