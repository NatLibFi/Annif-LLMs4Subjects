Beyond the dikes : how the Dutch work with water
"There are few countries in the world where water dominates the landscape and national identity as much as in the Netherlands. The vulnerable delta is always being taken back to the drawing board for further adaptation to the water threat. Climate change now instigates a next round of interventions. The classic battle against the water has been replaced by an approach that involves working with the water. This publication is the first to show the sheer size of the Dutch water project and its effects on in the coastal and river landscape. 'Beyond the Dikes: How the Dutch Work with Water' portrays this impressive operation. The book explains 30 interventions along rivers and coastlines - projects that combine aquaculture, cultural history, nature and human use in magnificent water landscapes that are waiting to be explored." -- Publisher's website
