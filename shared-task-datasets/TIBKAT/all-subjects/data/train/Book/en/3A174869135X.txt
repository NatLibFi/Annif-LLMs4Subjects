Anxiety, modern society, and the critical method : toward a theory and practice of critical socioanalysis
Anxiety, Modern Society, and the Critical Method interrogates the historical intersections of political economy, technology, and anxiety. By analyzing and building upon the tools developed by critical theorists to diagnose the symptoms of modern life-such as alienation, anomie, the Protestant ethic, and repression-Joel Michael Crombez convincingly argues for a revitalization of critical social science to better confront the anxiety of life in modern societies. With anxiety typically falling under the purview of psychology and its biomedical approach to treatment, here anxiety is demonstrated to have origins in the totalizing logics of modern society. As such, Crombez provides an interdisciplinary roadmap to diagnose and treat anxiety-which he calls critical socioanalysis-that accounts for the psychosocial complexity of its production
