Interference mitigation in device-to-device communications
"Device-to-Device Communications (D2D) is one of the key enabling technologies for the IoT and 5G which are the next technological marvels for the wireless industry. The performance of these wireless systems is degraded due to the interfering signals from proximity of legacy systems operating in similar frequency bands. Restriction of device form-factor and co-location of a number of electronic components in a small volume further complicates the design and efficiency challenge. These factors should be explored in order to get an efficient D2D solution working at a minimal interference level. This book fills the gap in addressing these important issues and will educate the reader on the most important aspects of the D2D communication and interference management techniques and lay the foundations for future advancements."--
