Games and bereavement : how video games represent attachment, loss, and grief
How can videogames portray love and loss? Games and Bereavement answers this question by analysing five videogames and conducting a participatory design study with grievers. Sabine Harrer offers both theoretical and practical perspectives on videogames and grief and suggests a design model for videogames to include grievers into game development. Overall, she explores how videogames can be used as contemporary medium for personal storytelling
