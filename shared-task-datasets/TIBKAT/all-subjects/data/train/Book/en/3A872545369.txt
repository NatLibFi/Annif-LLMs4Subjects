Foundations for nanoscience and nanotechnology
"This book acts as a stepping-stone to working in or understanding a new world in nanoscience and nanotechnology, opening the door for students and practitioners to develop projects that depend on this understanding. The book can be used at three levels: as an introduction to the nanoscale world, as a resource for understanding the foundations, thereby allowing for moving forward to working in this area, and as a source of recent research in the areas that illustrate foundational principles"--
