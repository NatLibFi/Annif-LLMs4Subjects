Beyond the case : the logics and practices of comparative ethnography
'Beyond the Case' is an edited volume that features internationally known scholars describing how and why they use comparative ethnographic methods in their research. For those new to ethnography, this will aid in selecting and applying an approach that maps on to their research goals. For those already committed to an existing approach or tradition, engagement with alternatives may provide insights into the strengths, weaknesses, and potential avenues for improving their own work.
