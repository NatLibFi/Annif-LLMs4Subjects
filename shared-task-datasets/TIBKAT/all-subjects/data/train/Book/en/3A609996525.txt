Cognitive architecture : from biopolitics to noopolitics ; architecture & mind in the age of communication and information
"Cognitive architecture questions how evolving modalities - from biopolitics to noopolitics - can be mapped upon the city under contemporary conditions of urbanization and globalization. Noopolitics, most broadly understood as a power exerted over the life of the mind, re-configures perception, memory and attention, and also implicates potential ways and means by which neurobiological architecture is undergoing reconfigurations. This volume, motivated by theories such as 'cognitive capitalism' and concepts such as 'neural plasticity', shows how architecture and urban processes and products commingle to form complex systems that produce novel forms of networks that empower the imagination and constitute the cultural landscape. This volume rethinks the relations between form and forms of communication, calling for a new logic of representation; it examines the manner in which information, with its non-hierarchical and distributed format is contributing both to the sculpting of brain and production of mind."--P. 4 of cover
