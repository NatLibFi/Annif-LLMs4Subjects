The book presents the project results from the Cultural Patterns of the European Enlargement Process (CULTPAT). Based on a qualitative, trans-disciplinary, social science approach, the study combines analytical skills from the fields of contemporary anthropology, political science, and history of ideas. The book reconstructs the cultural patterns of identity constructions on a local/regional, national, and European level since 1989/1990. It draws special attention to the fields of political discourse and policy making, which are perceived through conflicting representations on the said levels and seen as a potential danger posed by or to the enlargement process
