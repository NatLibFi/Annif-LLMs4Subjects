Fixed Point Theorems and Applications
This book addresses fixed point theory, a fascinating and far-reaching field with applications in several areas of mathematics. The content is divided into two main parts. The first, which is more theoretical, develops the main abstract theorems on the existence and uniqueness of fixed points of maps. In turn, the second part focuses on applications, covering a large variety of significant results ranging from ordinary differential equations in Banach spaces, to partial differential equations, operator theory, functional analysis, measure theory, and game theory. A final section containing 50 problems, many of which include helpful hints, rounds out the coverage. Intended for Master’s and PhD students in Mathematics or, more generally, mathematically oriented subjects, the book is designed to be largely self-contained, although some mathematical background is needed: readers should be familiar with measure theory, Banach and Hilbert spaces, locally convex topological vector spaces and, in general, with linear functional analysis
