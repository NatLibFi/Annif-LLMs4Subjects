Perl 6 fundamentals : a primer with examples, projects, and case studies
Gain the skills to begin developing Perl 6 applications from the ground up in this hands-on compact book.  You'll learn enough to get started building with Perl 6, using Perl 6's gradual typing, handy object orientation features, powerful parsing capabilities, and human-usable concurrency.  After a short introduction, each chapter develops a small example project, explaining the Perl 6 features used.  When the example is done, you'll explore another aspect, such as optimizing further for readability or testing the code
