Nanoparticles in catalysis
This volume discusses the great potential of metal nanoparticle catalysts for complicated molecular synthesis and reviews the current progress of this field. The development of highly active and stable heterogeneous catalysts is a crucial subject in modern science. However, development of heterogeneous catalysts for fine chemical synthesis has lagged far behind those for bulk chemical process. In recent years metal nanoparticle catalysts have been of great interest in this area due to their unique activity, ease of heterogenization, and robustness. Therefore, metal nanoparticle catalysts are an excellent candidate for the above-mentioned active and robust heterogeneous catalysts and this book provides an overview of this area. The present volume summarizes recent progress on nanoparticle catalysis for various organic transformations from simple redox reactions to complex asymmetric C-C bond forming reactions and also presents seminal studies on new technologies. It comprehensively summarizes advances in metal nanoparticle catalysis across several aspects including reaction manners, mechanistic investigations and new synthetic methodologies to encourage the use of metal nanoparticle catalysts for future organic synthesis. This volume will be of interest to students, researchers and professionals focused on the next-generation of fine chemical synthesis
