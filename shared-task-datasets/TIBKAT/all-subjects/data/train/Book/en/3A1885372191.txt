Particle confinement in penning traps : an introduction
This second edition is an updated and extended introduction to the world of Penning traps and provides an overview of the field, particularly for those entering it. It presents the basics of Penning traps from a fundamental and applied point of view and discusses the variety of methods, technologies and their applications to experiments, particularly in the field of precision spectroscopy across all frequency ranges. The book is written from an experimentalist's point of view, it includes numerous illustrations and extensive references to the available literature to ensure a high degree of breadth and accessibility. The new edition provides, for instance, a new chapter on particle temperature and cooling, new sections on particle dynamics, g-factor measurements, space charge as a confinement limitation, space charge and resonant particle loss, as well as a section on particle loss mechanisms.
