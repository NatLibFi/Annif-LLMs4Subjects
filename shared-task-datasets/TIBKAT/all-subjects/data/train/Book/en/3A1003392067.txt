Fuzzy dual numbers : theory and applications
This is the first book focusing exclusively on fuzzy dual numbers. In addition to offering a concise guide to their properties, operations and applications, it discusses some of their advantages with regard to classical fuzzy numbers, and describes the most important operations together with a set of interesting applications in e.g.
This is the first book focusing exclusively on fuzzy dual numbers. In addition to offering a concise guide to their properties, operations and applications, it discusses some of their advantages with regard to classical fuzzy numbers, and describes the most important operations together with a set of interesting applications in e.g. optimization, decision-making and system design. The book provides students, researchers and professionals the necessary theoretical background to apply this particular subset of fuzzy numbers to decision-making problems involving uncertainty. Further, it shows how to solve selected engineering and management problems and includes detailed numerical examples.
