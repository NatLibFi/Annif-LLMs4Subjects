Electrochemical engineering across scales : from molecules to processes
"In Volume XV in the series "Advances in Electrochemical Science and Engineering" various leading experts from the field of electrochemical engineering share their insights into how different experimental and computational methods are used in transferring molecular-scale discoveries into processes and products.Throughout, the focus is on the engineering problem and method of solution, rather than on the specific application, such that scientists from different backgrounds will benefit from the flow of ideas between the various subdisciplines."--
