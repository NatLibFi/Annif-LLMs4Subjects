Consequences of Microbial Interactions with Hydrocarbons, Oils, and Lipids : Biodegradation and Bioremediation
In this book international experts discuss the state-of-the-art in the biological degradation of hydrocarbons to meet remedial or disposal goals. The work focuses on practical applications, often on globally important scales including the remediation of some of the worldâ€™s largest crude oil spills. Other related chapters discuss important implications of microbial transformation of hydrocarbons, including treatment of high fat processing wastes, impacts of microbial biodegradation activity on industrial processes, and the implications of microbial oil degradation in relation to modern oil extraction processes like hydraulic fracturing of shales and extraction of oil sands
