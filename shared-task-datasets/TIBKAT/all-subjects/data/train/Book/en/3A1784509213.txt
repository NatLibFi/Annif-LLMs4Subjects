Cryogenic heat management
"Cryogenic engineering (cryogenics) is the production, preservation, and use of the cold. As long as there are two different temperatures, and some physical proximity or connection between the two, the heat is flowing. This book presents a comprehensive introduction into the management, preservation and efficient use of the cold, exploring the directing (or redirecting), organizing, promoting or inhibiting this flow of heat in a practical way. This book provides a description of the necessary theory, design methodology and advanced demonstrations (thermodynamics, heat transfer, thermal insulation, fluid mechanics) for many frequently occurring situations in low temperature apparatus. This includes systems that are widely used such as magnets for MRI, HEP, fusion (tokamak systems); space explorations; as well as potential future applications of cryo-life-sciences and chemical industrials. It assumes that the reader has had an undergraduate understanding of thermodynamics, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics, in addition to the mechanics of materials and material science. It will be a valuable guide for those researching or working with low temperature, or cryogenic systems, of postgradutes studying the topic"--
