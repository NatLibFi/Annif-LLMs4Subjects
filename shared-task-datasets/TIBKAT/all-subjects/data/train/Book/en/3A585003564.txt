Understanding economic statistics : an OECD perspective
The media publish economic data on a daily basis. Governments make decisions, affecting millions (and even billions) of people, based on the economic statistics available to them. In countless different ways, economic statistics are a fundamental part of modern life, shaping the way we interpret and react to the world around us. But how are these statistics produced? Who decides which statistics are useful and which are not? And how can we be sure of the quality of the statistics we read? Drawing on OECD statistics in particular, 'Understanding Economic Statistics: an OECD perspective' shows readers how to use statistics to understand the world economy. It gives an overview of the history, key concepts and the main providers of economic statistics. A detailed chapter provides a comprehensive picture of the main statistical activities of the OECD.  Finally, the book explores the crucial issue of quality assurance and the implications for public trust.
