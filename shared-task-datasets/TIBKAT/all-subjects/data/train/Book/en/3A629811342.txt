Chiral sulfur ligands : Asymmetric catalysis
The goal of this book is to show the high potential of chiral sulfur-containing ligands to promote numerous asymmetric catalytic transformations. These ligands can now be recognised as real competitors to the more usual phosphorus- or nitrogen-containing ligands, The goal of this book is to show the high potential of chiral sulfur-containing ligands to promote numerous asymmetric catalytic transformations. The important number of reports appeared in the literature over the last 35 years often highlighted spectacular results in terms of efficiency and enantioselectivity, allowing access to many biologically important molecules, which clearly demonstrates that these ligands can now be recognised as real competitors to the more usual phosphorus- or nitrogen-containing ligands. A key point of reference for post-graduate students, researchers and academics
