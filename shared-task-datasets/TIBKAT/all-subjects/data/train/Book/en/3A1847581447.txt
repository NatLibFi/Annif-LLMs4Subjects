COVID-19 and European banking performance : resilience, recovery and sustainability
"The monograph presents a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on European banking, both at a macro and a micro level. It analyses the impact of the pandemic on bank stability, performance and credit policies, as well as their strategic adjustments to the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. The initial chapters analyse the various governmental responses to the pandemic. Topics of discussion include the scale and scope of the wide range of public policies undertaken to mitigate the consequences of the crisis, and their efficiency in limiting the negative impact of the pandemic on the economy. The results suggest that the extensive public interventions have been largely successful in averting the possible disastrous consequences for the financial sector on a macro level. On a micro level, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the restructuring and recovery of the banking industry started after the 2008 crisis which has had a significant impact on economies around the world, arguably leading to a negative long-lasting effect on sustainable development. To examine this, the book focuses on the impact of the pandemic on bank lending policies, bank stability and performance, and on competitive position of the banks vis a vis the FinTech sector. Offering a thorough overview of the issues that banks will have to face as a consequence of pandemic related macroeconomic and industry adjustments, the book will be of interest to scholars, researchers and students of banking and finance as well as banking specialists concerned with the impact of crises on financial markets, risks and resilience."
