Introduction to plasma dynamics
"Beginning with an introduction to the characteristics and types of plasmas, this text covers the basic models of classical diffuse plasmas used to describe such phenomena as linear and shock waves, stationary flows, elements of plasma chemistry, and principles of plasma lasers. It describes a number of cosmic objects, including planetary vortices and magnetospheres. The book also discusses applied plasma dynamic systems, with special attention given to the history of plasma studies up to the present day. In addition, it reviews problems of controlled thermonuclear synthesis"--
