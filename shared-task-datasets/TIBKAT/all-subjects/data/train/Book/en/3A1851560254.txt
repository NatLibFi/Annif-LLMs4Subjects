Group Theory
Group -- Finite Groups and Subgroups -- Cyclic Groups -- Permutation Groups -- Cosets and Lagrange’s Theorem -- Normal Subgroups and Factor Groups -- Group Homomorphism and Isomorphism -- Automorphisms -- Direct Products -- Group Actions -- Sylow Theorems.
This textbook focuses on the basics and complex themes of group theory taught to senior undergraduate mathematics students across universities. The contents focus on the properties of groups, subgroups, cyclic groups, permutation groups, cosets and Lagrange’s theorem, normal subgroups and factor groups, group homomorphisms and isomorphisms, automorphisms, direct products, group actions and Sylow theorems. Pedagogical elements such as end of chapter exercises and solved problems are included to help understand abstract notions. Intermediate lemmas are also carefully designed so that they not only serve the theorems but are also valuable independently. The book is a useful reference to undergraduate and graduate students besides academics.
