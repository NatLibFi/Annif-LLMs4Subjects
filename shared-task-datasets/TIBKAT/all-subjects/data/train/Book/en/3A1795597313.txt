Python for MATLAB development : extend MATLAB with 300,000+ modules from the Python package index
MATLAB can run Python code! Python for MATLAB Development shows you how to enhance MATLAB with Python solutions to a vast array of computational problems in science, engineering, artificial intelligence, statistics, finance, and simulation. It is three books in one: A thorough Python tutorial that leverages your existing MATLAB knowledge with a comprehensive collection of MATLAB/Python equivalent expressions A reference guide to setting up and managing a Python environment that integrates cleanly with MATLAB A collection of recipes that demonstrate Python solutions invoked directly from MATLAB The demonstrated techniques and explanations will help you solve your own challenging problems in MATLAB using open source Python modules. Python is the ultimate MATLAB Toolbox and this book is your guide to its use. You will: Find symbolic solutions to integrals, derivatives, and series summations with SymPy Overlay data on maps with Cartopy Solve mixed-integer linear programming problems with PuLP Accelerate computationally-intensive tasks with numba Run large computations in parallel with dask Interact with Redis via pyredis, PostgreSQL via psycopg2, and MongoDB via pymongo Read and write file formats that are not natively understood by MATLAB, such as SQLite, YAML, and ini.
