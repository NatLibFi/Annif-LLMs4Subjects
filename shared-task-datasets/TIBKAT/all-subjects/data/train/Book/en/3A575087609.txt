Biopolitics and the emergence of modern architecture
"Biopolitics and the Emergence of Modern Architecture concerns the dissolution of the classical paradigm of architecture as imitative form in the context of the French Enlightenment and the emergence of a new logic of architecture based on a biopolitical process of subject formation. Following the publication of the English translation of Michel Foucault's The Birth of Biopolitics, Sven-Olov Wallenstein's book is the first to relate the biopolitical concept specifically to architecture. It concludes with a pictorial essay on the development of a building type that epitomizes this new architectural logic - the modern hospital."--BOOK JACKET
