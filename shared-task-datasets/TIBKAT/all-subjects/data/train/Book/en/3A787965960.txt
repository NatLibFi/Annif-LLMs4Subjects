Information modeling for interoperable dimensional metrology
Dimentional metrology is an essentiel part of modern manufacturing technologies, but the basic theories and mesurement methods are no longer sufficient for today's digitized systems. The information exchange between the software components of a dimentional metrology system not only costs a great deal of money, but also causes the entire system to lose data integrity. Information modeling for interoperable dimensional metrology analyzes interoperability issues in dimentional metrology systems ans describes information modeling techniques. It discusses new approaches and data models for solving interoperability problems, as well as introducing process activities, existing and emerging data models, and the key technologies of dimensional metrology systems. Written for researchers in industry and academia, as well as advanced undergratduate and postgraduate students, this book gives both an overview and an in-depth understanding of complete dimensional metrology systems. By covering in detail the theory and main content, techniques, and methods used in dimensional metrology systems, information modeling for interoperable dimensional metrology enables readers to solve real-world dimensional mesurement problems in modern dimensional metrology practices
