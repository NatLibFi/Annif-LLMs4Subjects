Postcolonial African anthropologies
"Postcolonial African Anthropologies showcases a selection of recent African ethnographies and critically discusses anthropology's engagement with decolonisation and postcolonialism. The ethnographers in the book show that contemporary anthropology in Africa is dynamic and deeply self-reflexive, engaging issues of power and life in Africa and its nearby diaspora in multi-vocal and diverse ways."--Back cover
