Ultra-high performance concrete : design, performance, and application
"Ultra-high performance concrete offers compressive strength of over 120 MPa, high toughness, light weight and superior durability. This is the first book to present advances in cement-based materials, characterization, design principles, and preparation; then raw material selection and mixture design methods; performance, including fresh and hardened properties; setting and hardening, dimensional stability, static and dynamic properties, durability, and self-healing. Applications are shown including high-rise, large-span, and heavy load-bearing structures, and seawater sea-sand UHPC. It suits a range of concrete technologists, designers, contractors and researchers"--
