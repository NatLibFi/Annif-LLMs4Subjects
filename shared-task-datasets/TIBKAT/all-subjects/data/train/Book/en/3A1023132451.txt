Writings on Caribbean History, Literature, Art and Culture : one love
"This book will be of great interest to students and scholars of Caribbean and Latin American studies, social and cultural history, women and gender studies, and diasporic studies. In addition, given the transnational and transdisciplinary nature of the bookâ€™s themes, it will also attract the attention of academics whose research focuses more generally on ethnic, postcolonial and Atlantic studies. The volume complements existing Caribbean titles across linguistic borders. However, its distinguishing feature is the intertextual unity, quality and visual imagery of the essays. The book explores the ways in which Caribbean writers, artists and literary scholars explore in their narratives a historical process embedded in genocidal, spatial and ecocidal violence seared in their pasts and their present. It draws attention intertextually to the way history shapes the memories of Caribbean writers, literary critics and artists, and the inventive ways they have found to remember the afterlife of those practices."--
