Adaptive Multiscale Schemes for Conservation Laws
The main theme of the book centers around adaptive numerical schemes for conservation laws based on a concept of multiresolution analysis. Efficient algorithms are presented for implementing this program for finite volume schemes on unstructured grids for general systems of multidimensional hyperbolic conservation laws. The efficiency is verified for several realistic numerical test examples. In addition, a rather thorough error analysis is supporting the approach. The monograph covers material ranging from the mathematical theory of conservation laws to the nitty-gritty of hash tables and memory management for an actual implementation. This makes it a self-contained book for both numerical analysts interested in the construction and the theory of adapative finite volume schemes as well as for those looking for a detailed guide on how to design and implement adaptive wavelet based solvers for real world problems. Since modern techniques are presented in an appealing way, the material is also well suited for an advanced course in numerical mathematics
