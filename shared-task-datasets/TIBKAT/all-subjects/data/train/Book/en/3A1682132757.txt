Modelling with AutoCAD 2002
The practical way to master 3D modelling techniques. Modelling with AutoCAD 2002 is a course based on learning and practising the techniques of 3D modelling using AutoCAD. Bob McFarlane's hands-on approach is uniquely suited to independent learning and use on courses. Unlike the many competing software reference guides that are available, this book is a true step-by-step course that focuses on the AutoCAD functions that are needed for each stage of producing a 3D drawing. The emphasis on learning through doing makes this book ideal for anyone involved in engineering, construction or architecture - where the focus is on productivity and practical skills.
