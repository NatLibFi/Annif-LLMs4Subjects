Upscaling earth : material, process, catalyst
Earth building is not only one of the oldest, but also one of the most modern construction methods of our time. What economic, environmental, and social conditions are necessary for an upscaling of earth to occur? In the future, cement, the most important component of concrete, will – as well as other finite resources – become less viable to produce and significantly more expensive. Considering appropriate alternatives for building materials is becoming imperative. This book presents a wide scope of built and unbuilt projects as well as strategies that can be implemented to edify processes of building, adapting the use of earth to each unique culture and context. Using impressive examples, the authors demonstrate groundbreaking technological innovations that highlight the advantages of this material: from its worldwide availability to the possibility of comprehensive recycling, from climate-neutral production to socially just implementation, including a focus on emerging economies. This book reveals the incredible potentials of earthen architecture – for people and for the entire planet.
