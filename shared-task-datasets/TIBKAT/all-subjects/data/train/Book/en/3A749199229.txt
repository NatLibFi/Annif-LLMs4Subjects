Inversion Method in the Discrete-time Nonlinear Control Systems Synthesis Problems
The purpose of this book is twofold: To survey control system design methods based on the system inversion technique and to collect into one place the many recent results in the field. It has been known for some time that inverse systems may be used to solve numerous control problems. Despite the importance and conceptual simplicity of this topic there appears to be no monograph written on it. The purpose of this work is therefore to present and apply a systematic design method which bases itself on the fundamental system property of invertibility. Many different theoretical and practical aspects are considered in this volume working from elementary topics in the first section to current research in the second
