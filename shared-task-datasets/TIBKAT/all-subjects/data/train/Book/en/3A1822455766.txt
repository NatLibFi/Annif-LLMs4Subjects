Jahrbuch für Europäische Geschichte / European History Yearbook : Europe Across Boundaries
The present issue of the European History Yearbook showcases research initially presented at the annual Mainz-Oxford graduate workshop "European History Across Boundaries from the Sixteenth to the Twentieth Century". The essays shed the straightjacket of national history and cross boundaries and borders. They do so by discussing the transcultural, transnational, and transimperial scopes of their research. Methodologically speaking, the European history that the authors have been researching and writing draws on comparative history, the study of transfer processes and entanglements, and the histoire croisée, among others. The contributions are not only interested in writing European history across boundaries but also in decentering Europe. Individual papers deal with Central America, East Africa, the Middle East, and Oceania. They take the readers far away from the imperial metropolises of Berlin, Madrid, or London - and yet still tell a story about these European imperial centres and societies
