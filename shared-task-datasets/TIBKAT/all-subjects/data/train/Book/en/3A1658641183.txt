Build Android-Based Smart Applications : Using Rules Engines, NLP and Automation Frameworks
1. Introduction -- 2. Rules Engines -- 3. Knowledge Management Applications -- 4. Android applications for solving real life problems.
Build smart applications using cutting-edge technologies such as rules engines, code automation frameworks, and natural language processing (NLP). This book provides step-by-step instructions on how to port nine rules engines (CLIPS, JRuleEngine, DTRules, Zilonis, TermWare, Roolie, OpenRules, JxBRE, and JEOPS) to the Android platform. Youâ€™ll learn how to use each rules engine to build a smart application with sample code snippets so that you can get started with programming smart applications immediately. Build Android-Based Smart Applicationsalso describes porting issues with other popular rules engines (Drools, JLisa, Take, and Jess). This book is a step-by-step guide on how to generate a working smart application from requirement specifications. It concludes by showing you how to generate a smart application from unstructured knowledge using the Stanford POS (Part of Speech) tagger NLP framework. You will: Evaluate the available rules engines to see which rules engine is best to use for building smart applications Build smart applications using rules engines Create a smart application using NLP Automatically generate smart application from requirement specifications.
