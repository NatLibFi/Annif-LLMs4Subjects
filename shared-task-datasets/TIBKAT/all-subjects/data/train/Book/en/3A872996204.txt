Shared identities : medieval and modern imaginings of Judeo-Islam
"In this controversial study, Aaron W Hughes breaks with received opinion that imagines two distinct religions, Judaism and Islam, interacting in the centuries immediately following the death of Muhammad in the early seventh century. Tradition describes these relations using tropes such as that of "symbiosis." Hughes instead argues that various porous groups--neither fully Muslim nor Jewish--exploited a shared terminology to make sense of their social worlds in response to the rapid process of Islamicization. What emerged as normative rabbinic Judaism on the one had, and Sunni and Shi'i Islam on the other were ultimately responses to such marginal groups. Even the spread of rabbinic Judaism, especially in the hands of Saadya Gaon (882-942 CE), was articulate Islamically. The emergence of the so-called "Golden Age" in places such as Muslim Spain and North Africa continued to see the articulation of this "Islamic" Judaism in the writings of luminaires such as Bahya ibn Paquda, Abraham ibn Ezra, Judah Halevi, and Moses Maimonides. Drawing on social theory, comparative religion, and original sources, Hughes presents a compelling case for rewriting our understanding of Jews and Muslims in their earliest centuries of interaction. Not content to remain solely in the past, however, he also examines the continued interaction of Muslims and Jews, now reimagined as Palestinians and Israelis, into the present"--
