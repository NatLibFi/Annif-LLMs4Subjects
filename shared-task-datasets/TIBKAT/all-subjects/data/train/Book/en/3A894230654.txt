Devil's bargain : Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, and the storming of the presidency
"It will take a miracle" -- "Where's my Steve?" -- Bildungsroman -- "A dangerous way to look at the world" -- Nobody builds walls like Trump -- The alt-Kochs -- A rolling tumbleweed of wounded male id and aggression -- "The traffic is absolutely filthy!" -- "Honest populism" -- Burn everything down -- "The FBI has learned of the existence..." -- Afterword: Kali Yuga
