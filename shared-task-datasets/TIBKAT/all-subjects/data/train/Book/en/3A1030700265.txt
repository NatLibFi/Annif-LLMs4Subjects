Distributed situation awareness in road transport : theory, measurement, and application to intersection design
"This book showcases, through the use of simulation, on-road testing, and human factors methods in an integrated manner. It achieves this by describing a programme of research designed to enhance situation awareness (SA) across different road users in Australia. The book also makes a telling contribution to the area of SA. Despite being identified as a key concept for road-safety efforts, along with many researchers calling for further research in this area, SA remains ill-defined, underexplored and generally ambiguous in a road-transport context. This book addresses this knowledge gap by proposing a new model of road-user SA and specifying interventions designed to enhance it"--
