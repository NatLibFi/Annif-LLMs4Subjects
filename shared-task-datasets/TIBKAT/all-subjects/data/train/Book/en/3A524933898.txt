Quantum Computing in Solid State Systems
Quantum Computation in Solid State Systems discusses experimental implementation of quantum computing for information processing devices, in particular observations of quantum behavior in several solid state systems are presented. The complementary theoretical contributions provide models of minimizing decoherence in the different systems. Most recent theoretical and experimental results on macroscopic quantum coherence of mesoscopic systems, as well as the realization of solid-state qubits and quantum gates are discussed. Particular attention is given to coherence effects in Josephson devices. Other solid state systems---including quantum dots, optical, ion, and spin devices---are also discussed.
