""Despite its cozy image, the bungalow in literature and film is haunted by violence yet fosters possibilities for personal transformation, utopian social vision and even comedy. Originating in Bengal and adapted as housing for colonialist ventures worldwide, the homes were sold in mail-order kits during the "bungalow mania" of the early 20th century and enjoyed a revival at century's end. The bungalow as fictional setting stages ongoing contradictions of modernity-home and homelessness, property and dispossession, self and other-prompting a rethinking of our images of house and home. Drawing on the work of writers, architects and film directors, including Katherine Mansfield, E. M. Forster, Amitav Ghosh, Frank Lloyd Wright, Willa Cather, Buster Keaton and Walter Mosley, this study offers new readings of the transcultural bungalow."-Provided by publisher"--
