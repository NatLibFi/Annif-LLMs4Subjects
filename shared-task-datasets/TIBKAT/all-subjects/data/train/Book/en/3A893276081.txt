Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH): The Quintessential Moonlighting Protein in Normal Cell Function and in Human Disease examines the biochemical protein interactions of the multi-dimensional protein GAPDH, further considering the regulatory mechanisms through which cells control their functional diversity. This protein's diverse activities range from nuclear tRNA export and the maintenance of genomic integrity, to cytoplasmic post-transcriptional control of gene expression and receptor mediated cell signaling, to membrane facilitation of iron metabolism, trafficking and fusion. This book will be of great interest to basic scientists, clinicians and students, including molecular and cell biologists, immunologists, pathologists and clinical researchers who are interested in the biochemistry of GAPDH in health and disease.--
