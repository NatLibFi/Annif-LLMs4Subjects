Finite antenna arrays and FSS
A periodic surface is an assembly of identical elements arranged in a one or two-dimensional array. Such surfaces have various effects on incident electromagnetic waves. Their applications range from antennas to stealth aircraft.This book discusses finite antenna arrays and how to minimize the radar cross section of these arrays. "Ben has been the world-wide guru of this technology...Ben Munk has written a book that represents the epitomy of practical understanding." W. Bahret, United States Air Force Frequency selective surfaces (FSSs) have important military and civilian applications including antenna theory, satellite communications and stealth technology Author is an authory on the subject, having been instrumental in the development of stealth technology for the US Air Force Much of the material in this book was deemed classified due to its importance to defence
