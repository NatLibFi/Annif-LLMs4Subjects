Alternative liquid dielectrics for high voltage transformer insulation systems : performance analysis and applications
"This book acts as a reference on biodegradable insulating liquids. The contents of this book are framed in a way to cover the pertinent orbits of ester liquids, key aspects that need to be emphasized to further expand the existing knowledge, and act as a quick guide to the utility engineers. This book also discusses critical challenges that will be helpful for engineers in the successful operation of ester-filled transformers. Importantly, reputable and experienced researchers who have worked extensively on the individual subtopics contribute to chapters of this book. This allows for a widening of the scope and technical orbits of the book in an effective and unique manner. This book also acts in bridging the gap between researchers and utility engineers concerning transformer insulation systems"--
