Global Literary Studies : Key Concepts
This book sets the grounds for Global Literary Studies as an emergent field. It innovatively looks at cross-border cultural phenomena through the concepts of space, scale, time, connectivity and agency, channeling the cross-fertilization of ideas across 4 lines: global translation flows, the global novel, global literary environments and global cinema. The book targets readers interested in a global critical approach in the humanities and beyond
