Ethnopharmacology of Medicinal Plants : Asia and the Pacific
For the first time in the history of medicinal plant research, Ethnopharmacology of Medicinal Plants: Asia and the Pacific sheds light on the pharmacological potentials of one of the most exiting and enormously rich sources of potential drugs: the medicinal plants of the Pacific Rim. Encompassing more than 6000 species of plant that are virtually unexplored for pharmacology, this volume provides cutting edge information on the pharmacological properties and therapeutic potentials of medicinal herbs used in the Asia-Pacific region against inflammation, CNS diseases, and cancer. Ethnopharmacology of Medicinal Plants: Asia and the Pacific emphasizes the fundamental importance of the precise observation of the use of each medicinal plant, combined with pharmacological experiments and its botanical classification, and provides the base for a new theory of ethnopharmacology. This book offers researchers an unprecedented coverage of all aspects of botany, ethnology, pharmacology, toxicology, pharmacy, and medicine for the use of plant materials for medicinal and related purposes.Written for:Pharmacologists, herbal medicine practioners, drug developers, phytochemists, medicinal chemists, phytologists, toxicologists, and researchers
