Strigolactones, alkamides and karrikins in plants : recent updates and future prospects
"Strigolactones, Alkamides and Karrikins in Plants: Recent Updates and Future Prospects provides a comprehensive knowledge on the various aspects of plant growth, physiology and communication associated with the three potential biomolecules. Strigolactones have gained much importance in the last decade as a potential plant growth regulator. Likewise, alkamides are also known for their plant growth regulatory and pharmacological properties. The evolutionary significance of karrikins as a potential signaling molecule in different plant groups has been fascinating to plant physiologists and ecologists. This book enables the reader to gain insights into the myriad role of these biomolecules in plant physiology under normal and challenging environments The book offers comprehensive coverage of the most essential topics, including: Regulation of strigolactone biosynthesis Strigolactones and plant stress tolerance Strigolactones and parasitic plants Alkamides and plant-microbe interaction in rhizosphere Pharmacological potential of alkamides Molecular associations of strigolactones and karrikins Karrikins in plant biotechnology Commercial realities of karrikins in biodiversity restoration In reference to the recent findings in the field, the authors have provided insights into the role of each biomolecule and analyzed the future prospects of each cover area"--
