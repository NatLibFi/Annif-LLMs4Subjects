Mathematical methods in modern complexity science
This book presents recent developments in nonlinear and complex systems. It provides recent theoretic developments and new techniques based on a nonlinear dynamical systems approach that can be used to model and understand complex behavior in nonlinear dynamical systems. It covers information theory, relativistic chaotic dynamics, data analysis, relativistic chaotic dynamics, solvability issues in integro-differential equations, and inverse problems for parabolic differential equations, synchronization and chaotic transient. Presents new concepts for understanding and modeling complex systems.
