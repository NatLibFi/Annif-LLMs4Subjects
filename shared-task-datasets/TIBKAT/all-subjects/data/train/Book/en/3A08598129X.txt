Here is the first book to examine the environmental landscape designs of Frank Lloyd Wright, probably the world's best known and most influential architect. Wrightscapes analyzes 85 of his works, and pays particular attention to site planning, landscape design, community scale, and regional planning. The authors include many original diagrams, rare archival material, and some 200 photographs, many never published before. Wrightscapes also chronicles how and way Wright's famous ecological sensabilities were established and how his design aspirations went far beyond accepted definitions of architecture. Wrightscapes is ideal for required or supplemental reading within many curriculums of architecture, landscape architecture, and city planning or urban design
