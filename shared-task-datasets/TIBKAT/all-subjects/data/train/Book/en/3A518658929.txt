Weaving truth : essays on language and the female in Greek thought
"In Ancient Greek thought, truth in language has a special relation to the female by virtue of her pre-eminent art-form - the one Freud believed was even invented by women - weaving. The essays in this book explore the implications of this nexus - language, the female, weaving, and the construction of truth."--BOOK JACKET
