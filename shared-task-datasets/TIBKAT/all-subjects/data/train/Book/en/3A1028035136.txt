Game Theory for Security and Risk Management : From Theory to Practice
The chapters in this volume explore how various methods from game theory can be utilized to optimize security and risk-management strategies.  Emphasizing the importance of connecting theory and practice, they detail the steps involved in selecting, adapting, and analyzing game-theoretic models in security engineering and provide case studies of successful implementations in different application domains.  Practitioners who are not experts in game theory and are uncertain about incorporating it into their work will benefit from this resource, as well as researchers in applied mathematics and computer science interested in current developments and future directions. The first part of the book presents the theoretical basics, covering various different game-theoretic models related to and suitable for security engineering.  The second part then shows how these models are adopted, implemented, and analyzed.  Surveillance systems, interconnected networks, and power grids are among the different application areas discussed.  Finally, in the third part, case studies from business and industry of successful applications of game-theoretic models are presented, and the range of applications discussed is expanded to include such areas as cloud computing, Internet of Things, and water utility networks
