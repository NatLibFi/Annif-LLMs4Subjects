Beginning algorithms
After guiding readers through the basics of algorithms and data structures, this book examines algorithms that help in programming tasks. It begins with a discussion of the basics then introduces practical sorting algorithms, and moves on to fundamental data structures. The companion Web site features Java-based working implementations.
After guiding readers through the basics of algorithms and data structures, this book examines specific algorithms that will help readers in programming tasks. It begins with a discussion of the basics - how to determine the characteristics of a given algorithm - then introduces practical sorting algorithms, and gradually moves on to fundamental data structures. The companion Web site features unique, Java-based working implementations and examples built and tested by the author.
