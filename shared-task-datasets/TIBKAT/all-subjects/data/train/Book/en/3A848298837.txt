Principles of magnetostatics
"Magnetic phenomena have been known since antiquity when a natural ore called lodestone was discovered to attract bits of iron. The scientific study of magnetism dates from around 1600 when William Gilbert summarized experiments on the subject in his treatise De Magnete [1]. However interest in the subject greatly increased after 1820, when Hans Christian Oersted reported that electrical currents could deflect magnetic needles, thereby establishing a connection between the subjects of electricity and magnetism [2]. Almost immediately, Andre Marie Ampere, Jean-Baptiste Biot and Felix Savart performed a series of seminal experiments that determined the forces acting between current loops"--
