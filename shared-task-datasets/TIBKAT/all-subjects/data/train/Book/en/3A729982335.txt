Agricultural and Fisheries Policies in Mexico : Recent Achievements, Continuing the Reform Agenda
This report analyses the effects of Mexicoâ€™s ambitious reforms to agricultural and fisheries policies since 1990 and makes recommendations for further reforms. The evaluation is based on criteria for good agricultural and fisheries policy as agreed to by OECD countries. Such criteria, if implemented, would support economically healthy sectors that contribute to the wider economy, respect natural resources and use inputs effectively without resorting to distorting subsidies.
