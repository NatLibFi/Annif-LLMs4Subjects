Being European
This book starts by posing a question: what does “Being European” mean? In order to answer this, the book first analyses the fundamental characteristics of the EU: it has been constructed step by step, nothing is imposed on its members, decisions are taken collectively and it has a unique multilevel legal system. Then, the book analyses the biggest problems of our time: migrants, terrorism and populism, and not only finds where the limits of the EU’s areas of competence lie, but also identifies the real action taken to combat those problems. As a third issue, the book analyses how the EU managed the economic crisis and shows how, from a global perspective, it has been the epitome of solidarity and the preservation of the welfare state. The three chapters demonstrate that a lot of manipulation or ignorance underlie criticism of the EU. The last chapter gives a definitive answer to the initial question on the basis of the previous analysis: no new changes are needed, but the present system has to be strengthened. In order to achieve this goal, we need to focus on our common culture, which has been shaped over the centuries, and our common identity. The Berlin Declaration of 2007 is our best reference point: democracy, freedom, the rule of law, human rights and solidarity are the elements that define our European identity, a unique approach in the world that must be defended and developed: in this respect, the EU is a pillar for the future of humanity.
