The Routledge handbook of gender and EU politics
"This handbook maps the expanding field of gender and EU Politics, giving an overview of the fundamentals and new directions of the sub-discipline, and serving as a reference book for (gender) scholars and students at different levels interested in the EU. In investigating the gendered nature of European integration and gender relations in the EU as a political system, it summarizes and assesses the research on gender and the EU to this point in time, identifies existing research gaps in gender and EU studies and addresses directions for future research. Distinguished contributors from the US, the UK and continental Europe, and from across disciplines from political science, sociology, economics and law, expertly inform about gender approaches and summarise the state of the art in gender and EU studies. The Routledge Handbook of Gender and EU Politics provides an essential and authoritative source of information for students, scholars and researchers in EU studies/politics, gender studies/politics, political theory, comparative politics, international relations, political and gender sociology, political economy, European and legal studies/law"--
