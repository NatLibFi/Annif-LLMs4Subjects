Modern apartment design
"Modern Apartment Design provides guidelines to the design of modern apartment buildings as well as a summation of current cutting-edge practice in engineered timber construction. The book covers a brief history of apartment buildings around the world, a broad outline of different types of apartment blocks, and a strong focus on the design and actual construction of apartment buildings, especially those utilising mass timber, such as cross laminated timber and laminated veneer lumber. It also features six Case Study chapters from industry-leading practitioners in the area, enabling best practice in architecture and engineering of these new apartment building types to be more widely understood and propagated worldwide. The fully illustrated, full colour, case studies span the globe and include: Clearwater Quay in Christchurch, New Zealand (architects: Pacific Environments NZ); Wynyard Central East 2 in Auckland, New Zealand (architects: Architectus); Dalton Works in London, UK (architects: Waugh Thistleton Architects); Mjostarnet, Brumunddal, Norway (architects: Voll Arkitekter); Brock Commons Tallwood House student housing in Vancouver, Canada (architects: Acton Ostry Architects); and Regensbergstrasse apartments in Zurich, Switzerland (architects: Dreicon). The book will be of great interest to architects and architecture students"--
