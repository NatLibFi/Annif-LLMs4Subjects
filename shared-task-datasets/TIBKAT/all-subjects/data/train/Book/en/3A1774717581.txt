Thomas Pynchon and the digital humanities : computational approaches to style
Introduction and Definition of Style -- Chapter 1: Issues in Computational Stylistics and Digital Pynchon Studies -- Chapter 2: Corpora and Software -- Chapter 3: Some Formal Overviews of Pynchon's Texts -- Chapter 4: The Style of Mason & Dixon -- Chapter 5: Pynchon, 'The Voice of Ambiguity,' Quantified -- Chapter 6: Pynchon's Acronymania -- Chapter 7: Pynchon's Profanity, Queried and Coded -- Chapter 8: Pynchon's Ellipsis Marks: Points and Dashes Conclusion : Pynchon's 'Late Style' and Future Work -- Bibliography.
"The first book-length analysis of Pynchon's style, this book uses methodologies such as computational analysis, drawn from the Digital Humanities, to reveal previously unknown stylistic trends in this much-studied author's oeuvre. In doing so, it challenges critical assumptions regarding supposedly 'Pynchonesque' stylistic features and presents the most extensive description thus far of Pynchon's 'late style'. It examines a range of texts from Pynchon's oeuvre , including Gravity's Rainbow , The Crying of Lot 49 and Mason & Dixon as well as contextualising his work alongside that of other key writers such as Toni Morrison, David Foster Wallace, Don DeLillo and Stephen King."--
