Water politics : the fragmentation of Western water policy
"This book is about the enactment, adaption, and ultimately fragmentation of government policy regarding the use of water in the American West. It describes its origins, how it became about building big projects, and how it was fragmented by pressures from environmental activism. It explores western water crisis in the United States. The case studies used in this book will help readers understand about water development and political battles in most of the western states to show readers how and why the policy changed and broke-down. The book is divided into two parts and describes the different eras of water policy. While most books on water policy focus on its deficiencies for meeting future challenges, Water Politics: The Fragmentation off Western Water Policy attempts to explore why those deficiencies occurred in the first place. The book is intended for undergraduate and graduate students in political science and policy studies who are interested in how public policies are enacted, how they change, and how they fall apart over time and why. The book should also be of particular interest to students in other disciplines that deal with water such as environmental studies, geology, sociology, hydrology, and civil engineering"--
