Basic chemometric techniques in atomic spectroscopy
This practical introduction is the first to present the principles of experimental designs, optimization and multivariate regression for atomic spectroscopists, This is the first book for atomic spectroscopists to present the basic principles of experimental designs, optimization and multivariate regression. Multivariate regression is a valuable statistical method for handling complex problems (such as spectral and chemical interferences) which arise during atomic spectrometry. However, the technique is underused as most spectroscopists do not have time to study the often complex literature on the subject. This practical introduction uses conceptual explanations and worked examples to give readers a clear understanding of the technique. Mathematics is kept to a minimum but, when required, is kept at a basic level. Practical considerations, interpretations and troubleshooting are emphasized and literature surveys are included to guide the reader to further work. The same dataset is used for all chapters dealing with calibration to demonstrate the differences between the different methodologies. Readers will learn how to handle spectral and chemical interferences in atomic spectrometry in a new, more efficient and cost-effective way
