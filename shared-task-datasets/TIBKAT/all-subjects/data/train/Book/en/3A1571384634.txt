Relativity, symmetry, and the structure of quantum theory / William H Klink (University of Iowa, USA), Wolfgang Schweiger (University of Graz, Austria) ; Volume 2: Point form relativistic quantum mechanics
This book covers relativistic quantum theory from the point of view of a particle theory, based on the irreducible representations of the Poincar√¢e group, the group that expresses the symmetry of Einstein relativity. There are several ways of formulating such a theory; this book develops what is called relativistic point form quantum mechanics, which, unlike quantum field theory, deals with a fixed number of particles in a relativistically invariant way. A chapter is devoted to applications of point form quantum mechanics to nuclear physics.
