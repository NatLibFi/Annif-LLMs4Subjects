Environmental toxicology and chemistry of oxygen species
The book describes the chemical structure and spectroscopic properties of toxic oxygen species such as: superoxide, hydroxyl and organic oxygen radicals, hydrogen peroxide and singlet oxygen. With respect to these oxygen species this volume also covers sources of generation; methods of identification; the chemical reactivity with biologically important compounds; biochemical, clinical and environmental aspects of the oxygen species formation. Emphasis is placed on photodynamic effects, possible role of oxygen species in human diseases, in smog and acid rain formation, in degradation of polymers and plant senescence processes. The book also includes cell and tissue mechanisms of protection against damage caused by oxygen species
