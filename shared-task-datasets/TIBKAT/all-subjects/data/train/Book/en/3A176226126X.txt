Chemical reactivity in confined systems : theory, modelling and applications
"This book provides a theoretical basis for the molecular phenomena observed in confined spaces. State-of the-art theoretical and computational approaches are described, with a focus on obtaining physically relevant understanding, enabling the reader to build a good appreciation of the underlying chemical principles. aÌ²²́ƠË₋Real life' examples of confined systems are presented, highlighting how the reactivity of atoms and molecules changes upon encapsulation. Recent developments related to the following host-guest systems are discussed. *AÌ² Cucurbit[n]uril *AÌ² ExBox 4 *AÌ² Clathrate hydrates *AÌ² Octa acid cavitand *AÌ² Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) *AÌ² Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) *AÌ² Zeolites *AÌ² Fullerenes *AÌ² Carbon nanotubes."--
