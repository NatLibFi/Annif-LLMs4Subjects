Emotions and consumption behaviour
This stimulating book scrutinizes how emotions function in consumers, from both a psychological and a managerial perspective. It demonstrates how gratitude, happiness, guilt, anger, pride and sadness determine different post-consumption behaviours such as positive and negative word of mouth, repurchase intention and complaint behaviour. -- ‘A structured, scientific approach to the study of emotional responses that is of interest to both managers and consumers. For marketing managers, this book proposes a simple method to understand how individual emotions, such as guilt or happiness, influence specific post-purchase behaviors. For consumers, it illustrates the broader implications of emotions that are routinely experienced while choosing, buying, and consuming products and services. Overall, the author deals with the elusive, complex, but highly fascinating subject of emotions and consumer behaviour in a lucid and coherent manner.’ (Simona Botti, London Business School, UK).
