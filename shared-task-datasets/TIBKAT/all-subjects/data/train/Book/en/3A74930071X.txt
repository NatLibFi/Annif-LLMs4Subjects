Advanced Optoelectronic Devices
Advanced Optoelectronic Devices gives the first unified presentation of the major developments in this field, both in terms of their physical background and with respect to applications. It covers devices based on the properties of quantum wells and fiber optics together with their applications in optical communications and signal processing. It also includes a comprehensive mathematical treatment and state-of-the-art presentation of the latest research in applied optoelectronics and semiconductor physics. The two different and complementary physical theories that describe optoelectronic devices, namely the electromagnetic field theory and quantum mechanics, are treated jointly in such a way as to reveal links and analogies wherever possible. This provides a better understanding of the basic processes. Therefore, the book is not simply a catalogue of different exotic devices but a presentation of a great variety of devices based on the same, or similar, physical phenomena
