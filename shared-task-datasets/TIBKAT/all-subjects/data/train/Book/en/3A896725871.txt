Teaching dialogue interpreting : research-based proposals for higher education
Teaching Dialogue Interpreting' is one of the very few book-length contributions that cross the research-to-training boundary in dialogue interpreting. The volume is innovative in at least three ways. First, it brings together experts working in areas as diverse as business interpreting, court interpreting, medical interpreting, and interpreting for the media, who represent a wide range of theoretical and methodological approaches. Second, it addresses instructors and course designers in higher education, but may also be used for refresher courses and/or retraining of in-service interpreters and bilingual staff. Third, and most important, it provides a set of resources, which, while research driven, are also readily usable in the classroom - either together or separately - depending on specific training needs and/or research interests. The collection thus makes a significant contribution in curriculum design for interpreter education
