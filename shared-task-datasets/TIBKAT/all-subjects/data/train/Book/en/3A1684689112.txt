This book presents a detailed overview and critical evaluation of recent advances and remaining challenges in improving nutritional quality and/or avoiding the accumulation of undesirable substances in plants using a variety of strategies based on modern biological tools and techniques. Each review chapter provides an authoritative and insightful account of the various aspects of nutritional enhancement of plants. In the course of the last two decades, several food crops rich in macro- and micronutrients have been developed to improve health and protect a large section of the populace in developing countries from chronic diseases. Providing extensive information on these developments, this book offers a valuable resource for all researchers, students and industrialists working in agriculture, the plant sciences, agronomy, horticulture, biotechnology, food and nutrition, and the soil and environmental sciences
