Law, business and human rights : bridging the gap
The intersection of business and human rights contains substantial economic, social, and political implications. Global business enterprises and civil society groups must establish a constructive and meaningful dialogue in order to work cooperatively to protect human rights. In this innovative book, the authors explore the role of firms in respecting human rights and explain the need for a better understanding of the human rights of affected stakeholders. The goal is to draw attention to these issues and generate common ground between two potentially disparate and conflicting interests. -- ‘The business and human rights field is burgeoning, and this volume makes a significant contribution by drawing business law scholars into related debates. Rich in empirical detail, individual chapters analyze the challenges faced both at the firm-level and from the perspective of affected stakeholders across a range of sectors and issue areas. Highly recommended.’ (Shareen Hertel, University of Connecticut, US).
