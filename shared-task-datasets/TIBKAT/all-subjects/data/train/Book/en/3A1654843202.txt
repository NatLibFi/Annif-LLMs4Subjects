Beginning Hibernate : For Hibernate 5
Get started with the Hibernate 5 persistence layer and gain a clear introduction to the current standard for object-relational persistence in Java. This updated edition includes the new Hibernate 5.0 framework as well as coverage of NoSQL, MongoDB, and other related technologies, ranging from applications to big data. Beginning Hibernate is ideal if you’re experienced in Java with databases (the traditional, or connected, approach), but new to open-source, lightweight Hibernate. The book keeps its focus on Hibernate without wasting time on nonessential third-party tools, so you’ll be able to immediately start building transaction-based engines and applications. Experienced authors Joseph Ottinger with Dave Minter and Jeff Linwood provide more in-depth examples than any other book for Hibernate beginners. They present their material in a lively, example-based manner—not a dry, theoretical, hard-to-read fashion.
