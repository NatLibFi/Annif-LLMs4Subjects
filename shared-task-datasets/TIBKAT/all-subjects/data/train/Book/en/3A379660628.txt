Sexuality in Greek and Roman society and literature : a sourcebook
"With numerous original translations of ancient poetry, inscriptions and documents, this volume is the first major sourcebook to explore the multifaceted nature of sexuality in antiquity." "Themes such as marriage, prostitution and same-sex attraction are presented comparatively, with material from Greece and Roman worlds shown side by side; this approach allows readers to interpret the written records with a full awareness of the different context of these separate but related societies. Commentaries are provided throughout, focusing on vocabulary and social and historical context."--Jacket
