Type-based flood statistics : an interlink between stochastic and deterministic flood hydrology
This book summarises for the first time all relevant methodologies for type-based flood statistics, introduces the basis of flood typology and makes them accessible to the user. Flood types improve the understanding of the flood-generating processes and characterise the flood event in terms of its features such as peak, volume and hydrograph shape. In addition, they can also significantly expand the information used in flood statistics and add valuable flood characteristics to the determination of design floods, especially the determination of flood scenarios relevant for reservoir management. A detailed framework with all aspects of point and spatial statistics as well as regionalisation is presented, and examples illustrate the benefit of the proposed methodology. The target audience is both users in associations and engineering offices, as type-based statistics are increasingly becoming part of the specifications, and researchers, as this is a current field of research.
