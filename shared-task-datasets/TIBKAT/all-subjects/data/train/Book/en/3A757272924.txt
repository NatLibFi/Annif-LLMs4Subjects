Quantal Density Functional Theory
Quantal density functional theory (Q-DFT) is a new local effective potential energy theory of the electronic structure of matter. It is a description in terms of classical fields that pervade all space, and their quantal sources. The fields, which are explicitly defined, are separately representative of the many-body electron correlations present in such a description, namely, those due to the Pauli exclusion principle, Coulomb repulsion, correlation-kinetic, and correlation-current-density effects. The book further describes Schr√∂dinger theory from the new perspective of fields and quantal sources. It also explains the physics underlying the functionals and functional derivatives of traditional DFT
