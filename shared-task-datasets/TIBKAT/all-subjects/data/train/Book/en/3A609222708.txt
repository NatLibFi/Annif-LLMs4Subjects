Visionary cities : [12 reasons for claiming the future of our cities]
"Visionary cities" sets the agenda for the city of the future. This first publication in the "Future Cities Series" is intended as an overview of the issues that The Why Factory is addressing and to outline this research institute's ambitions and modus operandi for the coming years.
