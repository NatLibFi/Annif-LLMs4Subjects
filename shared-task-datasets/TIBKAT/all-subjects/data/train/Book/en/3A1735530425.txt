Optical materials
Optical Materials, Second Edition, presents, in a unified form, the underlying physical and structural processes that determine the optical behavior of materials. It does this by combining elements from physics, optics, and materials science in a seamless manner, and introducing quantum mechanics when needed. The book groups the characteristics of optical materials into classes with similar behavior. In treating each type of material, the text pays particular attention to atomic composition and chemical makeup, electronic states and band structure, and physical microstructure so that the reader will gain insight into the kinds of materials engineering and processing conditions that are required to produce a material exhibiting a desired optical property. The physical principles are presented on many levels, including a physical explanation, followed by formal mathematical support and examples and methods of measurement. The reader may overlook the equations with no loss of comprehension, or may use the text to find appropriate equations for calculations of optical properties.- Includes a fundamental description of optical materials at the beginner and advanced levels- Provides a thorough coverage of the field and presents new concepts in an easy to understand manner that combines written explanations and equations- Serves as a valuable toolbox of applications and equations for the working reader
