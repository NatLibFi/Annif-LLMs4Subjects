Structured glass-fiber catalysts
"This book is dedicated to the synthesis of advanced glass-fiber catalysts for various emerging applications, investigation of their properties, and development of engineering basis required for their wide practical application. It describes how to create and use such catalysts for different chemical reactions. It discusses how to efficiently arrange them into structured catalytic cartridges and gives examples of their successful application for purification of waste gases from different hazardous contaminants and environmentally safe combustion of fuels. It covers nanosize surface science fundamentals through large-scale commercial catalytic reactors"--
