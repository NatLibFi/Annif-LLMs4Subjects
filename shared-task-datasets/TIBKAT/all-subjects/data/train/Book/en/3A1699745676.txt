Advanced numerical modelling of wave structure interactions
"Due to the growth in cheap computing power, over the last decade the numerical modelling of wave structure interaction has entered a new phase. Increasingly sophisticated mathematical models now allow for the most realistic modelling of fluid structure interaction ever achieved. Advanced Numerical Modelling of Wave Structure Interaction contains contributions from a wide range of experts in the field of numerical modelling for coastal engineering. Chapters present state-of-the-art numerical approaches for aspects of fluid structure interaction ranging from wave-breakwater interaction to the effect of vegetation on currents. This book aims to serve as a comprehensive guide to up-to-date numerical techniques used for a wide variety of fluid structure interaction problems within a coastal engineering context"--
