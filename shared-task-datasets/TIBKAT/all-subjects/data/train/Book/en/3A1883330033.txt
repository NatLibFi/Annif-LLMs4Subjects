Translations and participation : cross-disciplinary perspectives
In an era of heightened global interconnectedness and cultural exchange, social cleavages and dynamics of alienation become increasingly apparent. This necessitates a closer look at the intricate relationship between translations and participations as they unfold together. The contributors to this volume spark a cross-disciplinary dialogue on the interdependencies between translational practices - lingustic as well as cultural - and social participation. Authors from diverse fields, including interpreting, translation and education research as well as anthropology and sociology, share their perspectives on this vital yet often overlooked issue.
