Are there really neutrinos? : an evidential history
"This intriguing and accessible book examines the experiments on neutrino oscillations. It argues that this history gives us good reason to believe in the existence of neutrinos, a particle that interacts so weakly with matter that its interaction length is measured in light years of lead. Yet, the scientific process has provided evidence of the elusive neutrino. Written in a style accessible to any reader with a college education in physics, Are There Really Neutrinos? is of interest to students and researchers alike. This second edition contains a new epilogue highlighting the new developments in neutrino physics over the past 20 years"--
