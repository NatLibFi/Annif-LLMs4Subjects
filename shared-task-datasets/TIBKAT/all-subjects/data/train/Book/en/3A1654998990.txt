Ionization and ion transport : a primer for the study of non-equilibrium, low-temperature gas discharges and plasmas
This is an introduction for engineering and science students to the basic underlying physics and chemistry concepts that form the foundation of plasma science and engineering. It is a bridge for students who have no background in the topic by providing an understanding of what an ion is, how they move, the equations used to describe the basic concepts and how they link to the topics of plasmas and gas discharges. It focuses on specific concepts that are important to non-equilibrium, low temperature gas discharges.
