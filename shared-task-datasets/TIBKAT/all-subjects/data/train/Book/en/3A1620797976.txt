Critical geographies of cycling : history, political economy and culture
"Examining cycling from a range of geographical perspectives, this book uses historical and contemporary case studies to look at the history, politics, economy and culture of cycling. Pursuing a post-structural position in viewing understandings of the bicycle as contingent upon time and place, author Glen Norcliffe argues for the need for widespread processes such as gendered use of the bicycle, the Cyclists's Rights Movement, and the globalization of bicycle-making to be interpreted in different ways in different places. With this in mind, the essays in the book are divided into two sections: Spaces of Cycling which treats the location of the technological development, production and trade of cycles and Places of Cycling which interprets the specific places of consumption - the streets of the city, in the cycling clubs, among men and women, and at the trade show. Written from a geographer's integrative perspective to offer a broad understanding of cycling, this book will also be of interest to other social scientists in urban studies, cultural studies, technology and society, sociology, history and environmental planning"--Provided by publisher
