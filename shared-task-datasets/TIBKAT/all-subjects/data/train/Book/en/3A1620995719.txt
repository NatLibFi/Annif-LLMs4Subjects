General relativity : a first examination
Review of special relativity -- Vectors and tensors in spacetime -- Covariant differentiation, equations of motion -- Curvature -- Gravity and general relativity -- Solar system tests of Einstein's theory -- Black holes -- Gravitational waves -- Cosmology
"This manuscript aims to be a textbook for a one semester introduction to General Relativity for advanced undergraduate physics majors and engineers. The book is concise so that all of its material could be covered in the one semester time frame. In addition, the readers are introduced to the guts of the subject quickly without advanced mathematics. Students are daunted by very thick books that they know won't be completely covered. They also are impatient about wading through higher mathematics in a one semester course. Though concise, the theory development is transparent and the readers are exposed to the possible analytic calculations. The full solutions to some important problems are provided, and the experimental evidence is discussed"--
