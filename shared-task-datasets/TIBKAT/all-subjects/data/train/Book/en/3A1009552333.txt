Managing maritime safety
"Shipping is a pillar of global trade, with 90% of the world's trade in goods and raw materials carried by ship. Despite the economic benefits this delivers, maritime operations can be dangerous, and when accidents occur the consequences are serious. Consequential outcomes from hazards at sea include loss of cargo, destruction of the marine environment, serious injuries, deaths and material damage. Managing Maritime Safety will give you a thorough understanding of contemporary maritime safety and its management. It provides varying viewpoints on traditional safety topics in conjunction with critical discussions of the international safety management code and its application. The book also offers new perspectives on maritime safety such as ship and equipment design for safety and the relevance of safety management systems, in particular the application of the International Safety Management code to remote controlled or autonomous ships. The authors all work in the maritime industry, as practitioners, in education, research, government and classification. The combination of wide-ranging and extensive experience provides an unprecedented span of views with a strong connection to the real issues in the maritime domain. This book sets out to provide much needed consolidated knowledge for university level students on maritime safety management, incorporating theoretical, historical, research, operational and design perspectives."--Provided by publisher
