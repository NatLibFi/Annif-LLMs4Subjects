Post-tensioning in building construction
"This introduces the core concepts and steps for software-based structural design and construction of post-tensioned buildings, illustrated with several example designs to Eurocode and American building codes including the numerical design of a column-supported floor system used in contemporary building construction and a beam frame for a parking structure. It covers and compares bonded and unbonded post-tensioning systems and presents the detailing of post-tensioned members for crack mitigation, plus the detailing of tendons along with different profiles for optimum design and performance. It is a guide for practicing engineers and a more practical text for graduate students"--
