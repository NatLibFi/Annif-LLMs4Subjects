Keeping the promise? : contextualizing inclusive education in developing countries
Inclusive education became a global promise corroborated by international declarations such as the Salamanca Statement (1994) and the Incheon Declaration (2015).  Most countries worldwide have committed to the goal of inclusive education, putting a lot of pressure on so-called developing countries.  Against this backdrop, the threefold purpose of this book is to:  1. Generate research evidence on the development and implementation of inclusive education in developing countries, 2. Contextualize inclusive education in specific developing countries and contexts, and 3. Reflect on the future of inclusive education in developing countries. Dieser Titel ist im Open Access auf dem Dokumentenserver pedocs des DIPF hinterlegt. Im Online-Vertrieb ist er aus organisatorischen Gründen mit einer Service-Gebühr belegt.
