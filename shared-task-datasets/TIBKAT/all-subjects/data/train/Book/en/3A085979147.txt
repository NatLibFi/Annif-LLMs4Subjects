Growth, distribution and poverty in Africa : messages from the 1990s
"This book examines the main factors behind observed poverty changes in eight countries - Ethiopia, Ghana, Madagascar, Mauritania, Nigeria, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. After reviewing the trends in income poverty and other, more direct measures of well-being (such as education, health, and nutrition), the authors go beyond the aggregate numbers and highlight the insights to be gained from unraveling the microeconomic data.

Growth, Distribution, and Poverty in Africa describes those groups left behind and calls for public action to ensure that all poor Africans gain from future economic growth."--P. [4] of cover
