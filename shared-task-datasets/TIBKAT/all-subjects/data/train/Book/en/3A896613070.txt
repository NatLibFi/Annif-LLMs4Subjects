The imaginary geography of hollywood cinema 1960-2000
The Imaginary Geography of Hollywood Cinema 1960-2000 combines digital cartography with close readings of representative films to write a history of twentieth century Hollywood narrative cinema at the intersection of the geographies of narrative location, production, consumption and taste in the post-classical era, before the rise of digital cinema. This text reorients and redraws the boundaries of film history both literally and figuratively by cataloguing filmsâ€™ narrative locations on digital maps to examine where Hollywood locates its narratives over time.
