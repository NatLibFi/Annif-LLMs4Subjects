Adaptation or expiration in family firms : organizational flexibility in emerging economies
Andr√©s Hatum explores determinants of organizational flexibility in this examination of four family-owned companies, two flexible and two less flexible, from the edible oil and pharmaceutical industries. By means of an innovative analysis-including longitudinal analysis, coding analysis, statistical analysis and the use of original display charts--he illustrates the determinants of flexibility and sheds light on the process of transformation and adaptation of family firms, an area that has not yet been the subject of extensive empirical inquiry
