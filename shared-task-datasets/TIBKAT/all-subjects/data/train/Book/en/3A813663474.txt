Intel Galileo and Intel Galileo Gen 2 : API Features and Arduino Projects for Linux Programmers
Intel Galileo and Intel Galileo Gen 2:API Features and Arduino Projects for Linux Programmers provides detailed information about Intel Galileo and Intel Galileo Gen 2 boards for all software developers interested in Arduino and the Linux platform. The book covers the new Arduino APIs and an introduction about how to develop natively using Linux. You’ll learn how to Linux libraries and applications are used and interact with sketches, configure Wi-Fi mPCIe, and much more. Currently there are no books or easily information available on how to use the special APIs created for Galileo, or how which mPCIe modules really works and how to use them, or any information on how to take advantages of Linux and cross-compilers developing different projects. Developers currently have very limited resources on how to really explore all capabilities of the Intel Galileo family board. This book tries to keep all projects in a low cost margin. Author Manoel Carlos Ramon is a member of the Intel Galileo development team; his text draw on his practical experience in working on the Galileo project as he shares the team’s findings, problems, fixes, workarounds and techniques with the open source community. His areas of expertise are wide-ranging, including Linux embedded kernel and device drivers, C/C++, Java, OpenGL, Assembler, Android NDK/SDK/ADK and 2G/3G/4G modem integration. He has more than 17 years of experience in research and development of mobile devices and embedded circuits. His personal blog about programming is www.bytesthink.com
