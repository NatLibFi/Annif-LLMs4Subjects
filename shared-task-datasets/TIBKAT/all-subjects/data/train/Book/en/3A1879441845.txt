Dynamics of uneven development
This important new book critically examines the argument that structural asymmetries between the rich, industrialised countries of the global 'north' or 'centre' and the poor, largely primary-producing countries of the 'south' or 'periphery' could be responsible for an unequal division of the gains from international trade and investment. It explores this view by developing a model of Centre-Periphery relations using building blocks provided by Sraffa, Leontief, Pasinetti, Goodwin and others
