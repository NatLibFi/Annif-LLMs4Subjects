Calligraphy and architecture in the Muslim world
"This book explores the myriad interactions between calligraphy and architecture throughout the history of the Muslim world. From Spain to China, Islamic architecture and calligraphy are inexorably intertwined. Mosques, dervish lodges, mausolea, libraries, even baths and marketplaces bear masterpieces of calligraphy that rival the most refined books and scrolls. This major reference work focuses on architectural inscriptions throughout the Muslim world, some going back to the Middle Ages, others dating from our own lifetime. What were the purposes of these inscriptions? How do they infuse buildings with culturally specific meanings, sacred or profane? What do they add to architectural design? What sorts of materials were used, and how do they interact with light and space? Who were their patrons, and what do we know about the artists who produced them? You can find out with this exciting new collection written by a stellar cast of international contributors. It features 28 case studies explain different aspects and contexts of calligraphy in Islamic architecture. It is geographically wide-ranging - covers North Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, China and Spain. It takes an interdisciplinary approach to analysing calligraphy as part of its larger spatial-architectural context. It is lavishly illustrated with 400 colour images
