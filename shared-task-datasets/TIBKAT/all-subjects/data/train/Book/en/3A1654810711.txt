It From Bit or Bit From It? : On Physics and Information
The essays in this book look at the question of whether physics can be based on information, or - as John Wheeler phrased it - whether we can get 'It from Bit'. They are based on the prize-winning essays submitted to the FQXi essay competition of the same name, which drew over 180 entries.The eighteen contributions address topics as diverse as quantum foundations, entropy conservation, nonlinear logic and countable spacetime. Together they provide stimulating reading for all physics aficionados interested in the possible role(s) of information in the laws of nature.The Foundational Questions Institute, FQXi, catalyzes, supports, and disseminates research on questions at the foundations of physics and cosmology, particularly new frontiers and innovative ideas integral to a deep understanding of reality, but unlikely to be supported by conventional funding sources.
