Geometrical Aspects of Functional Analysis : Israel Seminar, 1985â€“86
These are the proceedings of the Israel Seminar on the Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis (GAFA) which was held between October 1985 and June 1986. The main emphasis of the seminar was on the study of the geometry of Banach spaces and in particular the study of convex sets in and infinite-dimensional spaces. The greater part of the volume is made up of original research papers; a few of the papers are expository in nature. Together, they reflect the wide scope of the problems studied at present in the framework of the geometry of Banach spaces
