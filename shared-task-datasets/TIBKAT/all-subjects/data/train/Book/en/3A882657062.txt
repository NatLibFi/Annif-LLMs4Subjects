"The world is saturated with data. We are regularly presented with data in words, tables, and graphics. Students from many academic fields are now expected to be educated about data in one form or another. Yet the typical sequence of courses--introductory statistics and research methods--does not provide sufficient information about data, learning to work with data sets, or how to present data to various audiences. This book is designed for these purposes. It discusses how data are used in research projects, where to get data, how to manage them with software, and how to present them so that one's message comes through clearly. With few expectations beyond some familiarity with basic statistics and research methods, this book provides a comprehensive set of principles for understanding and using data as part of a research project"--Provided by publisher
