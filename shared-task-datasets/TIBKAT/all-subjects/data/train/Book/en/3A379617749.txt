Differential models : an introduction with Mathcad
Differential equations are often used in mathematical models for technological processes or devices. However, the design of a differential mathematical model iscrucial anddifficult in engineering. As a hands-on approach to learn how to pose a differential mathematical modelthe authors have selected 9 examples with important practical application and treat them as following:- Problem-setting and physical model formulation- Designing the differential mathematical model- Integration of the differential equations- Visualization of results Each step of the development ofa differential model isenriched by respective Mathcad 11commands, todays necessary linkage of engineering significance and high computing complexity.
