Distribution theory : with applications in engineering and physics
In this comprehensive monograph, the authors apply modern mathematical methods to the study of mechanical and physical phenoema or techniques in acoustics, optics, and electrostatics, where classical mathematical tools fail. They present a general method of approaching problems, pointing out different aspects and difficulties that may occur. With respect to the theory of distributions, only the results and the principle theorems are given as well as some mathematical results.  The book also systematically deals with a large number of applications to problems of general Newtonian mechanics, as well as to problems pertaining to the mechanics of deformable solids and physics. Special attention is place upon the introduction of corresponding mathematical models. -- P. [4] of cover
