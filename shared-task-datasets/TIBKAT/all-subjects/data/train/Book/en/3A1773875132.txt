Wildlife Study Design
Despite the number of wildlife and conservation studies that are conducted, researchers and resource managers have not had a comprehensive guide to planning new studies. Wildlife Study Design fills that need by covering all aspects of study design, including surveys of major types of studies and variables, impact assessment, sampling techniques, inventorying and monitoring, and analysis of data. The book includes a practical, step-by-step guide to setting up a new study. Minimal mathematical notation and examples drawn from field research make applied animal ecology both accessible and relevant. Resource managers, researchers, and students of wildlife and conservation biology will find this book a fundamental resource for implementing and evaluating appropriate studies.
