A new financial market structure for East Asia
This book contends that the East Asian financial constitution lacks an appropriate infrastructure, resulting in inefficient allocation of high savings and an over-inflated short-term debt market. It goes on to point out that despite high savings, East Asia's dependency on financial centers outside the region is also relatively high, and that there is no strong region-wide network to connect various financial centers in East Asia
