Introduction to mediation, moderation, and conditional process analysis : a regression-based approach
"This engaging book explains the fundamentals of mediation and moderation analysis and their integration as 'conditional process analysis.' Procedures are described for testing hypotheses about the mechanisms by which causal effects operate, the conditions under which they occur, and the moderation of mechanisms. Relying on the principles of ordinary least squares regression, Andrew Hayes carefully explains the estimation and interpretation of direct and indirect effects, probing and visualization of interactions, and testing of questions about moderated mediation. Examples using data from published studies illustrate how to conduct and report the analyses described in the book. Of special value, the book introduces and documents PROCESS, a macro for SPSS and SAS that does all the computations described in the book. The author's website (www.afhayes.com) offers free downloads of PROCESS plus data files for the book's examples"--Provided by publisher
