Industrialising Africa : unlocking the economic potential of the continent
"Industrializing Africa examines the prospect of industrial development on the African continent from a radically different perspective. The book demonstrates that the elusive industrial development in Africa is a clear manifest of an incomplete decolonization of African economies. Through a detailed discussion of the current status of industrial development and the past industrialization strategies implemented on the continent, the book clearly shows that sustained industrial growth will remain elusive as long as African economies continue to operate under the colonial economic structure and logic, where African countries are structured to supply raw materials to industrial centres. If Africa is to have a chance to significantly grow its industrial sector, it has to de-centre the colonial economic logic by learning to build industrial capabilities, even in areas where countries on the continent currently do not have comparative advantage." - Provided by publisher
