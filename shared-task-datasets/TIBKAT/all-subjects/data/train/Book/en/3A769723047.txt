Design transitions : [inspiring stories - global viewpoints - how design is changing]
The world of design is changing. In response designers are expanding their professional boundaries, moving from designing objects to designing services and experiences to designing for positive social change. The designer no longer exists as a lone creative voice but is increasingly becoming a facilitator of other people's creativity, working in collaboration with stakeholders through participatory approaches. Taken together, the roles of designers are changing but they are still very much drawing on the fundamental skill set of designers. How can today's design practitioners, educators and students respond to the transition? In order to document and consider the current transitions happening in design practice, this book brings together some of the world's leading and innovative design practices that are challenging the traditional notions of designing and are operating in new design spaces
