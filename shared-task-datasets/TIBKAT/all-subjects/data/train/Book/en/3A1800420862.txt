Dynamic time series models using R-INLA : an applied perspective
"Dynamic Time Series Models using R-INLA: An Applied Perspective is the outcome of a joint effort to systematically describe the use of R-INLA for analysing time series and showcasing the code and description by several examples. This book introduces the underpinnings of R-INLA and the tools needed for modelling different types of time series using an approximate Bayesian framework. The book is an ideal reference for statisticians and scientists who work with time series data. It provides an excellent resource for teaching a course on Bayesian analysis using state space models for time series"--
