Dynamics, statistics, and projective geometry of Galois fields
"V. I. Arnold reveals some unexpected connections between such apparently unrelated theories as Galois fields, dynamical systems, ergodic theory, statistics, chaos and the geometry of projective structures on finite sets. The author blends experimental results with examples and geometrical explorations to make these findings accessible to a broad range of mathematicians, from undergraduate students to experienced researchers"--
