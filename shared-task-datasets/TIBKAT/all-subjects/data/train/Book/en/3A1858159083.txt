This book is based on a course for first-semester science students, held by the second author at the University of Zurich several times. Its goal is threefold: to have students learn a minimal working knowledge of linear algebra, acquire some computational skills, and familiarize them with mathematical language to make mathematical literature more accessible. Therefore, we give precise definitions, introduce helpful notations, and state any results carefully worded. We provide no proofs of these results but typically illustrate them with numerous examples. Additionally, for better understanding, we often give supporting arguments for why they are valid.
