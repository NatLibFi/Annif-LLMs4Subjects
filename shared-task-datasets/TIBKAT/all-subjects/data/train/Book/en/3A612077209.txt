Co-design approaches for dependable networked control systems
Networked Control Systems (NCS) is a growing field of application and calls for the development of integrated approaches requiring multidisciplinary skills in control, real-time computing and communication protocols. This book describes codesign approaches, and establishes the links between the QoC (Quality of Control) and QoS (Quality of Service) of the network and computing resources. The methods and tools described in this book take into account, at design level, various parameters and properties that must be satisfied by systems controlled through a network. Among the important network properties examined are the QoC, the dependability of the system, and the feasibility of the real-time scheduling of tasks and messages. Correct exploitation of these approaches allows for efficient design, diagnosis, and implementation of the NCS.This book will be of great interest to researchers and advanced students in automatic control, real-time computing, and networking domains, and to engineers tasked with development of NCS, as well as those working in related network design and engineering fields
