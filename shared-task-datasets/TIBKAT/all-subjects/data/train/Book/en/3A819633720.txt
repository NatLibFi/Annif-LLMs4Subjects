Biocompatible nanomaterials for targeted and controlled delivery of biomacromolecules
"Nanomaterials have gained immense recognition, particularly in biomacromolecular delivery, owing to their capability of diagnosis, controlled drug release or targeting at molecular, cellular and organ level. The present monograph endeavors to describe the role of nanomaterials in the development of various nanostructured, biomacromolecular delivery systems. This volume presents a discussion on various physicochemical properties, preparation techniques and analytical tools for characterizing these systems. The mechanisms of cellular internalization of nanomaterial based targeted systems is also embarked upon."--
