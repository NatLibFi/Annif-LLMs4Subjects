This is a thoroughgoing revision and expansion of the earlier book, bringing it up to date with the latest research. The older ideas are presented along with the new, and the experimental evidence is given in outline, and fully referenced. Where practical, illustrations are chosen from key works and the source reference is given in the subtitle as in the first edition. As before, this book is directed toward upper-year university students and graduate students.
