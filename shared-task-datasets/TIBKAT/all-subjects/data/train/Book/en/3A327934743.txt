Nuclear export of viral RNAs : with 1 table
Klappentext: Investigation of nuclear export has become a major research focus in cell biology. In particular, analysis of nucleocytoplasmic transport of viral RNAs lead already to the identification of multiple cellular proteins that participate in various nuclear export pathways. Moreover, increased research on viral RNA export is expected to result in the identification of novel drug targets for the therapy of virus-induced diseases. This volume of CTMI provides a timely overview to the mechanisms and factors that mediate nuclear export of viral RNAs. It also covers the structure of nuclear pore complexes and experimental approaches to investigate nuclear export.
