An introduction to graphene plasmonics
"The book aims at the graduate student entering the field of graphene plasmonics. It is essentially self-contained and brings together a number of different topics about the field that are scattered in a vast literature. The text is composed of eleven chapters and of a set of detailed appendices. It can be read in two different ways: Reading only the chapters to get acquainted with the field of plasmonics in graphene or reading the chapters and studying the appendices to get a working knowledge of the topic. Thus, the book provides a good training for the students on the different aspects of the field"--
