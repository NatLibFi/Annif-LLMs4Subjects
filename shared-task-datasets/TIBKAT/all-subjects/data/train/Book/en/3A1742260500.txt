Educational psychology : theory and practice
From renowned educational psychologist, Robert Slavin, the Tenth Edition of this popular text translates theory into practices that teachers can use in their classrooms with deeper inquiry into the concept of intentionality and a thorough integration of standards.  This new edition highlights the most current issues and emerging trends in the field of educational psychology, while continuing to have in-depth, practical coverage with a focus on the intentional teacher.  An “intentional teacher,” according to Slavin, is one who constantly reflects on his or her practice and makes instructional decisions based on a clear conception of how these practices affect students. To help readers become “intentional teachers,” the author offers a set of questions to guide them and models best practices through classroom examples.
