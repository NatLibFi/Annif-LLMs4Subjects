Data cities : how satellites are transforming architecture and design
"This book explains how rocket science and electronic technologies are transforming how we live and understand architecture, as networks of semiconductors, satellites, scanners and sensors convert light into unprecedented formats and contents of information. Flows of data will inform our future behaviours in physical, virtual and hybrid-reality situations, and architecture and cities are being reinvented as not merely static structures, but places that pulse. It surveys exceptional projects created by leading architects, scientists, artists, engineers, geographers, urban planners, gamers, gardeners, filmmakers and musicians."--Publisher's description
