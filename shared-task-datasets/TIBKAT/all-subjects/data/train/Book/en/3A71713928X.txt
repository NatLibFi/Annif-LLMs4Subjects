Magnetorheological fluid technology : applications in vehicle systems
"This book represents recent research and developments on vehicle applications of smart materials using magnetorheological fluids (MR fluids), a type of smart fluid in a carrier fluid. It introduces physical phenomena and properties of MR fluids with potential applications, covers control methodologies, introduces the hysteresis identification of MR fluid and its application, and presents optimal design methods. It also covers applications for passenger and commercial vehicles, and includes case studies and examples related to the topics. For each application, a consecutive process is presented such as actuator design, system modeling, analysis, control strategy formulation, experimental set-up, and control performance"--
