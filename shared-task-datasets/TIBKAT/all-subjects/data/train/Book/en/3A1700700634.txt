Race, faith and planning in Britain
"Race, Faith and Planning in Britain adopts a critical race theory perspective to analyse and discuss challenges of planning in contemporary multi-ethnic Britain. Exploring how planning is affected by and affects the racialization of social relations, this book charts the history of the UK planning system's approach, in terms of the spatial consequences of immigration, discourses of diversity and cohesion, citizenship and belonging. Authors Richard Gale and Huw Thomas pay special attention to the experiences of minority groups in Britain, including Gypsies and Travellers, and British Muslims. They underline that the struggle over planning in racialized societies must be construed as part of a wider political struggle over equality. This book is an essential read for students and practitioners of planning in multicultural contexts"--
