Legal theory
Legal Theory intends to serve as a student’s book for the legal education in the area of the basic discipline ‘theory of law’. For this purpose it contributes to the recent fundamental jurisprudential debate, which more extensively than the traditional theory of law refers to the communicative and media prerequisites of law. In the first part, the fundamental problems and basic concepts of theory of law are discussed. The focus is laid on the theory of rules or norms, formation of systems in law as well as questions concerning the application of law. In the second part, the discussion of communication and media theoretical approaches presented in the introduction is given more prominence. It is illustrated, on the one hand, that the law is reliant on communication and communication media. On the other hand, under the concept of ‘evolution theory’, the history of development of law is addressed in a communication and media theoretical manner.
