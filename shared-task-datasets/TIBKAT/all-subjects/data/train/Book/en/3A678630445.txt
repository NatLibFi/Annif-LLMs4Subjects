The politics of modern Central America : civil war, democratization, and underdevelopment
"This book analyzes the origins and consequences of civil war in Central America. Fabrice Lehoucq explains why the inability of autocracies to reform led to the civil wars of the 1980s and why violent conflict led to the unexpected transition to non-military governments in the 1990s.
