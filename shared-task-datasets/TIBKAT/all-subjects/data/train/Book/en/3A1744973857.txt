Place branding as an academic field is both challenging and under explored. In the face of an ever-expanding global urban population, this Handbook illustrates how place branding can contribute to transforming urban agglomeration into sustainable and healthy areas. The Chapters cover four key areas; place branding as a tool for economic development, experiences of place making, methodologies to develop place brands, and urban regeneration. Pioneering experts provide in-depth analysis on the politics and significance of place branding's inclusion in economic development programs, the multisensory dimensions of sense of place, and new epistemologies and methodologies for research. They further examine the role of place marketing in combatting challenges for future cities such as mobility, aesthetics and metropolitan conurbation. Students and scholars in management, marketing and economics will find this innovative and contemporary Handbook a must read. Eminently practical, it will also benefit policy makers and place planners, alongside consultants on public policies. Place branding as an academic field is both challenging and under explored.
