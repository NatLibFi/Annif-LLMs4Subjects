Computational optical coherence and statistical optics
"Computational Optical Coherence and Statistical Optics presents current approaches for simulating random optical fields with prescribed statistical properties. The book first reviews the key theoretical concepts of statistical optics and classic optical coherence theory, then demonstrates how to simulate optical fields with arbitrary states of temporal and spatial coherence in numerous detailed examples. Building on the techniques developed earlier in the text, the book culminates in the final two chapters with simulations of the double-slit or Young's experiment, a Michelson interferometer, the Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect, imaging with partially coherent light, and non-stationary or pulsed partially coherent beams. All of the simulations are written in the MATLAB scripting language (.m files), explained in detail throughout the text, and included as part of the book. Computational Optical Coherence and Statistical Optics will benefit students studying statistical optics as well as researchers and engineers working on applications which deal with or exploit optical coherence, e.g., astronomy, optical coherence tomography, beam shaping, ghost imaging, speckle mitigation, etc. In addition, this book will be of use to instructors or teachers of statistical optics. Using the simulation approaches presented in the book, instructors can create demonstrations of foundational statistical optics concepts, which will augment the theory presented in the classic pedagogical texts by J. Goodman and E. Wolf"--
