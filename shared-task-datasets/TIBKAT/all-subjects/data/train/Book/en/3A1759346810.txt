Extrinsic geometry of foliations
This book is devoted to geometric problems of foliation theory, in particular those related to extrinsic geometry, modern branch of Riemannian Geometry. The concept of mixed curvature is central to the discussion, and a version of the deep problem of the Ricci curvature for the case of mixed curvature of foliations is examined. The book is divided into five chapters that deal with integral and variation formulas and curvature and dynamics of foliations. Different approaches and methods (local and global, regular and singular) in solving the problems are described using integral and variation formulas, extrinsic geometric flows, generalizations of the Ricci and scalar curvatures, pseudo-Riemannian and metric-affine geometries, and 'computable' Finsler metrics. The book presents the state of the art in geometric and analytical theory of foliations as a continuation of the authors' life-long work in extrinsic geometry. It is designed for newcomers to the field as well as experienced geometers working in Riemannian geometry, foliation theory, differential topology, and a wide range of researchers in differential equations and their applications. It may also be a useful supplement to postgraduate level work and can inspire new interesting topics to explore.
