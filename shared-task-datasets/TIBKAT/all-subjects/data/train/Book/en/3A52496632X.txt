Ultrathin Magnetic Structures II : Measurement Techniques and Novel Magnetic Properties
The ability to understand and control the properties of interfaces has created a field of magnetism with profound impact in technology. This development has generated a need for a work that serves as an introduction to the field for those entering it from other fields. This work aims to fulfill this need
