Revision of Loose Femoral Prostheses : With a Stem System Based on the “Press-Fit” Principle: A Concept and a System of Implants: A Method and Its Results
The author of this multimedia work sets himself an ambitious goal: to allow a surgeon to achieve the revision of a prosthesis without too many difficulties (or too much apprehension!) with guaranteed results if he follows the proposed method step by step, and this, even if he is not very experienced in this discipline.To fulfil this purpose, the author provides a clear definition of the press-fit concept (principles and practical applications) and from there, he offers a logical and rigorous method for, first of all, planning the surgery, and then, performing it.The written text is also available as a computerized slide show, coming with a browsing system in order to make a pre-operative planning, which gives real pedagogic value to the whole of this work.
