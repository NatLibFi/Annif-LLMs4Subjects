The decline of the South African economy
South Africa's leading economists adopt within this volume a sectoral approach in their analysis of the drastic changes that have occurred within the South African economy since 1970. The book illustrates how, despite its sophisticated infrastructure, the South African economy has shared in the economic decline - resulting from misguided economic policies - that has been the experience of Sub-Saharan Africa
