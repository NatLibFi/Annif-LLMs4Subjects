Handbook of cultural economics
"Cultural economics has become well established as a subject of interest for students and instructors of courses ranging from economics to arts administration as well as for policy-makers and practitioners in the creative industries. Digitization has had a tremendous impact on many areas of the creative economy and the third edition of this popular book fully reflects it. The Handbook of Cultural Economics is an acknowledged leading source for students, teachers and others interested in finding out about the subject. Cultural economics covers a wide range of topics and they are reflected in the many short and accessibly written chapters. Each chapter is written by a specialist in the subject and offers both suggestions for further reading and cross-references to other related chapters in the book. It therefore combines accessibility with depth of knowledge. The intention of the book is to introduce the reader to the various topics and to testify to the strength of economics in explaining the economic aspects of the world of the arts and creative industries. The third edition demonstrates the huge impact that digitization has had on production and consumption in the sector. While being accessible to any reader with a basic knowledge of economics, it presents a comprehensive study at the forefront of the field for students and teachers of economics, business economics, creative industries, and media and arts administration as well as for policy-makers"--
