1. Introduction -- 2. Frank Hyneman Knight, the moral philosopher -- 3. Henry Calvert Simons, author of the blueprint -- 4. Friedrich von Hayek and the Austrian influence -- 5. Milton Friedman and monetarism -- 6. James Buchanan and public choice theory -- 7. Robert E. Lucas -- Jr. and new classical economics -- 8. Conclusion
This book provides the definitive account of this watershed and traces the evolution of laissez-faire using the cases of its proponents, Frank Knight, Henry Simons, Friedrich von Hayek, Milton Friedman, James Buchanan and Robert Lucas. By elucidating the pre-analytical framework of their writings, Sherryl Kasper accounts for the ideological influence of these pioneers on theoretical work, and illustrates that they played a primary role in founding the theoretical and philosophical use of rules as the basis of macroeconomic policy. A case study of the way in which interwar pluralism transcended to postwar neoclassicism is also featured
