Scattering of Wedges and Cones with Impedance Boundary Conditions
This monograph on scattering of electromagnetic waves by impedance wedges and cones is the most comprehensive treatise in existence on a specialized topic that is of great interest to electrical engineers and mathematical physicists. Written by two international experts on scattering and diffraction, it constitutes a fundamental and lasting contribution to the field of applied mathematics. Even though its obvious applications are to radar and to mobile communications, the mathematical methods employed herein are also applicable to problems involving scattering of acoustic and elastic waves. Thus, this monograph is of interest to all researchers on wave propagation and will remain a standard reference for the foreseeable future
