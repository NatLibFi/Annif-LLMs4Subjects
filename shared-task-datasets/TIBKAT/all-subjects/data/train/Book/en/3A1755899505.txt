Thinking like a linguist : an introduction to the science of language
"Thinking like a linguist is an engaging introduction to the study of language for undergraduate or beginning graduate students, aimed especially at those who would like to continue further linguistic study. It introduces students to analytical thinking about language, but goes beyond existing texts to show what it means to think like a scientist about language, through the exploration of data and interactive problem sets. Step-by-step instructions on interpreting a wide range of data teach students to perform scientific linguistic analysis."
