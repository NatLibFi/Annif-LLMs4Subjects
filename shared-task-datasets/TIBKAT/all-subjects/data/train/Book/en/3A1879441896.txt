Mixed economies in Europe : an evolutionary perspective on their emergence, transition and regulation
The end of the cold war has created a new and unprecedented type of mixed economy in Eastern Europe. This innovative up-to-date book questions whether the former Eastern block countries will follow the path of West European mixed economies, or if a quite different economic system will emerge. Mixed Economies in Europe presents new work by distinguished authors who offer an evolutionary perspective on the dynamics of mixed economies. In so doing, they provide a unique, policy-orientated assessment of the formation and transformation of mixed economies in both Eastern and Western Europe. In particular, they emphasise the importance of institutional arrangements and regulatory frameworks. The book shows that the liberalization of markets, both within and between European countries has led, in many cases, to a divergence of economic performance across regions and is likely to continue to do so in the future. This raises policy considerations for the EC and its constituent governments which have not, as yet, been adequately addressed
