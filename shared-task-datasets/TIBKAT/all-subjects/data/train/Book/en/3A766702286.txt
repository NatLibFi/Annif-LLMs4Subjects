Comprehensive analytical chemistry / [ed. by D. Barceló] ; Vol. 62: Analysis, removal, effects and risk of pharmaceuticals in the water cycle : occurence and transformation in the environment
Analysis, removal, effects and risk of pharmaceuticals in the water cycle provides an overview of the current analytical methods for trace determination of pharmaceuticals in environmental samples. The book also reviews the fate and occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the water cycle for their elimination in wastewater and drinking water treatment, focusing on the newest developments in treatment technologies, such as membrane bioreactors and advanced oxidation processes
