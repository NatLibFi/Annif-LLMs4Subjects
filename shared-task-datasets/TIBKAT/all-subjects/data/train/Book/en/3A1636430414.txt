Dopants and defects in semiconductors
"This revised edition continues to provide the most complete coverage of the fundamental knowledge of semiconductors, expanding on the latest technology and applications of semiconductors with a new chapter. In addition to inclusion of new chapter problems and worked examples, it delves into solid-state lighting (LEDs and laser diodes). It treats dopants and defects as a unified subject, offering a solid foundation for experimental methods and the theory of defects in semiconductors"--
