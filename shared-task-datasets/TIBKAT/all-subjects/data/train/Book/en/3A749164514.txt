The Maximum Entropy Method
The Maximum Entropy Method addresses the principle and applications of the powerful maximum entropy method (MEM), which has its roots in the principle of maximum entropy introduced into the field of statistical mechanics almost 40 years ago. This method has since been adopted in many areas of science and technology, such as spectral analysis, image restoration, mathematics, and physics. Readers of this monograph are lead to current research frontiers through the analysis and comparison of three schools of thought in MEM research. The step-by-step approach and the detailed examples make this an invaluable textbook for graduate students. The detailed practical algorithms will also appeal to scientists and engineers using this book as a reference work
