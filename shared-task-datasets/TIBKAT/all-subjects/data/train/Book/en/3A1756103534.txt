Geochemistry : concepts and applications
"Geochemistry is a branch of earth science. It is considered as a field of study that uses tools and principles of chemistry to explain the mechanisms in geologic environments. It often focuses on determining processes that control the abundance composition of minerals and their distribution in the earth crust. It plays a vital role in environmental soil and water systems to empathize, and modulates environmental problems, and studies the composition, structure and processes of the earth. This book aims to explore basic principles, concepts and applications of geochemistry. Topics include chemical weathering, impacts on living beings and water, geochemical cycles, oxidation and redox reactions in geochemistry, isotopes, analytical techniques, medicinal, inorganic, marine, atmospheric, and environmental applications, as well as case studies. This book helps in understanding the chemical composition of the earth and its applications. It also includes beneficial effects, bottlenecks, solutions, and future."--
