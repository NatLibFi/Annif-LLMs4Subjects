"The traditional dialect spoken in the Shetland Isles, the northernmost part of Scotland and Britain, is highly distinct. It displays distinct, characteristic features on all linguistic levels and particularly in its sound system, or its phonology. The dialect is one of the lesser-known varieties of English within the Inner circle. Increasing interest in the lesser-known varieties of English in recent years has brought a realization that there are still blanks on the map, even within the very core of the Inner circle. Sundkvist's comprehensive treatise draws upon results from a three-year research project funded by the Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation, for which a phonological survey of the Shetland dialect was carried out 2010-2012. This book is a useful resource for those working on historical linguistics and is intended to serve as a comprehensive description and accessible reference source on one of the most distinct lesser-known varieties of English within Britain. It documents and offers a systematic account of the rich regional variation as well as being a reference source for those studying the historical formation and emergence of, and language variation and change in Shetland as well as those within the broader field of Germanic linguistics"--
