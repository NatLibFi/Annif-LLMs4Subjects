Economic institutions and complexity : structures, interactions, and emergent properties
This book presents a concept of interactive economic institutions and systems, considered by the author to be a bottleneck to scientific progress. In the author's evaluation of contemporary institutional economics, the focus is on the interaction of complex economic structures in terms of their coordination routines, emergent behavioural characteristics and also their economic performance. Differences of behaviour characteristics and economic performances are explained as consequences of differently structured coordination routines. The book demonstrates that complexity, rather than being part of the problem of institutional analysis, can be made part of the solution. Economic Institutions and Complexity will appeal to academics and researchers of New Institutional Economics, microeconomics, evolutionary economics, political science, organization sociology and behavioural science
