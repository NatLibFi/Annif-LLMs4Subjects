Nineteenth century American literature in transition ; volume 4: American literature in transition, 1876-1910
"Nineteenth-Century American Literature in Transition provides an omnibus account of American literature and its ever-evolving field of study. Emphasizing the ways in which American literature has been in transition ever since its founding, this revisionary series examines four phases of American literary history, focusing on the movements, forms, and media that developed from the late eighteenth to the early twentieth century.
