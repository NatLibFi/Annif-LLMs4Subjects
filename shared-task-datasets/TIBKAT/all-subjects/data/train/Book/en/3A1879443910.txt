The Korean economy : post-crisis policies, issues and prospects
Korea has played, and will increasingly play, an important role in the future development of the South East Asian region, including the expansion of regional economic cooperation and interregional trade. Indeed Korea has been a leading proponent of the idea of ASEAN+3. Clearer understanding of this economy, its major contemporary policy and reform issues and its future, are of particular interest from both regional and global perspectives. A remarkable recovery of the post-crisis Korean economy occurred, but questions over its sustainability remain. Korea, therefore, stands at an important economic crossroads. This opportune book draws upon the knowledge of a wide range of experienced Korean economists and specialists to cover in detail many specific sectors and policy areas, ranging from the key reform sectors - financial, corporate, and public and the labour market, to that of monetary and exchange rate policies. The role and contribution of the 'new economy' is also examined along with developments in Korea's trade and foreign direct investment, free trade agreement policy, inter-Korean economic relations, and the core ingredients of a 'new' growth and economic development paradigm. Scholars and researchers of comparative economics as well as more specifically contemporary Korean and Asian economic, development and financial studies will find this book of great interest
