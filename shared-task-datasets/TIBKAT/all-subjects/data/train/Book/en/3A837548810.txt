A history of New Zealand literature
"A History of New Zealand Literature traces the genealogy of New Zealand literature from its first imaginings by colonial Europeans to the development of a national canon in the twentieth century. Beginning with a comprehensive introduction that charts the growth of a national literary tradition, this History includes extensive essays that illuminate the cultural and political intricacies of New Zealand literature. Organized thematically, these essays survey the multilayered verse and fiction of such diverse writers as Katherine Mansfield, Allen Curnow, Frank Sargeson, Janet Frame, Keri Hulme, Witi Ihimaera and Patricia Grace. Written by a host of leading scholars, this History devotes special attention to the lasting significance of colonialism and multiculturalism in New Zealand literature. This book is of pivotal importance to the development of New Zealand writing and will serve as an invaluable reference for specialists and students alike"--
