Magnesium injection molding
The objective of this book, being the first one on magnesium injection molding, is to treat both the scientific background and the technological aspects as they are understood at present. All aspects of material development, manufacturing and engineering will be covered including production, processing and application of magnesium and its alloys, research and practical implementation of magnesium injection molding and die casting, semisolid processing of alloys and composites. Magnesium injection molding is used to manufacture millions of components from magnesium alloys for various applications, including computer, camera and consumer electronic housings, automotive parts, sporting goods, and household and office equipment.
