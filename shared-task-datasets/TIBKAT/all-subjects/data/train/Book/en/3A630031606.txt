Locally solid Riesz spaces
Riesz spaces are named after Frigyes Riesz who first defined them in his 1928 paper "Sur la décomposition des opérations fonctionelles linéaires." Most early work on Riesz spaces addressed the algebraic side of the theory, ignoring the analytic implications, but exploring normed Riesz spaces and Banach lattices. This book concentrates on the general theory of topological Riesz spaces, with a unified approach to locally solid Riesz spaces, emphasizing the relationship between the order structure and the topological structure
The lattice structure if Riesz spaces -- Locally solid topologies -- Lebesgue and pre-Lebesgue topologies -- Fatou topologies -- Metrizable locally solid Riesz spaces -- Locally convex-solid Riesz spaces -- Laterally complete Riesz spaces.
