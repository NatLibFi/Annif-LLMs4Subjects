Biohydrogen : developments and prospects
"Biohydrogen is a promising gaseous biofuel that has prospective applications in combined heat and power, for fuel cells, or as a precursor for chemicals production. Hydrogen can also be converted to liquid hydrocarbon fuels and value-added chemicals through catalytic thermochemical or through biocatalytic biological pathways. This book covers some the important recent advances in the production and utilization of biohydrogen and its solutions for clean fuel, waste management, waste valorization, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change mitigation. Biohydrogen: Developments and Prospects first covers the basic principles, benefits, and challenges concerning both the biological and thermochemical routes for biohydrogen production and then goes on to address topics such as biomass conversion to hydrogen through gasification with a focus on the process parameters, catalytic reforming technologies for hydrogen production concerning various feedstocks; the co-conversion of plastic wastes and biomass into biohydrogen through co-gasification technology; the effect of process parameters on syngas yields through co-gasification; fermentative hydrogen production technologies; the molecular mechanism of hydrogen production and enhancing the yield in hydrogen production by genetic and metabolic engineering; hydrogen production routes through microbial electrolysis; and much more. Key features: Helps to provide the most up-to-date information addressing solutions for clean fuel, waste management, waste valorization, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change mitigation Offers in-depth knowledge about recent developments on thermochemical methanation technologies and bioreactor and bioprocess design in anaerobic digestion technologies Discusses biotechnological interventions for metabolic engineering of microorganisms towards biohydrogen production Looks at gasification technologies and catalytic reforming technologies for hydrogen production Addressing both the fundamentals as well as advanced new technological research on biohydrogen production by focusing on recent global research with emphasis on the technological, environmental, socioeconomic, and techno-economic aspects, this volume will be a valuable resource for faculty and advanced students, chemical and biochemical engineers, bioprocess technologists, biochemists, environmental scientists and researchers as well as theoretical and applied statisticians and policymakers in this area"--
