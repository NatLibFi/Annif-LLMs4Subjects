Handbook of Set Theory
- Definitive compendium of all of modern set theory- Chapters written by the leading experts in their areas- Carefully crafted, self-contained expositions for all the subfields of set theory- No other up-to-date single source available for all subfields of set theoryThis handbook is the definitive compendium of the methods, results, and current initiatives in modern set theory in all its research directions. Set theory has entered its prime as an advanced and autonomous field of mathematics with foundational significance, and the expanse and variety of this handbook attests to the richness and sophistication of the subject. The chapters are written by acknowledged experts, major research figures in their areas, and they each bring to bear their experience and insights in carefully wrought, self-contained expositions. There is historical depth, elegant development, probing to the frontiers, and prospects for the future. This handbook is essential reading for the aspiring researcher, a pivotal focus for the veteran set theorist, and a massive reference for all those who want to gain a larger sense of the tremendous advances that have been made in the subject, one which first appeared as a foundation of mathematics but in the last several decades has expanded into a broad and far-reaching field with its own self-fueling initiatives.
