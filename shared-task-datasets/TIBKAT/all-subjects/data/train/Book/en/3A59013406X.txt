PIC projects : a practical approach
This volume is a collection of projects based around various microcontrollers from the PIC family. The reader is guided from very simple to more complex projects in order to gradually build their knowledge about PIC microcontrollers and digital electronics in general. PIC microcontrollers are popular with both industrial developers and hobbyists alike due to their low cost, wide availability, large user base, extensive collection of application notes, availability of low cost or free development tools, and serial programming (and re-programming with flash memory) capability
