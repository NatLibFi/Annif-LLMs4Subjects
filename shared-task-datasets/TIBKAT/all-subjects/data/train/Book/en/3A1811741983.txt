Architectural possibilities in the work of Eisenman
"This book examines the central decades of Peter Eisenman's work through a formal and thematic analysis of key architectural projects and writings, revealing underlying characteristics and arguing for their productive continuity and transformative role. The book explores Peter Eisenman's approach to architectural form generation and thinking. It does this through a thematic and formal analysis of main projects and writings from the mid-1970s to mid-1990s. Following an introductory chapter addressing potentialities, the book is organised in two parts. The first part focuses on key writings of Eisenman, framing the close reading around a practice of resistance, the architect's approach to history as analysis, and the transformative conceptualisation of time. In the second part, the book undertakes an analysis of select projects from the 1980s and 1990s. Three formal preoccupations and conceptual orientations - ground manipulations, figuration, and spatial events - organise this part of the book. Previously unpublished material from the Peter Eisenman Archive, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montr√©al, provides primary source material. A concluding chapter addresses Eisenman's teaching, its relation to his larger project, and possible legacies for educators, practitioners, scholars, and theorists"--
