The satellite communication ground segment and earth station handbook
From international telephone network gateways to direct broadcast home receivers, today's broad range of ground systems and devices require satellite communication engineers and business managers to have a broad and sound understanding of the design and operating principles of earth stations and ground control facilities. The book is the first to explore the delivery end of the satellite link and its relationship to delivery of services. Authored by a leading authority in the field, the book provides you with the knowledge you need to devise your own approach to implementing and managing earth stations and the overall ground segment. You find practical guidance in an array of critical areas, including: preparing requirements, performing preliminary analyses, reviewing hardware designs, managing the introduction of the overall ground segment, and more. In over 400 pages with nearly 200 illustrations, this valuable book covers dozens of essential topics, including...Earth station and ground segment design philosophy and principles. GEO and non-GEO satellite orbit configurations. Video, data, and digital audio, and multimedia transmission. Uplink power control, RF Filtering, decoding, and Internet interfaces. Major earth station configurations and antennas. Building design, environmental concerns, and O&M principles. Supplier negotiations, cost evaluation, and support services. Plus, you find informative case studies, insightful ideas for "future-proofing" earth stations, and much more!
