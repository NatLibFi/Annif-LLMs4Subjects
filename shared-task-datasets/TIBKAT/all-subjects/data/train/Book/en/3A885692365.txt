Handbook on the geographies of money and finance
The aim of this timely work, which appears in the wake of the worst global financial crisis since the late 1920s, is to bring together high quality research-based contributions from leading international scholars involved in constructing a geographical perspective on money. Topics covered include the crisis, the spatial circuits of finance, regulation, mainstream financial markets (banking, equity, etc), through to the various 'alternative' and 'disruptive' forms of money that have arisen in recent years. It will be of interest to geographers, political scientists, sociologists, economists
