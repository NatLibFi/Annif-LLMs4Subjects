Insect control : biological and synthetic agents
The publication of the extensive seven-volume work Comprehensive Molecular Insect Science provided a complete reference encompassing important developments and achievements in modern insect science, including reviews on the ecdysone receptor, lipocalins, and bacterial toxins. Now two editors of the original series, Drs. Lawrence I. Gilbert and Sarjeet S. Gill, have selected contributions for a special volume of compelling and timeless articles on key aspects of insect control. Insect Control includes the original articles and new addenda covering topics such as insect growth-and development-disrupting insecticides, mechanisms and use of Bacillus thuringiensis, biology and genomics of polydnaviruses, pheromone function and use in insect control, and more.--
This single-volume was created for the researcher, entomologist, or student with a specialized interest in insect control. --
