Emerging practices in architectural pedagogy : accommodating an uncertain future
"Emerging Practices in Architectural Pedagogy explores the emergent techniques in architectural education that are helping to bridge the gap between the institutional setting and working practice. It demonstrates how teaching and learning can, and should, be directed towards tackling the real-world problems that students will encounter within their professional careers. Architectural and design practitioners are becoming less specialised, they are embracing cross-disciplinary connections and practical problem-solving. Architecture and design schools must align their teaching to reflect this changing world, and evolve from a fact-based acquisition process to a participatory method of learning. This book uses an extended case-study format to examine large-scale issues. Each chapter represents a specific mode of practice, which is linked to the wider debate on architectural and design pedagogy; this includes collaborative workshops and interventions, issues connected to sustainability and climate change, responses to rapid urbanisation, and, the creation of collaborative relationships across disciplines. The book has an international perspective, with contributions from the UK, USA and Singapore, and includes a timely discussion on teaching in a remote climate. This book will be an invaluable resource for engaged academics and teaching practitioners interested in playing a key role in the future development of the architectural profession"--
