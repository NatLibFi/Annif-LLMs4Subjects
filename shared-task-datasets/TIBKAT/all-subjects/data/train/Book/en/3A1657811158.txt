Unitary representations and harmonic analysis : an introduction
The principal aim of this book is to give an introduction to harmonic analysis and the theory of unitary representations of Lie groups. The second edition has been brought up to date with a number of textual changes in each of the five chapters, a new appendix on Fatou's theorem has been added in connection with the limits of discrete series, and the bibliography has been tripled in length
