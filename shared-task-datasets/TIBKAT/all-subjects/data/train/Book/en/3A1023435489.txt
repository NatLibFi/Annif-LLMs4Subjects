Creating competitiveness : entrepreneurship and innovation policies for growth
Although competitiveness is typically associated with firms, they are not the only organizational body whose performance is dependent upon competitiveness. This poignant and insightful book focuses on how the varied economic performance of cities and regions, both within nations as well as across nations, during the era of the ‘Great Recession’ also highlights the need for competitiveness. -- Competitive cities and regions enjoy a superior economic performance, while their less competitive counterparts experience poorer economic growth and increasing unemployment. -- Using leading frameworks, this study provides applications and case studies about what shapes the competitiveness of places in an international context. Specific policies that enhance local competitiveness are identified and analyzed.
