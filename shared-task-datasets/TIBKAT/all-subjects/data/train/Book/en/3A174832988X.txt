Advances in FDTD computational electrodynamics : photonics and nanotechnology
This book presents the current state-of-the-art in formulating and implementing computational models of light with materials such as silicon and gold at the nanoscale. Maxwell's equations are solved using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique. It will help you understand the latest developments in computational modeling of nanoscale optical microscopy and microchip lithography. You will also explore cutting-edge details in modeling nanoscale plasmonics, including nonlocal dielectric functions, molecular interactions, and multi-level semiconductor gain. Other topics include nanoscale biophotonics, especially for detecting early-stage cancers, and quantum vacuum, including the Casimir effect and blackbody radiation. --
