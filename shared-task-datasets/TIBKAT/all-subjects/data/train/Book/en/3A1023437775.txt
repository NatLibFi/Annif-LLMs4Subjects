Entrepreneurship, money and coordination : Hayek's theory of cultural evolution
Hayek's theory of cultural evolution has always generated controversy. Interest in Hayek's theory, and others' analysis and criticism of it, has been rising of late. This volume urges a reconsideration of Hayeks' theory of evolution and aims to explore the relevance of Hayek's theory for its own sake and for evolutionary economics more generally
