Graphene based biopolymer nanocomposites
The book comprehensively covers the different topics of graphene based biopolymer and nanocomposites, mainly synthesis methods for the composite materials, various characterization techniques to study the superior properties and insights on potential advanced applications.The book will address and rectify the complications of using plastics that are non-degradable and has abhorrent impact on environment. The limitations of properties of biopolymer can be vanquished by employing graphene as a nanomaterial. Outstanding properties of graphene in accordance with biopolymer can be utilized to develop applications like water treatment, tissue engineering, photo-catalysts, super-absorbents. This is a useful reference source for both engineers and researchers working in composite materials science as well as the students attending materials science, physics, chemistry, and engineering courses
