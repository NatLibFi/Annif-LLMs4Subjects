The rapid integration of global governments, businesses and capital has faced a dramatic and often hostile backlash in recent years. As populist agendas worldwide gain momentum, Deglobalization 2.0 explores the key drivers of reactionary movements. From the 'Make America Great Again' movement in the US, to Continental European populism, Peter van Bergeijk explains the critical catalysts of anti-globalization sentiment. Through a historical lens, this book draws out similarities and differences between contemporary developments and the economic crises of the 1930s, offering a unique understanding of the political and economic drivers of deglobalization. Focusing on wealth inequality, social uncertainty and international competition for economic supremacy, van Bergeijk examines and offers answers for the lacunae in the globalization debate. Provocative, insightful and accessible, this book confronts the deglobalization issue as a matter of real urgency and is thus vital reading for policy makers and managers working in international affairs and economic relations. It also offers guidance for academics in international economics and relations moving into the uncharted territory of deglobalization processes
