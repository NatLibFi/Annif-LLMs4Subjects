Quantum noise : a handbook of Markovian and non-Markovian quantum stochastic methods with applications to quantum optics
This book offers a systematic and comprehensive exposition of the quantum stochastic methods that have been developed in the field of quantum optics. It includes new treatments of photodetection, quantum amplifier theory, non-Markovian quantum stochastic processes, quantum input--output theory, and positive P-representations. It is the first book in which quantum noise is described by a mathematically complete theory in a form that is also suited to practical applications. Special attention is paid to non-classical effects, such as squeezing and antibunching.Chaptersadded to the previous edition, on the stochastic Schrödinger equation, and on cascaded quantum systems, and now supplemented, in the third editionby achapteron recent developments in various pertinent fieldssuch aslaser cooling, Bose-Einstein condensation, quantum feedback and quantum information.
