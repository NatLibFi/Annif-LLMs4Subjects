Resorcinol : chemistry, technology and applications
Resorcinol chemistry has been providing valuable properties and products in the development of advanced technologies in the areas of pharmaceuticals, rubber compounds, wood composites and plastics. Notable technologies include steel belted radial tires, resorcinol-formaldehyde-latex adhesives (RFL), a weather proof polycarbonate (Sollx), a super heat resistant polymer (PEN-RTM), the world's strongest fiber (Zylon), sun screens (UV absorbers), Intal (an asthma drug), Ostivone (an osteoporosis drug), Throat Plus (lozenges), Centron and Saheli (oral contraceptive pills), and many more. This new resorcinol book contains information on the chemistry and technologies developed for the usefulness of human needs. Scientists and researchers around the world working in the areas of pharmaceuticals, rubber compounds (tires, hoses, belts), polymers, polymer additives (UV absorbers, flame retardants), composites (polymers and wood), photoresists, or just simply organic chemistry will benefit from this key resorcinol reference.
