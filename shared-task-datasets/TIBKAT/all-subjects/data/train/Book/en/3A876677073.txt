Complex electromagnetic problems and numerical simulation approaches
Today, engineering problems are very complex, requiring powerful computer simulations to power them. For engineers, observable-based parameterization as well as numerically computable forms - with rapid convergent properties if in a series - are essential. Complex Electromagnetic Problems and Numerical Simulation Approaches, along with its companion FTP site, will show you how to take on complex electromagnetic problems and solve them in an accurate and efficient manner. Organized into two distinct parts, this comprehensive resource first introduces you to the concepts, approaches, and numerical simulation techniques that will be used throughout the book and then, in Part II, offers step-by-step guidance as to their practical, real-world applications. Self-contained chapters will enable you to find specific solutions to numerous problems. Filled with in-depth insight and expert advice, Complex Electromagnetic Problems and Numerical Simulation Approaches: . Describes ground wave propagation. Examines antenna systems. Deals with radar cross section (RCS) modeling. Explores microstrip network design with FDTD and TLM techniques. Discusses electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and bio-electromagnetics (BEM) modeling. Presents radar simulation Whether you're a professional electromagnetic engineer requiring a consolidated overview of the subject or an academic/student who wishes to use powerful simulators as a learning tool, Complex Electromagnetic Problems and Numerical Simulation Approaches - with its focus on model development, model justification, and range of validity - is the right book for you
