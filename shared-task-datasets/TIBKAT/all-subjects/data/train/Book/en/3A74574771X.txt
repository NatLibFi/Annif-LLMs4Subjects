Linux system programming : [talking directly to the Kernel and C Library]
UNIX, UNIX LINUX & UNIX TCL/TK. Write software that makes the most effective use of the Linux system, including the kernel and core system libraries. The majority of both Unix and Linux code is still written at the system level, and this book helps you focus on everything above the kernel, where applications such as Apache, bash, cp, vim, Emacs, gcc, gdb, glibc, ls, mv, and X exist. Written primarily for engineers looking to program at the low level, this updated edition of Linux System Programming gives you an understanding of core internals that makes for better code, no matter where it appears in the stack. -- Provided by publisher
