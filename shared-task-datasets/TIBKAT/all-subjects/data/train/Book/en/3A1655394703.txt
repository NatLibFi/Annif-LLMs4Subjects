Making Sense of Sensors : Implementing a Knowledge Pipeline
Chapter 1: Introducing the Pipeline -- Chapter 2: From Data to Recognition -- Chapter 3: Multimodal Recognition -- Chapter 4: Contextual Recognition -- Chapter 5: Representing Relationships -- Chapter 6: Relationships and Knowledge -- Chapter 7: Knowledge Representation
This book outlines the common architectures used for deriving meaningful data from sensors. In todayâ€™s world we are surrounded by sensors collecting various types of data about us and our environments. These sensors are the primary input devices for wearable computers, internet-of-things, and other mobile devices. This book provides the reader with the tools to understand how sensor data is converted into actionable knowledge and provides tips for in-depth work in this field. The information is presented in way that allows readers to associate the examples with their daily lives for better understanding of the concepts. Making Sense of Sensors starts with an overview of the general pipeline to extract meaningful data from sensors. It then dives deeper into some commonly used sensors and algorithms designed for knowledge extraction. Practical examples and pointers to more information are used to outline the key aspects of Multimodal recognition. The book concludes with a discussion on relationship extraction, knowledge representation, and management
