Language for specific purposes
"Language for Specific Purposes provides a concise history of the roots of LSP, and an analysis of the current trends in globalization, technology and applied linguistics that directly affect the learning, teaching and researching of LSP. The book provides insights into language course planning, design and implementation, assessment and evaluation, as well as issues in pedagogy, classroom management and professional development of particular interest to LSP practitioners. Another important focus of the book is research: the nature of research in LSP, typical research methods in the field, and ideas for researchable projects. Numerous case studies and lists of useful resources for further study and research make this book a rich resource, not only for graduate students planning to teach LSP, but also for professionals looking to update or extend their knowledge of the field"--
