The expanding field of nanotechnology is now one of the most promising areas of science. However, because some nanoparticles can have a negative impact on human health and the environment, the design of novel materials must always be accompanied by a comprehensive risk assessment. Until now, the information on the methods available has been fragmented and incomplete. This book is the first to provide a comprehensive review of recent progress and challenges in the risk assessment of nanomaterials by empirical and computational techniques. Topics covered include: benefits versus risks, carbon ba
