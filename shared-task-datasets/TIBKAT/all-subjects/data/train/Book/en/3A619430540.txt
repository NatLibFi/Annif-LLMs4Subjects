Colonial voices : a cultural history of English in Australia ; 1840 - 1940
"Colonial Voices explores the role of language in the greater 'civilising' project of the British Empire through the dissemination, reception and challenge to British English in Australia during the period from the 1840s to the 1940s. This was a period in which the art of oratory, eloquence and elocution was of great importance in the empire and Joy Damousi offers an innovative study of the relationship between language and empire. She shows the ways in which this relationship moved from dependency to independency and how, during that transition, definitions of the meaning and place of oratory, eloquence and elocution shifted. Her findings reveal the central role of voice and pronunciation in informing and defining both individual and collective identity as well as wider cultural views of class, race, nation and gender.
