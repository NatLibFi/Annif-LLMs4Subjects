The book focuses on biomedical innovations related to the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea. The latest diagnostic tools are described, including sleep laboratory equipment, wearables, and even smartphone apps. Innovative medical devices for treatment are also covered, such as CPAP, Auto-PAP, hypoglossal nerve stimulation, phrenic nerve stimulation, acoustic brain stimulation and electrical brain stimulation. This is an ideal book for biomedical engineers, pneumologists, neurologists, cardiologists, physiologists, ENT physicians, pediatrics, and epidemiologists who are interested in learning about the latest technologies in treating and diagnosing sleep apnea.
