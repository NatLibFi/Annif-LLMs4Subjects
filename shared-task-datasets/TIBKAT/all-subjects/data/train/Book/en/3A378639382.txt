Knowledge and the world : challenges beyond the science wars
The issue whether or in which sense science informs us about the real world has pervaded the history of thought since antiquity. Is what Science tells us about the world determined unambigously by facts or does the content of any scientific theory in some way depend on the human conditon? "Sokal's hoax" added a new dimesion to this controversial debate which soon came to been known as "Science Wars". The focus of the present book is to review the broad range of philosophical positons on this issue, stretching from realism to relativism, to expound the epistemic merits of science and to address the central question: in which sense can science justifiably claim to provide a truthful protrait of reality? This book addresses everyone interested in the philosophy and history of sciences, and in particular in the interplay between social and natural sciences.
