Flight dynamics, simulation, and control : for rigid and flexible aircraft
"Bringing together diverse topics in flight mechanics, aeroelasticity, and automatic controls, this book addresses the core issues involved in the dynamics, modeling, simulation, and control of fixed-wing aircraft. Covering basic principles applicable to both traditional rigid and modern flexible aircraft, the author explores the design and regulation of flight control systems and flight simulators, presents the latest techniques of modeling and simulation using MATLAB® and Simulink®, and provides case studies demonstrating the application of control laws in modern aircraft. Featuring numerous illustrations and worked examples, the text serves as a useful guide for designers of hybrid flight control systems with advanced composite structural components in the wings, fuselage, and control surfaces"--
