English as a lingua franca: perspectives and prospects : contributions in honour of Barbara Seidlhofer
This edited volume addresses perspectives and prospects of English as a lingua franca (ELF) in connection with other areas of linguistics. It is the first volume that brings together ELF scholars and experts from a wide range of areas in linguistics (such as corpus linguistics, sociolinguistics, historical linguistics, language pedagogy, language policy, intercultural communication) in order to explore how ELF relates to these fields.
