Surveys in Theoretical High Energy Physics - 2 : Lecture Notes from SERC Schools
Chapter 1. Quark-Gluon Plasma: An Overview -- Chapter 2. An Introduction to Thermal Field Theory -- Chapter 3. Perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics -- Chapter 4. Introduction to Anomalies -- Chapter 5. Cosmology for Particle Physicists -- Chapter 6. A Collection of Problems on Cosmology.
The book presents pedagogical reviews of important topics on high energy physics to the students and researchers in particle physics. The book also discusses topics on the Quarkâ€“Gluon plasma, thermal field theory, perturbative quantum chromodynamics, anomalies and cosmology. Students of particle physics need to be well-equipped with basic understanding of many concepts underlying the standard models of particle physics and cosmology. This is particularly true today when experimental results from colliders, such as large hadron collider (LHC) and relativistic heavy ion collider (RHIC), as well as inferences from cosmological observations, are expected to further expand our understanding of particle physics at high energies. This volume is the second in the Surveys in Theoretical High Energy Physics Series (SThEP). Topics covered in this book are based on lectures delivered at the SERC Schools in Theoretical High Energy Physics at the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, and the University of Hyderabad.
