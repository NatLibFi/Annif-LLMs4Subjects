This volume consists in a collection of essays dedicated to Norbert A'Campo on the occasion of his 80th birthday. The subject is geometry in the broadest sense. The topics include hyperbolic and super hyperbolic geometry, 3-manifolds, metric geometry, mapping class groups, linear groups, Riemann surfaces, Teichmüller spaces, high-dimensional complex geometry, differential topology, symplectic geometry, singularity theory, number theory, algebraic geometry, dynamics, mathematical physics and philosophy of mathematics. The book gives a fairly comprehensive overview of the wealth of current research in geometry.
