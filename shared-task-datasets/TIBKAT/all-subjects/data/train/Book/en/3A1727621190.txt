Electronic Materials
Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters BCI (WoS).The electronic properties of solids have become of increasing importance in the age of information technology. The study of solids and materials, while having originated from the disciplines of physics and chemistry, has evolved independently over the past few decades. The classical treatment of solid-state physics, which emphasized classifications, theories and fundamental physical principles, is no longer able to bridge the gap between materials advances and applications. In particular, the more recent developments in device physics and technology have not necessarily been driven by new concepts in physics or new materials, but rather by the ability of engineers to control crystal structures and properties better via advances in crystal growth and patterning techniques. In many cases, new applications simply arise from the adaption of conventional ideas to interdisciplinary areas. One example is that of recent advances which rely heavily upon the availability of the sub-micron technology developed by the semiconductor industry. Another example is the emergence of nanotechnology. This book aims to bridge the gap between solid-state physics, materials science and electronics. Its objective is to serve as a textbook covering all three areas, but having the ultimate goal of providing an understanding of the operation of devices. To make this book useful to a broad set of readers, the tendency is to treat the more difficult subjects, such as solid-state physics, using fewer mathematics and including worked examples where possible. By using such an approach, it is possible to include not only basic principles, but also the knowledge needed for applications. Keeping the subject matter at the elementary level as far as possible, the first 2 chapters introduce classical theories and address questions as elementary as, what are solids, before moving on to examine crystal structures and the link between crystal structures and materials properties. In the subsequent chapters, solids are examined in the sequence: metals; semiconductors; insulators; magnetic solids; superconductors; light-sensitive solids. Applications are discussed and examined. The last chapter is devoted to solid-state transducers and their applications. Altogether, this makes for a very accessible introduction to the subject matter. Kwok (U. of Victoria) has written a textbook intended to bridge the gap between solid-state physics, materials science, and electronics. The author covers all three topics, but with a goal of providing an understanding of the operation of devices. The book introduces classical theories and continues into the varied properties of solids, P-N junctions and related devices, micromachines, sensors, and packaging materials. There is no subject index.
