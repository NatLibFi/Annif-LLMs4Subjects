Polyurethanes : science, technology, markets, and trends
"Polyurethanes (PU) are one of the most versatile and commonly produced plastic materials. PU flexibility allows it to fit across the spectrum of specialty to commodity materials and production. As a polymer that is produced from a 2-part system, the production of the building blocks are complicated with a hazardous and complex spects while requiring optimization to an exceptional degree"--
