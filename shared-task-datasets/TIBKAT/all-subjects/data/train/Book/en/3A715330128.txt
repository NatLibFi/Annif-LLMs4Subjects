Advanced materials in automotive engineering
Beginning with a comprehensive introduction to advanced materials for vehicle lightweighting and automotive applications, Advanced materials in automotive engineering goes on to consider nanostructured steel for automotive body structures, aluminium sheet and high pressure die-cast aluminium alloys for automotive applications, magnesium alloys for lightweight powertrains and automotive bodies, and polymer and composite moulding technologies. The final chapters then consider a range of design and manufacturing issues that need to be addressed when working with advanced materials, including the design of advanced automotive body structures and closures, technologies for reducing noise, vibration and harshness, joining systems, and the recycling of automotive materials."--pub. desc
