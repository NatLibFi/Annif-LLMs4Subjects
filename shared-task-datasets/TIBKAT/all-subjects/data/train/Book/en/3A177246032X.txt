Field guide to light-matter interaction
"The interaction of light and matter has long history. It evolved from the ancient corpuscular theory, to wave theory, and finally to the quantum theory. Matter is composed of charged particles, among them positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons that are in motion. Light is an oscillating electromagnetic wave. But light is also particles (photons). The primary objective of this Field Guide to Light-Matter Interaction is to provide the reader with the basic principles of light and matter interaction using classical, semiclassical, and quantum theories. Within this Field Guide, you will find formulae and descriptions of phenomena that are fundamental for an understanding of the present state of the art of light-matter interaction"--
