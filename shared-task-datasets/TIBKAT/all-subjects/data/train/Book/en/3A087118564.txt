From idea to profit : how to market innovative products and services
The literature of innovation is full of calls to become more creative and inspiring: but it has less to say on the reality of turning theory into practice and ideas into profit. Real breakthroughs depend on finding profitable applications for new ideas. The beneficiaries of countless innovations are often not the original inventors, but those who are better able to exploit potential. This book is designed to help innovators capture the full value of their creativity. It combines the experience of innovative companies with the expertise of academics and advisors, bringing together the best of current thinking and practice in innovation, strategy, marketing, design, intellectual property and finance
