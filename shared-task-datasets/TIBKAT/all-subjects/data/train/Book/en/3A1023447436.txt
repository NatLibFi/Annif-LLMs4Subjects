Cultural mythology and global leadership
This ground-breaking book explains how deep-seated cultural mythologies shape contemporary global leaders and provides insights into navigating the dynamics and complexities in today's era of globalization. The authors use myths to uncover core characteristics and values from 20 different cultural contexts spanning all major regions of the world--the Americas, Europe, Africa and the Middle East, and Asia and the Pacific Rim--that have evolved over generations and continue to shape global leadership models. Commentaries are included from practicing managers and leaders to provide real world insights on the implications of the ideas discussed. International managers and executives, public officials, business consultants and corporate trainers will welcome the insights on cross-cultural leadership styles. The book will also find interest from researchers and students across a broad array of professional and social science disciplines
