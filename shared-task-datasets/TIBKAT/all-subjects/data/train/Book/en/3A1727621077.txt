Cluster electric spectroscopy of colloid chemical oxyhydrate systems
This monograph deals with the shape of Liesegang operator and its respective phase diagrams of spontaneous surges and analyzed properties of cluster attractors. It describes the influence of pulsation noise or self-organization current of gel systems in a magnetic field on singularities of optic parameters of yttrium oxyhydrate, as well as on kinetic curves of changes in optic density of oxyhydrate systems, sorptive properties of d- and f-elements, and the structural organization of their colloids. This monograph is meant for postgraduate students, magisters, researchers, and those interested in solid-state chemistry and physics. Keywords: Nanomaterials, Nanoparticles, Nanobioelectronics, Biomedical Application For graduate students and researchers interested in solid-state chemistry and physics, Sucharev and Apalikova discuss molecular Brownian motors of colloid oxyhydrate systems and application phenomena of oxyhydrate Brownian motors. Among their topics are the Liesegang operator, research into self-organization pulsation ion flows in oxyhydrate gels, the form and mechanism of stochastic wave clusters near graphite recording electrodes, textural morphological parameters of oxyhydrates and their sorptive parameters, and using oxyhydrate sorbents in applied radiochemistry and hydrometallurgy. — Chemistry— Materials science— Spectroscopy
