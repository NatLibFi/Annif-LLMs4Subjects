Late modernity, individualization and socialism : an associational critique of neoliberalism
Around the world, the aftershocks of an economic crisis brought on by neoliberal economics and aided by the austerity measures of governments continue to be felt. Yet, we are told that there is simply no alternative; that our current form of capitalism is here to stay
This book sets out to challenge this statement by arguing that the long-neglected theory of libertarian socialism can help us understand more fully the problems of our late modern society, as well as offering a plausible and attractive alternative. Matt Dawson draws upon classical and contemporary sociology to argue that individualization and late modernity are best realised in the associational forms advocated by theorists such as Ãˆmile Durkheim through discussing themes such as: everyday life, the state, economic democracy and social movements. Dawson encourages the reader to think anew about our contemporary concern with individualization, and how this is realised politically
