Electromagnetics : history, theory, and applications
Co-published with Oxford University Press. A handy reference for engineers and physicists, this IEEE reprinting of the classic text provides a deep, fundamental understanding of electromagnetics. Providing a pertinent historical overview for each chapter, it shows how special relativity is used to develop a complete electromagnetic theory from Coulomb's Law, with the need relativity theory developed in an early chapter. Electromagnetics also contains many applications for the chapters covering electrostatics, magnetostatics, electrodynamics, while the final three chapters of the book extend the electromagnetic theory to dielectric magnetic and conducting materials
