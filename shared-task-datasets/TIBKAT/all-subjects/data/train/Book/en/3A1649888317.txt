Digital Signatures
Digital Signatures is the first and only book to explain the underlying cryptographic principles and techniques used in designing the secure digital signature schemes being utilized today. This book will help the reader understand and appreciate the security guarantees provided by digital signatures. Full descriptions, detailed constructions, and formal proofs of security are provided for essentially all known provably-secure signature schemes, state-of-the-art signature schemes used extensively in practice are also explained in detail.A valuable reference book for researchers and industry practitioners, Digital Signatures can also be used as a tutorial for self-study by advanced-level students in computer science, or as a textbook in a seminar on signature schemes.
