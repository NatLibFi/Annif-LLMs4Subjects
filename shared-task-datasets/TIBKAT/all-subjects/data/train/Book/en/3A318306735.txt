Buddhist thought : a complete introduction to the Indian tradition
Buddhist Thought guides the reader towards a richer understanding of the central concepts of classical Indian Buddhist thought, tracing back to the time of Buddha, and opening up the latest scholarly perspectives and controversies. Abstract and complex ideas are made understandable by the authors' lucid style. Of particular interest here is the up-to-date survey of Buddhist Tantra in India, a branch of Buddhism where under strictly controlled conditions sexual activity may play a part in the religious path. This practice, of wide interest in the West, is also frequently misunderstood. Williams' discussion of this controversial practice as well as many other subjects make Buddhist Thought crucial and insightful reading for all studying or interested in Buddhism.
