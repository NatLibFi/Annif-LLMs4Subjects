Cognitive dynamic systems : perception-action cycle, radar, and radio
"The principles of cognition are becoming increasingly important in the areas of signal processing, communications and control. In this groundbreaking book, Simon Haykin, a pioneer in the field and an award-winning researcher, educator and author, sets out the fundamental ideas of cognitive dynamic systems. Weaving together the various branches of study involved, he demonstrates the power of cognitive information processing and highlights a range of future research directions. The book begins with a discussion of core topics such as cognition and sensing, dealing, in particular, with the perception-action cycle. Bayesian filtering, machine learning and dynamic programming are then addressed. Building on these foundations, there is detailed coverage of two important practical applications, cognitive radar and cognitive radio. Blending theory and practice, this insightful book is aimed at all graduate students and researchers looking for a thorough grounding in this fascinating field"--
