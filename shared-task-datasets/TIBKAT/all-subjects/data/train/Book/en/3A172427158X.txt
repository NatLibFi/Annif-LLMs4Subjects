Quantum error correction : symmetric, asymmetric, synchronizable, and convolutional codes
This text presents an algebraic approach to the construction of several important families of quantum codes derived from classical codes by applying the well-known Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) construction, the Hermitian, and the Steaneâ€™s enlargement construction to certain classes of classical codes. These quantum codes have good parameters and have been introduced recently in the literature. In addition, the book presents families of asymmetric quantum codes with good parameters and provides a detailed description of the procedures adopted to construct families of asymmetric quantum convolutional codes. Featuring accessible language and clear explanations, the book is suitable for use in advanced undergraduate and graduate courses as well as for self-guided study and reference. It provides an expert introduction to algebraic techniques of code construction and, because all of the constructions are performed algebraically, it equips the reader to construct families of codes, rather than only codes with specific parameters. The text offers an abundance of worked examples, exercises, and open-ended problems to motivate the reader to further investigate this rich area of inquiry. End-of-chapter summaries and a glossary of key terms allow for easy review and reference.
