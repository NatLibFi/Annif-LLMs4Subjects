"Discourse and Discrimination is a study of how racism, antisemitism and ethnicism are reflected in discourse." "Reisigl and Wodak first survey four established discourse-analysis approaches, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each, and then provide their own model of critical discourse analysis. Using this model, the authors present three case studies. While the focus of these studies is on racism in Austria, the approach is relevant for the study of discrimination in any context." "Drawing on a wide range of sources - from political speeches and legal documents to newspaper articles, television broadcasts and everyday conversations - Reisigl and Wodak question why even today, in a post-World-War-II society, racism and antisemitism are still virulent.
