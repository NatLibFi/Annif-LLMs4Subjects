Applications of Differential-Algebraic Equations: Examples and Benchmarks
This volume encompasses prototypical, innovative and emerging examples and benchmarks of Differential-Algebraic Equations (DAEs) and their applications, such as electrical networks, chemical reactors, multibody systems, and multiphysics models, to name but a few. Each article begins with an exposition of modelling, explaining whether the model is prototypical and for which applications it is used. This is followed by a mathematical analysis, and if appropriate, a discussion of the numerical aspects including simulation. Additionally, benchmark examples are included throughout the text. Mathematicians, engineers, and other scientists, working in both academia and industry either on differential-algebraic equations and systems or on problems where the tools and insight provided by differential-algebraic equations could be useful, would find this book resourceful
