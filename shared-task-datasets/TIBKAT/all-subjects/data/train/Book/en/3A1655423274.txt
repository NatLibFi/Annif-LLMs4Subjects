Empirical Bayes and Likelihood Inference
Bayesian and likelihood approaches to inference have a number of points of close contact, especially from an asymptotic point of view. Both approaches emphasize the construction of interval estimates of unknown parameters. Empirical Bayes methods have historically emphasized instead the construction of point estimates. In this volume researchers present recent work on several aspects of Bayesian, likelihood and empirical Bayes methods, presented at a workshop held in Montreal, Canada. The goal of the workshop was to explore the linkages among the methods, and to suggest new directions for research in the theory of inference
