Panofsky on Physics, Politics, and Peace : Pief Remembers
"The Life and Times of W.K.H. Panofsky is not only an autobiography of the respected physicist and director of the Stanford Linear Accelorator Center, but a discussion and analysis of issues critical to the relationship between independent academic inquiry and imposed government orthodoxy. The major phases of Dr. Panofsky's life are discussed chronologically, from his early research at the beginning of World War II, to his work as director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center to his recent efforts towards arms control and the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. The book describes each phase of Dr. Panofsky's career in sufficient detail to inform the reader of the nature of the issues surrounding his work, and to lay the basis for explaining the course of action chosen. Thus the book invites ""out of context"" reading by those interested in the particular issues covered, separate from their biographical relevance."
