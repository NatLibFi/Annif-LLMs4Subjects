Mastering Brexits through the ages : entrepreneurial innovators and small firms - the catalysts for success
This book is both a key contribution to understanding implementation risks and to identifying what a 'winning' post-Brexit UK economy should look like. Drawing on extensive research, the book identifies the strategic framework and associated practical measures needed to realise a positive outcome. It concurrently analyses Brexit mythology through carefully unpicking and demystifying complexities, anticipated Brexit risks, impacts, implications and unknowns
