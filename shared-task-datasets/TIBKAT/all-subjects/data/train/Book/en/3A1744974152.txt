1. Aims and foundations -- 2. Forms -- 3. Foundations -- 4. Functions -- 5. Failures -- 6. Figures -- 7. Summary and conclusions.
Trust deals with a range of questions such as: what are the roles of trust? What can we trust in? Can trust serve as an instrument for the governance of relations? Is trust a substitute, a precondition or an outcome of contracts? The author then goes on to analyse what trust is based on, what its limits are, how it grows and how it can also break down. The role of intermediaries is also discussed
