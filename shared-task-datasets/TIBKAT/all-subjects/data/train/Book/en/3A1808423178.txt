Northern California : regional landscape architecture : rooted in resilience
What makes a garden regionally appropriate? Fifteen private gardens designed by leading landscape architects answer that question for Northern California by directly addressing the climate, landscape, and culture they inhabit. Whether small or large, urban or rural, luxurious or low budget, these resilient outdoor spaces are finely attuned to the area's microclimates and the indoor-outdoor lifestyle for which Northern California is known. They make use of local building materials and craftspeople and offer their owners a unique emotional connection to nature. Firmly planted in time and place, the projects, complete with plans, define not so much a style as an experience and thrive with little effort from their owners
