Handbook of research on marketing and corporate social responsibility
The strategic importance of Corporate Social Responsibility for both large and small businesses only continues to grow. This Handbook explores the complex relationship between marketing and social responsibility, with a focus on marketing as a driver for CSR initiatives. Written by many of the leading scholars in the field, this is the first collection to examine CSR from a variety of marketing dimensions and a diverse set of cross-cultural perspectives, including consumer behavior, strategy, and public policy. The authors examine whether CSR holds equal value for both businesses and nonprofit organizations, and explore what happens when businesses fail to meet their larger social responsibilities. They also investigate potential consequences and the possibility that firms might do both good and harm while pursuing CSR initiatives. The conceptual and empirical insights found in this Handbook make it a useful resource for practitioners and an invaluable supplement to marketing curricula
