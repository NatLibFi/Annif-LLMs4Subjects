Application of Fractional Calculus in Water Flow and Related Processes -- Mathematical Preliminaries -- Essential Properties of Soils and Aquifers as Porous Media -- Transition from Classical Diffusion to Anomalous Diffusion-The Evolution of Concepts and Ideas -- Fractional Partial Differential Equations for Water Movement in Soils -- Applications of Fractional Partial Differential Equations to Infiltration and Water Movement in Soils -- Fractional Differential Equations for Solute Transport in Soils -- Hydraulics of Anomalous Flow on Hillslopes, in Catchment Networks and Irrigated Fields -- Fractional Partial Differential Equations for Groundwater Flow -- Fractional Partial Differential Equations for Solute Transport in Groundwater -- Fractional Partial Differential Equations, Poroviscoelastic Media and Geomechanics.
"This book presents the most relevant concepts and findings in fractional calculus (FC), fractional differential equations (FDEs) and fractional partial differentia equations (FPDEs) and their applications in soil physics, groundwater hydrology, soil mechanics, irrigation and drainage engineering, earth and environmental sciences and environmental engineering. Readers of this book will be postgraduates, senior undergraduates, academics, researchers and other professionals in these fields. A reader from the above fields will find the most relevant materials necessary for the initial study and immediate applications of the concepts and models with examples. It is the first book in soil science, hydrology and soil mechanics"--
