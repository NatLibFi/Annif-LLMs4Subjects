Climate-drought resilience in extreme environments
This book assesses the effectiveness of changes in watershed interventions in one of the most fragile resource regions of the India. Specifically the chapters examine various watershed centred interventions and their implementation process. An evaluation of the livelihood impacts, including crop production on the communities, is discussed and an assessment of the drought and climate resilience of households in the context of watershed and related interventions, including institutions and capacity of the communities is investigated. Lessons are drawn to further identify measures to strengthen and improvise interventions for enhanced climate-drought resilience in harsh environments. .
