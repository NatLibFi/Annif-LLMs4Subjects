Expert Oracle Database Architecture : Third Edition
Now in its third edition, this best-selling book continues to bring you some of the best thinking on how to apply Oracle Database to produce scalable applications that perform well and deliver correct results.

This fully revised third edition covers the developments up to Oracle Database 12c. Significant new content is included surrounding Oracle's new cloud feature set, and especially the use of pluggable databases. Each feature is taught in a proof-by-example manner, not only discussing what it is, but also how it works, how to implement software using it, and the common pitfalls associated with it. Don’t treat Oracle Database as a black-box. Get this book. Get under the hood. Turbo-charge your career.
