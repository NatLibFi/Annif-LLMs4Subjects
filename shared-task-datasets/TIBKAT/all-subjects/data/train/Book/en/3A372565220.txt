Scheduling algorithms
Besides scheduling problems for single and parallel machines and shop scheduling problems the book covers advanced models involving due-dates, sequence dependent changeover times and batching. Also multiprocessor task scheduling and problems with multipurpose machines are discussed. The methods used to solve these problems are linear programming, dynamic programming, branch-and-bound algorithms, and local search heuristics. Complexity results for the different classes of deterministic scheduling problems are updated and summarized. Also the references are updated.
