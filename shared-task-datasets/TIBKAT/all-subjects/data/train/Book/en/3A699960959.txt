Nematicons : spatial optical solitons in nematic liquid crystals
"Since the field of nematonics is relatively new, there is a need for a comprehensive introduction to nematonics theory and application. Nematonics Spatial Optical Solitons in Nematic Liquid Crystals breaks barriers of the field by being the first book of its kind to introduce the fundamentals, basic features and models, potential applications and novel phenomena and its important applications in liquid crystal technology. Recognized leader in the field Gaetano Assanto outlines the peculiar characteristics of nematicons and the promise they have for the future growth of this captivating new field"--
