Biocomposites : environmental and biomedical applications
"This new book presents the most recent studies on the different aspects of biocomposites. The chapters focus on the overall characteristics of biocomposites, including chemical composition along with engineering and technical properties of the most in-demand green materials employed for fabricating biocomposites. In such engineering and technical approaches, the progress and achievements for enhancing the properties of bio-composites are reviewed in detail. The present book also reports on the modern techniques along with new developments engaged for the production of biocomposites. After considering applications and trends of biocomposites, the major characterization techniques along with the important environmental effects are discussed in depth. This book provides vital information on new green materials and related biocomposites in addition to their imminent environmental and medical applications"--
