The Large Hadron Collider : Harvest of Run 1
This comprehensive volume summarizes and structures the multitude of results obtained at the LHC in its first running period and draws the grand picture of todayâ€™s physics at a hadron collider. Topics covered are Standard Model measurements, Higgs and top-quark physics, flavour physics, heavy-ion physics, and searches for supersymmetry and other extensions of the Standard Model. Emphasis is placed on overview and presentation of the lessons learned. Chapters on detectors and the LHC machine and a thorough outlook into the future complement the book. The individual chapters are written by teams of expert authors working at the forefront of LHC research
