The bones of architecture : Structure and design practices
Besides the many components that characterise the appearance of a building, it is the physical prerequisites that are crucial. They tie the (structural) components together and let the building ?stand?: just like the bones of vertebrates and us humans, every building has a load-bearing structure.From that perspective, construction, and thus also the buildings themselves are subject to fundamental sets of rules; as long as they are observed, the connection of their materials and components ensures good load bearing properties. In that way, these sets of rules create forms, pat-terns, orders and restrictions.00This publication investigates the cultivation of structures for architecture as developed by practising architects and engineers. Presenting the works and approaches of seven European architects and engineers, the editor simultaneously reflects on the rules, strategies and methods of designing structures and load bearing structures.With selected works by: Rui Furtado, engineer, Porto; Johansen Skovsted Arkitekter, Copen-hagen; Pedrazzini Guidotti, engineers, Lugano; Bruther, architects, Paris; Brandlhuber+, Arno Brandlhuber, architect, Berlin; engineer Bernabeu, Madrid; 6a Architects, London.00Exhibition: Garagem Sul, CCB, Lisbon, Portugal (18.06. - 08.09.2019)
