Normal development of voice in children : advances in evidence-based standards
With updated acoustical measures of voice profiles (phonetograms, the audiogram of the voice), and the fundamental frequency of the tone range, new standards have been reached. Especially the comparison to normal pediatric and hormonal development underlines the statistical scientific validity of the voice parameters. The relation to hormones and the predictive values for voice development opens new and interesting perspectives for experts. This book offers valuable insight to acoustical, physiological and biological measures based on prospective and stratified studies, comparing boys and girls.
