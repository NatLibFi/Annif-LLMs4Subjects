Advanced sampling methods
This book discusses all major topics on survey sampling and estimation. It covers traditional as well as advanced sampling methods related to the spatial populations. The book presents real-world applications of major sampling methods and illustrates them with the R software. As a large sample size is not cost-efficient, this book introduces a new method by using the domain knowledge of the negative correlation between the variable of interest and the auxiliary variable in order to control the size of a sample. In addition, the book focuses on adaptive cluster sampling, rank-set sampling and their applications in real life. Advance methods discussed in the book have tremendous applications in ecology, environmental science, health science, forestry, bio-sciences, and humanities. This book is targeted as a text for undergraduate and graduate students of statistics, as well as researchers in various disciplines.
