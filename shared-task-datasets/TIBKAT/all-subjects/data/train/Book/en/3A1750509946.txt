Functional properties of shape memory materials and their applications
"This book is compiled into three parts. Part 1 describes the functional properties of shape memory alloy, such as the shape memory effect and superelasticity, the constitutive equation for thermomechanical properties, the bi-axial tensile-torsional behavior, influence of strain rate on deformation behavior, cyclic deformation properties, micromechanical model of polycrystalline SMAs, application of thermomechanical model to tension-compression behavior, the transformation-induced creep and stress relaxation, and the torsional deformation of thin tape. Part 2 contains the advanced functions of shape-memory alloy and polymer such as the shape-retaining control using SMA system, the micromechanical model of shape memory polymer, performance of shape memory polymer composite, enhancement of fatigue life of SMA by ultrasonic shot peening and nitrogen ion implantation, enhancement of corrosion fatigue life of SMA , development of functionally-graded shape-memory alloy and polymer, development of shape memory composites and development of 3D-printing of shape memory polymer. Part 3 deals with the applications of shape-memory alloy and polymer such as the development of application model in engineering filed, the smart vortex generator for aircraft, the smart morphing flap driven by SMA wires and the development of application models of SMA brain spatula in medical engineering filed, the working support device in nursing care field and the energy conversion teaching material in education. This book will be of interest to graduate students, engineers, materials scientists and designers who are working in the field of mechanical and electric engineering, medical engineering, nursing care technology, aerospace engineering, robots, automatic machines, clothes and recycling for research, design, manufacturing and fabrication"--
