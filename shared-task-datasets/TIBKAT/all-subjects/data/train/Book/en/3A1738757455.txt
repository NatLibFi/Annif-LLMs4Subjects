Optimal coverage in wireless sensor networks
This book will serve as a reference, presenting state-of-the-art research on theoretical aspects of optimal sensor coverage problems. Readers will find it a useful tool for furthering developments on theory and applications of optimal coverage; much of the content can serve as material for advanced topics courses at the graduate level. The book is well versed with the hottest research topics such as Lifetime of Coverage, Weighted Sensor Cover, k-Coverage, Heterogeneous Sensors, Barrier, Sweep and Partial Coverage, Mobile Sensors, Camera Sensors and Energy-Harvesting Sensors, and more. Topics are introduced in a natural order from simple covers to connected covers, to the lifetime problem. Later, the book begins revisiting earlier problems ranging from the introduction of weights to coverage by k sensors and partial coverage, and from sensor heterogeneity to novel problems such as the barrier coverage problem. The book ends with coverage of mobile sensors, camera sensors, energy-harvesting sensors, underwater sensors, and crowdsensing.
