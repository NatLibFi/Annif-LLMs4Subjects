Dominique Perrault : inspiration and process in architecture
"A collection of materials, realised by the DPA studio in occasion of two international competitions for museum buildings, becomes an opportunity to demonstrate how even unfinished projects can be a great chance to experiment. These explorations are narrated by the sketches, models, notes and diagrams of Dominique Perrault, author of prestigious projects such as the National Library of France and the Ewha Womans University in Seoul."--
