Das Königreich der Vandalen : Geiserichs Herrschaft und das Imperium Romanum
A small group of Germanic barbarians pulled across Europe to North Africa, conquered Rome, and was directly involved in the downfall of the Western Roman Empire: the Vandals. For 100 years, their kingdom lasts. No other German tribe has achieved such a long independence. This Vandal kingdom is connected in a unique way with its first and most important king, Genseric. It was he who led them on Roman territory in present-day Tunisia, asserted them into military conflict, and then established a well-organized state. Konrad Vössing describes vividly and clearly this powerful kingdom in the context of the late Roman empire, the African provinces, the migration period and Genseric rule
