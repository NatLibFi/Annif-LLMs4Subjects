Practical applications of asymptotic techniques in electromagnetics
Antenna, wireless communication and other electrical engineers use asymptotic techniques for solving electromagnetic problems when the electrical size of a given scenario is large in comparison to the wavelength. This practical book offers in-depth coverage of this area, showing how to apply these techniques to the analysis of complex electromagnetic problems in order to obtain results with an exceptionally high degree of accuracy. Focusing on two highly-effective methods - the uniform theory of diffraction (UTD) and physical optics (PO), this book is unique in that it emphasizes how to solve real-world problems, rather than simply explaining theory like other books on the market. This first-of-its-kind resource shows professionals how to apply this knowledge to a wide range of projects in the field, including antenna design, mobile communications, and RCS (radar cross section) computation. This authoritative book is supported with more than 100 illustrations and over 250 equations. DVD Included! Contains a demonstration version of the NewFASANT software suite, including codes used to run the case studies presented in the book. A user's guide is also provided to help engineers understand how to use the codes
