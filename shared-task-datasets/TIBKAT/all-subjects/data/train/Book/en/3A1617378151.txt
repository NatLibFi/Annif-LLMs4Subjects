Digital religion, social media and culture : perspectives, practices, and futures
This anthology collects some of the most current research and reflection on the complex interactions between religion and computer-mediated communications (CMC). The contributions cohere around the central question: how will core religious understanding of identity, community and authority shape and be (re)shaped by the communicative possibilities of Web. 2.0? The authors address these questions in three distinct ways: through contemporary empirical research on how diverse traditions across the globe seek to take up the technologies and affordances of contemporary CDC; through investigations that place these contemporary developments in larger historical and theological contexts; and through careful reflection on the theoretical dimensions of research on religion and CMC.--From cover, p.
