Myeloma therapy : pursuing the plasma cell
Therapeutic options for patients with myeloma have radically changed over the past ten years. Myeloma Therapy: Pursuing the Plasma Cell provides updated various treatment options for patients with myeloma, with focus on the emerging and speculative aspects of myeloma therapy. Written by clearly acknowledged leaders in the field of myeloma therapy and research, Myeloma Therapy: Pursuing the Plasma Cell presents significant material on the biology and potential agents used to address specific signaling pathways, all of which are critical to myeloma biology and therapy. State of the art information from many of the leaders in the plasma cell disorders world includes disease pathogenesis and biology, chemotherapy based approaches, immune based therapies, currently approved novel agents, developing targets, supportive care, and other plasma cell disorders. Myeloma Therapy: Pursuing the Plasma Cell is a comprehensive collection and tremendous source in this time of rapid change in clinical and preclinical disease knowledge
