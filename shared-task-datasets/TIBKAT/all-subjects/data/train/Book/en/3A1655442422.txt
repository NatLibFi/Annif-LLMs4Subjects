Topics in Computational Wave Propagation : Direct and Inverse Problems
These ten detailed and authoritative survey articles on numerical methods for direct and inverse wave propagation problems are written by leading experts. Researchers and practitioners in computational wave propagation, from postgraduate level onwards, will find the breadth and depth of coverage of recent developments a valuable resource. The articles describe a wide range of topics on the application and analysis of methods for time and frequency domain PDE and boundary integral formulations of wave propagation problems. Electromagnetic, seismic and acoustic equations are considered. Recent developments in methods and analysis ranging from finite differences to hp-adaptive finite elements, including high-accuracy and fast methods are described with extensive references
