"This volume focuses on oxidative modifications of lipid molecules and the successive generation of singlet oxygen. The book also covers the secondary adductions of these reactive species with proteins and aminophospholipids. During lipid peroxidation, the initial event is the formation of lipid hydroperoxide, which is followed by an oxidation event that starts a chain-reaction. The formed lipid hydroperoxide gradually decomposes into harmful aldehydes, which are the advanced end-products of lipid peroxidation"--
