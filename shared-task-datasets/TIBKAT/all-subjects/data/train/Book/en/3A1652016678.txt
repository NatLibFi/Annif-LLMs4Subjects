Structural dynamics and probabilistic analyses for engineers
Some basics of the theory of vibrations -- Dynamic response of beams and other structures to deterministic excitation -- Dynamic response of a structure to random excitation -- Contacts in structural systems -- Nondeterministic behavior of structures -- Random crack propagation -- Design criteria -- Some important computer programs for structural analysis -- Conclusions : do and don't do in dynamic and probabilistic analyses
Probabilistic structural dynamics offers unparalleled tools for analyzing uncertainties in structural design. Once avoided because it is mathematically rigorous, this technique has recently remerged with the aide of computer software. Written by an author/educator with 40 years of experience in structural design, this user friendly manual integrates theories, formulas and mathematical models to produce a guide that will allow professionals to quickly grasp concepts and start solving problems. In this book, the author uses simple examples that provide templates for creating of more robust case studies later in the book. *Problems are presented in an easy to understand form *Practical guide to software programs to solve design problems *Packed with examples and case studies of actual projects *Classical and the new stochastic factors of safety
