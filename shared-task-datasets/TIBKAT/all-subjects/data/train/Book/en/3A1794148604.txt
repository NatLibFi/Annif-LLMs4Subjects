Waste-to-energy : recent developments and future perspectives towards circular economy
This book addresses the needs of students, researchers, as well as engineers and other professionals or readers interested in recent advances of biofuel and efficient waste management. In the context of energy consumption, over 85% of the total consumed energy comes from non-renewable fossil resources. Developing new renewable energy resources, especially biofuel production from wastes, has received increasing attention. The book is organized into three sections, namely Section I: Conventional waste management; Section II: From waste to green energy; and Section III: Case studies and future perspectives. Each section presents topic-specific chapters, which contain comprehensive and advanced knowledge of the subjects. Overall, the book covers the recent advances, breakthroughs, challenges, and future perspectives of waste-to-energy approach using different kinds of wastes as a feedstock for alternative biofuels and other integrated approaches such as wastewater treatment, plastic degradation, and CO2 sequestration in a cost-effective and eco-friendly way. In addition, different routes of waste recycling for enhanced biofuel production and case studies are presented with environmental and economic analysis. The presented case studies and future perspectives under Section III complement the chapters as they are authored by experts from bioenergy businesses who actually encounter real-world problems.
