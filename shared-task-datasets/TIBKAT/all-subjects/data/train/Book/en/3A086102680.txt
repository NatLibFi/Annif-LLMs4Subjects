Social change in Iran : an eyewitness account of dissent, defiance, and new movements for rights
Having spent one year in Iran in 1998, Yaghmaian (economics, Ramapo College) attempts to tell the day-to-day stories of a range of people resisting state violence, neoliberal economics, and social repression in the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as analyzing the prospects for social change. Focusing primarily on the student youth he looks at a variety of organizations, protests, actions, and strategies that people are using to try to advance social change in Iran. Unabashedly celebratory of the student rebels, Yaghmaian also looks at the slow development of an independent union movement, the questioning of assumptions by independent journalists, and other efforts to resist both the Islamist state leaders and neoliberal globalization.
