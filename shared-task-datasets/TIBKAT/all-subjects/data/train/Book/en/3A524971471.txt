Parameterized Complexity Theory
Parameterized complexity theory is a branch of computational complexity theory that provides a framework for a refined analysis of hard algorithmic problems. This book provides an introduction to both algorithmic techniques for fixed-parameter tractability and the structural theory of parameterized complexity classes
