Laboratory guide to the methods in biochemical genetics
This manual describes laboratory methodology for diagnosing inborn errors of metabolism. Each chapter is sufficiently detailed so as to be self-contained, thus enabling any individual to adopt the method in their own laboratory and obviating the need for additional methods of references. The book is unique in that it is the first of its kind to be published in the last 15 years, and individual chapters have been developed by experts in the field citing both established and 'cutting-edge' technology. Thus, it is sufficiently up-to-date to be applicable to the field of inborn errors of metabolism for all readers and those interested in laboratory diagnosis.
This manual deals specifically with laboratory approaches to diagnosing inborn errors of metabolism. The key feature is that each chapter is sufficiently detailed so that any individual can adopt the described method into their own respective laboratory.
