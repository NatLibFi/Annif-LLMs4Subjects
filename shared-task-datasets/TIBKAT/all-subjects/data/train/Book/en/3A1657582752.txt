Solving PDEs in Python : The FEniCS Tutorial I
1 Preliminaries -- 2 Fundamentals: Solving the Poisson Equation -- 3 A Gallery of Finite Element Solvers -- 4 Subdomains and Boundary Conditions -- 5 Extensions: Improving the Poisson Solver -- References
This book offers a concise and gentle introduction to finite element programming in Python based on the popular FEniCS software library. Using a series of examples, including the Poisson equation, the equations of linear elasticity, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and systems of nonlinear advection-diffusion-reaction equations, it guides readers through the essential steps to quickly solving a PDE in FEniCS, such as how to define a finite variational problem, how to set boundary conditions, how to solve linear and nonlinear systems, and how to visualize solutions and structure finite element Python programs.
