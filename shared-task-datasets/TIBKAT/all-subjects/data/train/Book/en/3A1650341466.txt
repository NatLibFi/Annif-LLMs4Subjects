Combining Technical and Fundamental Trading Strategies
Basics about Technical and Fundamental Trading -- Combination of Momentum and Operating Cash Flow Strategies -- A Closer Look at the Market Reactions -- Fundamental and Technical Trading by Mutual Funds -- Concluding Remarks.
There are two ways of selecting stocks: technical trading according to past changes in stock price and fundamental trading according to fundamental information. Ute Bonenkamp focuses on the combination of these two methods of investing. Using the technical momentum and the fundamental operating cash flow strategies as examples, she empirically shows that combining these two ways of investing is highly profitable. She further analyzes which market (mis)reactions cause the strategiesâ€™ extraordinary profits. Finally, she investigates whether professional mutual fund managers in the US (successfully) make use of these strategies.
