Designed for habitat : collaborations with habitat for humanity
"This second edition of Designed for Habitat presents twelve new projects designed and built by architects and Habitat for Humanity. The ways in which we think about affordable housing are being challenged by designers and not-for-profit housing advocates such as Habitat for Humanity and its affiliates. The projects chronicled in this book consider home affordability through the lens of monthly homeownership expenses, energy efficiency and residential energy use, and issues of designed resilience to natural events ranging from aging and accessibility concerns to natural disasters and climate change. New to this edition, the projects are grouped by Scale, Construction Technology, Energy & Affordability, and Design & Context. Illustrated with over 100 color images, the case studies include detailed plans and photographs to show how these projects came about, the strategies used by each team to approach the design and construction process, and the obstacles they overcame to realize a successful outcome. The lessons and insights presented will be a valuable resource, whether you're an architect, architecture student, Habitat affiliate leader, or an affordable housing advocate"--
