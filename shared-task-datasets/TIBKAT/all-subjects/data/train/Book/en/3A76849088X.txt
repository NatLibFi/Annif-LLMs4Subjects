Parallel science and engineering applications - the Charm++ approach
"This volume highlights the use of Charm++ in a wide variety of scientific and engineering fields. It emphasizes the adaptivity, asynchrony, and message-driven execution and proposes design choices for application development. With illustrative examples throughout, the text describes associated tools, parallelization strategies, and parallel performance. It also explains the requirements for writing any computational science and engineering application, including those related to molecular dynamics, quantum chemistry, cosmological simulations and visualizations, and weather simulations"--
