Handbook of gravitational wave astronomy
This handbook provides an updated comprehensive description of gravitational wave astronomy. In the first part, it reviews gravitational wave experiments, from ground and space based laser interferometers to pulsar timing arrays and indirect detection from the cosmic microwave background. In the second part, it discusses a number of astrophysical and cosmological gravitational wave sources, including black holes, neutron stars, possible more exotic objects, and sources in the early Universe. The third part of the book reviews the methods to calculate gravitational waveforms. The fourth and last part of the book covers techniques employed in gravitational wave astronomy data analysis. This book represents both a valuable resource for graduate students and an important reference for researchers in gravitational wave astronomy.
