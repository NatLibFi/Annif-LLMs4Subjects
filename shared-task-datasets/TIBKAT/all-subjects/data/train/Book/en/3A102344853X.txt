Professor Sigman has selected the most authoritative previously published papers for this pathbreaking collection. This timely book examines private decision-making and government policy for the management of hazardous waste, the clean-up of contaminated land and the redevelopment of brownfield sites. Issues explored include the success of economic incentive policies such as 'green taxes' and tort liability, environmental decentralization and attitudes toward risk by both regulators and households. The additional focus on empirical analysis will help economists understand this challenging public policy area and will make economic insights accessible to policymakers
