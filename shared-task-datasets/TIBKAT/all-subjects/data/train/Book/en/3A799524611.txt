Katherine Mansfield and continental Europe : connections and influences
"Katherine Mansfield and Continental Europe offers new interpretations of Katherine Mansfield's work by bringing together recent biographical and critical-theoretical approaches to her life and art. It features chapters on Mansfield's reception in Europe and her own translations of other European writers; new biographical and critical interpretations of her early 'difficult' period in Bavaria and her connections to Poland; connections with other authors both contemporary and historical; notions of identity, the self, and 'home'; and finally a reinterpretation and reassessment of her stories set in Europe. Katherine Mansfield and Continental Europe aims to fill a perceived gap in the market on Mansfield studies and will be of value for students, general readers and scholars of Mansfield alike"--
