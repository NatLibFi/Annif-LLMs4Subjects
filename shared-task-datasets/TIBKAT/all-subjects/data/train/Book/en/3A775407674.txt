Fractals in Science
The fractal concept has become an important tool for understanding irregular complex systems in various scientific disciplines. This book discusses in great detail fractals in biology, heterogeneous chemistry, polymers, and the earth sciences. Beginning with a general introduction to fractal geometry it continues with eight chapters on self-organized criticality, rough surfaces and interfaces, random walks, chemical reactions, and fractals in chemisty, biology, and medicine. A special chapter entitled "Computer Exploration of Fractals, Chaos, and Cooperativity" presents computer demonstrations of fractal models. 14 executable programs are included on a 3 1/2" MS-DOS diskette and run on any IBM or compatible computer
