Fundamentals of ultra-dense wireless networks
"Discover the fundamental characteristics of ultra-dense networks with this comprehensive text. Featuring a consistent mathematical description of ultra-dense small cell networks, whilst also covering real-world issues such as network deployment, operation and optimisation, it investigates performance metrics of coverage probability and area spectral efficiency (ASE), and addresses the aspects of ultra-dense networks that make them different from current networks. Insightful intuitions, which will assist decision makers as they migrate their services, are explained and mathematically proven. The book presents the latest review of research outcomes on ultra-dense networks, based on both theoretical analyses and network simulations, includes over 200 sources from 3GPP, the Small Cell Forum, journals and conference proceedings, and covers all other prominent topics. This is an ideal reference text for professionals who are dealing with the development, deployment, operation, and maintenance of ultra-dense small cell networks, as well as researchers and graduate students in communications"
