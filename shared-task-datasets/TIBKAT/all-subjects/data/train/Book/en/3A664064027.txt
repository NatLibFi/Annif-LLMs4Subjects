Gaseous electronics : tables, atoms, and molecules
"Interactions of energetic electrons and photons with atoms, molecules, excited states and ions are generally understood to fall in the domain of gaseous electronics. Theoretical and experimental research into several facets of these interactions have continued till now, from the days when the concept of the structure of the atom, composed of electrons, protons and neutrons was revolutionary during the last years of the nineteenth century. Ingenious methods were developed for the study of interaction of electron beams with gas molecules, the energy of the beam being controlled and measured to an extraordinary degree of sophistication. Study of electrons undergoing collisions in a swarm with a distribution of energy formed a parallel branch of study. With increasing complexity of these methods advantage was taken of the enormous storage of data and fast computation of modern computers. Methods were developed to improve the congruence of results obtained from beam studies and swarm measurements"--Provided by publisher
