Electromagnetic fields
Professor Jean Van Bladel, an eminent researcher and educator in fundamental electromagnetic theory and its application in electrical engineering, has updated and expanded his definitive text and reference on electromagnetic fields to twice its original content. This new edition incorporates the latest methods, theory, formulations, and applications that relate to today's technologies. With an emphasis on basic principles and a focus on electromagnetic formulation and analysis, Electromagnetic Fields, Second Edition includes detailed discussions of electrostatic fields, potential theory, propagation in waveguides and unbounded space, scattering by obstacles, penetration through apertures, and field behavior at high and low frequencies
