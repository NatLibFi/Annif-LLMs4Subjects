"This book is about knowing when creative action is worth the risk and when it is not. This includes developing the awareness, courage, and confidence to support and take risks when it is beneficial to do so in the classroom. It also includes being able to recognize when certain risks should be avoided. The key is knowing when and how to take creative action in a way that not only makes sense for the situation at hand, but also stands to make a positive contribution to others. The aim of this book is to help you and your students identify the kinds of risks that are worth taking, better anticipate and navigate potential hazards associated with those risks, and maximize the potential benefits"--
