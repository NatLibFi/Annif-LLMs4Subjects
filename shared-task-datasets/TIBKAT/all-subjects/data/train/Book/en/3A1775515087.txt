Global atmospheric and oceanic modelling : fundamental equations
"Global Atmospheric and Oceanic Modelling Combining rigorous theory with practical application, this book provides a unified and detailed account of the fundamental equations governing atmospheric and oceanic fluid flow on which global, quantitative models of weather and climate prediction are founded. It lays the foundation for more accurate models by making fewer approximations and imposing dynamical and thermodynamical consistency, moving beyond the assumption that the Earth is perfectly spherical. A general set of equations is developed in a standard notation with clearly stated assumptions, limitations, and important properties. Some exact, non-linear solutions are developed to promote further understanding and for testing purposes. This book contains a thorough consideration of the fundamental equations for atmospheric and oceanic models, and is therefore invaluable to both theoreticians and numerical modellers. It also stands as an accessible source for reference purposes. Andrew N. Staniforth - now retired - led the development of dynamical cores for weather and climate prediction at two national centres (Canada and the UK). He has published over 100 peer-reviewed journal articles, and is the recipient of various prizes and awards including: the Editor's Award (American Meteorological Society, 1990); the Andrew Thompson Prize (Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society, 1993); and the Buchan and Adrian Gill Prizes (Royal Meteorological Society, 2007 and 2009)"--
