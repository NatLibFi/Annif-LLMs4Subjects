Neurokommunikation : Werbewirkung im Zeitalter von Social Media und neuer Erkenntnisse der Hirnforschung
Neuromarketing, neuroeconomics, neurobranding—the findings of brain research seem to be revolutionising our idea of brand communication. However, on closer inspection searching for a button in the brain on a multicoloured PET scan which companies can press to induce customers to purchase their products appears to be as futile as believing in a limbic system, through which people can allegedly be manipulated.The updated and expanded second edition of this book collates the most recent studies by brain researchers from eminent international journals, taking up-to-date scientific findings that are relevant to the field of communication into account. The CASE2 model for the effects of advertising relates the somewhat surprising new paradigms to more established models, while above all considering the distinction neuroscience makes between implicit and explicit modes of action.The author of this book has been working in advertising for over 25 years, and his advertising agency, ‘For Sale’, devised the advertising campaign deployed by Media Markt, a German chain of stores that sells consumer electronic goods. He studied cognitive neuroscience at Columbia University in New York and advertising psychology at the LMU in Munich, where he did his doctorate in communication studies
