Introduction to regional economic development : major theories and basic analytical tools
In this easy-to-follow, one-stop reference, Dinc discusses a new and dynamic endogenous regional development approach that delves deeply into a variety of topics: the globalization process and its impact on local and regional economies; theoretical evolution of economic development; the role of governance; and institutions and local leadership in the development process. -- The book reviews major traditional local and regional development theories from their origins and early applications as well as regional agglomerations and industrial clusters. It also introduces conflict management procedures into the regional development process and provides a regional decision support framework that can be used for informed development policymaking. Another advantage of this book is its discussion of basic analytical tools and the inclusion of a template in an easy-to-use MS Excel spreadsheet application. Though the book follows a logical narrative, each chapter can be read individually without a loss of meaning, making it perfect for classrooms. -- Introduction to Regional Economic Development will prove to be an invaluable resource for teachers and students of regional science, regional development, and planning, as well as regional and local development practitioners, regional development agency staff, and local government officials.
