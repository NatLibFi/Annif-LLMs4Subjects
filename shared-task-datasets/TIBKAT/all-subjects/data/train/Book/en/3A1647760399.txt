Breast MRI : Fundamentals and Technical Aspects
With a focus on the basic imaging principles of breast MRI rather than on mathematical equations, this book takes a practical approach to imaging protocols, which helps radiologists increase their diagnostic effectiveness. It walks the reader through the basics of MRI, making it especially accessible to beginners. From a detailed outline of equipment prerequisites for obtaining high quality breast MRI to instructions on how to optimize image quality, expanded discussions on how to obtain optimized dynamic information, and explanations of good and bad imaging techniques, the book covers the topics that are most relevant to performing breast MRI.
