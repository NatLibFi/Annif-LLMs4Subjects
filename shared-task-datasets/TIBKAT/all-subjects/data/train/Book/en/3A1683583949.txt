Microbiology for food and health : technological developments and advances
"This book, Microbiology for Food and Health: Technological Developments and Advances highlights the innovative microbiological approaches and advances made in the field of microbial food industries. The volume covers the most recent progress in the field of dairy and food microbiology, emphasizing the current progress, actual challenges, and successes of the latest technologies. This book looks at technological advances in starter cultures, prospective applications of food-grade microorganisms for food preservation and food safety, and innovative microbiological approaches and technologies in the food industry. The first series of chapters discuss the types, classification, and systematic uses of various starter cultures in addition to probiotics for various commercial fermentation processes. The book goes on to covers recent breakthroughs in microbial bioprocessing that can be employed in the food and health industry, such as, for an example, prospective antimicrobial applications of inherently present fermentative microflora against spoilage and pathogenic type microorganisms; the use of potential probiotic LAB biofilms for the control of formation of pathogenic biofilms by exclusion mechanisms; and more. Also considered in the volume are advanced analytical and technological approaches, such as molecular techniques for the detection of lactic acid bacteria from food matrix as well as foodborne pathogens. It also looks at environmentally friendly approaches for the utilization of liquid and solid food wastes. With chapters from international contributors at the forefront of the food microbiology, functional foods, and microbial technology industries, this important resource provides an abundance of accessible information for a wide audience, including researchers, teachers, students, and food, nutrition, and health practitioners"--
