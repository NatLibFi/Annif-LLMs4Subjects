"This volume brings together eleven articles on Gustav von Schmoller, Max Weber, and Joseph Schumpeter. It aims to identify the methodological essence of the German Historical School (GHS) that flourished between the 1840s and the 1930s. Schmoller was a leader of the GHS, and Weber and Schumpeter, while not formally regarded as members of the GHS, are its spiritual successors in that they developed methodologies that helped resolve the controversy in method between history and theory, and in that they each practiced unique economic sociology designed as a synthesis of history and theory." "The book will be of particular interest to students and scholars of economic history, economic sociology, evolutionary economics, and institutional economics."--Jacket
