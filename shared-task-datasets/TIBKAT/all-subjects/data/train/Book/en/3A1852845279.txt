Deep learning and other soft computing techniques : biomedical and related applications
This book focuses on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and computational intelligence (CI) in medical and related applications. Applications include all aspects of medicine: from diagnostics (including analysis of medical images and medical data) to therapeutics (including drug design and radiotherapy) to epidemic- and pandemic-related public health policies.  Corresponding techniques include machine learning (especially deep learning), techniques for processing expert knowledge (e.g., fuzzy techniques), and advanced techniques of applied mathematics (such as innovative probabilistic and graph-based techniques).  The book also shows that these techniques can be used in many other applications areas, such as finance, transportation, physics.    This book helps practitioners and researchers to learn more about AI and CI methods and their biomedical (and related) applications-and to further develop this important research direction
