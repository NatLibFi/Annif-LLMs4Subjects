Belgian solutions / David Helbich ; Volume 1
Belgian solutions' is an ongoing, open collection of photos, which is mainly, but not only, presented on Facebook. It was started in 2009 by David Helbich, who's photos and title provide the core of the project. Since he opened it to the 'public', people responded massivly with own images. The collection is a random and endless publication, defined again and again by it's current constellation, its ubiquitous title, leading to ever new significations. The pictures are numbered, partly in a random manner, partly in a cryptic relation to the image. Like this the framework of a series is suggested as well as undermined. Where these solutions might lead to is as unclear as the future of social online-networks, or for that matter of nation-states and how we deal within one or another
