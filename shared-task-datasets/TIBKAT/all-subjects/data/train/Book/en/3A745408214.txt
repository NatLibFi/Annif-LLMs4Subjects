The dimensions of colour : Robert Grosseteste's De colore
Robert Grosseteste's De colore (On Colour), in which Grosseteste constructs a combinatorial account of colour, plays an important role within the canon of his scientific works. In this edition, translation and commentary, the conceptual and analytical tools of contemporary science, itself a descendent of Grosseteste and his contemporaries, bring his physical and mathematical reasoning into sharper relief.
