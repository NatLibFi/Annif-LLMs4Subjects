Smart cities in Europe and Asia : urban planning and management for a sustainable future
"The smart city concept, together with the growing importance of the UN' s Sustainable Development Goals, has a significant impact on city management and governance. This book examines real cases of smart city management across Asia and Europe. It covers regions such as Iceland, Estonia, Poland, Germany, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam to systemise the knowledge in the field. It evaluates smart cities' efficiency and analyses and assesses the standards, norms and best practices involved in the management of smart cities. The book answers questions such as what it is that makes smart cities stand out; why some countries in Europe and Asia have more smart cities than others; whether smart cities support the economy and GDP growth of the country, and what the main determinants of forming smart cities in Asia and Europe are. It also evaluates whether smart cities secure higher standards of living for their citizens as compared to regular cities. Many theoretical concepts and theories are developed and then verified from the perspective of Western economies. Central Eastern European and Asian countries are frequently overlooked, thus, examining the smart city idea from the viewpoint of non-Western economies offers a fresh insight into the concept and its adaptation and evolution. The range of issues analysed in the book are multi-layered and approached from a wide array of perspectives, from macroeconomics to management, finance and technology and public policy. Thus, the book is addressed to researchers, students and academics who specialize in sustainable and regional development, economic geography and management. It will also be of interest to urban planners, environmental scientists and policymakers."
