The start of the 21st century has seen an explosion of online media, with creative content becoming a driving force for competitiveness. As twin engines of the digital economy, much has been said about both creativity and entrepreneurship but less about their relationship. Entrepreneurial Creativity in a Virtual World provides a synthesis in order to develop a conceptual framework for these phenomena. Using real world case studies, Denise Tsang highlights the economic significance of digital media production in the video game, television and magazine sectors. She illustrates the key issues involved, such as intellectual content creation, coordinating commercial, artistic and technical resources, outsourcing of core creative inputs and engaging with the user community. The end result is a book that builds on existing literature to provide a new framework for entrepreneurial creativity. This book will be useful for students and researchers interested in the theory and evidence behind creativity and entrepreneurship. Consultants and policymakers in creative industries in the UK will find this to be an essential read
