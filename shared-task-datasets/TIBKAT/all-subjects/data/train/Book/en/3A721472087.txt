The shadow economy : an international survey
Illicit work, social security fraud, economic crime, and other shadow economy activities are fast becoming an international problem.

This updated edition argues that during the 2000s the average size of a shadow economy varied from 19% of GDP for OECD, to 30% for transition, and to 45% for developing countries.
