Riemannian Metrics of Constant Mass and Moduli Spaces of Conformal Structures
This monograph deals with recent questions of conformal geometry. It provides in detail an approach to studying moduli spaces of conformal structures, using a new canonical metric for conformal structures. This book is accessible to readers with basic knowledge in differential geometry and global analysis. It addresses graduates and researchers
