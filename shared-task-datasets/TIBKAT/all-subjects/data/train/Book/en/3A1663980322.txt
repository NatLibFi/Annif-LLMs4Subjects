Advanced radiation protection dosimetry
"Although many radiation protection scientists and engineers use dose coefficients, few know the origin of those dose coefficients. This is the first book in over 40 years to address the topic of radiation protection dosimetry in intimate detail. It covers all methods used in radiation protection dosimetry, including advanced external and internal radiation dosimetry concepts and regulatory applications. It is an ideal reference for both scientists and practitioners in radiation protection and students in graduate health physics and medical physics courses"--
