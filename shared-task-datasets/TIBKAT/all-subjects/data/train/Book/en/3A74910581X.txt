Advanced Techniques for Clearance of Flight Control Laws
In this book recent results of the GARTEUR (Group for Aeronautical Research and Technology in Europe) Action Group FM (AG11) are presented. The book focuses on analysis techniques for the flight clearance of highly augmented aircrafts, including contributions of 20 European aeronautical organisations such as National Research Centers, Aerospace Industries and Universities. The tasks and requirements of the Industrial Clearance Process for Flight Control Laws are presented as well as classical and particularly new analysis methods. The different methods are evaluated and compared and their potential application to Civil Aircraft is demonstrated
