Hyperbolic and Kinetic Models for Self-organised Biological Aggregations : A Modelling and Pattern Formation Approach
This book focuses on the spatio-temporal patterns generated by two classes of mathematical models (of hyperbolic and kinetic types) that have been increasingly used in the past several years to describe various biological and ecological communities. Here we combine an overview of various modelling approaches for collective behaviours displayed by individuals/cells/bacteria that interact locally and non-locally, with analytical and numerical mathematical techniques that can be used to investigate the spatio-temporal patterns produced by said individuals/cells/bacteria. Richly illustrated, the book offers a valuable guide for researchers new to the field, and is also suitable as a textbook for senior undergraduate or graduate students in mathematics or related disciplines
