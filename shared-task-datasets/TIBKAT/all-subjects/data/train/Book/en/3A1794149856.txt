A Graduate Course in NMR Spectroscopy
Chapter 1: Basic Concepts -- Chapter 2: High Resolution NMR Spectra of Molecules -- Chapter 3: Fourier Transform NMR -- Chapter 4: Polarization Transfer -- Chapter 5: Density Matrix Description of NMR -- Chapter 6: Multidimensional NMR Spectroscopy -- Appendix.
This textbook is designed for graduate students to introduce the basic concepts of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR), spectral analysis and modern developments such as multidimensional NMR, in reasonable detail and rigor. The book is self-contained, so, a unique textbook in that sense with end of chapter exercises included supported by a solution manual. Some of the advanced topics are included as Appendices for quick reference. Students of chemistry who have some exposure to mathematics and physics will benefit from this book and it will prepare them to pursue research in different branches of Chemistry or Biophysics or Structural Biology.
