Noise and vibration analysis : signal analysis and experimental procedures
Noise and Vibration Analysis is a complete and practical guide that combines both signal processing and modal analysis theory with their practical application in noise and vibration analysis. It provides an invaluable, integrated guide for practicing engineers as well as a suitable introduction for students new to the topic of noise and vibration. Taking a practical learning approach, Brandt includes exercises that allow the content to be developed in an academic course framework or as supplementary material for private and further study.Addresses the theory and application of signal analysis
"Noise and Vibration Analysis adopts a practical learning approach, building upon two existing class-note type books that have been used by the author for 10 years of teaching two academic courses"--
