Optimization of power system operation
"Learn to apply optimization methods to solve power system operation problems. Optimization of Power System Operation applies the latest applications of new technologies to power system operation and analysis, including several new and important content areas that are not covered in existing books: uncertainty analysis in power systems; steady-state security regions; optimal load shedding; and optimal reconfiguration of electric distribution networks.   The book covers both traditional and modern technologies, including power flow analysis, steady-state security region analysis, security-constrained economic dispatch, multi-area system economic dispatch, unit commitment, optimal power flow, reactive power (VAR) optimization, optimal load shed, optimal reconfiguration of distribution network, power system uncertainty analysis, power system sensitivity analysis, analytic hierarchical process, neural network, fuzzy set theory, genetic algorithm, evolutionary programming, and particle swarm optimization, among others. Additionally, new topics such as the wheeling model, multi-area wheeling, the total transfer capability computation in multiple areas, reactive power pricing calculation, and others are also addressed." -- Publisher's description
