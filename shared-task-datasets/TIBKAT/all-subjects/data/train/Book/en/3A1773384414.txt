Water security in Asia : opportunities and challenges in the context of climate change
This book assesses the current water-security situation in Asia. The thematic areas of the book discuss the United Nation's sustainable development goals with a particular focus on Goal 6 (ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation) and Goal 13 (take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts). Asia has been facing a number of water-related challenges for decades due to multiple factors such as increasing population, socio-economic development, urbanization and migration, and climate change now poses an additional threat. While significant efforts have been made by governments in Asia, much more work is needed to make Asian societies water-secure. Given its multi-disciplinary approach, the book is a valuable resource for researchers involved in the further development of water-security concepts, approaches, and methodologies. In addition, it helps policymakers, planners, and practitioners to formulate sustainable water- security enhancement strategies grounded in sound scientific evidence to protect human well-being
