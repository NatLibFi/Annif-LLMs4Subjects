Academic woman : voicing narratives of gendered experience
In this collection, both individually and collectively, the authors explore the gendering of women's experiences in academia through the lens of narratives of lived experience. This is a cogent theme throughout the book, reflecting on women's experiences as intersectional - always raced, classed, gendered, nuanced and complex. Jointly, the chapters provide important insights into individual and collective contemporary women's experiences in academia from international perspectives, such as gender equity, barriers to success, and achievement. This comprehensive volume provides a reference point for all women and their colleagues working in universities and colleges across the world
