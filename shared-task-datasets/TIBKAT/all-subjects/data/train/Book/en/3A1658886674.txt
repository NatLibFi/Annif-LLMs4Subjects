Companion to European Heritage Revivals
Are you organising an international heritage project?

It offers a critical examination of the fieldâ€™s basic concepts and discusses a vast array of 'heritage revival tools', including games, historical re-enactments, 3D-visualisations, films, television documentaries, spatial designs and, most importantly, international heritage routes.

Above all, it shows the exceptional success achieved by projects which consistently focus on creating meaningful experiences together with individual users
