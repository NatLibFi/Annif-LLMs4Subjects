Cell Signaling in Vascular Inflammation
Although inflammatory disease of the vascular bed of the lung is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in both adult and pediatric age groups, the importance of vascular biology to its understanding, and in developing novel therapeutics, has been overlooked. In Cell Signaling in Vascular Inflammation, leading basic and clinical researchers review the signal transduction mechanisms responsible for lung inflammation, including vascular hyperpermeability, white cell accumulation, and vascular remodeling. The authors cut across disciplines to bring together a broad-based presentation of inflammatory challenge, both in the initial phases of the inflammatory response, as well as in the more prolonged phase of genomic involvement. Authoritative and state-of-the-art, Cell Signaling in Vascular Inflammation offers physiologists, molecular and cell biologists, and pharmaceutical scientists a comprehensive survey of the signal transduction pathways in lung vascular cells that illuminates not only the processes of lung inflammation, but also the potential for developing new therapeutic strategies to combat inflammatory lung disease.
