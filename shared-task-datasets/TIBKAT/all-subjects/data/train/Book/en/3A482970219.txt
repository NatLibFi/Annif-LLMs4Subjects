Third-generation systems and intelligent wireless networking : smart antennas and adaptive modulation
Third-Generation Systems and Intelligent Wireless Networking studies the network capacity gains that can be achieved with the advent of adaptive antenna arrays and adaptive modulation techniques in both FDMA / TDMA and CDMA based mobile cellular networks. The employment of adaptive antennas has numerous benefits and advantages. These include reducing the co-channel interference imposed on other system users, increasing the user capacity and the area spectral efficiency, improving the power efficiency, and reducing the number of handovers as well as transmission errors.  * Provides an overview of the various CDMA based 3G wireless standards, namely UTRA, IMT 2000 and cdma 2000 * Provides an introduction to near-instantaneously adaptive modulation for single- and multi-carrier modulation or OFDM, as well as CDMA * Quantifies the service-related benefits of adaptive transceivers in wireless video telephony * Studies the network performance gains using adaptive antenna arrays at the base station in an FDMA / TDMA cellular mobile network * Presents the design of a combined power control and adaptive modulation assisted channel allocation algorithm and its performance in an FDMA / TDMA cellular mobile network * Compares the performance of various UTRA soft-handover techniques, quantifies the network capacity and evaluates the network performance with the aid of adaptive antenna arrays   By providing an all-encompassing self-contained treatment of adaptive modulation, adaptive antennas and adaptive networking, this volume will inspire researchers, practising engineers and advanced students in the areas of wireless communications and networking. Above all, it endeavours to be an informative and stimulating read
