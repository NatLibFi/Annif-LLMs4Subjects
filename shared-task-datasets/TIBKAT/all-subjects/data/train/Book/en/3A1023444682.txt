Charting corporate corruption : agency, structure and escalation
In the post-Enron era, corporate corruption is increasingly on the research agenda. This informative book provides a novel approach by charting the causes of corruption.

By analyzing and describing the social psychological dimensions of this escalation, the book will be effective in creating preventive measures that can be designed and implemented in business organizations
