Further Linear Algebra
Further Linear Algebra is a natural sequel to the authors' highly acclaimed SUMS volume "Basic Linear Algebra". The more advanced topics covered here take the reader to the very heart of the subject, and include inner product spaces, direct sums of subspaces, the primary decomposition theorem and various canonical forms for matrices. Furthermore, the authors provide a brief introduction to the use of MAPLE in linear algebra calculations, and biographical profiles of eminent mathematicians associated with the subject. An introductory chapter recaps the prerequisites (for those readers unfamiliar with the first volume), and a wide range of worked examples and exercises (with solutions) are strategically placed throughout the text to consolidate understanding
