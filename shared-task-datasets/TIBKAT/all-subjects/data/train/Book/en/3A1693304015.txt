Planning the impossible : urban development and spatial strategies in the Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport Region
In urban regions, airport areas are inevitable. They are key infrastructure elements that involve important commercial and spatial factors. Taking the example of Charles de Gaulle airport (CDG) in Paris, the author analyzes the planning parameters that make visible the key factors influencing urban development. Step by step, she reveals the history of the development of CDG airport in Paris, investigates the conflicts perceived by the planners, and from that derives generally feasible approaches that can be applied to cope with conflicting paradigms. The book is intended for town planners, municipalities, and architects, and makes a practical contribution to establishing and assessing planning strategies for airport areas
