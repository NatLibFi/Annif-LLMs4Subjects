German pop literature : a companion
Pop literature of the 1990s enjoyed bestselling success, as well as an extensive and sometimes derogatory reception in the press. Since then, scholarship on pop has emerged to challenge its flash-in-the-pan status by situating the genre within a longer history of aesthetic practices. The essays in the volume examine works by well-known pop writers like Christian Kracht, Benjamin Lebert, Florian Illies, Feridun ZaimoÄŸlu and Charlotte Roche. --
