Design of optimal feedback for structural control
"This book addresses problems in optimal structural control. It provides solutions and techniques for optimal control design problems related to passive and semi-active controlled structures. Optimal control theory is used in order to solve these problems in a rigorous manner. Modern theoretical notions, such as dissipativity and passivity of dynamic systems, are discussed in the context of the addressed problems. Novel solutions for optimal passive and semi-active control design problems are derived and verified by rigorous theoretical derivations and numerical simulations of typical civil structures which are subjected to different types of dynamic excitations"--
