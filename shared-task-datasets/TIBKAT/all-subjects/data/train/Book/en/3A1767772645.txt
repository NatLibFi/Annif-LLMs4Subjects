Rail vehicle mechatronics
"This unique and up-to-date work surveys the use of mechatronics in rail vehicles, notably traction, braking, communications, data sharing, and control. The results include improved safety, comfort, and fuel efficiency. Mechatronic systems are a key element in modern rail vehicle design and operation. Starting with an overview of mechatronic theory, the book goes on to cover topics including modeling of mechanical and electrical systems for rail vehicles, open and closed loop control systems, sensors, actuators and microprocessors. Modern simulation techniques and examples are included throughout, and numerical experiments and developed models for railway application are presented and explained. Case studies are used, alongside practical examples, to ensure that the reader can apply mechatronic theory to real world conditions. These case studies include modeling of a hybrid locomotive and simplified models of railway vehicle lateral dynamics for suspension control studies. Rail Vehicle Mechatronics provides current and in-depth content for design engineers, operations managers, systems engineers and technical consultants world-wide, working with freight, passenger, and urban transit railway systems"--
