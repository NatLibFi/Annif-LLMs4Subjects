OECD Economics Glossary : English-French
This updated and expanded edition of the 1992 Glossaire de l’économie anglais-français contains some 30 000 terms and expressions, covering a wide range of subject areas: general economics, statistics, finance and banking, trade, management, accounting, insurance, manpower and employment, development and tax. The glossary also explores new fields, such as money laundering and financial engineering. It gives brief descriptions of four specialist areas (financial analysis, money laundering, credit derivatives and transfer prices) and the English equivalents of the basic concepts.
