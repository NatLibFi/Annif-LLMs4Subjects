Beneficial chemical elements of plants : recent developments and future prospects
"Beneficial elements like Aluminium (Al), cobalt (Co), sodium (Na), selenium (Se), and silicon (Si) play a vital role in plant growth. They reportedly increase a plants tolerance against biotic stress, like pathogens and herbivory, and to abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, and nutrient toxicity or deficiency. Although these elements increase the growth and development of various plants against the fluctuating environmental conditions, their concentration and way of function varies for each plant in different conditions. These beneficial elements are not necessary for plants, but when provided, they benefit their growth subsequently, and can stimulate mechanisms of resistance to fluctuating environmental conditions and also promote the uptake of other nutrients and reimburse the toxic impacts of other elements."--
