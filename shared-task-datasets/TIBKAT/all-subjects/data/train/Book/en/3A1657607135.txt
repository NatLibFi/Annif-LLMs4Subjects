LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 : The Mayan Adventure
Build five robots to overcome obstacles and lead a team of explorers deep into a Mayan tomb. You are along for the ride with Evan and his archaeologist uncle as they explore a Mayan pyramid complete with traps and treasures. Using a variety of EV3 robots, the archaeology team is able to move deeper into the tomb, all the way to the sarcophagus of King Ixtua. But beware of the traps! The pyramid's design has successfully deterred unwanted visitors through the centuries, and your team will need to be careful and alert. LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3: The Mayan Adventure guides in the design, construction, and programming of unique explorer robots to open “the newly discovered tomb of an ancient Mayan king." You will learn and use a workmanlike design methodology that teaches you about your robot’s motors and sensors. Complete building and programming instructions are provided for each robot, giving you as much guidance as you want, to learn as you build. Can you help Evan and the team of explorers navigate through the old pyramid and gain entry to King Ixtua's tomb? Read the stories, dig in to the environments, and create the robots that will reveal the secrets of The Mayan Adventure. Updates the beloved Mayan Adventure to the latest LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 hardware and software. Shows how to build all five EV3 robots to solve real-world problems. Includes Design Journal pages and Engineering Notes that encourage constructive brainstorming
