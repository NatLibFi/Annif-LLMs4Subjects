El espa√±ol en los Estados Unidos : e pluribus unum? ; enfoques multidisciplinarios
"This volume (written entirely in Spanish, with English abstracts) contains 17 studies on a variety of aspects of Spanish in the United States, including topics such as: a socio-demographic analysis of the US Hispanic population, bilingual first language acquisition of English and Spanish, cross-generational maintenance of Spanish, steps toward a dialectology of  US Spanish, dialect contact in the United States, conceptual convergence with English in the speech of US Hispanics, Spanglish as an identity marker, language policies in the US health delivery system to Hispanics, and several perspectives on Spanish literacy and the teaching of Spanish as a heritage language in the United States. While some chapters take an updated "state-of-the-art" approach to the field of research they focus on, many others offer new theoretical insights or discuss the results of original studies in applied linguistics, which will undoubtedly be of great interest to the scholars  working in the field of US Spanish, irrespective of the particular methodology they favor in their research." -- Publisher description
