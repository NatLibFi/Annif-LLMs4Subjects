Mechanical design : theory and applications
Mechanical Design: Theory and Applications, Third Edition introduces the design and selection of common mechanical engineering components and machine elements, hence providing the foundational "building blocks" engineers needs to practice their art. In this book, readers will learn how to develop detailed mechanical design skills in the areas of bearings, shafts, gears, seals, belt and chain drives, clutches and brakes, and springs and fasteners. Where standard components are available from manufacturers, the steps necessary for their specification and selection are thoroughly developed. Descriptive and illustrative information is used to introduce principles, individual components, and the detailed methods and calculations that are necessary to specify and design or select a component. As well as thorough descriptions of methodologies, this book also provides a wealth of valuable reference information on codes and regulations.
