Applied Multidimensional Scaling
This book introduces MDS as a psychological model and as a data analysis technique for the applied researcher. It also discusses, in detail, how to use two MDS programs, Proxscal (a module of SPSS) and Smacof (an R-package). The book is unique in its orientation on the applied researcher, whose primary interest is in using MDS as a tool to build substantive theories. This is done by emphasizing practical issues (such as evaluating model fit), by presenting ways to enforce theoretical expectations on the MDS solution, and by discussing typical mistakes that MDS users tend to make. The primary audience of this book are psychologists, social scientists, and market researchers. No particular background knowledge is required, beyond a basic knowledge of statistics.
First Steps -- The Purpose of MDS -- The Goodness of an MDS Solution -- Proximities -- Variants of Different MDS Models -- Confirmatory MDS -- Typical Mistakes in MDS -- MDS Algorithms -- Computer Programs for MDS.
