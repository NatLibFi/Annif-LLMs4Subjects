Biodiversity, conservation, and sustainable development : principles and practices with Asian examples
This important book highlights the conflicts between economic growth and the conservation of nature in the context of sustainable development. It places particular emphasis on biological diversity and examines possible policies for resolving conflicts which arise from the contrasting goals of conserving the natural environment and economic growth. The book opens with an overview of the challenges of economics, nature conservation and sustainable development and goes on to discuss general principles and broad policies. Case studies from China and north-east India help illustrate important economic and social principles involved in nature conservation. General issues examined include: * the value of environmental and resource economics in planning sustainable development * the importance of biodiversity conservation for sustainable development and for the stability and sustainability of ecological systems * the impact of economic globalization and market systems on the conservation of nature * priorities for the financial support of protected areas * the extent to which ecotourism can be harnessed to reconcile economic utilisation of an area with nature conservation * the costs and benefits of conservation * financing the management of nature reserves This book will be essential reading for economists interested in the environment, ecology and development
