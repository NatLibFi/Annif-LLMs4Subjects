D-modules, perverse sheaves, and representation theory
This work examines in detail the foundations of D-module theory and its intersection with cohomology groups and representation theory. This systematic and carefully written exposition begins with preliminary concepts before focusing on some basic but important theories that have emerged in the last few decades. Significant topics that have emerged as studies in their own right include a treatment of the theory of holonomic D-modules, perverse sheaves, the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, Hodge modules, and Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. To further aid the reader, appendices are provided as reviews for the theory of derived categories and algebraic varieties. "D-modules, Perverse Sheaves, and Representation Theory" is a unique and essential textbook at the graduate level for classroom use or self-study. Graduate students and researchers in algebra and representation theory willbenefit greatlyfrom this work. TOC:Introduction - Part I.
