CD14 in the inflammatory response
In a world full of pathogens the ability to detect an incipient infection and to respond rapidly and appropriately to it is a decisive part of our survival strategy. The innate immune system provides the first response to an infection by initiating an inflammatory response and the monocyte surface molecule CD14 is a key element in this response system. The initial chapters in this volume describe the structure and ligand interactions of this important receptor molecule which is involved both in inflammation and in some aspects of apoptosis. The very recent results which illuminate the probable signal transduction pathways are also described. Overactivation of the inflammatory response can lead to systemic inflammation and septic shock. Attempts to intervene clinically in this system have been disappointing, and the reasons for these failures are discussed in the context of the expression of TNF which is upregulated by CD14. A discussion of new data on the clinical course of shock and the currently emerging therapeutic strategies rounds off the book. The information compiled in this well-edited volume will be of use to everyone working on problems of inflammation - a topic where fundamental research and clinical medicine meet. Clinicians will find the current state of scientific knowledge on the inflammatory response as induced via CD14 presented in a readable form, while the clinical aspects discussed will be of particular interest to scientists and students who lack a medical background
