Infrared thermal imaging : fundamentals, research and applications
This richly illustrated hands-on guide is designed for researchers, teachers and practitioners. The huge selection of examples taken from science, basic teaching of physics, practical applications in industry and a variety of other disciplines spanning the range from medicine to volcano research allows readers to pick those that come closest to their own individual task at hand. Following a look at the fundamentals of IR thermal imaging, properties of the imaging systems, as well as basic and advanced methods, the book goes on to discuss IR imaging applications in teaching, research and industry. Specific examples include thermography of buildings, microsystems and the rather new field of IR imaging of gases.  Impartially written by expert authors in the field from a renowned applied science institution, who are in the unique position of having both experience in public and private research and in teaching, this comprehensive book can be used for teaching beginners in the field as well as providing further education to specialized staff, students and researchers.
