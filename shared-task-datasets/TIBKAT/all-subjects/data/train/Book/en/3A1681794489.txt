Guidelines for community energy planning
This book systematically introduces readers to the operator method, which can be used in different stages of urban planning. Energy planning should ideally be accompanied by urban planning, ranging from comprehensive planning and detailed planning, to the design of individual construction projects. This book discusses a range of methods and models for defining energy planning objectives; analyzing and predicting energy demand; assessing available energy resources; optimizing integrated energy systems; analyzing the cost-effectiveness of proposals; implementation management; and post-assessment. Part one focuses on energy planning in different urban planning stages, while part two provides detailed discussions of key issues related to energy planning
