Biomedical signals based computer-aided diagnosis for neurological disorders
Biomedical signals provide unprecedented insight into abnormal or anomalous neurological conditions. The computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system plays a key role in detecting neurological abnormalities and improving diagnosis and treatment consistency in medicine. This book covers different aspects of biomedical signals-based systems used in the automatic detection/identification of neurological disorders. Several biomedical signals are introduced and analyzed, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate (HR), magnetoencephalogram (MEG), and electromyogram (EMG). It explains the role of the CAD system in processing biomedical signals and the application to neurological disorder diagnosis. The book provides the basics of biomedical signal processing, optimization methods, and machine learning/deep learning techniques used in designing CAD systems for neurological disorders. Presents the concepts of CAD for various neurological disorders; Covers biomedical signal processing and machine learning/deep learning techniques; Includes case studies, real-time examples, and research directions.
