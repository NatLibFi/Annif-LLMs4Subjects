Morphology : from data to theories
"This textbook discussing morphology and its processes within a general framework that will incorporate the most recent developments in the field, but also in their relation with syntax, lexical semantics and phonology. It pays particular attention to the debate between lexicalism and constructionism, and provides open activities designed to help students start their own original research and stimulate their own thinking over the morphology of their languages beyond what is usually described in published works. This approach is particularly important because many textbooks ignore some of the most recent developments in syntax when it comes to defining the place of morphology and the lexicon in the architecture of grammar or to providing evidence about the existence of morphology as an independent module. This textbook discusses developments in Construction Grammar and in the Minimalist Program which have helped reframe the discussion about the Lexical Integrity Hypothesis and related issues. By presenting the latest theories and highlighting the current challenges in morphology, upper level undergraduate and postgraduate students will find this textbook an invigorating and inspiring resource."--Publisher's website
