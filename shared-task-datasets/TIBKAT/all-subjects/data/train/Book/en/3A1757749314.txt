Tragedy and Philosophy. A Parallel History
Completed shortly before her death in 2019, Tragedy and Philosophy is the sum of Agnes Heller's reflections on European history and culture, seen through the prism of Europe's two unique literary creations: tragedy and philosophy. Part 1 traces their parallel history from ancient Athens to rebirth in early modern London and Paris. Part 2 explores the interactions between post-metaphysical philosophy and post-tragic drama from the eighteenth through to the twentieth centuries. Heller's perspective is post-Hegelian: the story of European culture can only be told from its end, the generalization of modernity across the globe. In this sense Part 3 is Heller's farewell to the grand narrative of European history and culture as well as her own personal farewell to philosophy
