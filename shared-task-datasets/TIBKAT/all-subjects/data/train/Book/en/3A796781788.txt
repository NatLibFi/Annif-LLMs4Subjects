Market supervision in the European Union : integrated administration in constitutional context
In 'Market Supervision in the European Union', Pieter Van Cleynenbreugel compares and reconstructs the emergence of divergently structured supranational market supervision mechanisms in six different sectors of EU regulation (competition, financial services, chemicals, consumer law, electronic communications and energy). EU market supervision developments have been plentiful over the past decade, but have so far mainly been studied in their own sector-specific context. On the basis of an innovative cross-sector investigation, Pieter Van Cleynenbreugel identifies and conceptualises common or converging EU constitutional benchmarks underlying those sector-specific administrative design developments. Those benchmarks better allow to conceptualise, predict and restrain future EU integrated administration structures and initiatives in those and other fields of European Union law
