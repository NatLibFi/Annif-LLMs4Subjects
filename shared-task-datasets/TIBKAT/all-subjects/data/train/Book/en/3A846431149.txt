Ortner & Ortner Baukunst
"The architecture firm Ortner & Ortner Baukunst with branches in Vienna, Berlin, and Cologne was founded in 1987 by Laurids and Manfred Ortner and has its roots in the architecture group Haus-Rucker-Co. which was part of the vibrant Viennese architecture and art scene in the 1960s and 70s ... The book describes the development of the O&O world of ideas, focusing on the latest buildings and projects."--Page 4 of cover
