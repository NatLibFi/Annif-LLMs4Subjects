Radiosurgery and pathological fundamentals : new insights discussed by acknowledged experts
Because of the huge clinical experience that has been accumulated in radiosurgery, it seems timely to explore and process out systematically pathological fundamentals on the effect of focused irradiation. The better understanding of radiobiology will enhance the outcomes of radiosurgical procedures. Renowned experts from all over the world discuss the baselines of pathology and radiobiology, medical physical principles, dose prescription guidelines, current radiosurgical techniques, advanced computer technology and recent imaging methods in radiosurgery. In this unique volume the most pioneering feature is the parallel discussion of clinical radiosurgical results with fundamental pathological findings following high-dose focused irradiation. Topics range from benign and malignant brain tumors, vascular malformations, functional disorders, ocular and spinal radiosurgery, interstitial brachytherapy to experimental efforts.This publication gives neurosurgeons, radiosurgeons, radiologists, pathologists, medical physicists, neurologists, oncologists, ophthalmologists, otolaryngologists as well as nuclear medicine and medical information technology experts an excellent understanding of the latest development of pathological fundamentals and new trends in radiosurgery
