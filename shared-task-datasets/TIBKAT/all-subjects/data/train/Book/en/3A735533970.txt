Laboratory experiments : using microwave heating
"This book presents a series of procedures for organic, inorganic, analytical, and physical chemistry experiments. Each experimental protocol comprises a chapter in the text that is available for purchase individually. Each protocol contains a brief introduction to the concepts behind the chemistry covered, followed by detailed procedures for performing the reaction using a small and a larger microwave unit. The book covers all commonly available scientific microwave apparatus currently used in teaching laboratories. Each chapter concludes with questions for students to answer as part of their laboratory write-up. The experiments are also featured online as well as on a complementary CD-ROM. The author maintains a website with supplemental information"--
