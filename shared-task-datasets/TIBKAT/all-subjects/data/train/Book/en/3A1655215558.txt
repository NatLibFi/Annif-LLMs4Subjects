Conducting polymers : bioinspired intelligent materials and devices
Conducting polymers are organic, conjugated materials that offer high electrical conductivity through doping by oxidation and a wide range of unique electromechanical and electrochromic characteristics. These properties can be reversibly tuned through electrochemical reactions, making this class of materials good biomimetic models and ideal candidates for the development of novel flexible and transparent sensing devices. This book comprehensively summarises the current and future applications of conducting polymers, with chapters focusing on electrosynthesis strategies, theoretical models for composition dependent allosteric and structural changes, composition dependent biomimetic properties, novel biomimetic devices and future developments of zoomorphic and anthropomorphic tools
