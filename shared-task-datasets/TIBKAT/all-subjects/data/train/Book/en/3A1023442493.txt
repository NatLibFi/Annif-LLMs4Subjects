Trust and human resource management
An organization’s human resource management (HRM) policies and their implementation have long been claimed to influence trust within an organizational environment. However there has, until now, been a limited examination of the relationship between the two. In this unique book, the contributors explore the HRM cycle from entry to exit, and examine in detail the issue of trust and its links with HRM. Each chapter takes an aspect of HRM including; selection, performance management, careers and personal development, training, change management and exit, and offers a new understanding and insight into the role, importance and challenges to trust within these processes. -- ‘This is an extremely welcome and timely contribution which extends our understanding of the relationship between trust and HRM in organizations, a relationship which has until now been under explored. This excellent edited collection explores trust in the context of HRM stage by stage from pre-entry to exit in a thoughtful and provocative way. In each chapter leading scholars in the trust and HRM fields highlight critical issues for both researchers and practitioners to consider. Key reading for anyone interested in how HRM can enhance and develop trust and how trust can contribute to the success of HRM.’ (Antoinette Weibel, University of Konstanz, Germany and President of First International Network on Trust).
