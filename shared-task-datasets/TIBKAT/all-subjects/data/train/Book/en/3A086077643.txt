This book presents a coherent account of contemporary computational approaches for turbulent flows. It aims to provide the reader with information about the current state of the art as well as to stimulate directions for future research and development. The book puts particular emphasis on computational methods for incompressible and compressible turbulent flows as well as on methods for analysing and quantifying numerical errors in turbulent flow computations. Apart from reviewing main research developments, new previously unpublished material is also included in many of the chapters. This book aims to appeal to a broad audience of applied scientists and engineers who are involved in the development and application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods for turbulent flows. The readership includes academic researchers as well as CFD practitioners in industry. The chapters were specifically composed to also constitute an advanced textbook for PhD candidates in the field of CFD and turbulence. The book can also be used as a textbook at the level of MSc or MEng studies in engineering, physics and applied mathematics departments
