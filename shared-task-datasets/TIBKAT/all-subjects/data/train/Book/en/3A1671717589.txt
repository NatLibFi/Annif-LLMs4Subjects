Writing for planners : a handbook for students and professionals in writing, editing, and document production
"Writing is never easy, but this book can make it easier. With attentiveness and experience, Claudia Kousoulas gives readers applied writing, editing, and production approaches that provide a clear path to completing a document and tools that ensure it is engaging and professional. The book follows a project's path from initial assignment and conception, through sorting out what's significant, shaping it into a message, and guiding readers to an action. It addresses the different types of documents planners have to create, the different media they use, and the different audiences they address. Its strategies will help writers start a project and see it through to a clear and coherent piece of work that serves its purpose. This book will help planners meet the challenges of creating work that is accurate, creative, and useful. Students will find it helpful in providing professional standards and quick reference information, and that professionals will carry it through their careers as a reference, as a way to establish workplace standards, and to improve their own work"--
