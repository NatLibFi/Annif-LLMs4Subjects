Spillovers and innovations : space, environment, and the economy
Innovation processes and related spillovers are of eminent importance in a modern economy. How do they relate to spatial structures and environmental factors? The papers analyse innovation processes and spillovers in the economy from various angles, focussing mainly on regional and environmental aspects. Among others they touch issues on university spillovers, urban tourism, highway investments, industry clusters, and econometrics. An introductory chapter sets the stage for the following discussion, and a concluding chapter evaluates the achievements. Contributors from Austria, other European countries and from the U.S.A. discuss this question from various angles: among others universities, urban tourism, highway investments, and industry clusters. The volume demonstrates the relevance of the concept of spillovers, particularly in the context of innovations, and stimulates future work in this area.
