Inverse problems with applications in science and engineering
"Driven the advancement of industrial mathematics and the need for impact case studies, Inverse Problems with Applications in Science and Engineering thoroughly examines the state-of-the-art of some representative classes of inverse and ill-posed problems for partial differential equations (PDEs). The natural practical applications of this examination arise in heat transfer, electrostatics, porous media, acoustics, fluid and solid mechanics - all of which are addressed in this text. Features: Covers all types of PDEs, namely, elliptic (Laplace's, Helmholtz, modified Helmholtz, biharmonic, Stokes), parabolic (heat, convection-reaction-diffusion) and hyperbolic (wave) Excellent reference for post-graduates and researchers in mathematics, engineering, and any other scientific disciplines that deal with inverse problems Contains both theory and numerical algorithms for solving all types of inverse and ill-posed problems"--
