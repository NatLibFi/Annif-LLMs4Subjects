Soils and food security
Soil is essential to agriculture and a resource that cannot be replaced easily. Nevertheless, its importance to food production and the threats to its sustainability are often overlooked. This book, the 35th volume of Issues in Environmental Science and Technology, examines the current status of soils across the globe and their potential for food production to meet the needs of the World's population in the 21st Century. Threats, such as the degradation, pollution and erosion of soil are discussed, along with the possible consequences of climate change for soil and food production. As an ecosystem service, soil also serves to capture nutrients and sequester carbon, and these issues are discussed in the context of adding value to soil protection. The influence of modern agricultural techniques in enhancing soil productivity is also discussed. Throughout the book case studies support the discussion. Together with the books on Ecosystem Services, Sustainable Water, and Environmental Impacts of Modern Agriculture, this addition to the series will be essential reading for anyone concerned with the environment, whether as scientist, policy maker, student or lay reader.
