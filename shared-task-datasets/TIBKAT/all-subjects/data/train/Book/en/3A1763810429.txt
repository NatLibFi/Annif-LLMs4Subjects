Bioengineering and biomaterials in ventricular assist devices
"Often associated with artificial hearts, Ventricular Assist Devices (VAD) are blood pumps that can provide circulatory assistance to the left ventricle, the right ventricle, or both biventricular. Bioengineering and Biomaterials in Ventricular Assist Devices details constructive details of VADs and the biomaterials used in their development and support. This advanced text is aimed at advanced students, researchers, and practicing engineers conducting work on VADs and will be of interest to a broad interdisciplinary group, including on bioengineers, materials engineers, chemical engineers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, and others"--
