Dutch Architecture
Dutch architects carry out complex and multi-use planning assignments in densely populated and highly urbanised areas. They also have a great track record in giving new purpose to buildings that have become unused and unwanted. Former warehouses, power plants and industrial units are now boasting state-of-the-art restoration and re-use, whilst retaining their historic identity. Dutch housing schemes are renowned internationally - they foster sustainability, functional and spatial cohesion. Dutch architects have been masters at managing water and land for centuries, and have developed a responsive spatial and urban planning approach. This book presents a selection of Dutch architects, all experts in delivering aesthetic and architectural quality to houses, corporate buildings, shopping malls, motorways, parking garages, bridges
