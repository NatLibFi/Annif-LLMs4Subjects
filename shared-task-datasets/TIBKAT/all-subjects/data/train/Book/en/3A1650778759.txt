Three-Dimensional Model Analysis and Processing
Three-Dimensional Model Analysis and Processing' focuses on five hot research directions in 3D model analysis and processing in computer science, i.e., on compression, feature extraction, content-based retrieval, irreversible watermarking and reversible watermarking. The book is based on a wide range of new content, systematic and theoretical, and fully reflects the state-of-the-art in 3D model analysis and processing technologies. This book is intended for researchers, engineers and graduate students working in 3D model analysis and processing. Faxin Yu is an Associate Professor at the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Zhejiang University, China, both Zheming Lu and Pinghui Wang are also Professors there, Hao Luo is a Lecturer there.
