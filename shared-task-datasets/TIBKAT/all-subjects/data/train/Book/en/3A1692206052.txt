Transmission of electrical energy : overhead lines
"The electric energy consumed in homes, shops, and industry is transported from the generating plants to the consumers mentioned through transmission lines in alternating current (AC). The transmission lines are very important because without them many cities could not use the electric power and the life in these cities would be a chaos. In this book, the reader will learn, easily and didactically, how an AC transmission line project is executed in practice, how to calculate the parameters needed to use in transmission lines projects, how an AC transmission line operates, and how to use the ATPdraw, a world-class computing program, to do simulations of AC transmission lines. The purpose of integrating the ATPdraw computational program with this book is to provide computational solutions from examples proposed in the text, to show topics covered in the text, to get computational solutions with a more realistic tool and to provide readers with an experience using a professional analysis program transmission line"--
