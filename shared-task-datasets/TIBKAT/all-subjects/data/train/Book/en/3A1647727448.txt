Pediatric Heart Sounds
Pediatric Heart Soundsoffers in-depth tutorials of specific pediatric heart sounds and a diagnosis of those sounds. A self-assessment option helps the viewer to recognize the audio features of a heart condition as well as how to analyze logically and 'dissect' the murmur to improve identification. The book is designed to provide explanation of the mechanisms involved.
As a learning tool, Pediatric Heart Sounds offers a unique interactive overview of cardiac auscultation. The CD-ROM is the only one to integrate high-fidelity, digitally recorded pediatric heart sounds with a graphic patient chest interface, while the book provides a review of the mechanisms behind the individual heart sounds. Using the CD-ROM, readers can place the stethoscope at the four chest locations most commonly auscultated and to hear the corresponding sounds, thus simulating an actual examination. Pediatric Heart Sounds provides an additional learning tool for medical students and practitioners in preparation for future study or for integration into practical work experience with pediatric patients.
