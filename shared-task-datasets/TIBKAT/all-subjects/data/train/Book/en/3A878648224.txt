Diagnostics of laboratory and astrophysical plasmas using spectral lineshapes of one-, two-, and three-electron systems
"The book presents an advanced tool for experimentalists using spectral lineshapes for diagnostics of laboratory or astrophysical plasmas, and for theorists helping the experimentalists in interpreting the experimental line profiles. It significantly expands the scope of parameters of plasmas and/or fields in it that can be measured. For some parameters, the book presents new, more advanced diagnostic methods than the methods covered in the previous books"--
