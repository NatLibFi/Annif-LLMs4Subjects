Vibrant architecture : matter as a codesigner of living structures
This book explores how matter may become a codesigner of our living spaces. The possibility of promoting architectural liveliness by incorporating ‘vibrant matter’ into the built environment is explored as a new practice in sustainable buildings. The resultant ‘vibrant architecture’ raises the possibility of environmentally positive spaces that enhance - rather than reduce - the health of our biosphere.
