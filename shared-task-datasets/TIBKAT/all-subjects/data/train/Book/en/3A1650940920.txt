Linear algebra : for everyone
This book provides students with the rudiments of Linear Algebra, a fundamental subject for students in all areas of science and technology. The book would also be good for statistics students studying linear algebra. It is the translation of a successful textbook currently being used in Italy. The author is a mathematician sensitive to the needs of a general audience. In addition to introducing fundamental ideas in Linear Algebra through a wide variety of interesting examples, the book also discusses topics not usually covered in an elementary text (e.g. the "cost" of operations, generalized inverses, approximate solutions). The challenge is to show why the "everyone" in the title can find Linear Algebra useful and easy to learn. The translation has been prepared by a native English speaking mathematician, Professor Anthony V. Geramita.
