Synchrotron radiation and free-electron lasers : principles of coherent X-ray generation
"Drawing upon the most recent theoretical developments, pre-eminent leaders in the field guide you through the fundamental principles and techniques of high-brightness X-ray generation from both synchrotron and free-electron laser sources. A wide range of topics is covered, including high-brightness synchrotron radiation from undulators, self-amplified spontaneous emission, seeded high-gain amplifiers with harmonic generation, ultra-short pulses, tapering for higher power, free-electron laser oscillators, and X-ray oscillator and amplifier configuration. Novel mathematical approaches and numerous figures accompanied by intuitive explanations enable easy understanding of key concepts, whilst practical considerations of performance improving techniques and discussion of recent experimental results provide the tools and knowledge needed to address current research problems in the field"--
