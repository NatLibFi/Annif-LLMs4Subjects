Automatic target recognition
Definitions and performance measures -- Target detection strategies -- Target classifier strategies -- Unification of automatic target tracking and automatic target recognition -- Multisensor fusion -- Next-generation ATR -- How smart is your automatic target recognizer?
"This third edition of Automatic Target Recognition provides a roadmap for breakthrough ATR designs with increased intelligence, performance, and autonomy. Clear distinctions are made between military problems and comparable commercial Deep Learning problems. These considerations need to be understood by ATR engineers working in the defense industry as well as by their government customers. A reference design is provided for a next-generation ATR that can continuously learn from and adapt to its environment. The convergence of diverse forms of data on a single platform supports new capabilities and improved performance. This third edition broadens the notion of ATR to multisensor fusion. Radical continuous-learning ATR architectures, better integration of data sources, well-packaged sensors, and low-power teraflop chips will enable transformative military designs"--
