Potassium-ion batteries : materials and applications
"Potassium-ion batteries have gained the most attention in emerging electrochemical energy storage technology of the future. Potassium-ion batteries have abundant resources and similar electrochemical behavior to lithium-ion batteries and thus can meet the needs of electrochemical energy storage applications. These batteries possess low cost, long cycle life, high energy density, safety, and reliability. The invention of potassiumion batteries came to the surface of energy storage research in 2004, over two decades after the revolutionary invention of lithium-ion batteries. Potassium-ion batteries are the potential alternative to lithium-ion batteries, fueling a new direction of energy storage research for many universities"--
