Disequilibrium sports economics : competitive imbalance and budget constraints
For decades, sports economics has been set within the framework of equilibrium economics, in particular when modelling team sport leagues. Based on a conviction that this does not reflect real life, this book addresses a gap in the literature and opens up a new research area by applying concepts drawn from disequilibrium economics. It is divided into two parts, the first of which focuses on economic disequilibrium in sports markets and competitive imbalance in sporting contests. The second part concentrates on soft budget constraints and their consequences for club governance and management. -- This pioneering book is the first to tackle non-mainstream economics in sport and offers a first approach to disequilibrium sports economics. Providing a new metric of competitive balance and opening up new avenues of future research, this is essential reading for economists and those researching sport across many disciplines. -- ‘This is an interesting book worth reading for every sports economist because it introduces a thought provoking approach to the growing field of sports economics. The authors show how disequilibrium economics may improve our understanding of puzzling economic phenomena in sports. I congratulate the editor and the contributors for this new book and the novel perspectives provided therein!’ (Helmut M. Dietl, University of Zurich, Switzerland).
