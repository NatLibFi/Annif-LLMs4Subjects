Signs in MR-Mammography
Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women, and its incidence and prevalence have been steadily rising in recent decades. This book describes morphologic and kinetic signs that are important in the analysis of breast MR images before and after contrast administration and in various pulse sequences. Earlier this method was regarded as high sensitive but low specific. Today, by utilizing all the information contained in MR data sets, we can greatly increase the specificity of MRM. This gives MRM a very high overall accuracy in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of breast lesions, making it possible to detect cancers as small as 3 mm with a high degree of confidence. This book is intended to help broaden and expedite the clinical application of MRM so that as many physicians as possible can make more accurate and confident diagnoses.
