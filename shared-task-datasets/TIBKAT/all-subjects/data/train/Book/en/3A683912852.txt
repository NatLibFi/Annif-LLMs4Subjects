Introducing second language acquisition
"Written for students encountering the topic for the first time, this is a clear and practical introduction to second language acquisition (SLA). Using non-technical language it explains how a second language is acquired; what the learner of a second language needs to know; and why some learners are more successful than others. This new edition of Muriel Saville-Troike's bestselling textbook introduces in a step-by-step fashion a range of fundamental concepts, such as SLA in adults and children, in formal and informal learning contexts, and in diverse sociocultural settings.

Providing a solid foundation in SLA, this book has become the leading introduction to the field for students of linguistics, psychology, education, and trainee language teachers"--
