Basic macroscopic principles of applied superconductivity
"The book presents investigation results of the mechanism of stable or unstable formation of electrodynamic states of low- and high-temperature superconductors taking into account their thermal history. The analysis of results enabled the non-isothermal conditions of retaining the superconductivity to be formulated for cases of variations in the external magnetic field, transport current with heat releases from pulse sources of perturbations of ambiguous power and duration. The analysis allows an understanding of physical ideas of the character of macroscopic phenomenon development in the low- and high-temperature superconductors. The results discussed herein can be used in developing superconducting systems and in analysis of conditions saving the superconductivity within a wide range of changes in working temperatures and primarily in intensive external actions"--
