Quasiconformal Space Mappings : A collection of surveys 1960â€“1990
This volume is a collection of surveys on function theory in euclidean n-dimensional spaces centered around the theme of quasiconformal space mappings. These surveys cover or are related to several topics including inequalities for conformal invariants and extremal length, distortion theorems, L(p)-theory of quasiconformal maps, nonlinear potential theory, variational calculus, value distribution theory of quasiregular maps, topological properties of discrete open mappings, the action of quasiconformal maps in special classes of domains, and global injectivity theorems. The present volume is the first collection of surveys on Quasiconformal Space Mappings since the origin of the theory in 1960 and this collection provides in compact form access to a wide spectrum of recent results due to well-known specialists.
