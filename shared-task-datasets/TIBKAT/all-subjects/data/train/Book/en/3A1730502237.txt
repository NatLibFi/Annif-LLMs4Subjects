The suckling and weaned piglet
The last books discussing the neonatal or weaned pig were published over 15 years ago. This new book provides up to date information on the suckling and weaned piglet. It covers novel and important topics such as microbiota development in piglets and management of hyperprolific litters. It also discusses topics such as weaning age and its long term influence on piglet heath and performance. The developments of lean and fat tissues and of the intestinal immune system in young pigs are described in detail. Emphasis is put on well-being with chapters focussing on husbandry interventions in suckling piglets as well as consequences of the lactational environment on behavioural disturbances of pigs after weaning. The multiple stressors encountered at and post-weaning are also discussed. Updates on essential subjects such as neonatal mortality, creep feeding of suckling piglets, feeding strategies for weaned pigs, housing systems post-weaning and diseases of piglets are provided. The information covered in this book should be of great assistance to animal scientists, nutritionists, veterinarians and swine producers. They will be made aware of most recent knowledge that will assist in improving the performance and welfare of suckling and weaned piglets
