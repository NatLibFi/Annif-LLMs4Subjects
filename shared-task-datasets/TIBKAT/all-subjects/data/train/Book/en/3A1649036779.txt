Pediatric Endourology Techniques
This book comprehensively covers the practical aspects of the various endourological procedures in children. The interactive nature not only gives the theoretical aspects but, also, the technical aspects of the procedures involved to enable the surgeon to read and watch the procedure beforehand, including some helpful tips and tricks to make the procedure easier and safer. Audiovisual aids serve as a very useful adjunct to the training process. A ready reference manual, this book does not cover the theory of the underlying conditions (for which there are excellent textbooks). Aimed at all pediatric urology and pediatric surgery trainees and consultants across the board, it will also be of great benefit to the adult surgeons who occasionally deal with children.
