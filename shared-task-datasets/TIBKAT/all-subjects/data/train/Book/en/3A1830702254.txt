Nanosensors
"Recent advances have radically increased the sensitivity of nanomaterial-based biosensors, making it possible to detect one particular molecule against a background of billions of others. Focusing on the materials suitable for biosensor applications, such as nanoparticles, carbon based materials and nanotubes, this book will enable the reader to prepare the respective nanomaterials for use in actual devices by appropriate functionalization, surface processing or directed self-assembly. The emphasis throughout will be on electrochemical, optical and mechanical detection methods, leading to solutions for today's most challenging tasks. In addition to the academics and professionals addressed by the authors, the main readership group(s) will include the related in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) devices industries"--
