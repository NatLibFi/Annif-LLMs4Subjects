Quantum mechanics : detailed historical, mathematical and computational approaches
"This book brings historical perspective of quantum mechanics and quantum chemistry along with detailed mathematical support for the understanding of matrix mechanics, wave mechanics, quantum statistics and quantum chemistry. In order to enhance the learning experience, this book also includes the fundamentals of Fortran and numerical calculations to pave the way for the source codes of several problems of quantum mechanics and quantum chemistry. All these codes are available on the author's website. In addition, there are several proposed exercises and do-it-yourself activities. The main target audience are the students of Physics, Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, as also students and researchers of theoretical physics and chemistry"--
