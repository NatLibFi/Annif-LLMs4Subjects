Pyrethroids : exposure, applications and resistance
"Pyrethroids have been employed in crop fields all over the world. However, the use of this chemical class of insecticides raised concerns about environmental contamination and toxic effects on non-target species, including health issues on human population. Therefore, Pyrethroids: Exposure, Applications and Resistance presents recent literature about the biodegradation of pyrethroids with emphasis on studies performed in soil at fields and in controlled environments. The authors chapter briefly discus pyrethroid exposure, toxicity, effects and their applications in different fields. A detailed insight on microbial mediated transformation of pyrethroids is also provided. In closing, the current status of pyrethroid resistance in the dengue vector is reviewed, and the underlying biochemical and molecular mechanisms that may potentially play a role in the resistance are characterized. This knowledge may aid in understanding challenges in mosquito control"--
