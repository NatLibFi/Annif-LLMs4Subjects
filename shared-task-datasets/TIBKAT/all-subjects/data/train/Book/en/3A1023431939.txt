Industrial policy after the crisis : seizing the future
Industrial Policy after the Crisis provides a fresh and insightful study on the lessons that can be drawn from the global financial crisis for the analysis, definition and implementation of industrial policy. The authors utilize a political economy framework for the analysis of industrial development post-crisis, centred on the organisation of production and stressing its importance for the wealth of nations, meaning not only rising income but also ‘justice and happiness’.
