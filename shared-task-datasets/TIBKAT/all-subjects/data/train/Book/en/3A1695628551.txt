Green economy in the Western Balkans : towards a sustainable future
This multidisciplinary approach to the Western Balkans addresses topics from responsible business and ethics, innovation, corporate social responsibility, and new technology to human resources management. It is a theoretical and practical guide towards a sustainable future for the Western Balkans, showing drivers and barriers affecting the region in its effort to green its economy, and provides a systematic and holistic overview and critical examination of the situation in the region. Chapters explore a review of the literature and developing theory, and report empirical procedures. If the Western Balkan countries are following the industrialised states of Western Europe - which are now keen to develop in a sustainable manner, combining economic growth with social justice and improved environment - this work fills the growing need for more research and to expand the current knowledge base about environmental and development challenges, as well as the new, efficient and climate-neutral 'Green Economy' of this region.
