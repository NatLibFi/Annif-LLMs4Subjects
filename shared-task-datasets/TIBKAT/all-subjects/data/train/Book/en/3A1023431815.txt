This Handbook draws together top international researchers and discusses the state of the art and the future direction of research at the nexus between sport and business. It is heavily built upon choosing, applying and evaluating appropriate quantitative as well as qualitative research methods for practical advice in sport and business research. -- ‘Söderman and Dolles have assembled an impressive array of researchers to address the nexus between sport and business. In their rich collection of research on sport business theory and practice Söderman and Dolles identify research themes from governance to branding, from sport events to sport systems, and from social media to fan identity, and they specifically reflect on the application of major theoretical concepts and key research methods. The authors’ aim is to advance sport business research through critical reflection on topic selection, research design, data analysis and interpretation. Their unique approach encourages researchers, from novice to experienced, to embrace diverse theories and methods. The Handbook is recommended reading for those interested in advancing sport business research.’ (Graham Cuskelly, Griffith University, Australia)
