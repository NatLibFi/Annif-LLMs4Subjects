Handbook of research on strategy and foresight
pt. I. Probing the future : cultivating strategic foresight -- pt. II. Foresight and organizational becoming : strategy process, practice and change -- pt. III. Shaping the future : strategizing and innovation-- pt. IV. Responding to the future : intuition, inertia and strategic flexibility
Drawing together a collection of 29 original chapters, the Handbook makes an invaluable contribution to theory and practice by stimulating disciplined, rigorous and imaginative enquiry into the relationship between strategy and foresight. Leading scholars in the field of strategic management are brought together to offer innovative and multi-disciplinary perspectives on the past, present and future of strategy formation and foresight. In so doing, they challenge research in four key areas: strategy and foresight processes; strategy innovation for the future; understanding the future; and strategically responding to the future
