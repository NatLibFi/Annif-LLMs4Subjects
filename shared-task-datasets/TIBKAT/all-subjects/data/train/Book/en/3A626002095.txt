Transition to Responsible Fisheries : Economic and Policy Implications
If the fishing industry is to survive in the long term, more responsible practices and approaches need to be adopted. This involves not only the industryâ€™s own practices, but also public sector policies and in particular fisheries management approaches. This book identifies possible transition paths to responsible fisheries, assesses their consequences and provides policy recommendations on how to enhance prosperity in this sector.
