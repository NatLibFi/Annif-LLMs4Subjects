Crop systems biology : narrowing the gaps between crop modelling and genetics
"Crop systems biology is an interdisciplinary research approach, combining modern genetics and genomics, traditional physiology and biochemistry, and advanced bioinformatics and crop modelling. It is a rapidly developing field and this book is testimony to its dynamic evolution. The book provides examples of how gene regulatory and metabolic networks are included, in a spatially and temporally specific manner, in multi-scale crop modelling and how functional-structural plant modelling in combination with quantitative trait loci analysis is used to advance breedings for architectural traits."--
