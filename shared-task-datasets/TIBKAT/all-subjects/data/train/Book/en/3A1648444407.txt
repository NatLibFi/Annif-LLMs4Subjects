Nitroazoles: Synthesis, Structure and Applications
The monograph gives an exhaustive and systematic description of the methods of synthesis, application, structure and properties of nitroazoles perspective medicines, universal bases in peptide nucleic acids, agrochemicals, and components of high-energy materials. All five-membered nitroderivatives of azoles - pyrazoles, imidazoles, triazoles, tetrazoles, oxazoles, isoxazoles, oxadiazoles, thiazoles, isothiazoles, thiadiazoles, and their benzanalogs - indazoles, benzimidazoles, benzoxazoles, benzisoxazoles, benzoxadiazoles, benzothiazoles, benzoisothiazoles, benzothiadiazoles, benzotriazoles are discussed in the book. Special attention is paid to the nitroimidazole derivatives many of which are well-known drugs and hypoxic cell radiosensitizers (azomycine, metronidazole, misonidazole, tinidazole, dimetridazole, ipronidazole, carnidazole and etc). The critical evaluation of a large body of the information on nitroazoles investigations by physicochemical methods (NMR, NQR, ESR, UV, IR- specrtoscopy, X-ray, mass-spectrometry, polarography, dipole moments and others methods) is presented here.
This volume is devoted to the synthesis, application, structure, and physicochemical properties of nitroazoles (five-membered aromatic compounds). The book is unique in providing the first comprehensive treatment of nitroazoles.
