Challenges and goals for accelerators in the XXI century
Motivation for particle accelerator development -- Energy revolution: from static fields to cavity resonators -- The world's first colliders: Adone, VEP -- Lepton colliders and the Zoo of elementary particles in the 70s: PETRA, SPEAR, PEP -- The LEP e+ e- ring at the energy frontier of circular lepton colliders -- SLAC: the highest energy linear collider -- B-factories -- The Cosmotron ('53) and the Bevatron ('54): the first GeV -- The PS ('59) and AGS ('60): first strong focusing proton synchrotrons -- ISR: the world's first proton collider (appr. '65; 1st collisions '71) -- The SPS ('76): the first proton-antiproton collider; stochastic cooling; discovery of neutral currents and the W and Z bosons -- The antiproton accumulator and collector rings and the discovery of the W&Z intermediate bosons -- Fermilab antiproton sourcem recycler ring and main injector -- Production of antiprotons at CERN and the unique rf manipulations in the PSB & PS -- Tevatron: the world's first fully superconducting collider; discovery of the Top and Bottom quark -- Neutrino production and spallation sources: Kamiokande (cosmic rays), NuMi and MINOS (FERMILAB) - Soudan mine); n-TOF and NA64 at SPS; ISIS (Rutherford Laboratory) -- HERA: the world's first and only proton electron collider -- Circular light sources -- XFEL light sources -- SSC; ISABELLE ('78 groundbreaking)-> CBA ('81) -> cancelled ('83) -- GSI: heavy ion facility -- ISOLDE and Rex: a rare isotope facility -- LEAR and AD antiproton facilities: production of anti-Hydrogen -- B-factories: the luminosity frontier: KEK-B upgrade projects -- RHIC: the first dedicated heavy ion collider; bunched beam cooling for ions -- The LHC project: the energy frontier of high energy particle physics -- The LHC ion program -- The LHC upgrade plans: increasing the performance of the LHC -- The LHC injector complex upgrade: existing challenges and upgrade plans -- HE-LHC: the quest for increasing the energy of the LHC -- Electron-ion collider eRHIC (coherent electron cooling, energy recovery linac) -- LHeC: the option of a TeV scale Lepton Hadron collider using the LHC infrastructure -- ILC and CLIC: design of a high energy lepton collider -- Circular lepton colliders as an option for a Higgs factory: the highest energy circular lepton collider -- HIE ISOLDE -- FAIR project at GSI -- ELENA anti proton facility -- CNGS: Neutrino appearance physics -- European Spallation Source -- Neutrino factory proton driver and target design -- The quest for power: high power proton drivers in the XXI century -- Plasma acceleration -- Energy recovery linacs -- FFAGS: front end for neutrino factories and medical accelerators -- Fast cooling and Muon acceleration and the prospect of Muon colliders -- HITGSI: SIS a medical treatment facility -- Medaustron: the Austrian cancer treatment facility -- Industrial projects (Siemens in Kiel and Marburg, IBA) -- Other options for Hadron treatment facilities (e.g. LEIR at CERN etc)
