Materials and design : the art and science of material selection in product design
"This book explores the role of materials and manufacturing in product design. We have placed particular emphasis on how the materiality of an object (what it is made of and how it is made) can be manipulated to create aesthetics and functionality of a product. We are equally concerned with issues related to feasibility of production and the sustainability of a system. The methods presented here are supported by some 100 profiles of materials and manufacturing processes, emphasizing the attributes most relevant for product design."--Jacket
Materials are the stuff of design. From the very beginning of human history, materials have been taken from the natural world and shaped, modified, and adapted for everything from primitive tools to modern electronics. This renowned book by noted materials engineering author Mike Ashby and Industrial designer, Kara Johnson, explores the role of materials and materials processing in product design, with a particular emphasis on creating both desired aesthetics and functionality. The new edition will feature even more of the highly useful "materials profiles," that give critical design, processing, performance and applications criteria for each material in question. The reader will find information ranging from the generic and commercial names of each material, its physical and mechanical properties, its chemical properties, its common uses, how it is typically made and processed, and even its average price. And with improved photographs and drawings, the reader will be taken even more closely to the way real design is done by real designers, selecting the optimum materials for a successful product. * The best guide ever published on the on the role of materials, past and present, in product development, by noted materials authority Mike Ashby and professional designer Kara Johnson--now with even better photos and drawings on the Design Process * Significant new section on the use of re-cycled materials in products, and the importance of sustainable design for manufactured goods and services * Enhanced materials profiles, with addition of new materials types like nanomaterials, advanced plastics and bio-based materials
