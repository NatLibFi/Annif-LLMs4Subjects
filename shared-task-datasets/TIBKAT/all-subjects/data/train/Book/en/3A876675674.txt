Optical Bit Error Rate: An Estimation Methodology provides an analytical methodology to the estimation of bit error rate of optical digital signals. This presents an extremely important subject in the design of optical communications systems and networks, yet previous to the publication of this book the topic had not been covered holistically. The text lays out an easy-to-understand analytical approach to a highly important and complex subject: bit error rate (BER) estimation of a transmitted signal with a focus on optical transmission. It includes coverage of such important topics as impairments on DWDM optical signals, causes of signal distortion, and identification and estimation of the signal quality by statistical estimation of the bit error rate. The book includes numerous illustrations and examples to make a difficult topic easy to understand. This edition includes a CD-ROM with run-time simulations from a vendor that provides commercial software for the industry
