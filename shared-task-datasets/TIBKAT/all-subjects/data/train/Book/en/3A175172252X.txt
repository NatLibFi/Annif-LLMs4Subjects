The Cambridge Companion to Margaret Atwood
The field of Margaret Atwood studies, like her own work, is in constant evolution. This second edition of The Cambridge Companion to Margaret Atwood provides substantial reconceptualization of Atwood's writing in multiple genres that has spanned six decades, with particular focus on developments since 2000. Exploring Atwood in our contemporary context, this edition discusses the relationship between her Canadian identity and her role as an international literary celebrity and spokesperson on global issues, ranging from environmentalism to women's rights to digital technology. As well as providing novel insights into Atwood's recent dystopias and classic texts, this edition highlights a significant dimension in the reception of Atwood's work, with new material on the striking Hulu and MGM television adaptation of The Handmaid's Tale. This up-to-date volume illuminates new directions in Atwood's career, and introduces students, scholars and general readers alike to the ever-expanding dimensions of her literary art
