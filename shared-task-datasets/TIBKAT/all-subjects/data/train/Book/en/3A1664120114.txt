The new architecture of wine : 25 spectacular California wineries
"Heather Hebert features the stories and stunning architecture of 25 California wineries, all built within the last ten years. Together, these wineries form an authentic expression of the winemakers' passion for the land and its heritage. They are an homage to California. Over the past twenty years, the California wine industry and its architecture transformed. As wine tourism has increased, California vintners have embraced the call to create splendid spaces where tourists and wine club members can taste their unique varieties and enjoy time and conversation about wine. In place of imitating old-world European estates, grand architectural statements or quirky forays into bohemianism, the new architecture of wine has evolved into a celebration of California's topography, agricultural heritage, historic architectural vernacular, and forward-thinking passion for sustainability and design."--Provided by the publisher
