"Volume 4: Degradation of Pesticides and Polychlorinated Biphenyls addresses pesticide degradation, PCBs degradation, and genetic interventions. It begins by describing environment pesticide degradation, mechanisms and sustainability, microbes and microbial enzymes, plant microbe interactions, organophosphorus degradations and endosulfan degradation. It then goes on to discuss PCBs and degradation, cypermethrin, degradation by Phanerochaete chrysosporium, carvone and surfactants for degradation of PCBs. The book also advocates for genetic systems for degradation of PCBs and pesticides, with discussion of the different advantages and disadvantages for each strategy and the various techniques"--
