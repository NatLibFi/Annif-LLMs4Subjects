Monetary policy and central banking : new directions in post-Keynesian theory
Has the economic and financial crisis changed the way we conduct monetary policy? Is quantitative easing consistent with the endogeneity of money? These are but two of the questions this new book explores. The various contributors offer interesting and new perspectives on the conduct of monetary policy during the crisis, and provide sharp criticism of central bank policies in the US and Europe. -- Divided into two parts, this book presents a detailed, multi-faceted analysis of banking and monetary policy. The first part examines the role of central banks within an endogenous money framework. These chapters address post-Keynesian interest rate policy, monetary mercantilism, financial market organization and developing economies. In the second part of the book, the focus switches to the analysis of the financial crisis that began in 2007. The chapters in this section discuss the role of central banks in times of crisis.
