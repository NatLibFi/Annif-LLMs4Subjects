Broadband microstrip antennas
Microstrip antennas are lightweight and small volume, can be made conformal to the host surface, and are manufactured using printed- circuit technology so can be mass produced at low cost, but alas, say Kumar and Ray (Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay) their use has been restricted by their inherently narrow bandwidth. Over the past few decades, however, reports have surfaced of broadband configurations, and they detail the most promising, compiling material from scattered journals, conference proceedings, and books. They explain concepts of several techniques, and describe examples without bogging down in mathematical detail. Annotation copyrighted by Book News, Inc., Portland, OR
