Immune response and the eye : in memory of J. Wayne Streilein, the pioneer in ocular immunology
The second edition of Immune ‘Response and the Eye’ highlights recent insights into the ‘dangerous compromise’ between the immune system and the eye, which protects the eye against pathogens while limiting inflammation and immune-mediated injury to ocular tissues with little or no regenerative potential. It discusses the broad spectrum of physiological, immunological, anatomical, and biochemical adaptations that conspire to closely regulate the tone and tenor of immune responses in the eye. This volume further describes immune-mediated diseases that occur when the compromise between the immune system and the eye is breached. This breakdown in immune privilege threatens the vision of millions each year. Finally, recent advances in ocular immunology are presented, which offer potential therapeutic applications in corneal and retinal transplantation and in the management of blinding autoimmune diseases of the eye.Eye researchers, ophthalmologists and immunologists will appreciate the state-of-the-art and authoritative information presented in ‘Immune Response and the Eye’
