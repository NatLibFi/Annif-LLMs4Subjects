Methods in Statistical Mechanics : A Modern View
An Introduction to Statistical Mechanics -- The Role of Dynamics in Statistical Mechanics -- Operator Representations of Statistical Mechanics -- Path Integrals and Applications -- The Liouville Equation.-Canonical Distributions and Thermodynamic Functions -- The Statistical Mechanics of Unstable Quantum States.
This book presents a variety of techniques for tackling phenomena that are not amenable to the conventional approach based on the concept of probabilities. The methods described rely on the use of path integration, thermal Green functions, time-temperature propagators, Liouville operators, second quantization, and field correlators at finite density and temperature. Also exploring the statistical mechanics of unstable quantum systems, the book is intended as a supplementary or reference text for use in one-semester graduate courses on Quantum Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Electromagnetism, and Mathematical Methods in Physics. .
