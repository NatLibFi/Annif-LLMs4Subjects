SDG5 gender equality and empowerment of women and girls
Conventional development planning lacks sensitivity to the female experience. Tackling gendered discrimination and the exclusion of women, SDG5 aims to 'achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.' This book considers the current state of play and identifies the trends, drivers and impact of gender equality. Taking a comprehensive and global approach, the book addresses the multifaceted concerns of women within the overall paradigm of the post-2015 development agenda. The authors analyse the patterns of gender inequality in different socioeconomic regions across developing, middle income and developed countries. The book will examine how the gap between policy and implementation might be tackled and contemplate how effective policy action might provide a solution. Offering best practice and posing key challenges for achieving the goal, this is the only book which comprehensively deals with all the key aspects of SDG5 based on the latest credible research."Concise Guides to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals" comprises 17 short books, each examining one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
