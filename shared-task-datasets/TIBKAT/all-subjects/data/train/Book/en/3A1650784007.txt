This volume includes studies of organizations that deliver professional services, including accounting, law, and management consulting firms. These organizations are of importance for several reasons: they underpin the modern economy, enabling economic exchange; they constitute the 'intellect industry', developing and disseminating new ideas; and, they are exemplars of knowledge-intensive organizations. Contributors include researchers from North America and Europe. This book series is available electronically online
