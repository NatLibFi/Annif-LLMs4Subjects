Ultrasound has found an increasing number of applications in recent years due to greatly increased computing power. Ultrasound devices are often preferred over other devices because of their lower cost, portability, and non-invasive nature. Patients using ultrasound can avoid the dangers of radiological imaging devices such as x-rays, CT scans, and radioactive media injections. Ultrasound is also a preferred and practical method of detecting material fatique and defects in metals, composites, semiconductors, wood, etc. Detailed appendices contain useful formulas and their derivations, technical details of relevant theories The FAQ format is used where a concept in one answer leads to a new Q & A
