Advances in Electromagnetic Fields in Living Systems
The mechanisms of interaction for fields at low frequencies are very different from those at high frequencies. The interaction of electromagnetic fields and waves with biological systems is frequency-dependent. This work is part of the "Advances in Electromagnetic Fields in Living Systems" series
