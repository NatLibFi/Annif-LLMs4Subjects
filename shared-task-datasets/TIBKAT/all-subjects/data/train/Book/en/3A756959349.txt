What every engineer should know about cyber security and digital forensics
"This book offers the non-security professional an introduction to the security risks involved when using technology and discusses how to mitigate the risk of security incidents. The book introduces the information security topics every engineer should understand if they use a computer or any mobile device that is connected to the Internet. Most engineers work at employers that want their data secure, but not every employer invests in training their engineers in understanding the risk. It is a well-known fact that the weakest link in any secure system is not the system--it is the user. Just ask any hacker. Topics include network security, personal data security, cloud computing, mobile computing, preparing for an incident, incident response, evidence handling, Internet usage, and security certifications. The book also discusses cyber-physical systems such as the smart electric grid, smart transportation, and advanced manufacturing to demonstrate the impact of security on different engineering disciplines. In addition, the book covers the application of the concepts, presented via short case studies of real-world incidents throughout, chronologically delineating related events. It also provides information on certifications and reference manuals in the area of information security and digital forensics"--
