Handbook of machinery dynamics
Containing details on basic theories and particular problems, the Handbook of Machinery Dynamics reviews machine design for selecting the most appropriate energy transfer mechanisms elaborates on vibration operations, from the frictionless spring-mass system and systems with multiple degrees of freedom to translational and rotational systems develops and numerically illustrates rotordynamic expressions relating to spin speed, as well as whirl magnitude, speed, mode, and ratio examines fluid-structure interactions and ways to prevent structural damage through fluid machinery stall or cavitation calculates dynamic responses of machine tool and workpiece systems and analyzes the machine tool-cutting process as a nonlinear dynamic system offers forecasting methods for natural frequencies and mode shapes of blade-disk assemblies, and axial thrust loads on turbomachine bearings addresses damage control, maintenance requirements, and troubleshooting techniques for ensuring reliable machinery performance
