Key technologies of metro construction in hard rock stratum
"This book is a comprehensive and objective study of the theory and construction methods of metro construction in hard rock stratum. It is based on the construction of the Qingdao metro and provides key techniques for metro construction in hard rock stratum in a systematic manner. Detailed data, accurate charts and pictures are provided to guide future metro construction in hard rock stratum in China. Divided into six chapters, Key Technologies of Metro Construction in Hard Rock Stratum covers various construction technologies in hard rock stratum including (1) drilling and blasting construction technology, (2) open-cut station construction technology, (3) subsurface excavated station construction technology, (4) grouting reinforcement technology in adverse geological section, and (5) standardized metro construction technology. It can be used as reference for design, construction, monitoring or supervision staff as well as teachers and students engaged in metro and underground construction to facilitate exchange of ideas"--
Brief introduction -- Drilling-blasting tunnel construction technology in hard rock stratum -- Open-cut station construction technology -- Subsurface excavated station construction technology -- Grouting reinforcement technology of poor geological section -- Green construction and standardized site construction.
