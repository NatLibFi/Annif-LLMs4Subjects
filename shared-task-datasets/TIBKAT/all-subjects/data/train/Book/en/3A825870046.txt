Flight dynamic principles : a linear systems approach to aircraft stability and control
The study of flight dynamics requires a thorough understanding of the theory of the stability and control of aircraft, an appreciation of flight control systems and a comprehensive grounding in the theory of automatic control. Flight Dynamics provides all three in an accessible and student focussed text. Written for those coming to the subject for the first time the book is suitable as a complete first course text. It provides a secure foundation from which to move on to more advanced topics such a non-linear flight dynamics, simulation and advanced flight control, and is ideal for those on course including flight mechanics, aircraft handling qualities, aircraft stability and control. Enhances by detailed worked examples, case studies and aircraft operating condition software, this complete course text, by a renowned flight dynamicist, is widely used on aircraft engineering courses *Broad coverage of this broad topic - ideal for study and professional use *Covers key contemporary topics including all aspects of optimisation, emissions, regulation *End of chapter exercises, Instructor's Manual, accompanying modelling code for performance model generation and optimisation solution
