Tiny houses
"This book showcases inspirational small houses with unique character and style from all around the world. At the forefront of modern architecture, tiny houses exemplify today’s ideals of minimalism, personal freedom, and low-impact construction—not to mention impeccable style and comfort. In multi-page spreads this book features highly detailed, full-color interior and exterior shots, along with informative texts that explore the inspiration and context of each home. From off-the grid woodland dwellings that take you away from it all to highdensity solutions to the urban housing crisis, these homes pack a lot of design ingenuity into their small spaces. While some of these structures feature state-of-the-art architectural flourishes and luxurious amenities, others are modest and environmentally sustainable retreats designed specifically for travel, creative pursuits, or affordable housing. Each of these homes offers endlessly innovative inspiration for building and living in your home, in spaces that fit your needs." --
