Sleep science : integrating basic research and clinical practice
This book is published at a time when more and more advances are being made to bridge the gap between basic and clinical neuroscience. It is primarily intended for scientists and clinicians intent on linking the neurobiology of sleep with its associated disorders. Topics were selected that illustrate how contemporary research is being translated into clinical insights and therapies. The contributed chapters were written by scientists actively working at the interface between basic and applied sleep science, with subjects ranging from the mechanisms of intracellular signal transduction to the effects of ambient geophysical cycles. Essays include the physiologic regulation of sleep and its homeostatic collapse, the underlying neural and chemical circuitry, and the biological basis for new therapies using melatonin and environmental light
