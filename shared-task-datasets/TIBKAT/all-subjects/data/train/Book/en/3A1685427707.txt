Titanate and titania nanotubes : Synthesis, properties and applications
A unique compilation of data from a wide range of chemical and spectroscopic instrumentation and their integration into nanostructure characterisation, This exciting new book is a unique compilation of data from a wide range of chemical and spectroscopic instrumentation and the integration of nanostructure characterisation drawn from physical, chemical, electrochemical, spectroscopic and electron microscopic measurements. It fills a gap in the current nanomaterials literature by documenting the latest research from scientific journals and patent literature to provide a concise yet balanced and integrated treatment of an interesting topic: titanium oxide nanostructures within the emerging fashionable area of nanomaterials. Of particular interest are the following key chapters: *  Modification and Coating Techniques - provides a unique summary and discussion of available techniques to coat surfaces with nanostructured materials *  Chemical Properties - relates structure to surface chemistry and hence applications *  Structural and Physical Properties - reviews the relationship between nanostructure and physical properties providing a basis for the rationalisation of applications The book, a valuable reference point, is aimed at professionals, postgraduates and industrial research workers in nanomaterials.  Readers will gain a knowledge of the methods for synthesising nanomaterials as well as an understanding of their structure and resulting physical characteristics and a knowledge of their (existing and potential) applications
