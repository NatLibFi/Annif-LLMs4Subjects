The traveling salesman problem : optimization with the attractor-based search system
This book presents a new search paradigm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The intrinsic difficulty of the TSP is associated with the combinatorial explosion of potential solutions in the solution space. The author introduces the idea of using the attractor concept in dynamical systems theory to reduce the search space for exhaustive search for the TSP. Numerous examples are used to describe how to use this new search algorithm to solve the TSP and its variants including: multi-objective TSP, dynamic TSP, and probabilistic TSP. This book is intended for readers in the field of optimization research and application.
