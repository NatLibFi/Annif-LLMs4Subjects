Gender in history : global perspectives
"The title of this book would have made little sense to me when I chose to be a history major nearly five decades ago. I might perhaps have thought it an analysis of linguistic developments, as gender was something I considered (and bemoaned) largely when learning German nouns. The women's movement changed that, as it changed so much else. The feminist movement that began in the 1960s - often termed the "second wave" to set it apart from the "first wave" of feminism that began in the nineteenth century - included a wide range of political beliefs, with various groups working for a broad spectrum of goals, one of which was to understand more about the lives of women in the past. This paralleled a similar rise of interest in women's history that accompanied the first wave of feminism. Women's and Gender History Advocates of women's rights in the present, myself included, looked at what we had been taught about the past - as well as what we had been taught about literature, psychology, religion, biology, and most other disciplines - and realized we were only hearing half the story. Most of the studies we read or heard described the male experience - "man the artist," "man the hunter," "man and his environment" - though they often portrayed it as universal. We began to investigate the lives of women in the past, asserting that any investigation of past power relationships had to include discussion of patriarchy, that predominant social system in which men have more power and access to resources than women of the same group, and in which some men are privileged over other men and some women over other women"--
