Analytical food microbiology : a laboratory manual
"Food microbiology is the study of the microorganisms which inhabit, create or contaminate food. Of major importance is the study of microorganisms causing food spoilage. Food safety is a major focus of food microbiology, although "good" bacteria such as probiotics are becoming increasingly important in food science. This new edition bridges the gap between its predecessor, which emphasized conventional methods, and subsequent advances in analytical methodologies. Researchers and analysts strive to keep up with advances in microbiological methods. Although many techniques appear regularly in scientific literature, only a few of these are used routinely by analysts and even fewer are useable in teaching laboratories. In the time since the publication of the first edition, the authors of this book have screened many new published analytical methods for suitability as laboratory exercises. The new edition not only implements new and advanced analytical methods, but also improves currently used techniques. Since publication of the first edition, new selective and highly differential media have become available commercially. Some of the previous laboratory exercises included rapid detection kits that are no longer available from the manufacturer. Basic concepts have been modified to better reflect emerging food safety concerns. In the new laboratory manual, these issues are addressed in a creative manner"--
