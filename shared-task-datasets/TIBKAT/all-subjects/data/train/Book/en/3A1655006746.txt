Computer Algebra Recipes for Classical Mechanics
Hundreds of novel and innovative computer algebra "recipes" will enable readers starting at the second year undergraduate level to easily and rapidly solve and explore most problems they encounter in their classical mechanics studies. Using the powerful computer algebra system MAPLE (Release 8) - no prior knowledge of MAPLE is presumed - the relevant command structures are explained on a need-to-know basis as the recipes are developed. This new problem-solving guide can serve in the classroom or for self-study, for reference, or as a text for an on-line course
