Britain, Europe and EMU
This book shows how the transformation of Britain's economic performance has been based on control of public expenditure, improving competitiveness, co-operative industrial relations and a large favourable contribution from inward investment. In contrast, Europe has suffered from rising unemployment, while misguided trade policies have obstructed the exploitation of the IT revolution. Europe's failures will undermine the EMU project. Britain will do well to keep clear. The book concludes with chapters on the modern relevance of Locke on inflation, Ricardo on public debt and Condillac on the creation of competitive market economies
