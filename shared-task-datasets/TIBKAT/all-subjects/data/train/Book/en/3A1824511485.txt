Bridging time
Since 1890, the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp has been home to a rich collection spanning over seven centuries of art history; from the Flemish Primitives to Expressionists. More recently, the Museum has been enriched by another treasure by the Dutch architectural firm KAAN Architecten. Their restoration work and new design combine a contemporary allure with the glorious but somewhat neglected beauty of the 19th-century landmark. Completely concealed within the existing museum, the new extension underlines the strength of the original building and its role as heritage within the rapidly changing city. These contrasting yet dialoguing spaces coexist as two different worlds in one building. The renovation and extension bring together the past, the present and the future in a layered ensemble of time, architecture, history and art.00This publication documents the result of an extensive renovation, richly illustrated with original drawings, archive material and unique images of the new KMSKA
