MuPAD Pro Computing Essentials
This is a book about using MuPAD in teaching undergraduate mathematics and solving undergraduate mathematics problems with MuPAD. The author explains basic principles of MuPAD commands and how to write simple programs or to develop interactive environments for teaching mathematics. The text gives a large number of useful examples from different areas of undergraduate mathematics developed by the author during his long teaching experience. All the book examples are published on the book website. Flash, SVG and JVX formats are used to display interactive and animated graphics. In addition, a great deal of supplementary material about MuPAD is available through the MathPAD Online website (www.mathpad.org), for which the bookâ€™s author is also the editor-in-chief. The second edition of this book has been completely rewritten to cover many new features of MuPAD. The large section covering mathematical graphics and animation is especially noteworthy. All the MuPAD code has been revised and tested with the use of MuPAD 3.0
