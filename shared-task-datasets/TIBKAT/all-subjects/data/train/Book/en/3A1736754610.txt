The Riesz transform of codimension smaller than one and the Wolff energy
"Fix d [greater than or equal to] 2, and s [epsilon] (d - 1, d). We characterize the non-negative locally finite non-atomic Borel measures [mu] in Rd for which the associated s-Riesz transform is bounded in L²([mu]) in terms of the Wolff energy. This extends the range of s in which the Mateu-Prat-Verdera characterization of measures with bounded s-Riesz transform is known. As an application, we give a metric characterization of the removable sets for locally Lipschitz continuous solutions of the fractional Laplacian operator (-[delta])[infinity]/2, [infinity] [epsilon] (1, 2), in terms of a well-known capacity from non-linear potential theory. This result contrasts sharply with removability results for Lipschitz harmonic functions"--
