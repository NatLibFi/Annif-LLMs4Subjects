Liposuction : Principles and Practice
The contributors to this book have spent time and effort presenting the cosmetic and plastic surgeon with information on the techniques and uses of liposuction for cosmetic and non-cosmetic surgery purposes. This constitutes the first book on cosmetic and non-cosmetic liposuction. It provides a how-to-do manual for all procedures of cosmetic and non-cosmetic liposuction and is abundantly illustrated. Although new technology helps improve results, it is experience, care, and skill of the cosmetic surgeon that is necessary to obtain optimal results that satisfy the patient.
Liposuction began as a contouring procedure but has evolved into the treatment of obese patients, gynecomastia, ptosis, macromastia, and even patients who have complications from heart disease or diabetes. Other disorders such as axillary sweat hypersecretion, lipomas, and angiomas are also potential disorders that may be treated with liposuction. Physicians performing liposuction must be adequately trained and experienced in the potential and actual complications before attempting to perform liposuction. Patient safety is the most important aspect of all surgeries, but especially of cosmetic surgery, which is an elective procedure. New technology helps improve results but experience, care, and skill of the cosmetic surgeon is necessary to obtain optimal results that satisfy the patient. The contributors to this book have spent time and effort presenting the cosmetic and plastic surgeon as much information as possible on the techniques and uses of liposuction for cosmetic and non-cosmetic surgery purposes.
