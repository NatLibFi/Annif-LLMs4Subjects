Pattern Recognition : An Algorithmic Approach
Observing the environment and recognising patterns for the purpose of decision making is fundamental to human nature. This book deals with the scientific discipline that enables similar perception in machines through pattern recognition (PR), which has application in diverse technology areas. This book is an exposition of principal topics in PR using an algorithmic approach. It provides a thorough introduction to the concepts of PR and a systematic account of the major topics in PR besides reviewing the vast progress made in the field in recent times. It includes basic techniques of PR, neural networks, support vector machines and decision trees. While theoretical aspects have been given due coverage, the emphasis is more on the practical. The book is replete with examples and illustrations and includes chapter-end exercises. It is designed to meet the needs of senior undergraduate and postgraduate students of computer science and allied disciplines.  Dr. M. Narasimha Murty is a professor in the Department of Computer Science and Automation at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. Dr. V. Susheela Devi is a senior scientific officer in the Department of Computer Science and Automation at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.
