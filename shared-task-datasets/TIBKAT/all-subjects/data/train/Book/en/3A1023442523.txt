Narcissism in the workplace : research, opinion and practice
Possessing a positive self-attitude, being self-confident, and having high self-esteem are worthwhile attributes in both work and personal life; some take these positive attributes to the extreme and become self-absorbed, self-adoring, self-centered, and show little empathy for the problems and concerns of others.
