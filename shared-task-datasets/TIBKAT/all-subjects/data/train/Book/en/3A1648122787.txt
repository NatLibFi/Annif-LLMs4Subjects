Foreign Direct Investment in China : Challenges and Prospects for Regional Development
This book provides a selection of papers presented at the Foreign Direct Investment in China’s Regional Development Conference, organised in Xian on 11-12 October 2001 at the request of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation. The book reviews regional patterns of FDI inflows in China, investment requirements, opportunities in and comparative advantages of China’s regions, and details the types of FDI sought for the Chinese hinterland. It offers business perspectives with regard to what needs to be done. Lessons learned from experiences in Canada, Turkey, Germany and Brazil are discussed, with a particular focus on investment promotion and linkages with local enterprise development. The book concludes with policy messages relevant not only to China but also to other countries striving to improve conditions for investment in their less-developed regions.
