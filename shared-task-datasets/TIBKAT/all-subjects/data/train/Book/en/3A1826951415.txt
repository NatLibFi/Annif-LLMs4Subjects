Barry's advanced construction of buildings
"Robin Barry's Construction of Buildings was first published in 1958 as a 5 volume set and rapidly became a standard work on the subject. Following Barry's death in 2002 a two volume format was adopted with new authors. Barry's Advanced Construction of Buildings retains the emphasis on larger scale buildings: primarily residential, commercial and industrial buildings constructed with load bearing frames. The text will be brought fully up to date, and will continue to explain construction technology through key functional and performance requirements for the main elements common to all buildings. With increased focus on low carbon, resilient buildings, the book will pay particular attention to the decisions required to ensure the built environment is as sustainable as possible, and the consequences of those decisions. With new in chapter' questions to better facilitate self-reflection and learning, the book will be in ideal companion and follow on to the fifth edition of Barry's Introduction to Construction of Buildings"--
