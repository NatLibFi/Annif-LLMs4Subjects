Handbuch der deutschen Grammatik
"This handbook is a modern, readable academic grammar that serves as a good foundation for teachers and learners alike, as a reference volume in moments of doubt and as a guide to understanding modern approaches to grammar. It works with the concepts of conventional grammar, but also explains differing concepts from current models. The fifth edition has been renewed once again and brought up to date to reflect current research."--Publisher's website
