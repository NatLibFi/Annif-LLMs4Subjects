Amos Rex Art Museum
Since its opening, the Amos Rex Art Museum, designed by JKMM architects, has been a great public and architectural success. It is tucked away underground in the ancient glass palace in the heart of central Helsinki.00Through its architecture, it sets new boundaries for what a museum can and should be. With its huge arched exhibition halls and eye-catching lanterns that make it feel as though it is above ground, the building never fails to surprise.00Art museums seldom manage to be fully functional for all types of art, new and old, and at the same time deliver an architecturally strong experience that changes the city.0But here, everything is in place, states Lars Nittve in one of the book?s essays. In this book, a close-up of the museum is drawn in words, sketches, and pictures
