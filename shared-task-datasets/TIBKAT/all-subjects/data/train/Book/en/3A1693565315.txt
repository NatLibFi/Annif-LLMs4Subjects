Solid state chemistry : an introduction
"Building a foundation with a thorough description of crystalline structures, this fifth edition of Solid State Chemistry: An Introduction presents a wide range of the synthetic and physical techniques used to prepare and characterize solids. Going beyond this, this largely nonmathematical introduction to solid state chemistry includes the bonding and electronic, magnetic, electrical and optical properties of solids. Solids of particular interest - porous solids, superconductors and nanostructures are included. Practical examples of applications and modern developments are given. It offers students the opportunity to apply their knowledge in real-life situations and serve them well throughout their degree course"--
