The politicisation of social Europe : conflict dynamics and welfare integration
"Preface by Anton Hemerijck, Professor of Political Science and Sociology, European University Institute, Florence, Italy While for some scholars the Euro crisis dashed the dream of Social Europe, this thought-provoking book proposes a more nuanced assessment, challenging the notion of austerity as the only way forward. Tracing the evolution of the political debate on European social integration and its interplay with the European economic governance after the Euro crisis, it sheds light on the conflict dynamics and political conditions that enabled the progressive shift away from the initial post-crisis EU 'conservative reflex', towards a new European holding environment for flourishing welfare states. This timely book provides a detailed reconstruction of the European social agenda after the Great Recession, touching upon budgetary, legislative and coordinative policies and including an in-depth analysis of the EU response to the Covid-19 crisis. Utilising innovative approaches and methodology, Francesco Corti identifies four lines of functional and territorial conflict which characterise the debate on EU social integration. An original focus on the role of the European Parliament in fostering further social integration gives the book an original and insightful perspective. The Politicisation of Social Europe will be a key resource for students and scholars of European politics, political sociology and welfare states, as well as EU officials and policy makers seeking to identify strategies that can facilitate them in pursuing a successful social agenda"--
