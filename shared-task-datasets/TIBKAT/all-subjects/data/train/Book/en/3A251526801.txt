A cognitive psychology of mass communication
Klappentext: With this third edition of "A Cognitive Psychology of Mass Communication", author Richard Jackson Harris continues his examination of how our experiences with media affect the way we acquire knowledge about the world, and how this knowledge creates consequences for attitudes and behavior. Presenting theories from psychology and communication along with reviews of the corresponding research, this text covers a wide variety of media and media issues, ranging from the commonly discussed topics - sex, violence, advertising - to less-studied topics, such as values, sports, and entertainment education.
