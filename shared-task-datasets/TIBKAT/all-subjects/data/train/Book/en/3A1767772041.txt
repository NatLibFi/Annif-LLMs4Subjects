Theory and design of fermentation processes
"The book covers the kinetics and design of fermentation processes, defined in the broader sense as any industrial processes that use living microorganisms or cells, both under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. It starts with concise introduction to microbes and their metabolism, followed by rate equations, stoichiometry, derivation and use of mass balances for the design processes. It covers oxygen transfer and mass balances, heat transfer, and design and scale-up/sale-down of fermentation processes. It further includes industrially relevant process examples, over hundred solved examples, questions and problems, and solution of differential equations and systems of equations in Excel. Features: Uses chemical engineering principles for the study of fermentation processes. Provides detailed coverage of stoichiometry and kinetics of fermentation processes. Discusses pertinent oxygen transfer theory and its applications. Concisely covers microorganisms' biochemistry and metabolism. Includes solved examples and problems with solutions manual. This book is designed as a textbook for undergraduate students in chemical engineering, however it is also suitable for postgraduate students and for process engineers interested in these topics"--
