A primer on machine learning applications in civil engineering
"Machine Learning has undergone rapid growth in diversification and practicality, and repertoire of these techniques has evolved and expanded. The aim of this book is to provide a broad overview of the available machine learning techniques which can be utilized for solving civil engineering problems. Fundamentals of both theoretical and practical aspects are discussed in the domains of Water Resources/Hydrological Modelling, Geotechnical Engineering, Construction Engineering and Management, Coastal/Marine Engineering. Complex civil engineering problems such as drought forecasting, river flow forecasting, precipitation forecasting, and significant wave height forecasting are included"--
