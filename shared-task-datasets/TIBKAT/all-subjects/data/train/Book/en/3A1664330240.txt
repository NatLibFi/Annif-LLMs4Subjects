Utopia and the contemporary British novel
"This book explores the narrative treatment of time from a philosophical perspective. I will be concerned with how the experience of lived time, or temporality, functions in a specific set of British novels to reveal the persistence of the utopian imagination in the twenty-first century. Central to this book is the assertion that utopian expression not only persists within the twenty-first-century novel, but is shaping an emerging body of fictions whose shared interrogation of lived and historical time reveals a series of radically nonlinear, disjunct, pluralised and alternative temporal constructions. The writers I have selected for inclusion within this study represent a renaissance of British literary talent in the contemporary period that cuts across different generations." --
