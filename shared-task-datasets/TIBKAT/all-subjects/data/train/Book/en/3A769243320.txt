Medical imaging : technology and applications
"Preface The field of medical imaging is particularly diverse, incorporating fields such as mechanical and electrical engineering, physics, mathematics, computer science, and, of course, medicine. Knowledge in all these fields has come together with a sole purpose: to improve patient health through noninvasive imaging"--
"The book has two intentions. First, it assembles the latest research in the field of medical imaging technology in one place. Detailed descriptions of current state-of-the-art medical imaging systems (comprised of x-ray CT, MRI, ultrasound, and nuclear medicine) and data processing techniques are discussed. Information is provided that will give interested engineers and scientists a solid foundation from which to build with additional resources. Secondly, it exposes the reader to myriad applications that medical imaging technology has enabled"--
