Collision phenomena in liquids and solids
Selected basic flows and forces -- Jet impact onto a solid wall -- Drop impact onto a dry solid wall -- Drop impact onto dry surfaces with complex morphology -- Drop impacts with liquid pools and layers -- Drop and spray diagnostics -- Atomization and spray formation -- Spray impact -- Rigid body collision with liquid surface -- Particle impact onto wetted wall -- Particle and long bar impact onto a rigid wall -- Shaped-charge (Munroe) jets and projectile penetration -- Fragmentation
"A comprehensive account of the physical foundations of collision and impact phenomena and their applications in a multitude of engineering disciplines. In-depth explanations are included to reveal the unifying features of collision phenomena in both liquids and solids, and to apply them to disciplines including theoretical and applied mechanics, physics and applied mathematics, materials science, aerospace, mechanical and chemical engineering and terminal ballistics. Covering a range of examples from drops, jets and sprays, to seaplanes and ballistic projectiles, and detailing a variety of theoretical, numerical and experimental tools that can be used in developing new models and approaches, this is an ideal resource for students, researchers and practicing engineers alike"--
