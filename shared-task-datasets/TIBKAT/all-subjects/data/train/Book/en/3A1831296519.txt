Cyber-physical systems for industrial transformation : fundamentals, standards, and protocols
"This book investigates the fundaments, standards, and protocols of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in the industrial transformation environment. It facilitates a fusion of both technologies in the creation of reliable and robust applications. Cyber-Physical Systems for Industrial Transformation: Fundamentals, Standards, and Protocols explores emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Blockchain, Robotic Process Automation, Virtual Reality, Edge Computing, and 5G technology to highlight current and future opportunities to transition CPS to become more robust and reliable. The book showcases the real-time sensing, processing, and actuation software and discusses fault-tolerant and cybersecurity as well. This book brings together undergraduates, postgraduates, academics, researchers, and industry individuals that are interested in exploring new ideas, techniques, and tools related to CPS and Industry 4.0"--
