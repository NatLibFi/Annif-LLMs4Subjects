Summability theory and its applications
"Summability Theory and Its Applications explains various aspects of summability and demonstrates its applications in a rigorous and coherent manner. The content can readily serve as a reference or as a useful series of lecture notes on the subject. This substantially revised new edition includes brand new material across several chapters as well as several corrections, including: the addition of the domain of Cesaro matrix C(m) of order m in the classical sequence spaces to Chapter 4; and introducing the domain of four-dimensional binomial matrix in the spaces of bounded, convergent in the Pringsheim's sense, both convergent in the Pringsheim's sense and bounded, and regularly convergent double sequences, in Chapter 7. Features Investigates different types of summable spaces and computes their dual Suitable for graduate students and researchers with a (special) interest in spaces of single and double sequences, matrix transformations and domains of triangle matrices Can serve as a reference or as supplementary reading in a computational physics course, or as a key text for special Analysis seminars"--
