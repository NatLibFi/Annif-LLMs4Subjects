The Pathophysiologic Basis of Nuclear Medicine
Begins with some basic information on cell and molecules and an explanation of how radiopharmaceuticals are localized in various normal and abnormal tissues. This book presents diagnostic applications and their clinical utilization in several chapters designed to link the basic relevant knowledge of anatomy, physiology, and pathology
The second edition of this book has been significantly expanded to meet the demands of the increasing new trend of molecular imaging. A separate chapter on the basis of FDG uptake has been added. New to this edition are the more clinically oriented details on scintigraphic studies, their strengths and limitations in relation to other modalities. It further contains many new images, illustrations and tables.
