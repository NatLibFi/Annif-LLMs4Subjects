Preface -- Introduction -- History and Archeology -- Taxonomy, distribution, and ecology -- Resin collection and tapping practices -- Tree growth and physiology -- Tree growth and climatic adaptations -- Microbial symbionts -- Genetic diversity and population structure -- Genome sequencing and comparative assessment in Boswellia -- Economics and social use -- Propagation and conservation -- Phytochemical and medicinal aspects of resin -- Phytochemical and medicinal aspects of essential oil -- Pyrolysis of frankincense -- Frankincense-based products -- Glossary -- Index
This book provides insight into the biology and genomics of the genus Boswellia (family Burseraceae), a natural resource used for the production of frankincense, an oleo-gum resin. The Boswellia species are ecologically, medicinally, commercially and culturally important. Significantly contributing to the paucity of comprehensive literature on this genus, this volume provides a detailed discussion on the genomics, physiology and ecology of Boswellia. The chapters cover a wide range of topics, including taxonomy, distribution, genetic diversity and microbiology. The production process of frankincense and its impact on the species are presented as well. In light of the recent decline of various Boswellia populations, species propagation and conservation are discussed. Plant scholars, ecologists and conservation biologists will find this book to be an important and informative reference
