Radiative heat transfer
Every chapter of Radiative Heat Transfer offers uncluttered nomenclature, numerous worked examples, and a large number of problems - many based on "real world" situations, making it ideal for classroom use as well as for self-study. The book's 22 chapters cover the four major areas in the field: surface properties; surface transport; properties of participating media; and transfer through participating media. Within each chapter, all analytical methods are developed in substantial detail, and a number of examples show how the developed relations may be applied to practical problems. Extensive solution manual for adopting instructors Most complete text in the field of radiative heat transfer Many worked examples and end-of-chapter problems Large number of computer codes (in Fortran and C++), ranging from basic problem solving aids to sophisticated research tools Covers experimental methods
