A critical introduction to international criminal law
International criminal law has witnessed a rapid rise after the end of the Cold War. The UN refers to the birth of a new 'age of accountability', but certain historical objections, such as selectivity or victor's justice, have never fully gone away, and many of the justice dimensions of international criminal law remain unexplored. Various critiques have emerged in socio-legal scholarship or globalization discourse, revealing that there is a stark discrepancy between reality and expectation. Linking discussion of legal theories, case-law and practice to scholarship and opinion, A Critical Introduction to International Criminal Law explores these critiques through five main themes at the heart of contemporary dilemmas: * The shifting contours of criminality and international crimes * The tension between individual and collective responsibility * The challenges of domestic, international, hybrid and regional justice institutions * The foundations of justice procedures * Approaches towards punishment and reparation Suitable for students, academics and professionals from multiple fields wishing to understand contemporary theories, practices and critiques of international criminal law.
