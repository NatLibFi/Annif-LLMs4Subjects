Staatlichkeit in Rom? : Diskurse und Praxis (in) der r√∂mischen Republik
Was the Roman Republic a state? This question is discussed by 10 renowned authors, whose contributions to this volume illuminate possible traces of statehood, examine communications structures, and investigate whether the Roman Republic fulfilled the specific functions of a state. The roles of citizens are discussed, along with the themes of conquest and rule and aspects of grain supply, infrastructure, and law. In addition, two articles in this volume deal with the term "state" and the scope of statehood as analytical categories. Thus this volume, inspired by contemporary debates in legal and political science, offers a focused ancient history case study on the state, and an overview of current research on the Roman Republic
