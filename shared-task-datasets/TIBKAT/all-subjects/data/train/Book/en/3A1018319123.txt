Refugees, civil society and the state : European experiences and global challenges
“Ludger Pries explores the important moral, social and political challenge facing Europe and the international community: the protection of refugees as one of the most vulnerable groups on the planet. Combining an in-depth analysis of current research, own empirical studies in several European countries, and a critical review of the policies of nation-states as well as international and transnational organizations, the author analyses the 2015 so-called refugee crisis and its continuing impact. Who are the refugees, how and why did they come? Which parts of civil society were actively involved and why? What are the future responsibilities of the state for arriving refugees and their successful integration? This book examines the limitations of structural settings with perspectives on collective actors' behaviour and strategies. Offering a critical view on the historical embedding of the refugee issue, as well as the current and future challenges for Europe, Pries provides an insightful overview of all aspects of the so-called European refugee crisis and its aftermath. Refugees, Civil Society and the State merges perspectives from political science and international relations with international humanitarian law, the sociology of migration and action theory. Scholars, journalists and political actors who want to further understand the ongoing challenge of refugee protection will greatly benefit from the distinguished author's research.” (Publisher's description)
