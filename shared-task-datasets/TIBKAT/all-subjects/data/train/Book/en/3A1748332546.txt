Ambient intelligence, wireless networking, and ubiquitous computing
Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is the next wave in computing and communications technology. Nano-sized sensors and computers, wireless networks, and intelligent software are being integrated to create AmI environments. One such AmI environment is an intelligent home that can sense changes in a house and its occupants to instantly track objects or call 911 in case of a fall or heart attack. Another AmI environment is an intelligent airport to effortlessly guide a traveler to a connecting flight, through customs, or to a waiting car service.
