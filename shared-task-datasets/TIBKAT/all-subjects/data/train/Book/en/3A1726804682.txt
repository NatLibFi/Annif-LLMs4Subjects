A guide to temporal networks
"Network science offers a powerful language to represent and study complex systems composed of interacting elements - from the Internet to social and biological systems. A Guide to Temporal Networks presents recent theoretical and modelling progress in the emerging field of temporally varying networks and provides connections between the different areas of knowledge required to address this multi-disciplinary subject. After an introduction to key concepts on networks and stochastic dynamics, the authors guide the reader through a coherent selection of mathematical and computational tools for network dynamics. Perfect for students and professionals, this book is a gateway to an active field of research developing between the disciplines of applied mathematics, physics and computer science, with applications in others including social sciences, neuroscience and biology. This second edition extensively expands upon the coverage of the first addition as the authors expertly present recent theoretical and modelling progress in the emerging field of temporal networks, providing the keys to (and connections between) the different areas of knowledge required to address this multi-disciplinary problem"--
