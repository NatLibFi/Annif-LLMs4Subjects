Historical dictionary of the Baptists
A product of the Protestant Reformation, the Baptists can be a difficult group to define. Despite their common faith, there is no single Baptist church, nationally or regionally conceived, and though there is a stress on a voluntary association of individual congregations, local churches are autonomous in their church government, and denominational groups reflect a wide variety of types. The present volume, covering Baptists worldwide, fills a gap in reference, providing a one-volume, updated reference to the Baptists. Cross-referenced entries include biographical, geographical, ecclesiastical, theological, and thematic discussions. The work is comprehensive and accurate, making it an ideal tool for both first-time scholars of the Baptists and more experienced researchers. As a quick and accurate ready-reference, this volume will be an important addition to academic and church libraries and any serving those interested in religious history.
