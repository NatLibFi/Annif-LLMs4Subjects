Endovascular Aneurysm Repair : From Bench to Bed
Endovascular procedures have a tremendous impact upon modern patient care. This book summarizes covered stent-graft applications in the experimental and clinical settings. Excellent illustrations document the acute and chronic behavior of stent-grafts within the vascular system including diagnostic imaging, histologic work-up and schematic drawings. A large amount of experience on intravascular ultrasound-based repair of aortic pathologies is presented. Physicians interested in the endovascular field will find this book a very stimulating resource
