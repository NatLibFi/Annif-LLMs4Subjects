Graphs for the analysis of bipolar fuzzy information
This monograph discusses decision making methods under bipolar fuzzy graphical models with the aim of overcoming the lack of mathematical approach towards bipolar informationâ€”positive and negative. It investigates the properties of bipolar fuzzy graphs, their distance functions, and concept of their isomorphism. It presents certain notions, including irregular bipolar fuzzy graphs, domination in bipolar fuzzy graphs, bipolar fuzzy circuits, energy in bipolar fuzzy graphs, bipolar single-valued neutrosophic competition graphs, and bipolar neutrosophic graph structures. This book also presents the applications of mentioned concepts to real-world problems in areas of product manufacturing, international relations, psychology, global terrorism and more, making it valuable for researchers, computer scientists, social scientists and alike.
