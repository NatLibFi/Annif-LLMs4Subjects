Recent trends in radiation chemistry
This volume is a review of the trends in the field of radiation chemistry research. It covers a broad spectrum of topics, ranging from the historical perspective, instrumentation of accelerators in the nanosecond to femtosecond region, through the use of radiation chemical methods in the study of antioxidants and nanomaterials, radiation-induced DNA damage by ionizing radiation involving both direct and indirect effects, to ultrafast events in free electron transfer, radiation-induced processes at solid-liquid interfaces and the recent work on infrared spectroscopy and radiation chemistry. The book is unique in that it covers a wide spectrum of topics that will be of great interest to beginners as well as experts. Recent data on ultrafast phenomena from the recently established world-class laser-driven accelerators facilities in the US, France and Japan are reviewed
