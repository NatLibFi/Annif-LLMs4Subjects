Continuum methods of physical modeling : continuum mechanics, dimensional analysis, turbulence ; with 14 tables, 113 exercises and solutions
vorl√§ufig!!! The book unifies classical continuum mechanics and turbulence modeling, i.e. the same fundamental concepts are used to derive model equations for material behaviour and turbulence closure and complements these with methods of dimensional analysis. The intention is to equip the reader with the ability to understand the complex nonlinear modeling in material behaviour and turbulence closure as well as to derive or invent his own models. Examples are mostly taken from environmental physics and geophysics.
