Innovation and expansion in translation process research
"Cognitive research in translation and interpreting has reached a critical threshold of maturity that is triggering rapid expansion along exciting new paths that potentially lead to deeper connections with other disciplines. Innovation and Expansion in Translation Process Research reflects this broadening scope and reach, emphasizing ongoing methodological innovations, diversification of research topics and questions, and rich interactions with adjacent fields of research. The contributions to the volume can be grouped within four loosely defined themes: advances in traditional topics in translation process research, including problems in translation, translation competence or expertise, and specialization of translators; advances in research into the emotional or affective aspects of translating and translator training; innovations in machine translation and post-editing; expansion of cognitively-oriented translation studies to include editing processes and reception studies. This timely volume highlights the burgeoning growth, diversification, and connectivity of translation process research"--
