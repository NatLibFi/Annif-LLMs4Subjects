International trade and economic growth in open economies : the classical dynamics of Hume, Smith, Ricardo and Malthus
In this enlightening book, John Berdell addresses the widely-held belief that classical economics distanced itself from policy issues and public debates regarding the effects of international trade on economic growth in advanced economies.
