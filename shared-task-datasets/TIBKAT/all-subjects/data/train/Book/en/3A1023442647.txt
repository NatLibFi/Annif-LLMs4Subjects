Economic reform in developing countries : reach, range, reason
pt. 1. Reach : person-centered, evenhanded -- pt. 2. Range : institutional reform, policy change -- pt. 3. Reason : strategies, not slogans
This book offers insights into the process of economic reform in developing countries. It is organized around three factors that are critical to the success of any reform. According to Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen, these key dimensions are Reach, Range, and Reason. "Reach" refers to the ability of reform to be person-centered and evenhanded, reaching all individuals in society. "Range" considers the institutional reforms and policy changes necessary to implement change and the possible ripple effects on other policies and populations. Finally, "Reason" captures the importance of constantly asking why a particular reform has been selected
