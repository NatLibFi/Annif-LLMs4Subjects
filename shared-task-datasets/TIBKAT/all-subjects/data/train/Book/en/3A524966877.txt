Toxicants in aqueous ecosystems : a guide for the analytical and environmental chemist
The oceans and rivers, in particular, are not unlimited reservoirs into which waste can be dumped and that control of these emissions is necessary if destruction of the environment is to be avoided. This work offers information on these issues and on the analytical methods needed by experts active in environmental protection and toxicology
It is becoming increasingly realised that the oceans and rivers, in particular, are not unlimited reservoir into which waste can be dumped and that control of these emissions is necessary if complete destruction of the environment is to be avoided. T. R. Crompton has drawn together up-to-date information on these issues and on the relevant analytical methods needed by all experts active in environmental protection and toxicology.
