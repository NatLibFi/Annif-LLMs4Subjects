Introduction to electromagnetic compatibility
"New contributing authors Robert Scully and Mark Steffka have created a third edition of Dr. Clayton Paul's Introduction to Electromagnetic Compatibility that reflects the many advances that have occured in the field since the second edition was published in 2006. The new edition maintains the intuitive treatment of EMC topics ranging from basic to advanced concepts, as well as the comfortable presentation style that was a hallmark of the first two editions. The authors include detailed, worked-out examples throughout the text. In addition, readers can assess their grasp of the material using review exercises that follow the discussion of each important topic. This edition features several new appendices, including Phasor Analysis of Electric Circuits, The Electromagnetic Fields Equations and Waves, Computer Codes for Calculating the Per-Unit Length Parameters and Crosstalk of Multiconductor Transmission Lines, and a SPICE (PSPICE) tutorial"--
