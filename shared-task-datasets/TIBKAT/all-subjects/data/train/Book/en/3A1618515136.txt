Nietzsche, naturalism, and normativity
This title comprises ten original essays which critically engage with one of the western canon's most controversial ethical thinkers. Bringing together an internationally renowned line-up of Nietzsche specialists and mainstream moral philosophers, the volume provides a timely and distinctive contribution to our understanding of both Nietzsche and his significance for ethical thought more generally. As well as clarifying Nietzsche's own views, both critical and positive, ethical and meta-ethical, the articles connect Nietzsche's philosophical concerns to contemporary debates in and about ethics, normativity, and value. The volume's topics include: the nature and scope of Nietzsche's critique of morality; the character of the positive ideals Nietzsche advances in light of that critique; the meta-ethical commitments underpinning the substantive views he variously opposes and espouses; his conception of human psychology and its relation to normativity and value
