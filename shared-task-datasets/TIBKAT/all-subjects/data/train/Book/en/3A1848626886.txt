Highway engineering
"Highway Engineering covers all the necessary foundational material needed by civil engineers to address the analysis, design, and construction of highways. It covers central topics such as geometric, junction and pavement design, structural design, and pavement maintenance, while also ensuring students obtain an adequate grasp of traffic analysis. It places the topic in context by introducing the economic, political, social, environmental, and administrative dimensions of the subject -- essential understanding for all engineers. Highway Engineering makes frequent reference to the Department of Transport's Design Manual for Roads and Bridges and moves in a logical sequence from the planning and economic justification for a highway, through the geometric design and traffic analysis of highway links and intersections, including analysis for the increasingly important non-car-based modes of transport, to the design and maintenance of both flexible and rigid pavements"--
