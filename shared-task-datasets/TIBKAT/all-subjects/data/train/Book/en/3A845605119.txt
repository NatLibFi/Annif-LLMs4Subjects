"Covering both TFT technologies, and the theory and practice of circuit design, this book equips engineers with the technical knowledge and hands-on skills needed to make circuits on foil with organic or metal oxide based TFTs for applications such as flexible displays and RFID. It provides readers with a solid theoretical background and gives an overview of current TFT technologies including device architecture, typical parameters, and a theoretical framework for comparing different logical families. Concrete, real-world design cases, such as RFID circuits, and organic and metal oxide TFT-based 8-bit microprocessors, enable readers to grasp the practical potential of these design techniques and how they can be applied. This is an essential guide for students and professionals who need to make better transistors on foil"--
