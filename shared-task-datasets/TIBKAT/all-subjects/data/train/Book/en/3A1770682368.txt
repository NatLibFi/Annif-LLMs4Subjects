Geochemical and biogeochemical reaction modeling
"An indispensable primer and reference textbook, the third edition of Geochemical and Biogeochemical Reaction Modeling carries the reader from the field's origins and theoretical underpinnings through to a collection of fully worked examples. A clear exposition of the underlying equations and calculation techniques is balanced by real-world example calculations. The book depicts geochemical reaction modeling as a vibrant field of study applicable to a wide spectrum of issues of scientific, practical, and societal concern. The new edition offers a thorough description of surface complexation modeling, including twoand three-layer methods; broader treatment of kinetic rate laws; the effect of stagnant zones on transport; and techniques for determining gas partial pressures. This handbook demystifies and makes broadly accessible an elegant technique for portraying chemical processes in the geosphere. It will again prove to be invaluable for geochemists, environmental scientists and engineers, aqueous and surface chemists, microbiologists, university teachers, and government regulators"--
