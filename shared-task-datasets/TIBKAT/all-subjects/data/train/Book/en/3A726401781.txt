Shock wave dynamics : derivatives and related topics
"An important reference for professionals and students in Aerospace and Aeronautical Engineering as well as in Mechanical Engineering, this book covers general jump conditions; two-dimensional/axisymmetric formulation; derivatives for a two-dimensional/axisymmetric shock with a uniform freestream; derivative applications; vorticity and its substantial derivative; shock wave triple-point morphology; derivatives when the upstream flow is nonuniform; and general derivatives formulation. Aside from derivatives, the book extensively covers shock generated vorticity and it includes a novel analysis of triple points. Both analyses are accompanied with a wide-ranging parametric study"--
