Semiconductor quantum optics
"The emerging field of semiconductor quantum optics combines semiconductor physics and quantum optics, with the aim of developing quantum devices with unprecedented performance.In this book researchers and graduate students alike will reach a new level of understanding to begin conducting state-of-the-art investigations. The book combines theoretical methods from quantum optics and solid-state physics to give a consistent microscopic description of light-matter- and many-body-interaction effects in low dimensional semiconductor nanostructures. It develops the systematic theory needed to treat semiconductor quantum-optical effects, such as strong light-matter coupling, light-matter entanglement, squeezing, as well as quantum-optical semiconductor spectroscopy. Detailed derivations of key equations help readers learn the techniques and nearly 300 exercises help test their understanding of the materials covered"--
