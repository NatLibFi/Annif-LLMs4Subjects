Quantum Mechanics on the Personal Computer
Now in its 2nd edition, Quantum Mechanics on the PC presents the most up-to-date approach to elementary quantum mechanics. It is based on the interactive program Interquanta, which runs on MS-DOS either with or without coprocessor (two separate versions included on a 3 1/2'' diskette). With its extensive 3D colour graphics features, the book guides readers through computer experiments on - free particles - bound states and scattering from various potentials - two-particle problems - properties of special functions of mathematical physics. The course, with a wide variety of more than 200 detailed, class-tested problems, provides students - even with little experience in quantum mechanics - with unique practical experience of complex probability amplitudes, eigenvalues, scattering cross sections, and the like. Lecturers and teachers will find here excellent, hands-on classroom demonstrations for their quantum-mechanics course. See LooK 2/92
