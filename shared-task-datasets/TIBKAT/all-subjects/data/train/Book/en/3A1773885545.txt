Actually, there are many different kinds of bees, most of which live relatively hidden from our view. Maybe some of us are familiar with bumblebees, but who would recognize the solitary bees, which considerably o- number the social bees? These little-observed bees are often dubbed “wild bees” to distinguish them from our honeymakers.
