Religion, the Secular, and the Politics of Sexual Difference
Global struggles over women's roles, rights, and dress have taken center stage in a drama that casts the secular and the religious in tense if not violent opposition.

This volume upsets these certainties by blending diverse voices and traditions, both secular and religious, in studies historicizing, questioning, and testing the implicit links between secularism
