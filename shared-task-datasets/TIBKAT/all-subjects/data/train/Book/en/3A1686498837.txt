Understanding voltammetry : simulation of electrode processes
"This is the first textbook in the field of electrochemistry that will teach experimental electrochemists how to carry out simulation of electrode processes. Processes at both macro- and micro-electrodes are examined and the simulation of both diffusion-only and diffusion-convection processes are addressed. The simulation of processes with coupled homogeneous kinetics and at microelectrode arrays are further discussed. Over the course of the book the reader's understanding is developed to the point where they will be able to undertake and solve research-level problems. The book leads the reader through from a basic understanding of the principles underlying electrochemical simulation to the development of computer programs which describe the complex processes found in voltammetry. This second edition has been revised throughout, and contains new material relating to random walks in electrochemistry, as well as expanded materials on the checking and validation of simulations, pulse techniques, and square wave voltammetry"--
