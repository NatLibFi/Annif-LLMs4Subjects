Radiologic-Pathologic Correlations from Head to Toe : Understanding the Manifestations of Disease
This richly illustrated book offers correlation of gross and microscopic pathology with abnormal radiologic images. Taking advantage of all imaging modalities, the authors give detailed descriptions and critical assessments of radiologic presentations of a broad spectrum of diseases from most organ systems, including the nervous system, head and neck, chest, abdomen, urogenital system, musculoskeletal system and breast. Some chapters are based on a very successful lecture series offered recently at the European Congress of Radiology in Vienna, with additional important topics added. The book helps the clinician to apply the principles of radiologic--pathologic correlation to the interpretation of radiologic studies, to understand the clinical and pathologic implications of the radiologic appearance and to refine the differential diagnosis in various entities and organ systems, based on specific cross-correlated features. Authoritative reviews, written by leading experts, are provided on all of the important clinical entities.
