In-situ synthesis of aluminum matrix composites
Introduction -- Design and development of in situ reaction system -- Electromagnetic synthesis of In-situ Aluminum Matrix Composites -- High energy ultrasonic synthesis of In-situ Aluminum Matrix Composites -- Synthesis of In-situ Aluminum Matrix Composite by acoustic magnetic coupling -- Solidification structure and interface structure of In-situ Aluminum Matrix Composite -- Effect of plastic processing on the structure of In-situ Aluminum Matrix Composite -- Mechanical properties of In-situ Aluminum Matrix Composites -- Wear properties of In-situ Aluminum Matrix Composites.
This book comprehensively and systematically discusses in situ aluminum matrix composites, from their system design, material development, and preparation technology, to their solidification structure, plastic processing, and properties. As a new type of metal matrix composite, it not only provides a technical framework for the low-cost, large-scale development of high-performance compliant materials, but also provides important technical support for the promotion of the aluminum industry. The book appeals to researchers and industrial practitioners in the area of materials development for in situ aluminum matrix composites.
