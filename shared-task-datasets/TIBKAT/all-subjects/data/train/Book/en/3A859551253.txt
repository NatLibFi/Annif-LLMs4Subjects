Boris Velikovsky : 1878-1937
With his residential buildings, office blocks, schools and factories, Boris Velikovsky (1878-1937) made a definitive contribution to Russian avant-garde architecture. His early constructions, such as Gribov House in Moscow, are still very much bound to Russian Neoclassism, yet since the Revolution of 1917, he increasingly designed Constructivist architecture. One example is his Gostorg Management Building, distinguished by glass facades, the functional division of space and use of state-of-the-art materials. Furthermore in the garden city of Druzhba for instance, Velikovsky intensively engaged with new ideas in town planning. With mostly hitherto unpublished technical plans, as well as numerous historical and new colour photographs of his most famous projects, Boris Velikowsky's contribution to Russian avant-garde architecture is appreciated for the first time in book form
