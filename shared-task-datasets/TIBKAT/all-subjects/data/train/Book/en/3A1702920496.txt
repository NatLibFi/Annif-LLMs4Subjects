Embodied computing : wearables, implantables, embeddables, ingestibles
"Embodied technologies such as wearable tracking bracelets, ingestible sensors, embeddable prosthetics, and implantable microchips all stand to redefine the human experience and what it means to speak of technology and the body. No longer the speculative stuff of science fiction, embodied technologies have arrived and are being developed by a variety of industries at an alarming rate.

Varieties of wearable, ingestible, embeddable, and implantable technologies have become constitutive of new hybrid bodies, blurring the line separating the human from the technological. Yet, bodies constantly negotiate demands made by technology-both humanizing and dehumanizing. Embodied Technology: Wearables, Implantables, Embeddables, Ingestibles is a collection by key practitioners and theorists in the field and analyzes a variety of sociotechnical themes and devices as agents in dialogue with the human body and subjectivity"--
