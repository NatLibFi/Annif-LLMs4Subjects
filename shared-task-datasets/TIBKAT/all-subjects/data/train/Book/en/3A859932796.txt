The handbook of environmental chemistry / founded by Otto Hutzinger ; editors-in-chief: Damià Barceló, Andrey G. Kostianoy ; volume 48: Indoor and outdoor nanoparticles : determinants of release and exposure scenarios
This volume provides an overview of the determinants of the release of and exposure to airborne nanoparticles. Whether intentionally manufactured or unintentionally generated during industrial processes, the release of nanoparticles can result in significant worker exposure, which must be dealt with adequately by means of dedicated risk assessments to ensure workplace health and safety. The book extensively discusses a number of measurement and modelling strategies available for this purpose. It also reviews the health hazardous potential of nano-sized particles and fibres, and follows the flow of engineered nanomaterials from production and use to disposal and the environment. It appeals to a wide readership, from specialists already working in the field to newcomers aiming to gain insights into this topic.
