A Course on Point Processes
This graduate-level textbook provides a straight-forward and mathematically rigorous introduction to the standard theory of point processes. The author's aim is to present an account which concentrates on the essentials and which places an emphasis on conveying an intuitive understanding of the subject. As a result, it provides a clear presentation of how statistical ideas can be viewed from this perspective and particular topics covered include the theory of extreme values and sampling from finite populations. Prerequisites are that the reader has a basic grounding in the mathematical theory of probability and statistics, but otherwise the book is self-contained. It arises from courses given by the author over a number of years and includes numerous exercises ranging from simple computations to more challenging explorations of ideas from the text
