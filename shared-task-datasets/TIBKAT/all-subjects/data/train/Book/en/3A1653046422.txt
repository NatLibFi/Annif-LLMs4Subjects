Topics in Fixed Point Theory
The purpose of this contributed volume is to provide a primary resource for anyone interested in fixed point theory with a metric flavor. The book presents information for those wishing to find results that might apply to their own work and for those wishing to obtain a deeper understanding of the theory. The book should be of interest to a wide range of researchers in mathematical analysis as well as to those whose primary interest is the study of fixed point theory and the underlying spaces. The level of exposition is directed to a wide audience, including students and established researchers. Key topics covered include Banach contraction theorem, hyperconvex metric spaces, modular function spaces, fixed point theory in ordered sets, topological fixed point theory for set-valued maps, coincidence theorems, Lefschetz and Nielsen theories, systems of nonlinear inequalities, iterative methods for fixed point problems, and the Ekeland’s variational principle
