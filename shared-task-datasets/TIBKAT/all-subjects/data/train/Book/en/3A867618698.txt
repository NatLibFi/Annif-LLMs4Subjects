LDPC code designs, constructions, and unification
"Written by leading experts, this self-contained text provides systematic coverage of LDPC codes and their construction techniques, unifying both algebraic- and graph-based approaches into a single theoretical framework (the superposition construction). An algebraic method for constructing protograph LDPC codes is described, and entirely new codes and techniques are presented. These include a new class of LDPC codes with doubly quasi-cyclic structure, as well as algebraic methods for constructing spatially and globally coupled LDPC codes. Authoritative, yet written using accessible language, this text is essential reading for electrical engineers, computer scientists and mathematicians working in communications and information theory"--
