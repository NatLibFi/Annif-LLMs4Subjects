Landscapes of Music in Istanbul : a Cultural Politics of Place and Exclusion
Everyday articulations of music, place, urban politics, and inclusion/exclusion are powerfully present in Istanbul. This volume analyzes landscapes of music, community, and exclusion across a century and a half. An interdisciplinary group of scholars and artists presents four case studies: the rembetika, the music of the Asiks, the Zakir/Alevi tradition, and hip-hop, in Beyoglu, Üsküdar, the gentrifying Sulukule neighborhood, and across the metropolis.  Alex Papadopoulos is Associate Professor of Geography at DePaul University, Chicago. He studies the contestation of urban space in European cities. Asli Duru is Marie Curie Fellow at The Open University, London, and studies everyday geographies of health and wellbeing.
