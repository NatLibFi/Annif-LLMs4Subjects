The shaping of South African society, 1652-1840
This book is about the formative years of the Cape, 1652 to ca. 1840. During this period two processes began which have since been the main themes of South African history: the integration of Southern Africa into a world economy and the dominance of Europeans over blacks. The book attempts to analyse the development of social and economic patterns and gives attention to all the peoples and classes who inhabited the Cape colony.
