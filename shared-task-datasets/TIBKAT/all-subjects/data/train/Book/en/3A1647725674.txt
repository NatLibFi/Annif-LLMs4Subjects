Foundations of Quantum Physics
The intent of the authors in writing this book is to avoid a modern trend in textbooks that is to condense and compress the texts into smaller sizes. The authors believe that a textbook should be more than a one or two semester acquaintance. This is especially true for a course such as quantum mechanics which is likely taken by physics majors who will use the subject for the rest of their careers. Perhaps in years to come, this student, now a working physicist, is interested in a subject skipped in the course. He or she knows where to find the material in a book that is quite familiar to him or her, a book they retained from their course and kept in a personal library. The goal in writing this book is to have that kind of staying power and be a long-term companion for physicists. The authors will also provide an instructor's solution manual, which will be available to adopting professors.
