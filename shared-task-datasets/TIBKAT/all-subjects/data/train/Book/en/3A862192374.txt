This volume addresses artificial photosynthesis which promises to solve the forthcoming energy crisis by developing devices which would, as photosynthetic organisms do, directly transform solar energy into fuels. Artificial photosynthesis can be achieved in a number of ways, from improving natural photosynthesis, to solid-state approaches, and covers a wide range of scientific fields involving theoretical as well as experimental work, The aim of this volume is to summarize the different aspects of the artificial photosynthesis.--
