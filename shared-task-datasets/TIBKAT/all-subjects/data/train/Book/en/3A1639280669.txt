Introduction to superposition principle waves -- The wave function: expectations, values, and uncertainty -- The Schr√∂dinger equation -- Quantum axiomatics -- Quantum measurements -- Path integral formulation of quantum mechanics -- Supersymmetry in quantum mechanics -- Quantum persistent currents -- Cryptography and quantum mechanics -- Non-equilibrium quantum -- Introductory spintronics -- Quantum dots -- Magnetic resonance -- Introductory theory of scattering -- Introduction to Quantum Hall effect
"This new book, Quantum Mechanics: Axiomatic Theory with Modern Applications, will act as a guide through the various aspects of quantum mechanics. It not only involves the basics but also addresses new themes developed in the field in recent years. These include quantum mechanics in relation to electronics, as in quantum dots, spintronics, cryptography, and other more theoretical aspects such as path integral formulation and supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The volume presents a number of mathematical tools and physical consequences derived from quantum mechanics axiomatic. The starting point of the volume is a very brief review of the phenomenology associated with the origins of quantum theory, as the branch of science was understood in the beginning of the 20th century, leading to an interpretation of the results at that time"--
