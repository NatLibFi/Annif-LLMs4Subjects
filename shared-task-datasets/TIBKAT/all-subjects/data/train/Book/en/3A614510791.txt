Technology of cheesemaking
This book covers the science and technology underlying cheesemaking, as practised today in the manufacture of hard, semi-soft and soft cheeses. It covers research developments within the areas of molecular genetics, advanced sensor / measurement science, chemometrics, enzymology and flavour chemistry. In order to reflect new issues and challenges chapters are included on milk handling prior to cheesemaking; packaging; and major advances in the control of the end user properties of cheese using key manufacturing parameters and variables. [...] The volume has been structured in the order in which cheese manufacture is executed in cheese plants - from milk process science, through curd process science, to cheese ripening science and quality assessment.
