Redux in action
With Redux, you manage the state of a web application in a single, simple object, practically eliminating most state-related bugs.  Centralizing state with Redux makes it possible to quickly start saved user sessions, maintain a reliable state history, and smoothly transfer state between UIs.  Plus, the Redux state container is fully programmable and integrates cleanly with React and other popular frameworks.  "Redux in action" is an accessible guide to effectively managing state in web applications.  Built around common use cases, this practical book starts with a simple task-management application built in React.  You'll use the app to learn the Redux workflow, handle asynchronous actions, and get your hands on the Redux developer tools.  With each step, you'll discover more about Redux and the benefits of centralized state management.  The book progresses to more-complex examples, including writing middleware for analytics, time travel debugging, and an overview of how Redux works with other frameworks such as Angular and Electron
