A guide to Monte Carlo simulations in statistical physics
"Dealing with all aspects of Monte Carlo simulation of complex physical systems encountered in condensed-matter physics and statistical mechanics, this book provides an introduction to computer simulations in physics. This fourth edition contains extensive new material describing numerous powerful algorithms not covered in previous editions, in some cases representing new developments that have only recently appeared. Older methodologies whose impact was previously unclear or unappreciated are also introduced, in addition to many small revisions that bring the text and cited literature up to date. This edition also introduces the use of petascale computing facilities in the Monte Carlo arena"--
