Viruses and apoptosis : 5 tables
The interactions between viruses and the cells they infect include the virus control of cellular functions to their advantage. The cell counteracts with a defensive immune system and stress responses. Both sides of this struggle include modifications in the cell death program that will be crucial for the infection outcome. In this book, molecular pathways regulated by viral genes and their role in the pathogenesis of infection are analysed in different viral models. It also includes a didactic update of known signaling pathways in apoptosis and their role in normal and infected cells. Special emphasis was given to molecular pathways underlying viral transformation and oncogenesis and to the perspectives in cancer gene therapy. Particular cell types in apoptosis such as neuronal cells and lymphoid cell death are also emphasized. This book is designed to give an in-depth update of viral gene interaction with regulation pathways in apoptosis for scientists and researchers in the fields of molecular biology, virology, cell biology, oncology, and neurobiology.
