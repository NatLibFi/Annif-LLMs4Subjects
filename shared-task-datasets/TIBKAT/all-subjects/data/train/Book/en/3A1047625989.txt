Work Across the Lifespan
Work Across the Lifespan coalesces lifespan theoretical and lifespan-based empirical perspectives on aging and work. The books examines human development theories that explain patterns of growth, trajectories of change and maintenance of continuities across the entirety of life. Using the implicit focus of these theories on aging as a guide to intra-individual change and goal-based self-regulation processes, the book examines the relationship between work and aging. Drawing upon developmental psychology, life course sociology, microeconomics, and critical gerontology, this authoritative reference brings together the collective thinking of researchers who study aging and working, and aging and careers
