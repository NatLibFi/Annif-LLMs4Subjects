The Discrete Nonlinear Schr√∂dinger Equation : Mathematical Analysis, Numerical Computations and Physical Perspectives
Summarizes the results obtained over the years in the context of the Discrete Nonlinear Schrodinger equation and the physical settings. This book introduces the model and its systematic derivation, a subsequent analysis of the existence and the stability of fundamental nonlinear structures in 1, 2 and 3 spatial lattice dimensions
