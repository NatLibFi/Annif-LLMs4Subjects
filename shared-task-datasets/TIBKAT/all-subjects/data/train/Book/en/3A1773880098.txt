It investigates linearly combined motion comp- sated signals and generalizes the well known superposition for bidirectional prediction in B-pictures. The number of superimposed signals and the sel- tion of reference pictures will be important aspects of the discussion. The application oriented part of the book employs this concept to the well known ITU-T Recommendation H.263 and continues with the improvements by superimposed motion-compensated signals for the emerging ITU-T R- ommendation H.264 and ISO/IEC MPEG-4 (Part 10). In addition, it discusses a new approach for wavelet-based video coding. This technology is currently investigated by MPEG to develop a new video compression standard for the mid-term future.
