Animating Guarini : an orthographic project
The evolution of orthographic projection from a technique to a convention has provided architecture with orthographic drawing--a form of imaging continually used to present, defend, and build architecture. Orthographic projection's geometric principles and complex history are no longer part of an architect's education, and yet its underlying Euclidean geometry informs the materialization of architecture, regardless of complexity. In this book, I mine the instrumental history of orthographic projection to reacquire the generative techniques of drawing that do not deal with visualization. Animating Guarini is thus a historical account and a reimagining of orthographic projection as a drawing technique that precedes convention
