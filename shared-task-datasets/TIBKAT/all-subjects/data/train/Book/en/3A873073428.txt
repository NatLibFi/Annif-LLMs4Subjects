"The European General Data Protection Regulation introduces a uniform data protection legislation which will apply directly in all EU member states and which will also have to be observed by numerous companies outside the EU who have business in the EU. The handbook ... addresses the key changes resulting from the Regulation and the requirements it places on typical business processes and rapidly spreading new technologies, also by using practically relevant examples. The handbook therefore provides ... [a] basis for all international companies affected by the Regulation to review their existing business processes and ensure that new processes and business models are in line with these new data protection requirements."--
