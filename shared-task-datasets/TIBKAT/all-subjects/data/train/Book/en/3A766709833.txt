Global prayers : contemporary manifestations of the religious in the city
Religious communities inscribe themselves into the cityscape not only socially and politically, but also acoustically and architecturally. Global Prayers examines the mutual influence of religion and urbanism, looking at how various forms of faith manifest themselves in the cities of the world. Photo essays, interviews, reports, scientific texts, and artistic photo spreads inquire into the making of urban religion and the production of religious urbanity.
