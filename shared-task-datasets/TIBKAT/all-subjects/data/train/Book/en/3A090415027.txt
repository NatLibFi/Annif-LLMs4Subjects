This book covers the fundamental principles of space-time coding for wireless communications over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, and the practical coding methods for achieving the performance improvements predicted by the theory. Ideal for graduate students familiar with the basics of digital communications, and engineers implementing the theory in real systems
