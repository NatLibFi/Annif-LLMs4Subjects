Room for artifacts : the architecture of WOJR
Room for Artifacts' contains a collection of sixteen architectural artifacts a mask, a church, a labyrinth, a dwelling, a bust, and a series of totems, among others designed by WOJR: Organization for Architecture, based in Cambridge, MA. The work is presented three times throughout the book in conceptual drawings, architectural drawings, and images. Certain characteristics recur such as symmetry, frontality, figurality, proportionality, flatness and depth, outlining WOJR's preoccupation with fundamental aspects of architectural form that are rich in historical precedent. The new book carves a space for discourse around the role of architectural representation in a contemporary context. The featured work is evidence of WOJR's belief that every line drawn is simultaneously an opportunity to invoke aspects of ideologies embedded in lines drawn by architects of the past, as well as to express a progressive agenda of a forward-looking body of work
