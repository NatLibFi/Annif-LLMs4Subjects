African-American English : structure, history, and use
"This book was the first to provide a comprehensive survey of linguistic research into African-American English and is widely recognised as a classic in the field. It covers both the main linguistic features, in particular the grammar, phonology and lexicon and the sociological, political and educational issues connected with African-American English. The editors have played key roles in the development of African American English and Black Linguistics as an academic field of study and along with other leading figures, notably Geneva Smitherman, Bill Labov and Walt Wolfram, they provide an authoritative, diverse guide to this vitally important subject area. Drawing on key moments of cultural significance from the Ebonics controversy to the rap of Ice-T, the contributors cover the state of the art in scholarship on African-American English, and actively dispel misconceptions, address new questions and explore new approaches. This classic edition has a new foreword by Sonja Lanehart, setting the book in context and celebrating its influence. This is an essential text for courses on African-American English, key reading for Varieties of English and World Englishes modules and an important reference for students of linguistics, black studies and anthropology at both undergraduate and postgraduate level"--
