Design/build with Jersey Devil : a handbook for education and practice
"This Architecture Brief is a vital tool for teaching and learning design/build education in architecture schools. Draws directly from the expertise of Jersey Devil, a group working into their fifth decade who pioneered the movement and influenced a generation of practitioners and educators such as Rural Studio. Themes touch on socially responsible architecture, fostering craftsmanship and collaboration, off-the-shelf components and nonstandard applications, educational reform, good life and play, and university-community relations. There are now over 100 design/build programs in schools of architecture throughout the USA, a threefold increase in the past twenty years. The members of Jersey Devil--Steve Badanes, Jim Adamson, and John Ringel--continue to teach design/build in schools in Seattle, Vermont, and Miami. Their project locations include local work as well as schools in countries such as Finland, India, and Mexico. Charlie Hailey is Professor of Architecture at the University of Florida"--
