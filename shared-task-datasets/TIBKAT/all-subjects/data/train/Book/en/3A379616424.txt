Comprehensive mathematics for computer scientists / Guerino Mazzola; Jody Weissmann; GÃ©rard Milmeister ; 2: Calculus and ODEs, splines, probability, Fourier and wavelet theory, fractals and neural networks, categories and lambda calculus
This two-volume textbook Comprehensive Mathematics for the Working Computer Scientist is a self-contained comprehensive presentation of mathematics including sets, numbers, graphs, algebra, logic, grammars, machines, linear geometry, calculus, ODEs, and special themes such as neural networks, Fourier theory, wavelets, numerical issues, statistics, categories, and manifolds. The concept framework is streamlined but defining and proving virtually everything. The style implicitly follows the spirit of recent topos-oriented theoretical computer science. Despite the theoretical soundness, the material stresses a large number of core computer science subjects, such as, for example, a discussion of floating point arithmetic, Backus-Naur normal forms, L-systems, Chomsky hierarchies, algorithms for data encoding, e.g., the Reed- Solomon code. The numerous course examples are motivated by computer science and bear a generic scientific meaning. This text is complemented by an online university course which covers the same theoretical content, however, in a totally different presentation. The student or working scientist who once gets involved in this text may at any time consult the online interface which comprises applets and other interactive tools. TOC:Topology.- Calculus
