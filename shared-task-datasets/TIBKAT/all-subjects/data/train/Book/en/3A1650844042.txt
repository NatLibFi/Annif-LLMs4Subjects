Numerical Techniques for Global Atmospheric Models
This book surveys recent developments in numerical techniques for global atmospheric models. It is based upon a collection of lectures prepared by leading experts in the field. The chapters reveal the multitude of steps that determine the global atmospheric model design. They encompass the choice of the equation set, computational grids on the sphere, horizontal and vertical discretizations, time integration methods, filtering and diffusion mechanisms, conservation properties, tracer transport, and considerations for designing models for massively parallel computers. A reader interested in applied numerical methods but also the many facets of atmospheric modeling should find this book of particular relevance.
Part I: Equations of motion and some basic ideas on discretizations -- Pat II. Conservation laws, finite-volume methods, remapping techniques and spherical grids -- Part III. Some aspects of atmospheric dynamical cores.
