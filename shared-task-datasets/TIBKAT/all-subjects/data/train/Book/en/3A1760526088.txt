Southern drama and geopathology --Lillian Hellman's South -- South to a familiar place : from Beth Henley to Elizabeth Dewberry and Sandra Deer -- "Another world, another planet" : the displaced South in the work of Paula Vogel and Pearl Cleage -- Re-placing genre, setting, and community in Shay Youngblood's and Sharon Bridgforth's plays --Conclusion.
