Attenuation of incoherent seismic noise
This book examines the effects of incoherent noise and how it leads to the misinterpretation of seismic data. It also reviews common noise reduction approaches and their drawbacks, focusing on developments that have occurred in the past decade. The main features of this book include: • Hands-on implementation in MATLAB and/or C • In-depth discussions of both theoretical and practical aspects of the subject • Supplementary, real-world seismic data • Detailed descriptions of structure-enhancing filters. Connecting the theory and practical implementation of noise reduction, the book helps readers fill the gap from equations to code, and from classical filters to the preservation and enhancement of a robust structure. Lastly, it highlights cutting-edge research in the area. As such, it is of interest to researchers in the fields of petroleum engineering, exploration seismology, and geophysics, as well as to practitioners working in the petroleum industry
