Acoustic wave and electromechanical resonators : concept to key applications
This groundbreaking book provides you with a comprehensive understanding of FBAR (thin-film bulk acoustic wave resonator), MEMS (microelectomechanical system), and NEMS (nanoelectromechanical system) resonators. For the first time anywhere, you find extensive coverage of these devices at both the technology and application levels. This practical reference offers you guidance in design, fabrication, and characterization of FBARs, MEMS and NEBS. It discusses the integration of these devices with standard CMOS (complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor) technologies, and their application to sensin
