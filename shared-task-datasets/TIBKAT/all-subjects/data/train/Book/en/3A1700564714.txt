Fundamentals of human resource management
Fundamentals of Human Resources Management supports human resources training for all students of management -- not just HR managers. The text presents a wide range of HR topics within a single semester of material, and a wealth of functional examples and applications. Fundamentals is also the first text of its kind to make talent management processes a core study. This 5th Edition has been updated with practical personnel techniques, real company examples, and new material on business sustainability. Each chapter touches on important recurring themes in management, including employee engagement tactics, small/global business management, employment law features, and positive employee relations, to help students become stronger and more effective managers
