This book compiles the most comprehensive collection of protocols currently used in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal research. This experience-based collection includes methods for isolation, cultivation, detection, and quantification of AM fungi, as well as the use of metagenomics for community studies and experimental procedures for functional genomics. Written for the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Authoritative and cutting-edge, Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi: Methods and Protocols serves as an ideal aid for researchers seeking to perform experiments that fill the gaps in our knowledge of the basic biology, functions, and ecology of AM fungi in the hope of deploying these powerful plant fungal symbionts in agriculture more effectively.
