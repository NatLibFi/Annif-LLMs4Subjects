This survey contains more than 3,000 formulas and methods from the field of finance and insurance mathematics (as well as related formulas in mathematics, probability theory, statistics, econometrics, index numbers, demography, stochastic processes and time series). The formulas are mostly applicable in financial and actuarial practice. Their mathematical level ranges from simple ones based on arithmetic to very sophisticated matters of higher mathematics (e. g. stochastic calculus), but they are usually presented in the form most frequently used in applications. Explanations and references to related parts of the survey are given so that one can easily browse and look them up in the text; the detailed Index is also helpful for this purpose. The survey will be of benefit for students, researchers and practitioners in finance and insurance.
