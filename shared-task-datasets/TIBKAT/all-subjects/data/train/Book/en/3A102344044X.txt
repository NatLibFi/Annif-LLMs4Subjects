New developments in economic education
'Mixon and Cebula have compiled a valuable collection that offers a blend of compelling empirical results on the efficacy of classroom innovations along with practical advice to implement cutting edge pedagogical techniques. New and seasoned instructors alike can enhance their economics courses and improve student learning as they select from innovative ideas that range from simple to complex.' (Gail Hoyt, University of Kentucky, US). -- 'This volume is a welcome addition to an ever growing body of work in economic education. The chapters herein are sure to appeal equally to new and seasoned instructors. The often overlooked process of setting expectations is motivated through a fresh look at syllabus construction. A wide range of content areas are covered throughout the volume, with dedicated chapters on the Coase Theorem and tax evasion. Research chapters enhance our understanding of the acquisition of economic knowledge (through clicker use), the stock of economic and financial knowledge (and correlated factors), and how real and perceived economic and financial literacy influence opinions (related to the financial crisis). The depth and breadth of coverage on such important topics make this a must have volume.' (KimMarie McGoldrick, University of Richmond, US). -- 'This volume includes chapters extending and updating innovative teaching methods for undergraduate economics courses, as well as chapters with empirical research. Economic educators and general economists who are interested in teaching will therefore find something of interest and importance here.' (Michael Watts, Purdue University, US).
