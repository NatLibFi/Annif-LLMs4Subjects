This new edition features: • a major expansion of the chapter on postcolonial criticism that includes topics such as Nordicism, globalization and the ‘end’ of postcolonial theory, global tourism and global conservation • an extended explanation of each theory, using examples from everyday life, popular culture, and literary texts • a list of specific questions critics ask about literary texts • an interpretation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby through the lens of each theory • a list of questions for further practice to guide readers in applying each theory to different literary works • updated and expanded bibliographies. Both engaging and rigorous, this is a "how-to" book for undergraduate and graduate students new to critical theory and for college professors who want to broaden their repertoire of critical approaches to literature.
