Chandigarh redux : Le Corbusier, Pierre Jeanneret, Jane B. Drew, E. Maxwell Fry
Chandigarh, built in the 1950s to a scheme by Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret with their team of international and Indian architects, until the present day is regarded an icon of modernist urban design. Austrian artist Werner Feiersinger has recently travelled to the legendary capital of India s federal state Punjab. Inspired by Ernst Scheidegger s book "Chandigarh 1956"," " he has put together a vast pictorial account of the city s famous architecture today. This new book features some 300 of Feiersinger s photographs. With the artist s view and based on his own creative experience as a sculptor, he shows the expressive sculptural qualities of the buildings. He captures the place s vivid atmosphere and virtuosity and illustrates its continuous topicality. This artistic approach clearly distinguishes this book from previous publications on Chandigarh, most of which are of merely documentary character. The essay by Austrian architect Andreas Vass reflects on Chandigarh s history, its architectural qualities, and its future development. The title "Chandigarh Redux "refers to Francis Ford Coppola s Apocalypse Now Redux, the 2001 extended version of his epic war film of 1979.
