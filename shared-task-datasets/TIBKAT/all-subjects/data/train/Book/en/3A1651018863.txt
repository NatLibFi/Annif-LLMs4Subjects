Partial Differential Equations for Geometric Design
The subject of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) which first emerged in the 18th century holds an exciting and special position in the applications relating to the mathematical modelling of physical phenomena. The subject of PDEs has been developed by major names in Applied Mathematics such as Euler, Legendre, Laplace and Fourier and has applications to each and every physical phenomenon known to us e.g. fluid flow, elasticity, electricity and magnetism, weather forecasting and financial modelling. This book introduces the recent developments of PDEs in the field of Geometric Design particularly for computer based design and analysis involving the geometry of physical objects. Starting from the basic theory through to the discussion of practical applications the book describes how PDEs can be used in the area of Computer Aided Design and Simulation Based Design. Extensive examples with real life applications of PDEs in the area of Geometric Design are discussed in the book.
