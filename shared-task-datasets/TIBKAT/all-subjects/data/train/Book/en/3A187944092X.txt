Growth theory, nonlinear dynamics and economic modelling : scientific essays of William Allen Brock
This outstanding collection of William Brock's essays illustrates the power of dynamic modelling to shed light on the forces for stability and instability in economic systems. The articles selected reflect his best work and are indicative both of the type of policy problem that he finds challenging and the complex methodology that he uses to solve them. Also included is an introduction by Brock to his own work, which helps tie together the main aspects of his research to date. The volume covers: * stochastic models and optimal growth * financial and macroeconomic modelling * ecology, mechanism design and regulation * nonlinearity in economics
