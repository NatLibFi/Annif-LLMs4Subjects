Movement of acoustic energy in the ocean
This book highlights the advantages of the vector-phase method in underwater acoustic measurements and presents results of theoretical and experimental studies of the deep open ocean and shallow sea based on vector-phase representations. Based on the physical phenomena discovered and compensation of counter streams of energy and vortices of the acoustic intensity vector, processes of transmitting acoustic energy of a tonal signal in the real ocean are described. The book also discusses the development of advanced detection tools based on vector-phase sonar. This book provides useful content for professionals and researchers working in various fields of applied underwater acoustics.
