Models of the Chinese economy
Models of the Chinese Economy is an authoritative and comprehensive book which will enable readers to gain a more thorough understanding of this important economy. The authors focus on economic modelling of the current Chinese economy for forecasting and policy simulation purposes. Dynamic computable general equilibrium, gravity, models of exchange rate determination and a VAR model are employed with which to provide both medium- and long-term forecasts of China's economic growth and structural change. All the models have been specially designed to capture the institutional features of the Chinese economy and the authors also emphasise the opening of the economy and relations with other countries. The impact on the Chinese economy of such factors as the flow of foreign direct investments, trade liberalisations, tariff cuts and other external shocks are addressed and analysed through model simulations. This book will be welcomed by international agencies interested in the economic development of China, China analysts, academics, and graduate students
