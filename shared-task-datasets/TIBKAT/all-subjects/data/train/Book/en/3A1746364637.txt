Modern Mössbauer Spectroscopy : New Challenges Based on Cutting-Edge Techniques
This book presents an overview of the latest Mössbauer spectroscopy research. It sheds light on various cutting-edge research subjects: (i) nuclear resonance scattering experiments implemented at synchrotron radiation facilities, e.g., ESRF, DESY and Spring-8; (ii) multidisciplinary materials research related to chemistry, biology, geoscience, molecular magnetism of metal complexes, batteries, and magnetism; (iii) novel imaging techniques based on probing diffusion in solids using Mössbauer spectroscopy. The first three chapters introduce recent research on modern Mössbauer spectroscopy, including nuclear resonant scattering experiments and development of related techniques at synchrotron accelerator facilities. Chapters 4 and 5 then demonstrate the applications of such pioneering techniques to chemistry, biology and geoscience. Chapters 6 and 7 describe the applications to new functional materials, i.e., metal complexes and Li- and Na-ion batteries, while the final two chapters are devoted to two important measuring techniques: Mössbauer spectroscopy under external magnetic fields, and microscopic Mössbauer techniques on diffusion in solids, which are expected to play an essential role in the investigation and characterization of magnetic structures and microstructures in materials. The cutting-edge content provides readers with quick updates on the latest research topics in the field, while the tutorial-style descriptions allow readers unfamiliar with Mössbauer spectroscopy to learn and implement the techniques. As such, the book is especially useful for advanced undergraduate and early graduate students who have recently been assigned to a laboratory.
