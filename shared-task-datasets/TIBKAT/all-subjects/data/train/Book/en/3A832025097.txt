Palladio Virtuel
The classical villas: the impending crisis of synthesis -- The Barchessa projects: extensions into the landscape -- The virtual villa: the dissipation of the villa type
Featuring more than 300 new analytic drawings and models, this study explores the evolution of Palladio's villas from those that exhibit classical symmetrical volumetric bodies to others that exhibit no bodies at all, just fragments in a landscape
