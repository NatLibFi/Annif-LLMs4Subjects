Principles of Integrated Airborne Avionics
This book discusses the principles, approaches, concepts and development programs for integrated aircraft avionics. The functional tasks of integrated on-board radio electronic equipment (avionics) of navigation, landing, data exchange and air traffic control are formulated that meet the modern requirements of civil and military aviation, and the principles of avionics integration are proposed. The modern approaches to the joint processing of information in navigation and landing complexes are analyzed. Algorithms of multichannel information processing in integrated avionics are considered, and examples of its implementation are presented. This book is intended for scientists and professionals in the field of aviation equipment, students and graduate students of relevant specialties. .
