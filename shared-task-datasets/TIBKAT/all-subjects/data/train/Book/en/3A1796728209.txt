This book is about using “collage” among Iranian students in architecture studio, and in order to introduce the way these students use the technique to the English reader, we (Ali Yaser Jafari and Reihaneh Khorramrouei) have chosen this valuable book by AliAsghar Adibi to translate from Farsi to English. It provides a representative example of design through collage and culture. This book originally collected and published in three chapters: Collage history in different arts; Objectives and steps to make collage images; Two experienced examples.
