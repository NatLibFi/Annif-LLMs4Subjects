Principles of scattering and transport of light
"In this book we present a comprehensive introduction to the topic of scattering and transport of light. This is a classical subject that is still evolving, whilst occupying a central place in modern optical physics. At the same time, it plays a key role in multiple disciplines of applied science. Our approach is to begin with the basic theory of wave propagation, and construct a coherent framework that connects various aspects of the subject: scattering theory to radiative transport, radiative transport to diffusion, and field correlations to the statistics of speckle patterns. We note that the selection of topics is strongly influenced by the author's views on the foundations of the field, on which questions are fundamental and, quite evidently, their taste and interests. As a consequence, many important topics are omitted. These include Anderson localisation, applications of random matrix theory to multiple scattering, non-Gaussian speckle correlations, inverse problems and imaging, and effects due to nonclassical states of light, amongst others"--
