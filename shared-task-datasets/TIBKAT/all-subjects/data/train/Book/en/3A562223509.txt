Self-organized morphology in nanostructured materials
Integrating nano and microphysical effects, this book's team of expert authors offers new insights into self-organized structure formation in nanomaterials. A major question addressed in this book is the role of spatial and temporal order. In particular, you'll discover how to apply concepts developed on macroscopic and microscopic scales to structure formation occurring on nanoscales, a key focus of interest at the frontiers of science.
In this volume, concepts of nonlinear dynamics and self-organization are applied to topics in materials sciences with emphasis on semiconductors, soft matter, and biomaterials. The questions addressed include how to compare ordering phenomena under nonequilibrium situations, usually called self-organized structures, with those arising under situations close to equilibrium via selfassembly. Analogies are pointed out, differences are characterized, and efforts made to discover common features in the mechanistic description of those phenomena. Of major importance is the question of the role of sp
