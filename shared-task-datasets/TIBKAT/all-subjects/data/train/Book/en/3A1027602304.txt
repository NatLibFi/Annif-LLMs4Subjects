The Cambridge introduction to British fiction, 1900-1950
"Examining the work of more than one hundred writers, in a wide variety of genres including detective, spy, gothic, fantasy, comic, and science fiction, this book is an unusually comprehensive introduction to the novels and short stories of the period. Providing fresh readings of famous modernist figures (Conrad, Ford Madox Ford, Joyce, Woolf, Forster, Lawrence, and others), Robert L. Caserio also brings new attention to lesser-known writers who merit increased attention. He provides readers with an overview of modernist fiction's intellectual milieu, and addresses its contextualization by history and politics--feminism, global war, and the emergence of the welfare state after World War II. An ideal introduction for the student, this book offers a thought-provoking re-examination of literary history, and an exploration of the unique value of fiction's portrayals of the world"--
