Handbook of food bioengineering / edited by Alexandru Mihai Grumezescu, Alina Maria Holban ; Volume 3: Soft chemistry and food fermentation
Soft Chemistry and Food Fermentation, Volume Three, the latest release in the Handbook of Food Bioengineering series is a practical resource that provides significant knowledge and new perspectives in food processing and preservation, promoting renewable resources by applying soft ecological techniques (i.e. soft chemistry). Fermentation represents a simple and very efficient way to preserve food in developing countries where other methods, depending on specialized instruments, are not available. Through processes of soft chemistry and fermentation, food ingredients can be produced with improved properties (such as pharmabiotics) able to promote health.
