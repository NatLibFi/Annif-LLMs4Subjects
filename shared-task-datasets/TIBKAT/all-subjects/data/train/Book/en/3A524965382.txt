Physical testing of rubber
Rubber is important in many engineering applications because of its unique properties. These properties must be measured with appropriate test methods developed specifically for this class of materials. This book provides, in one volume, comprehensive coverage of the procedures for measuring the whole range of the physical properties of rubber. This new edition presents an up-to-date introduction to the standard methods used for testing, quality control analysis, product evaluation, and production of design data for rubber and elastomers. Factors to be incorporated in the revision include the effects of newer instrumentation, the cutting back of laboratory staff, increased demands for formal accreditation and calibration, trend to product testing, overlap of thermoplastic elastomers with plastics and increased need for design data.
