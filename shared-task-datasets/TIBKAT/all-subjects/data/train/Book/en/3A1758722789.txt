Fire-resistant paper : materials, technologies, and applications
"While paper is a valued product, the paper industry contributes to environmental pollution and consumption of natural resources, and the organic substances out of which traditional paper is made render it highly flammable and easy to burn. This book introduces a new technology to develop environmentally friendly fire-resistant paper using highly flexible ultralong hydroxyapatite nanowires and discusses applications and potential for commercialization. This work is aimed at materials scientists, chemical engineers, industrial chemists, and other researchers from across the scientific and engineering disciplines interested in development of this exciting alternative to traditional paper"--
