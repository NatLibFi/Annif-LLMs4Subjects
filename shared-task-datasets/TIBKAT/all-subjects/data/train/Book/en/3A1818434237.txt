Chemometrics and numerical methods in LIBS
"The LIBS community is constantly growing and it now widely recognized that LIBS techniques provide large sets of data statistical methods for simplification and analysis are essential; however, there is still some confusion on the proper application of these methods to LIBS analysis and, most of all, on the procedures that must be applied for the validation of the results obtained. The book will be organized in three parts, dealing with the main applications of chemometrics in LIBS: simplification of the spectral information, classification of spectra, quantitative analysis. Each part will be divided in sections, describing the different techniques with practical examples. For example, in Part 2, the techniques described will be discussed in the perspective of waste sorting by LIBS and LIBS micro-imaging of geological material, to mention just two of the main applications which exploits at the best the chemometric techniques of classification."--
