Smart polymers : basics and applications
Photoresponsive polymers / A.B.Samui -- Smart paints / A.B.Samui & S.S.Pawar -- Polymers for thermal energy storage / Swati Sundararajan & A. B.Samui.
"The smart materials have come in to existence during conceiving the idea of materials/systems which has 4th dimension. To match the advancement in instrumentation, efforts are being done to develop materials, which are mostly smart materials. The response of stimuli responsive polymers is reversible in nature. This has developed interest among academic area, research and industrial areas as well. The challenge remains in coupling their application with non-adverse effect on the environment. To take care of all the parameter, there is requirement to understand the basics. This book is different from other books in that it explores more on polymer materials' smart behaviour covering vibration damping, thermal and electrochemical energy, sensing at trace level, biotechnology and so on. The book is distributed in 14 chapters to discuss diverse areas, including : photoresponsive polymers that can be manipulated with specific frequency of light, designing of polymers for vibration damping, smart manipulations of hydrophic and superhydrophobic polymers,  biopolymers including hydrogel for smart application, drug delivery etc., and more. The target audience is researchers, students of higher classes and teachers involved in higher education. The text provides the basics (in brief) and applications (in detail) to provide total understanding to the readers"--
