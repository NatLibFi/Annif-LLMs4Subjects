Lyric in its times : temporalities in verse, breath, and stone
"In this important new intervention, leading poet and critic John Wilkinson explores the material life of the lyric poem. How does the lyric - considered as an object, as an event - grapple with permanence and impermanence, the rhythms of change and the passing of time? Drawing on new insights from contemporary philosophy and object-oriented ontology, psychoanalysis and the visual arts, The Lyric in Its Times includes innovative and insightful new readings of work by a wide range of lyric poets, from Shakespeare, Blake and Shelley to Charles Baudelaire, Frank O'Hara and J.H. Prynne." --
