Pro OGRE 3D programming : [leverage the power of modern real-time hardware-accelerated 3D graphics with the best-in-class 3D graphics library]
Verlagsinfo: Pro OGRE 3D Programming is your detailed guide to utilizing the OGRE 3D engine, one of the best-in-breed 3D rendering libraries available. You'll learn what OGRE is, and more importantly, what it is not. OGRE gives you an object-oriented interface to render 3D scenes independent of the implementation, such as Direct3D or OpenGL. OGRE is available on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. It can be utilized to create a variety of 3D-based applications and is commonly used in game creation. This book covers OGRE from obtaining the source to polishing the final product. If you are an aspiring game programmer with beginner/intermediate-level knowledge of game design practices and intermediate-level knowledge of the C++ language, this is the book for you. Familiarity with open source project management tools such as CVS and Subversion will also help you to digest the material. Included with the book is a ready-to-use Utility Toolkit class library useful for jumpstarting OGRE-based programs. You'll also find discussion of OGRE's capabilities from the perspective of a content creator, not just a programmer. The content of this book was reviewed prior to publication by Steve Streeting, founder and lead developer of the OGRE 3D project.
