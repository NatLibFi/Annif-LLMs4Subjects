Composite Materials : Science and Applications
The first edition of ""Composite Materials"" introduced a new way of looking at composite materials: covering composites in accordance with their functions. This second edition expands the book's scope to emphasize application-driven and process-oriented materials development. This tutorial-style reference book examines both structural composite materials and functional composite materials, as needed for a substantial range of applications. The emphasis on application-driven and process-oriented materials development is enhanced by a large amount of experimental results that provide real illus
