Glaucoma
This second Glaucoma volume of the Essentials in Ophthalmology series, like the first, provides a comprehensive picture of recent progress in both basic clinical research and applied clinical science in the study of glaucoma. Rather than a replacement for traditional textbooks on glaucoma, this volume serves as a conceptual bridge between original research and textbook presentation. The book encompasses frequently unmentioned aspects of therapy, including adherence, persistence and health economics. Glaucoma II provides the reader with diverse and salient topics reflective of the contemporary, evidence-based approach to the study, treatment and management of glaucoma.
