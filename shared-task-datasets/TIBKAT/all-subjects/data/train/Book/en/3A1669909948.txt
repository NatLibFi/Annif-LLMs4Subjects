Historia ludens : the playing historian
"This book aims to further a debate about aspects of 'playing' and 'gaming' in connection with history. Reaching out to academics, professionals and students alike, it pursues a dedicated interdisciplinary approach. Rather than only focusing on how professionals could learn from academics in history, the book also ponders the question of what academics can learn from gaming and playing for their own practice, such as gamification for teaching, or using 'play' as a paradigm for novel approaches into historical scholarship. 'Playing' and 'gaming' are thus understood as a broad cultural phenomenon that cross-pollinates the theory and practice of history and gaming alike"--
