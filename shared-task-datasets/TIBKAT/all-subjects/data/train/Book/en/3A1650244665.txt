Descriptor linear systems is an important and rich part of the general field of control systems theory. This book provides a systematic development of descriptor linear systems covering two aspects --- analysis and design. The text provides thorough introductions to the theory of continuous-time descriptor linear systems and to the basic results and recent advances in descriptor linear systems theory. Key features of Analysis and Design of Descriptor Linear Systems: • Introduces real-world examples of descriptor linear systems • Provides step-by-step algorithms for important analysis and design problems • Covers both basic and advanced results in the literature of continuous-time descriptor linear systems • Includes three appendices which supply additional relevant materials supporting the content of select chapters in the book The clear presentation of materials and extensive examples make this book easy to understand by a wide audience and therefore general readers will find this book to be a comprehensive introduction to the theory of descriptor linear systems. Researchers will find a comprehensive description of the most recent results in this theory and students will find a solid introduction and overview to some important problems in linear systems theory.
