Unlocking the potential of post-industrial cities
"This book explores why the center cities of Baltimore, Cleveland, Detroit, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis have underperformed for more than 40 years, from 1970 to the present. The authors' investigation of how these cities and their residents can escape the poverty trap is informed by quantitative social science research."
