Sensors Based on Nanostructured Materials
This book presents the many different techniques and methods of fabricating materials on the nanometer scale, and, specifically, the utilization of these resources with regard to sensors. The techniques described are studied from an application-oriented perspective, providing the reader with a perspective of the types of nanostructured sensors available that is broader than other books which concentrate on theoretical situations related to specific fabrication techniques.
