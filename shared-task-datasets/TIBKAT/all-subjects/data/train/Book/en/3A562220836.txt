Inorganic and organometallic macromolecules : design and applications
This important work is based on the editors' symposium at the 2005 ACS meeting in Washington, DC. The contents include an emphasis on main-group polymers, including boron. The chapters are not simply journal articles, but have real added value as the editors have reviewed the general area by placing the work into a larger perspective. This book will be required reading for scientists in a number of disciplines including chemical engineers and physics researchers.
