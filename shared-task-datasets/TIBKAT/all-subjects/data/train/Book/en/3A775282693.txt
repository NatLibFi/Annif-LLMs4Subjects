Water at interfaces : a molecular approach
"The behavior of water at interfaces and surfaces is still poorly understood at the molecular scale. This book is written for the practicing scientist and engineer who want a fundamental understanding of what water does at surfaces and interfaces. It covers a host of examples to convey general principles, including the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of materials, the special structure of interfacial water for biological and electrochemical processes, the role of water at biosurfaces (DNA, proteins, and membranes), friction and adhesion, marine aerosols, ice formation, wetting-dewetting, and filtration"--
