Catalysis in ionic liquids : from catalyst synthesis to application
Although ionic liquids have only been studied in depth during the last decades, the field is now maturing to such a degree that the focus is on larger scale applications for use in real processes such as catalysis. Current information is scattered across the literature and Catalysis in Ionic Liquids provides a critical analysis of the research published to date on ionic solvents in all areas of the catalytic science. The book covers both catalyst synthesis using ionic liquids as solvents and green syntheses using both ionic liquids as well as mixtures of ionic liquids and carbon dioxide (as a subcritical and supercritical liquid), including enzymatic, homogeneous, and heterogeneous catalysis, electrocatalysis and organocatalysis. As well as the catalysis community, the book will also be of interest to postgraduates, postdoctoral workers and researchers in academia and industry working in organic synthesis, new materials synthesis, renewable sources of energy and electrochemistry. Written by leading experts in the field, this is the reference source to find about catalysis in ionic liquids
