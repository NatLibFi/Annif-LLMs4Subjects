A revision of the family Adelidae of the western hemisphere (Lepidoptera: Adeloidea)
The systematics, morphology, and distributions are reviewed for the New World Adelidae. Four genera (Ceromitia, 51 species; Nemophora, 1 species; Adela, 19 species; Cauchas, 16 species) are currently recognized for North, Central, and South America. Keys to all New World genera and species are provided, as are diagnoses, illustrations, and distributional data. In this study, we are reporting 52 new species, most of which are (36 species) within the large pantropical genus Ceromitia. Additionally, we present gene trees for Adela, Cauchas, Ceromitia, and Nemophora and discuss their phylogenetic relationships
