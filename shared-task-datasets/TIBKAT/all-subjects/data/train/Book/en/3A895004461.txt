Toshio Shibata, Laurent Ney
The book presents a collection of photographs by the Japanese artist Toshio Shibata (°1949) of structures designed by the Belgian-Luxembourgish engineer Laurent Ney (°1964). Two artists, two media meeting one another. Both media deal with the same subject: the civil-engineering structure embedded in a natural setting. Both artists analyze topography, geology and landscape and detect essential forms that emphasize their artificial creations. Although temporality and locality are present in their work, there is also a kind of timelessness. Not only in the large scale; there are similar ingredients they work with. Also in the smallest detail of the individual object,texture and materiality play a predominant role
