Optical waveguide theory : mathematical models, spectral theory and numerical analysis
This book addresses the most advanced to-date mathematical approach and numerical methods in electromagnetic field theory and wave propagation. It presents the application of developed methods and techniques to the analysis of waves in various guiding structures â€”shielded and open metal-dielectric waveguides of arbitrary cross-section, planar and circular waveguides filled with inhomogeneous dielectrics, metamaterials, chiral media, anisotropic media and layered media with absorption. It also looks into spectral properties of wave propagation for the waveguide families being considered, and the relevant mathematical techniques such as spectral theory of non-self-adjoint operator-valued functions are described, including rigorous proofs of the existence of various types of waves. Further, numerical methods constructed on the basis of the presented mathematical approach and the results of numerical modeling for various structures are also described in depth. The book is beneficial to a broad spectrum of readers ranging from pure and applied mathematicians in electromagnetic field theory to researchers and engineers who are familiar with mathematics. Further, it is also useful as a supplementary text for upper-level undergraduate students interested in learning more advanced topics of mathematical methods in electromagnetics.
