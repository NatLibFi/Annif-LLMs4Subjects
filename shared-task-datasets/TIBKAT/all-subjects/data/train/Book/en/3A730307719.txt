3 weeks, 24 hours : Cimeira da NATO em Lisboa - Lisbon NATO Summit ; [arquitectura: RISCO, ambientes: P-06 Atelier]
In November 2010, the NATO Summit held in Lisbon dominated the political news of the world's media for 24 hours. In only three weeks Risco architects and P-06 designers created an ephemeral summit installation in the pavilions of Lisbon's exhibition centre, which was designed not only to meet the strict requirements for an event of this scale but also to set standards in terms of sustainability and communication design. The spaces that were created provided the framework not only for a political but also for a media event.
