Advances in plant biotechnology : in vitro production of secondary metabolites of industrial interest
"This book integrates recent knowledge on tissue culture, metabolite production under controlled conditions, the scaling-up to produce them at bioreactor level, and its industrial applications. The biosynthesis pathways, the factors that affect them, and the accumulation of metabolites, along with structure-function studies are reviewed"
