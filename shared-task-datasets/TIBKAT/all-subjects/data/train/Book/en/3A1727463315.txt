Field guide to solar optics
Optics related to solar technologies is a wide field of study. The topics covered in this Field Guide are frequently encountered in solar engineering and research for energy harvesting, particularly for electricity generation. The book includes: background on energy needs and usage, including where solar technologies fit into the energy mix; properties of the sun and foundations for solar energy collection; optical properties, concepts, and basic components; various optical systems used in solar engineering and solar energy collection; concepts for characterizing optical components/systems and analysis approaches; and measurement tools commonly used in solar engineering and research. The presentation is slanted toward solar thermal power, or as it is commonly called, concentrating solar power (CSP) technologies
