Minimally Invasive Neurosurgery and Multidisciplinary Neurotraumatology
The primary objective of neurosurgeons is to achieve the best possible outcome for patients while minimizing nervous-system injury through their interventions. Great advances in the practice of minimally invasive neurosurgery over the past couple of decades have been made possible through technological advances providing increasingly sophisticated instrumentation for use in the operating room, necessitating the acquisition of new surgical skills and know-how. Dissemination of this kind of knowledge was the common goal of two conferences, the 6th International Congress of Minimally Invasive Surgery and the 3rd World Congress of the Academy for Multidisciplinary Neurotraumatology, held concurrently in Nagoya, Japan, in March 2005. This volume of proceedings contains in their entirety the reports submitted at both these meetings, and provides valuable insights into the latest innovations in clinical neurosurgery for practitioners from a broad range of disciplines.
