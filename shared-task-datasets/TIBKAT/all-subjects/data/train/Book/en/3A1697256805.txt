Dioxin : environmental fate and health/ecological consequences
"The book provides a holistic understanding of the compound dioxin, an organic pollutant which is highly toxic to humans and animals alike. Exposure to dioxin can occur through various environmental matrices. This handbook presents an in-depth toxicological profile and human health consequences, as well as various routes and exposure pathways of dioxin and dioxin-like compounds. Given the magnitude of its spread and toxicity it is imperative to document the current state of scientific know-how, which this book essentially does, by bringing together experts from a variety of disciplines ((bio)chemistry, toxicology, environmental health/engineering) to disseminate their most recent findings"--
