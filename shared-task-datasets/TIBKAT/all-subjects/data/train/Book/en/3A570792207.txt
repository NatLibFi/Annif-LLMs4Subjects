Illacrimate sepolture : curiosità e ricerca scientifica nella storia delle riesumazioni dei Medici
The "Medici Project" – launched in 2004 – comprises a palaeopathological study of the corpses of the Medici buried in the Medici Chapels. The exhumations which took place in the past have altered the original state of the sepulchres, frequently compromising their conservation. Through the study of archive documents and iconographic material, this book is offered as a contribution to the contextualisation of these operations, and represents not only a starting-point for further investigations, but a fundamental working tool for the "Medici Project" itself
