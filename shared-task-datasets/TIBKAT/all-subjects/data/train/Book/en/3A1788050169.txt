Bioenergy crops : a sustainable means of phytoremediation
"Heavy metal and organic pollutant contamination in marginal as well as arable lands is growing as a threat to the world population. Introduction of hyperaccumulators in agricultural lands will help to remove the contaminants, but it is a time consuming process which will lead to financial crisis to the farmers. In this scenario, scientists are focused on developing or identifying plants with dual function of phytoremediation and bioenergy production. The large biomass produced by them will be utilized in biodiesel production and used as biofertilizers. Each chapter of the book presents different topics in the field of phytoremediation and bioenergy production. Some chapters highlight the economic advantages of phytoremediation and bioenergy production and also focus on the future face of the industries dealing with the same. Other chapters deal with most promising plant species for biomass production and phytoremediation, and the modern approaches that makes a hyperaccumulator a bioenergy crops"--
