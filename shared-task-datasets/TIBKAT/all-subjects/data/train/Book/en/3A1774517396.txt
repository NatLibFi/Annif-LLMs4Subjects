English lexicography from British tradition to world Englishes
"This book traces, as a starter, the evolution of English dictionaries from their earliest roots to the present state by adopting both sociolinguistic and lexicographical perspectives and aims to provide, chronologically, comprehensively and coherently, a spectacular landscape of the historical evolution of lexicographies of core native-speaker varieties of English under the influence of British lexicographical tradition and its derivation of dictionary paradigms. It attempts to break out of the limits of the dictionary-ontology paradigm and put relevant research against socio-cultural contexts in which those lexicographies emerge and develop. Its primary aim is to unfold a vivid, coherent and complete picture of how lexicographies of core native-speaker varieties of English (other than British) originate and develop, directly or indirectly, from their British roots to modern forms, highlighting their evolutional links with and inheritance from British (occasionally American) lexicographical tradition, their interrelation to socio-cultural settings, as well as their reformation and divergences through innovation and self-expansion. For the first time, this book presents under one cover a coherent and integrated panorama of lexicographies of core native-speaker varieties of English from early sprouts to current shapes and from emergence to prosperity"--
