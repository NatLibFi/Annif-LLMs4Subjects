Solid state engineering physics
This textbook presents the fundamental concepts and theories in solid-state engineering physics in a very simple, systematic, and comprehensive way. The book is written in a lucid manner so that students are able to understand the realization behind the mathematical concepts which are the backbone of this subject. All the subject fundamentals and related derivations are discussed in an easy and comprehensive way to make the students strong about the basics of the solid-state engineering physics. The philosophy of presentation and material content in the book are based on concept-based approach toward the subject. The key features also lie in the solutions of several interesting numerical problems so that the students should have the idea of the practical usages of the subject. The book will benefit students who are taking introductory courses in solid-state physics for engineering.
