International relations theory
PART 1. Images of international relations theory -- PART 2. Interpretive understandings & normative considerations -- PART 3. The intellectual roots of IR theory. This book is the longest-standing and best-selling IR theory text on the market, popular for the authors' clear and readable explanations of the various IR world views. Newer editions identify separate interpretive understandings-positivism, feminism, and those influenced by phenomenology-post-modernism, critical theory, and constructivism.
