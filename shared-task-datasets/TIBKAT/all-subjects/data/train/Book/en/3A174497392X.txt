The rapid pace of technological change and globalization of products, competition and services have conspired to place a new premium on innovation for firms across the world. Although many variables influence creativity and innovation, the effective leadership of creative teams has proved especially important. This timely Handbook presents the state of the art for what leaders must do to lead creative teams and how they should do it. Handbook of Research on Leadership and Creativity is divided into three major sections. The first section on leadership functions identifies key activities that must be executed by leaders if creative efforts are to prove successful. The next section explains creative leadership using available theoretical models, examining the effects of leader behaviors on follower creativity. The final section investigates specific domains where organizations seek creativity. It covers the creative domains of research and development as well as military and academia, which have not traditionally been viewed as domains where creative leadership is critical. This comprehensive Handbook makes a significant contribution to the literature on creativity and innovation and will be welcomed as an accessible yet authoritative text by students, teachers and researchers alike
