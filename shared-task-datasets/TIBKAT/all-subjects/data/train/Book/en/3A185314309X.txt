Toward artificial general intelligence : deep learning, neural networks, generative AI
Artifi cial Intelligence (AI) has been an exciting fi eld of study and research in educational institutions and research labs across the globe. Technology giants and IT organizations invest heavily on AI technologies and tools with the aim of preciselyautomating a variety of simple as well as complicated business operations acrossindustry verticals. This book covers the latest trends and transitions happening in thefuturistic AI domain. The book also focuses on machine and deep learning (ML/DL)algorithms, which are, undoubtedly, the mainstream implementation technologies ofstate-of-the-art AI systems and services. Also, there are chapters on computer vision(CV) and natural language processing (NLP), the primary use cases and applicationsof AI. The book has well-written chapters for demystifying AI model engineeringmethods. Further on, our esteemed readers can fi nd details on AI model evaluation,optimization, deployment and observability. Finally, the book deals and describesgenerative AI, the latest buzzword in the IT industry.  The book  presents the recent ground-breaking changes taking place in the aspects of AI model building, hosting, running and maintaining in cloud environments,  articulates and accentuates the most recent developments taking place in the  domain of Artifi cial Intelligence,  covers the noteworthy innovations and disruptions towards Generative Artifi cial  Intelligence (Generative AI),  explains the breakthrough innovations and disruptions towards Artifi cial General  Intelligence (AGI)  and delineates an engaging discussion of Natural Language Processing, Neuromorphic Systems and Biometrics
