Fiscal policy and social welfare : an analysis of alternative tax and transfer systems
In Fiscal Policy and Social Welfare John Creedy examines alternative tax and transfer systems and their redistributive effects. Drawing on original research, this volume concentrates on modelling tax structures and their implications for social welfare and income distribution. After reviewing various inequality and tax progressivity measures, as well as social welfare functions, the discussion moves systematically from a framework with fixed labour supplies to one in which labour supplies respond to changes in the tax system. Attention is given to taxes in a multi-period context, including the treatment of pension schemes. Finally, the analysis is extended to a general equilibrium framework involving many individuals. Extensive use is made of numerical examples and diagrams. Researchers, students and policy makers will welcome this rigorous and consistent treatment of alternative tax and transfer systems and their effects on social welfare, income distribution and tax progressivity, in both partial and general equilibrium contexts
