International Classification of HRCT for Occupational and Environmental Respiratory Diseases
Many international experts collaborated in creating this groundbreaking work, a principal-coding system, and in developing reference films and imaging parameters for the International Classification of HRCT for Occupational and Environmental Respiratory Diseases. The book is an authoritative guide to the recognition of dust diseases of the lung, using radiological imaging techniques, with special emphasis on high-resolution computerized tomography (CT). The classification is a powerful, essential tool for recording patient data on CT in a globally standardized semiquantitative way. The system is also applicable to surveillance and screening for occupational and environmental respiratory diseases. With the accompanying CD-ROM containing all the reference films, readers can easily interpret clinical data. The book is a valuable resource not only for radiologists but for all who work in occupational medicine and public health.
