Comparative economic studies in Europe : a thirty year review
This book is written in honor of Horst Brezinski and explores a wide and diverse range of topics related to comparative economic studies. Containing contributions from a number of former Presidents of the European Association for Comparative Economic Studies, the chapters discuss the hard budget constraint, economic transformation in Central Eastern Europe, illiberal democracy, sovereign wealth fund, higher education, the euro, the shadow economy, multinational companies, and economic power. Additional attention is given to new areas of study such as the digital economy and sports economics. This book aims to examine comparative economies across a wide range of geographical areas including China, Hungary, the United Kingdom, Poland, and the United States and will be relevant to those interested in emerging and transition economies, the political economy, economic policy, and international relations.
