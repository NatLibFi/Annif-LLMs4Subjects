Multiagent systems : introduction and coordination control
"Multiagent systems offer tremendous opportunities for development in computing and its applications. The objective of this book is to identify preliminary requirements and fundamental issues related to multiagent systems; provide coherent solutions for adopting multiagent framework for examining problems critically in smart microgrid systems; and present advanced analysis of multiagent systems under cyber-physical attacks and develop resilient control strategies to guarantee safe operation. The book is a comprehensive volume on the subject"--
