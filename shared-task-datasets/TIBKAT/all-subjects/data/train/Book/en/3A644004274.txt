Africa water atlas
This "Africa Water Atlas" is a visual account of Africa's endowment and use of water resources, revealed through 224 maps and 104 satellite images as well as some 500 graphics, hundreds of compelling photos plus a brief profile of the water situation in every country. These visual elements vividly illustrate a succinct narrative describing and analysing Africa's water issues and exemplifying them through the judicious use of case studies. The Atlas tells the paradoxical story of a continent with adequate renewable water resources, but unequal access because the water is either abundant or scarce depending on the season or the place. It explores the opportunities to develop Africa's untapped water resources and human capacities to deliver safe drinking water and sanitation services to achieve the water-related Millennium Development Goals, as well as hydropower and irrigation services that help support livelihoods and boost economic development.
