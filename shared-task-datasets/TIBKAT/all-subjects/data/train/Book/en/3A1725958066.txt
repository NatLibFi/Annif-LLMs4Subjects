This study proposes a revised interpretation of Foucault's views on literature. It has been argued that the philosopher's interest in literature was limited to the 1960s and of a mostly depoliticized nature. However, Foucault's previously unpublished later works suggest a different reality, showing a sustained interest in literature and its politics. In the light of this new material, the book repositions Foucault's ideas within recent debates on the politics of literature
