The urban masterplanning handbook
This important resource features 20 examples of masterplans that are rigorously analysed visually through drawings and diagrams that are specially drawn to scale. As well as providing high quality graphical representations of its subjects, the reference gives an important new emphasis on the processes and structures that influence the form of these projects. It reveals whether a masterplan has been privately or publicly funded, if it has been planned as a single entity, or through multiple subdivisions of land, if it has been initiated by an individual landowner or by the city through expropriation. These significant influences are highlighted in the individual case study texts and through highly legible diagrams and also by the comparisons made between the projects
