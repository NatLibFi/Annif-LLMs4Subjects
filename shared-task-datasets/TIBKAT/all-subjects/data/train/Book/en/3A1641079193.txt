Plasma physics in active wave ionosphere interaction
Basis of plasma -- Electromagnetic property of plasma and plasma modes -- Kinetic-derivation and analysis of the dielectric tensor -- Electromagnetic wave propagation in the ionosphere -- Electromagnetic wave interaction with the ionosphere -- Parametric instabilities -- Parametric instabilities excited in high-frequency heating experiments -- Nonlinear plasma waves -- Ionospheric very-low-frequency transmitter
"Theories are connected to the represented (HF heating) experiments, which enables readers to grasp and appreciate the study. HF heating experiments are active research area, this book provides theoretical basis for the understanding of the experimental observations and for preparing future experiments. Home-work problems contain not only physics questions, but also engineering questions which have practical applications and are attractive to engineers as well"--
