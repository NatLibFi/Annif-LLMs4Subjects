Rechargeable lithium batteries : from fundamentals to applications
Rechargeable Lithium Batteries: From Fundamentals to Application provides an overview of rechargeable lithium batteries, from fundamental materials, though characterization and modeling, to applications. The market share of lithium ion batteries is fast increasing due to their high energy density and low maintenance requirements. Lithium air batteries have the potential for even higher energy densities, a requirement for the development of electric vehicles, and other types of rechargeable lithium battery are also in development. After an introductory chapter providing an overview of the main scientific and technological challenges posed by rechargeable Li batteries, Part One of this book reviews materials and characterization of rechargeable lithium batteries. Part Two covers performance and applications, discussing essential aspects such as battery management, battery safety and emerging rechargeable lithium battery technologies as well as medical and aerospace applications
