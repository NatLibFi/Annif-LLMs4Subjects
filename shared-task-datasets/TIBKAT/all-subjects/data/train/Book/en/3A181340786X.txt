Matrix cracking in ceramic-matrix composites
This book focuses on the matrix cracking behavior in ceramicâ€“matrix composites (CMCs), including first matrix cracking behavior, matrix cracking evolution behavior, matrix crack opening and closure behavior considering temperature and oxidation. The micro-damage mechanisms are analyzed, and the micromechanical damage models are developed to characterize the cracking behavior. Experimental matrix cracking behavior of different CMCs at room and elevated temperatures is predicted. The book can help the material scientists and engineering designers to better understand the cracking behavior in CMCs.
