Repetitive DNA
The experimental data that have been generated using new molecular techniques associated with the completion of genome projects have changed our perception of the structural features, functional implications and evolutionary dynamics of repetitive DNA sequences. This volume of Genome Dynamics provides a valuable update on recent developments in research into multigene families, centromeres, telomeres, microsatellite DNA, satellite DNA, and transposable elements. Each chapter presents a review by distinguished experts and analyzes repetitive DNA diversity and abundance, as well as the impact on genome structure, function and evolution.This publication is targeted at scientists and scholars at every level, from students to faculty members, and, indeed, anyone involved or interested in genetics, molecular evolution, molecular biology as well as genomics will find it a valuable source of up-to-date information
