Corporate governance and China's H-share market
Using detailed case studies of the first nine mainland Chinese companies to be listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange (1993-94), Alice de Jonge examines the evolution of corporate governance law and culture in China's H-share market. A story emerges not of tensions between ideas of corporate governance from two different legal systems--Hong Kong vs. mainland Chinese--nor about legal convergence as China adopts concepts from Anglo-American jurisdictions. Rather, it is a story of individual firms being pragmatic in mediating the different agendas of state-agencies that own or control them. Corporate Governance and China's H-Share Market looks at corporate governance in a cross-border context, is unique in providing a detailed understanding of China's H-share market, reveals why a beer company was the first ever Chinese firm to be listed overseas. This fascinating work will appeal to postgraduate students and scholars of corporate governance, Asian law and legal systems and Asian business, as well as Chinese scholars more generally. Professionals such as law practitioners working in Chinese law will also find the book of interest
