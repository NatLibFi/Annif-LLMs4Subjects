High-performance/high-strength lightweight concrete for bridge girders and decks
"TRB's National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 733: High-Performance/High-Strength Lightweight Concrete for Bridge Girders and Decks presents proposed changes to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials' Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) bridge design and construction specifications to address the use of lightweight concrete in bridge girders and decks.  The proposed specifications are designed to help highway agencies evaluate between comparable designs of lightweight and normal weight concrete bridge elements so that an agency's ultimate selection will yield the greatest economic benefit. The attachments contained in the research agency's final report provide elaborations and detail on several aspects of the research.  Attachments A and B provide proposed changes to AASHTO LRFD bridge design and bridge construction specifications, respectively; these are included in the print and PDF version of the report.  Attachments C through R are available for download below.    Attachments C, D, and E contain a detailed literature review, survey results, and a literature summary and the approved work plan, respectively.  Attachment C; Attachment D ; Attachment E; Attachments F through M provide details of the experimental program that were not able to be included in the body of this report.   Attachment F; Attachment G; Attachment H; Attachment I; Attachment J; Attachment K; Attachment L; Attachment M.  Attachments N through Q present design examples of bridges containing lightweight concrete and details of the parametric study.  Attachment N; Attachment O; Attachment P; Attachment Q.   Attachment R is a detailed reference list."--Publication information
