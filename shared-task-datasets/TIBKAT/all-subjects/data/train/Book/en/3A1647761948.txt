The University Department of Psychiatry in Munich : From Kraepelin and his predecessors to molecular psychiatry
The building history of the Munich clinic substantiates the developments in psychiatry during the past 100 years; but sole illustration of the constructional aspects would be dull and impersonal. The development of a clinic could be understood as a life story, in which not only the building and organisation structure itself, but also the patients treated in the clinic and the people working there should be taken into consideration: Doctors from the Munich clinic have always enhanced the development of clinical psychiatry and psychiatric science decisively. As such, the names of Emil Kraepelin and Alois Alzheimer are known to all psychiatrists all over the world nowadays - even to those, who do not realize that the scientific work of these names are closely linked to the Munich clinic.
