Modern X86 Assembly Language Programming : 32-bit, 64-bit, SSE, and AVX
Modern X86 Assembly Language Programming shows the fundamentals of x86 assembly language programming. It focuses on the aspects of the x86 instruction set that are most relevant to application software development. The book's structure and sample code are designed to help the reader quickly understand x86 assembly language programming and the computational capabilities of the x86 platform. Major topics of the book include the following: 32-bit core architecture, data types, internal registers, memory addressing modes, and the basic instruction set X87 core architecture, register stack, special purpose registers, floating-point encodings, and instruction set MMX technology and instruction set Streaming SIMD extensions (SSE) and Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) including internal registers, packed integer arithmetic, packed and scalar floating-point arithmetic, and associated instruction sets 64-bit core architecture, data types, internal registers, memory addressing modes, and the basic instruction set 64-bit extensions to SSE and AVX technologies X86 assembly language optimization strategies and techniques
