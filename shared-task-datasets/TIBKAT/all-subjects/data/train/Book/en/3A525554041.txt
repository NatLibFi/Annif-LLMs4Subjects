Juveniles in secure settings : services for problematic drug and alcohol users
In many European countries, little is known regarding juvenile offenders with problematic drug and alcohol use. Their use prior to prison tends to be recreational or exploratory, rather than dependent or due to addiction. During incarceration in secure settings, problematic drug and alcohol use among juvenile offenders is not routinely addressed and services remain insufficiently developed. The relationship between juvenile offending, deprived social background, low level of education, experiences of sexual of physical abuse, problematic alcohol and substance misuse has been underlined in various studies, but is addressed differently across Europe. This study, conducted in Belgium, Denmark, England, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Slovakia and Spain, explores some of these differences while finding that drug use is a common key contributing factor to juvenile offending. <engl.>
