The Computer Graphics Manual
This book presents a broad overview of computer graphics (CG), its history, and the hardware tools it employs. Covering a substantial number of concepts and algorithms, the text describes the techniques, approaches, and algorithms at the core of this field. Emphasis is placed on practical design and implementation, highlighting how graphics software works, and explaining how current CG can generate and display realistic-looking objects. The mathematics is non-rigorous, with the necessary mathematical background introduced in the Appendixes. Features: includes numerous figures, examples and solved exercises; discusses the key 2D and 3D transformations, and the main types of projections; presents an extensive selection of methods, algorithms, and techniques; examines advanced techniques in CG, including the nature and properties of light and color, graphics standards and file formats, and fractals; explores the principles of image compression; describes the important input/output graphics devices.  David Salomon is a professor emeritus of Computer Science at California State University, Northridge. He has authored numerous articles and Springer books, including Elements of Computer Security, Handbook of Data Compression, A Concise Introduction to Data Compression, Variable-length Codes for Data Compression, Transformations and Projections in Computer Graphics, Curves and Surfaces for Computer Graphics, Coding for Data and Computer Communications, Data Privacy and Security, and A Guide to Data Compression Methods.
