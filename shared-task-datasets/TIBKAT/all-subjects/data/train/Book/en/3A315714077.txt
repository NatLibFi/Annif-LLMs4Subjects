Introducing robotics with Lego MindStorms
Shows the reader how to build a variety of increasingly sophisticated computer controlled robots using the Lego Mindstorms Robotic Invention System (RIS). Initially, this book covers fundamental building techniques and mechanics needed to construct strong and efficient robots using the various 'click-together' components supplied in the basic RIS kit. Then explains in simple terms how the 'brain' of the robot may be programmed on screen using a PC and 'zapped' to the robot over an infra red link. Also, shows how a more sophisticated Windows programming language such as Visual BASIC may be used to control the robots.
