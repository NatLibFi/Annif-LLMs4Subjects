The book offers a combination of the basic knowledge needed over the long term plus current, specific risk issues, and includes practical applications based on quantitative examples. It thus offers an integrated model of corporate risk management. Prof. Dr. Thomas Wolke (Hochschule f√ºr Wirtschaft und Recht Berlin)
