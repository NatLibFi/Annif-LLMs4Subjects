Cognitive radio techniques : spectrum sensing, interference mitigation, and localization
Providing an in-depth treatment of the core enablers of cognitive radio technology, this unique book places emphasis on critical areas that have not been sufficiently covered in existing literature. You find expert guidance in the key enablers with respect to communications and signal processing. The book presents fundamentals, basic solutions, detailed discussions of important enabler issues, and advanced algorithms to save you time with your projects in the field. For the first time in any book, you find an adequately detailed treatment of spectrum sensing that covers nearly every aspect of the subject. Moreover, this valuable resource provides you with thorough working knowledge of localization and interference mitigation as enablers of cognitive radio technology. The book includes all the necessary mathematics, statistical and probabilistic treatments, and performance analysis to give you a comprehensive understanding of the material
