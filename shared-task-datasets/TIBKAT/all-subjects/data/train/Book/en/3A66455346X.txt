Chalcogenides form a special class of materials, which have one or more of the elements from the chalcogen group, Group VI in the Periodic Table (S, Se. or Te) as a constituent, the chalcogen is mixed with other elements to form various ""new"" compounds and alloys. Chalcogenides are noncrystalline solids because their structure is ""amorphous"" or ""glassy"". Such structures have totally different properties than crystalline solids. Chalcogenide glasses have a number of very interesting and useful properties, which have been already exploited in the commercialization of new devices."
