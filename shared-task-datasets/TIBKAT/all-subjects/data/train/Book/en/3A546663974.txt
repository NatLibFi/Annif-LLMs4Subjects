Structural Approaches to Sequence Evolution : Molecules, Networks, Populations
Recent advances in understanding the thermodynamics of macromolecules, the topological properties of gene networks, the organization and mutation capabilities of genomes, and the structure of populations make it possible to incorporate these key elements into a broader and deeply interdisciplinary view of molecular evolution. This book gives an account of such a new approach, through clear tutorial contributions by leading scientists.
Structural requirements constrain the evolution of biological entities at all levels, from macromolecules to their networks, right up to populations of biological organisms. This book gives an account of structural approaches to sequence evolution, through tutorial contributions by scientists specializing in the different fields involved
