Nanotechnology in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine
"Referred to as "nanomedicine" or "nanobiomedicine," the application of nanotechnology to medicine can impact diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of diseases as well as control and understanding of biological systems. Bringing together an unparalleled field of experts, this volume explores various aspects of nanotechnology and its applications in biomedical fields. The book uses an application-based approach to relate laboratory-based research to the development of technologies that can be readily adaptable to an industrial environment, focusing chiefly on drug delivery, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine"--Provided by publisher
