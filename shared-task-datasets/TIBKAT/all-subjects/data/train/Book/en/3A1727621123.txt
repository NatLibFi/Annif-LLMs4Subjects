Materials Science and Design for Engineers
Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters BCI (WoS).The uniqueness of the title of this book, Materials Science and Design for Engineers, already indicates that the authors - professionals having over 30 years of experience in the fields of materials science and engineering - are here tackling the rarely-discussed topic of the science of materials as directly related to the domain of design in engineering applications. This comprehensive textbook has now filled that gap in the engineering literature. This textbook is intended for engineering students taking their first course in materials science and engineering. The authors integrate materials science concepts with materials design for structural, aerospace, energy, electronic, automotive, and biomedical engineering applications. The book's four sections address the fundamentals of materials science and engineering, physical and mechanical metallurgy, design of engineering alloys, and the science and design of non-metallic materials. Chapters conclude with a summary, additional information, questions and problems, and relevant materials selection and design problems. Authors are Huda (materials engineering, King Saud U., Saudi Arabia) and Bulpett (advanced research fellow, Experimental Techniques Centre, Brunel U., UK).
