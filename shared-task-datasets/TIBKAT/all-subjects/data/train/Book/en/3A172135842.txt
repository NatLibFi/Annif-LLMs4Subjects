Hawai øi : return to nationhood
Rezension: "Contains thought-provoking essays that depict the same tragedy that befell all aboriginal peoples when encountering European people; loss of their homeland and way of life. It's an essential resource that describes the underside of Hawaiian history and the resilience of the Polynesian people who like the American Indian, Maoris & Australian aborigines continue to assert their rights for justice despite the overwhelming odds that have faced them since their toxic encounter with their conquerers."
