Compression textiles for medical, sports, and allied applications
"Textile-based compression therapy is used in range of applications, such as for athlete and sport recovery, enhanced proprioception, compression spacesuits, and in management of chronic disease. Textiles for Compression provides an overview of compression devices and products, testing methods to measure properties of materials used in compression devices, and design considerations based on dynamic body measurements. It also includes a model for predicting pressure and details challenges in applying compression for various applications. - Discusses the science behind compression therapy - Delves into the materials used in compression devices and products and assesses their performance based on properties and structure - Covers theoretical modeling to predict the pressure exerted by compression devices on the human body - Considers compression textile design based on dynamic body measurements This book is aimed at professionals and researchers in textile engineering, materials engineering, medical practitioners - Phlebologist, biotechnology, and development of textile-based compression devices and products"--
