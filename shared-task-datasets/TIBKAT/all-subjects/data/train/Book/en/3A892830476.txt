Progress & prosperity : the Chinese city as a global urban model
This publication focusses on the shift from building for construction's sake to that of building for progress. After decades of extraordinary development and urbanization, Chinese cities have arrived at a stage of "New Normal". Urban development is now shifting from quantity-driven to quality-driven, with art and culture as a tasty topping for countless developments. It examines the future of (Chinese) cities as a "testimony from the battleground", and how their current metamorphosis can impact cities worldwide especially in the Global South. The key argument is: China has developed a very appealing urban model. Could this be a blueprint for cities worldwide, like the Italian city was once a blueprint for the Northern European city?
