The Oxford anthology of Tudor drama
This anthology is the sister volume to 'The Oxford Handbook of Tudor Drama'. It contains sixteen of the most important, innovative, and dramatically exciting plays from the long Tudor century (1485-1603) newly edited in accessible modern spelling from original manuscripts or printed texts.

For in reality 'medieval' plays such as the magnificent York mystery cycle and the interludes of John Heywood were being performed through much of the sixteenth century, alongside 'Renaissance' works such as the comedy 'Gammer Gurton's Needle' and Jasper Heywood's English re-imagining of Seneca's tragedy of blood, 'Thyestes'
