Anti-Inflammatory Drug Discovery
Anti-Inflammatory Drug Discovery provides a comprehensive review of recent medicinal chemistry approaches to a variety of important therapeutic targets and provides a key reference for those interested in the prosecution of modern drug discovery programs directed at anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action. The editors, with extensive experience in this field, have selected key thought-leaders who will bring their experience to the medicinal chemistry literature for each target, ranging from components of the arachadonic acid cascade, to kinases, GPCRs, sphingolipids and others, to summarize its background biology and detail new insights, major advances and issues related to bringing new anti-inflammatory therapies to market. Consisting of five main sections key targets covered will include the AA Cascade: mPGES1, cPLA2, Leukotriene A4 Hydrolase, CRTH2; Kinases: P38/PDE4, MAPKAP Kinase 2 (MK2), Syk Kinase Inhibitors, Jak Kinases, IKK , Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase; GPCRs: CCR1, CCR2 Antagonists, CB2 Agonists; Sphingolipids: S1P1 Receptor Agonists, Sphingosine Lyase and Sphingosine Kinase 1 and a final miscellaneous section that looks at Non-Steroidal Dissociated Glucocorticoid Receptor Agonists. The book will be essential reading for pharmacologists, medicinal chemists and pharmaceutical scientists working in industry and academia.
