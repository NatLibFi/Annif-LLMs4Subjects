Principles and applications of fourier optics
Fourier optics, being a staple of optical design and analysis for over 50 years, has produced many new applications in recent years. In this text, Bob Tyson presents the fundamentals of Fourier optics with sufficient detail to educate the reader, typically an advanced student or working scientist or engineer, to the level of applying the knowledge to a specific set of design or analysis problems. Instead of presenting complex multipage proofs the key results are presented with appropriate literature references, before proceeding to look at modern applications. This allows readers to take away a solid appreciation of the principles to enable them to appreciate the range of applications and be able to start using Fourier optics in their research or industrial work. Well aware that many of the mathematical techniques used in the field can now be solved digitally, the book will point to those methods or applicable computer software available to the reader
