Heterogeneous catalysis : experimental and theoretical studies
"This book contains a collection of papers that Professor Eli Ruckenstein and his co-workers have published in the area of heterogeneous catalysis during the past four decades. Chapters 1-3 deal with a number of catalysts involved in various catalytic reactions including methane CO2 reforming, methane partial oxidation, and catalytic combustion; Chapters 4-6 are concerned with applications of various materials such as zeolites, mesoporous V-Mg-O oxides, polymers and polymer-coated SiO2 as catalysts or catalyst supports; Chapter 7 is devoted to theoretical and experimental investigations of metal sintering in model catalysts during heating in various atmospheres; and Chapter 8 deals with some theoretical approaches relevant to heterogeneous catalysis. Each chapter contains a summary, analyses and connections to present-day R&D applications. This book will be of interest to catalytic and material scientists from universities and industry and to graduate students"--
