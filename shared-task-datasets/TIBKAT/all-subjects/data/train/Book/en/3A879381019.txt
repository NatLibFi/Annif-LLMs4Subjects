Sensory and aroma marketing
This book explains how sensory and aroma marketing is used by food companies to improve the sales of their products at different locations. It starts with an introductory section about the current relevance of this field, and the foundation of how senses can affect consumers' behaviours. Then, it moves into different chapters highlighting the importance of each one of the senses in marketing strategies (smell, sight, sound, taste, and touch). Perhaps for readers the role of smell, sight, smell, and taste are obvious in selling strategies and in bringing positive experiences, memories, and feelings, but the book also provides examples of how touch and sound guide consumer decisions. The final chapter looks into the future. 'Sensory and aroma marketing' should be easily understood by university students interested in Food Science and Technology, make sensory marketing reachable and useful at the industry as well as at the academic and research levels. Readers will be able to answer questions which all consumers bear in mind. For example: is it possible to 'manipulate' consumers in choosing a specific food by using a specific aroma or locating the product at a proper height in a supermarket; and is it possible to control how much time a consumer spends in a hypermarket by using a specific music rhythm?
