Peace and democratic society
"Recent acts of terrorism and the current unrest in the Middle East remind us how important it is to understand the relationship between peace and democracy. In an insightful introductory essay to this report, Nobel laureate Amartya Sen challenges widely accepted explanations for violence. He makes a plea for a global, multilateral debate on the causes of conflict, and an understanding of the multiple identities of the individuals involved. The introductory essay draws on the findings of the Commonwealth Commission on Respect and Understanding, which was chaired by Sen, and established to promote mutual communication and understanding among all faiths and communities in the Commonwealth. Its timely report, "Civil Paths to Peace", suggests that governments, media and educators—indeed, everyone—must take the time to understand the complexities around violent behaviour and its causes, without prejudging what these might be."--Publisher's website
