Introduction to quantum field theory and the standard model
"Based on the lectures given at TU Munich for third-year physics students, this book provides the basic concepts of relativistic quantum field theory, perturbation theory, Feynman graphs, Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories, with application to QED, QCD, and the electroweak Standard Model. It also introduces quantum field theory and particle physics for beginning graduate students with an orientation towards particle physics and its theoretical foundations. Phenomenology of W and Z bosons, as well as Higgs bosons, is part of the electroweak chapter in addition to recent experimental results, precision tests and current status of the Standard Model"--
