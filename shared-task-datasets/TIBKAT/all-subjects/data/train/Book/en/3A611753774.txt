Low molecular weight organic semiconductors
"This up-to-date reference for students and researchers in the field is the first systematic treatment of the property measurements of organic semiconductor materials. Following an introduction, the book goes on to treat the structural analysis of thin films and spectroscopy of electronic states. Subsequent sections deal with optical spectroscopy and charge transport. An invaluable source for understanding, handling and applying this key type of material for physicists, materials scientists, graduate students, and analytical laboratories."--P. [4] of cover
