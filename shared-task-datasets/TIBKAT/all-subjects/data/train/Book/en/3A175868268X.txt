Optical and molecular physics : theoretical principles and experimental methods
"Optical and Molecular Physics: Theoretical Principles and Experimental Methods addresses many important applications and advances in the field. The book is divided into 5 sections: Plasmonics and carbon dots physics with applications Optical films, fibers, and materials Optical properties of advanced materials Molecular physics and diffusion Macromolecular physics The volume also looks at optical materials in the development of composite materials for the functionalization of glass, ceramic, and polymeric substrates to interact with electromagnetic radiation. The book presents state-of-the-art research in the preparation methods, optical characterization, and usage of optical materials and devices in various photonic fields. It integrates materials science with other engineering subjects, such as physics, chemistry, and electrical engineering. The authors discuss devices and technologies used by the electronics, magnetics, and photonics industries and offer perspectives on the manufacturing technologies used in device fabrication. Weaving together science and engineering aspects, this book maintains a careful balance between fundamentals and technological aspects to cover applications for a variety of fields. The volume will be an invaluable resource that offers a broad selection of information and research on key ideas, formulae, techniques, and results in optical and molecular physics"--
