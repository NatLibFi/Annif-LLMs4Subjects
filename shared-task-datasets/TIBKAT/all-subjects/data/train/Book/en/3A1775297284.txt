Spectroscopy for materials analysis : an introduction
This book includes X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, electron spectroscopy, and atomic emission spectroscopy, which are now extensively employed in material analysis. This book is organized as a guide for undergraduate students and engineers who wish to study analytical spectroscopy in material science. An objective of this book is to explain the principles of those methods of spectroscopy only with basic mathematical expressions and to introduce their applications to actual materials
