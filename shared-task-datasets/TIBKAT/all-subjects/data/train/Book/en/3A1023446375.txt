Employment, growth and development : a post-Keynesian approach
Bringing together over a dozen post-Keynesian experts on the issues of employment, growth, development and exchange rates, this book breaks new ground by offering interesting and innovative insights into the problems faced today in both developed and developing countries. This topical book addresses unemployment in Europe, the wrong-headed reliance on NAIRU to formulate policy, distributional conflicts and financial factors, as well as problems faced in developing countries with respect to exchange rate policy, central banking, challenges to growth, and international financial flows. In the first part of the book the chapters deal with issues related to employment policies, economic growth and development while the second part is dedicated to development and growth issues in open-economy developing countries.
