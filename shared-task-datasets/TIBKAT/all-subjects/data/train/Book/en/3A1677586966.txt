The United Nations and changing world politics
The revised and updated Introduction to this classic text situates the UN in substantially changing world politics, including: the election of the ninth Secretary-General, António Guterres; the burgeoning of “new nationalisms” worldwide, including most importantly in the Trump administration’s Washington, DC, and Brexit; the continuing proliferation of such non-state actors as ISIS and those in the “third UN,” including developmental and humanitarian NGOs.
