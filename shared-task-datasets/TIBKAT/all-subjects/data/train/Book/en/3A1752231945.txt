"The world's ever-increasing use of plastics has created large areas of floating plastic waste in the oceans. Nanoplastics and microplastics have made their way into food, particularly in the marine environment. They have been found in in crustaceans and bivalve mollusks like oysters and mussels, where the digestive tract is eaten. They have also been reported in honey, beer, and table salt. This book discusses the fate of microplastics and nanoplastics in the environment and discusses sampling and analysis methods detecting and identifying them"--
