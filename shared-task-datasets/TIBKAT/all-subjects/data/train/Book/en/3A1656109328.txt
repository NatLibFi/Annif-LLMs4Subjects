Magnetorheology : advances and applications
Magnetorheological fluids, smart fluids which change viscosity in the presence of a magnetic field, are of great commercial interest for many engineering applications such as shock absorbers and dampers in aerospace. Magnetorheology: Advances and Applications provides an update on the key developments in the physics, chemistry and uses of magnetorheological fluids. Topics covered include the role of interparticle friction and rotational diffusion, magnetoelasticity, nondimensional flow analysis, thin-film rheology, tribology, coated magnetorheological composite particles and magnetorheological
