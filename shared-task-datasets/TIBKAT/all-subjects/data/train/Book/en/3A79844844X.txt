Culture, health, and religion at the millennium : Sweden unparadised
"Culture, Health and Religion at the Millennium : Sweden Unparadised presents interpretations of Swedish culture, health, politics, and religion today, as the image of Sweden is being transformed from the well-functioning but existentially bland economic wonder to a more pluralistic, fragmented and gloomy society. The changing situation of contemporary Sweden means that the time is ripe to make a self-critical appraisal of the state of Sweden today. In six chapters, renowned Swedish scholars from film studies, literary studies, political science, religious studies and theology give their interpretations of sin, culture, health, politics, and religion in contemporary Sweden, with a particular focus upon its cultural representation in popular media. This book will serve as a background of much of the contemporary boom of Swedish fiction, both in popular literature as well as on the silver screen"--Provided by publisher
