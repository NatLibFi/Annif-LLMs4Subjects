Optimizing factory performance : cost-effective ways to achieve significant and sustainable improvement; [introducing manufacturing's third dimension]
"TQM, Reengineering, Theory of Constraints, JIT, Six Sigma, Lean Manufacturing ... These are just some of the methods that, over the past five decades, have promised to transform any manufacturing firm into a lean, mean, money-making machine. While each incorporates certain fundamental truths, strengths, and benefits, they are not panaceas. Nor do they necessarily provide much-needed insight into the science that underlies factory performance." "James Ignizio, an internationally recognized performance optimization expert, believes that only a balanced approach will provide the significant and sustainable improvement required of firms who will survive and prosper in the twenty-first century. In this guide, Dr. Ignizio picks up where such concepts as Six Sigma and Lean Manufacturing leave off to provide a holistic, three-dimensional approach to mastering the art and science of manufacturing."--BOOK JACKET
