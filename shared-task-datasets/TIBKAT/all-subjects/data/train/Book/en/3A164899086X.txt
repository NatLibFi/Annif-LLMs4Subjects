Handbook of Cancer Survivorship
Not long ago, a cancer diagnosis was regarded as an automatic death sentence, today there are ten million survivors. Equally impressive is the growing number of clinicians and researchers dedicated to improving the quality of survivors' lives and care. Yet despite this encouraging picture, there has never been a reliable central source for relevant clinical information - till now. The Handbook on Cancer Survivorship responds to the diverse needs of survivors and their support communities by comprehensively addressing the major issues in the field, from the burden of survivorship to secondary prevention. Editor Michael Feuerstein, himself a cancer survivor, and sixty other top scientist-practitioners analyze in depth how survivors meet and manage the challenges of life after cancer, and what clinicians, researchers, and public health systems can do to ease the transition. The Handbook's 27 comprehensive chapters include the latest research and practice related to: Survivors' quality of life, and how it can be assessed, Managing everyday and chronic stress, Depression, anxiety, pain disorders, and cognitive changesCoping, adaptation, and resilience, Behavior change strategies - exercise, weight control, smoking cessation, Cancer survivorship centers and other models for follow-up care, Survivor, clinician, and international perspectives, New frontiers in practice, research, and policy. Such wide-ranging coverage benefits everyone involved in cancer survival: primary care providers, oncologists, behavioral health specialists, physical and occupational therapists, nutritionists, epidemiologists, health systems professionals and policymakers, and, of course, survivors themselves and their families.
