Principles of nano-optics
"First published in 2006, this book has become the standard reference on nano-optics. Now in its second edition, the text has been thoroughly updated to take into account new developments and research directions. While the overall structure and pedagogical style of the book remain unchanged, all existing chapters have been expanded and a new chapter has been added. Adopting a broad perspective, the authors provide a detailed overview of the theoretical and experimental concepts that are needed to understand and work in nano-optics, across subfields ranging from quantum optics to biophysics. New topics of discussion include: optical antennas; new imaging techniques ...
"The introduction of new concepts and applications. Applications of near-field optics soon covered a large span ranging from fundamental physics and materials science to biology and medicine. Following a logical development, the strong interest in near-field optics gave birth to the fields of singlemolecule spectroscopy and plasmonics, and inspired new theoretical work associated with the nature of optical near-fields. In parallel, relying on the momentum of the flowering nanosciences, researchers started to tailor nanomaterials ...
