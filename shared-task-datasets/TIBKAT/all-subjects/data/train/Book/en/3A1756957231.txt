Powers of two : the information universe — information as the building block of everything
Is everything Information? This is a tantalizing question which emerges in modern physics, life sciences, astronomy and in today’s information and technology-driven society. In Powers of Two expert authors undertake a unique expedition - in words and images - throughout the world (and scales) of information. The story resembles, in a way, the classic “Powers of Ten” journeys through space: from us to the macro and the micro worlds. However, by following Powers of Two through the world of information, a completely different and timely paradigm unfolds: The Information Universe in nature and in our society. In this book, we experience how information lies at the very foundation of our understanding of the Universe. .
