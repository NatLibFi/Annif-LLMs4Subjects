Post-growth geographies : Spatial relations of diverse and alternative economies
Post-Growth Geographies examines spatial relations of diverse and alternative economies between growth-oriented institutions and multiple socio-ecological crises. The book brings together conceptual and empirical contributions from geography and its neighboring disciplines and offers different perspectives on the possibilities, demands, and critiques of post-growth transformation. Through case studies and interviews, the contributions combine voices from activism, civil society, planning, and politics with current theoretical debates on socio-ecological transformation
