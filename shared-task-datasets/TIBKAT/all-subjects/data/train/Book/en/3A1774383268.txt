Solanum tuberosum : methods and protocols
This volume offers a comprehensive collection of experimental approaches to study Solanum tuberosum (potato). Chapters are divided into five sections covering a general overview of potato, the research fields of molecular biology, omics approaches, and bioinformatics, and finally, the application of the generated knowledge for crop improvement. Written in the format of the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series, each wet-lab chapter includes an introduction to the topic, lists necessary materials and reagents, includes tips on troubleshooting and known pitfalls, and step-by-step, readily reproducible protocols. Authoritative and practical, Solanum tuberosum: Methods and Protocols aims to provide a collection of methods for the potato research community that will enable scientists gain insight into the world of the potato.
