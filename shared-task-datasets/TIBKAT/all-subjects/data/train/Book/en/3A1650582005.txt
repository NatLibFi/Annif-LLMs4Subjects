Computational Physics : Simulation of Classical and Quantum Systems
This book encapsulates the coverage for a two-semester course in computational physics. The first part introduces the basic numerical methods while omitting mathematical proofs but demonstrating the algorithms by way of numerous computer experiments. The second part specializes in simulation of classical and quantum systems with instructive examples spanning many fields in physics, from a classical rotor to a quantum bit. All program examples are realized as Java applets ready to run in your browser and do not require any programming skills.  1984 PhD in experimental and theoretical physics 1996 Habilitation in theoretical physics since 1999 lecturer at Technische Universität München (TUM) 2001 and 2003, visiting scientist at AIST, Tsukuba,Japan 2006-2008 temporary leader of the Institute for Theoretical Biomolecular Physics (T38) at TUM
