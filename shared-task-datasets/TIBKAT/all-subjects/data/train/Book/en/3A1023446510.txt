Macroeconomics of growth cycles and financial instability
In light of the recent economic crisis and in keeping with Hyman Minsky’s analysis of financial instability, this book considers the important interaction between cycles and growth, via the interplay between demand, supply and real-world financial issues. Piero Ferri presents a macroeconomic study of a monetary production economy within a dynamic paradigm, where instability phenomena and inhibitive policy measures interact, and where the forces that self-regulate markets cannot prevent the occurrence of instability problems. Underpinning this paradigm is the idea that such volatility is the result of endogenous forces; shocks can trigger instability but cannot explain its persistence. As endogenous instability has multiple causes and mechanisms of transmission, the author adopts various perspectives – both analytical and by means of simulation – in order to explore and characterize the phenomenon of growth cycles and instability.
