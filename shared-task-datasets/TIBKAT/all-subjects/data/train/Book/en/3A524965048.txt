Modern Techniques for Characterizing Magnetic Materials
Modern Techniques for Characterizing Magnetic Materials provides an extensive overview of novel characterization tools for magnetic materials including neutron, photon and electron scatterings and other microscopy techniques by world-renowned scientists. This interdisciplinary reference describes all available techniques to characterize and to understand magnetic materials, techniques that cover a wide range of length scales and belong to different scientific communities. The diverse contributions enhance cross-discipline communication, while also identifying both the drawbacks and advantages of different techniques, which can result in deriving effective combinations of techniques that are especially fruitful at nanometer scales. It will be a valuable resource for all graduate students, researchers, engineers and scientists who are interested in magnetic materials including their crystal structure, electronic structure, magnetization dynamics and their associated magnetic properties and underlying magnetism.
