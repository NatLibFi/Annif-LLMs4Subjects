Intraoperative Neurophysiological Monitoring
The premier authority on intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IOM) provides in a new edition a comprehensive, up-to-date reference on IOM techniques and their anatomical and physiological basis. Dr. MÃ¸ller offers theoretical and practical guidance regarding electrophysiological recordings in the operating room, how to interpret the results, and how to present them to the surgeon. In addition, the author has added new material on the monitoring of the spinal motor system, of sensory systems, of peripheral nerves, and in skull base surgery. Included are methods for guiding the surgeon in operations, such as microvascular decompression, implantation of electrodes for deep brain stimulation, repair of peripheral nerves and for placement of electrodes for auditory prostheses.
