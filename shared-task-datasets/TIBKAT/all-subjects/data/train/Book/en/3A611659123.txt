Structural virology
"Structural Virology covers a wide range of topics and is split into three sections. The first discusses the vast biophysical methodologies used in structural virology, including sample production and purification, confocal microscopy, mass spectrometry, negative-stain and cryo-electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The second discusses the role of virus capsid protein structures in determining the functional roles required for receptor recognition, cellular entry, capsid assembly, genome packaging and mechanisms of host immune system evasion. The last section discusses therapeutic strategies based on virus protein structures, including the design of antiviral drugs and the development of viral capsids as vehicles for foreign gene delivery"--From publisher's description
