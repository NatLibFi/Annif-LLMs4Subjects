Pro XAML with C# : From Design to Deployment on WPF, Windows Store, and Windows Phone
Packed with real, usable code and expert insights, Pro XAML with C# shows you how to design and build compelling enterprise applications on WPF, Windows Store, or Windows Phone, or any combination of the three. In Part I, authors Buddy James and Lori Lalonde introduce you to XAML and reveal proven techniques for developing successful line-of-business applications. You’ll also find out about some of the conflicting needs and interests that you might encounter as an enterprise XAML developer. Part II begins to lay the groundwork to help you properly architect your application, providing you with a deeper understanding of domain-driven design and the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern. You will also learn about proper exception handling and logging techniques, and how to cover your code with unit tests to reduce bugs and validate your design. Part III explores implementation and deployment details for each of Microsoft’s XAML UIs, along with advice on deploying and maintaining your application across different devices using version control repositories and continuous integration. Pro XAML with C# is for intermediate to experienced developers. Readers should have experience working with C# and at least one XAML-based technology (WPF, Silverlight, Windows Store, or Windows Phone)
