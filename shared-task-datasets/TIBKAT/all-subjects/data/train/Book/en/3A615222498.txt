Classical mechanics : from Newton to Einstein ; a modern introduction
"Classical Mechanics provides a clear introduction to the subject, combining a user-friendly style with an authoritative approach, whilst requiring minimal prerequisite mathematics - only elementary calculus and simple vectors are presumed. The text starts with a careful look at Newton's Laws, before applying them in one dimension to oscillations and collisions. More advanced applications - including gravitational orbits, rigid body dynamics and mechanics in rotating frames - are deferred until after the limitations of Newton's inertial frames have been highlighted through an exposition of Einstein's Special Relativity.  Comprehensive yet concise introduction to classical mechanics and relativity.   Emphasize real life examples. Includes many interesting problems and a key revision notes chapter. Presented in a style that assumes a minimum of mathematical knowledge. Contains new chapter on computational dynamics. Unique mixture of classical mechanics with relativity. Supplementary web link and solutions manual"--
