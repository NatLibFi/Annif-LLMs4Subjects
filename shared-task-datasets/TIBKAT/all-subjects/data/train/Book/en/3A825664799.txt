Hitler's Brudervolk : the Dutch and the colonization of occupied Eastern Europe, 1939 - 1945

Between the summers of 1941 and 1944, some 5,500 Dutch men and women left their occupied homeland to find employment in the so-called German Occupied Eastern Territories: Belarus, the Baltic countries and parts of Ukraine.
