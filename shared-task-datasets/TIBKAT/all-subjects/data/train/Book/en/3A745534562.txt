Atlas linguistique de la Polynésie française
Main description: This is the first linguistic atlas ever produced on the indigenous languages of French Polynesia. By providing each word with its translation in 20 different islands, its more than 2000 maps constitute an important reference for anyone interested in Polynesian languages. The atlas illustrates the linguistic unity and diversity of this immense archipelago, on the eastern wing of the Polynesian world. The two-volume work has been inspired by scientific objectives with dialectological, sociolinguistic, and historical issues in mind. In addition, it is aimed at the populations of French Polynesia, since the subject of the atlas concerns their languages and cultures, some of which are disappearing.
