Applications of differential transform to real world problems
"Applications of Differential Transform to Real World Problems is an invaluable resource for applied researchers to find the analytical solution of differential equations describing the dynamical system with less computational effort and time. This book describes the basic concepts of differential transform method and solution of various real-world problems describe by simple to complicated differential equations. This book provides a computational technique which is not only conceptually simple and easy to use but also readily adaptable for computer coding. Different chapters of the book deals with the basic differential equation involve in the physical phenomena as well complicated system of differential described by the mathematical model"--
