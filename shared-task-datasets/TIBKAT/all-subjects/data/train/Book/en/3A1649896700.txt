Spinors in Four-Dimensional Spaces
Without using the customary Clifford algebras frequently studied in connection with the representations of orthogonal groups, spinors are developed in this work for four-dimensional spaces in a language analogous to the spinor formalism used in relativistic spacetime. This systematic and self-contained book provides very useful details as to how spinors work and includes many interesting examples of why they are useful such as applications in Yang-Mills theory. This work will serve graduate students and researchers in mathematical and theoretical physics, it is suitable as a seminar text, a reference book, and a self-study guide. Reviews from the author`s previous book, 3-D Spinors, Spin-Weighted Functions and their Applications: "In summary...the book gathers much of what can be done with 3-D spinors in an easy-to-read, self-contained form designed for applications that will supplement many available spinor treatments. The book...should be appealing to graduate students and researchers in relativity and mathematical physics." -Mathematical Reviews "The present book provides an easy-to-read and unconventional presentation of the spinor formalism for three-dimensional spaces with a definite or indefinite metric...Following a nice and descriptive introduction chapters 2-4 are devoted to spin-weighted functions and their applications, while chapters 5 and 6 collect all the standard material on spinor algebra and spinor analysis respectively. The final chapter contains some applications of the formalism to general relativity." -Monatshefte f√ºr Mathematik
