Porous silicon : from formation to application / edited by Ghenadii Korotcenkov ; Volume 1: Formation and properties
"Volume One focus on the fundamentals and practical aspects of silicon porosification by anodization and the properties of porous silicon, including electrical, luminescence, optical, thermal properties, and contact phenomena. Processing of porous silicon, including drying, storage, oxidation, etching, filling, and functionalizing, are also discussed in this book."--
