New formalist criticism : theory and practice
"New Formalist Criticism: Theory and Practice attempts to situate New Formalist criticism in contemporary theory and practice, arguing for its singularity and value, tracing its roots and development, exploring its role in other critical modes and in non-literary disciplines, offering analyses of a range of texts, and portraying literary study as a provisional rehearsal of existential postures and attitudes in the inevitably historical present of the reader. Critically sophisticated, but written in a lucid and engaging style, with numerous examples and concrete analyses, New Formalist Criticism: Theory and Practice will speak to a wide readership.

New Formalist Criticism: Theory and Practice will invigorate the study of literary form and help redraw the map of contemporary criticism"--
