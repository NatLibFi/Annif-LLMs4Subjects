'Byron and the Forms of Thought' is a major new study of Byron as a poet and thinker. While informed by recent work on Byron's philosophical contexts it sharply diverges from previous methodological assumptions to break new ground. Rather than attempting to re-describe Byron as a philosopher of a particular sort, the book draws attention to the ways in which Byron's poetry understands and explores its own 'philosophical' agency
