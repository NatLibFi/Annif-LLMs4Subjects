Computer-aided control systems design : practical applications using MATLAB and Simulink
"This book emphasizes applying control fundamentals to practical industry systems such as ALSTOM gasifier system in power station and underwater robotic vehicle (URV) in marine industry. The text begins with basic principles such as understanding the control engineering and recognizing that powerful software packages exist to aid the control systems design. For practicality, the choice and emphasis of material is guided by the basic objective of making an engineer or student capable of dealing with practical control problems in industry"--
