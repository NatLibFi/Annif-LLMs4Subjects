Stratigraphy : a modern synthesis
The scope of modern stratigraphy -- The stratigraphic-sedimentologic data base -- Facies analysis -- Facies Models -- Sequence stratigraphy -- Basin mapping methods -- Stratigraphy: The modern synthesis -- The Future of Time.
The updated textbook is intended to serve as an advanced and detailed treatment of the evolution of the subject of stratigraphy from its disparate beginnings as separate studies of sedimentology, lithostratigraphy, chronostratigraphy, etc., into a modern integrated discipline in which all components are necessary. There is a historical introduction, which now includes information about the timeline of the evolution of the components of modern stratigraphy. The elements of the various components (facies analysis, sequence stratigraphy, mapping methods, chronostratigraphic methods, etc.) are outlined, and a chapter discussing the modern synthesis is included near the end of the book, which closes with a discussion of future research trends in the study of time as preserved in the stratigraphic record.
