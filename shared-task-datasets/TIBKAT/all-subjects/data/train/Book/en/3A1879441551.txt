Knowledge spillovers and economic growth : regional growth differentials across Europe
One of the most striking paradoxes of our time has been the growing importance of regions in the face of a globalizing economy. This insightful book explains the dynamics of regions in a global economy and sheds light on the role of knowledge in driving regional growth. The author examines the way in which regions grow by receiving knowledge from surrounding regions. Using evolutionary theory, she advances the argument that knowledge spillovers operate locally. Computer-simulations analyse the impact of knowledge spillovers on economic growth across European regions. Finally, the author uses new original data on, among others, patents and research and development to demonstrate differences in economic and innovative activity across regions
