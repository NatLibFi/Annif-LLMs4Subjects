The Global South and literature
"'The Global South' has largely supplanted 'The Third World' in discussions of Development Studies, Postcolonial Studies, World Literature and Comparative Literature respectively. The concept registers a new set of relationships between nations of the once-colonized world as their connections to nations of the north diminish in significance. Such relationships register particularly clearly in contemporary cultural theory and literary production. The Global South and Literature explores the historical, cultural and literary applications of the term for 21st century flows of transnational cultural influence, tracing their manifestations across the Global Southern traditions of Africa, Asia and Latin America. This collection of interdisciplinary contributions examines the origins, development and applications of this emergent term, employed at the nexus of the critical social sciences and developments in literary humanities and cultural studies. This book will be a key resource for Students, graduates and researchers working in the field of Postcolonial Studies and World Literature"--
