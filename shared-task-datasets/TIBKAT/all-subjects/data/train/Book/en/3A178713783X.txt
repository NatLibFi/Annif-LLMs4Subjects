Heating and cooling with ground-source heat pumps in cold and moderate climates / Vasile Minea ; Volume 2: Design principles, potential applications and case studies
"This book focuses on fundamentals and design principles of vertical and horizontal indirect and direct expansion closed-loop, and ground and surface water ground-source heat pump systems. It also details the thermodynamic aspects of mechanical and thermo-chemical compression cycles of geothermal heat pumps, as well as the energetic, economic and environmental aspects associated with the use of ground-source heat pump systems for heating and cooling residential and commercial/institutional buildings in moderate and cold climates"--
