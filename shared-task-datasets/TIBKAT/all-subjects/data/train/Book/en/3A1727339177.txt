Satellite navigation systems and technologies
Based on the design theory and development experience of Beidou navigation satellite system (BDS), this book highlights the space segment and the related satellite technologies as well as satellite-ground integration design from the perspective of engineering. The satellite navigation technology in this book is divided into uplink and reception technology, broadcasting link technology, inter-satellite link technology, time-frequency system technology, navigation signal generation and assessment technology, navigation information management technology, autonomous operation technology of navigation satellite. In closing, the book introduces readers to the technological development status and trend of BDS and other GNSS, and propose the technologies of future development. Unlike most current books on this topic, which largely concentrate on principles, receiver design or applications, the book also features substantial information on the role of satellite system in the GNSS and the process of signal information flow, and each chapter not only studies on the theoretical function and main technologies, but also focuses on engineering development. Accordingly, readers will gain not only a better understanding of navigation satellite systems as a whole, but also of their main components and key technologies.
