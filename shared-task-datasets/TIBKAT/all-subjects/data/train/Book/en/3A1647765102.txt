Sourcebook of Models for Biomedical Research
The collection of systems represented in the Sourcebook of Models for Biomedical Research reflect the diversity and utility of models that are used in biomedicine. That utility is based on the consideration that observations made in particular organisms will provide insight into the workings of other, more complex systems. Some models have the advantage that the reproductive, mitotic, development or aging cycles are rapid compared with those in humans, others are utilized because individual proteins may be studied in an advantageous way and have human homologs. Other organisms are facile to grow in laboratory settings, lend themselves to convenient analyses, have defined genomes or present especially good human models of human or animal disease. The Sourcebook of Models for Biomedical Research is a comprehensive and extensive collection of these important medical parallels. While the entire book is not devoted to the remarkable success of the genomic programs, this work is well represented and indexed within these pages. This volume will be an invaluable resource for pharmaceutical and academic researchers across a wide range of biological fields.
The collection of systems represented in this volume is a unique effort to reflect the diversity and utility of models used in biomedicine. That utility is based on the consideration that observations made in particular organisms will provide insight into the workings of other, more complex systems. This volume is therefore a comprehensive and extensive collection of these important medical parallels.
