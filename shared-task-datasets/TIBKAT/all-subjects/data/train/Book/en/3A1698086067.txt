Double helix of phyllotaxis : analysis of the geometric model of plant morphogenesis
"This book is devoted to anyone who is in search of a beauty in mathematics and mathematics in the beauty around us. Attempting to combine mathematical rigor and magnificence of the visual perception, author is presenting the mathematical study of phyllotaxis, the most beautiful phenomenon of the living nature. The distinctive feature of this book is an animation feature that explains the work of mathematical models and the transformation of 3D space. The analysis of the phyllotactic pattern as a system of discrete objects together with the mathematical tools of generalized sequences made it possible to find a universal algorithm for calculating the divergence angle. In addition, it is serving as a new proof of the fundamental theorem of phyllotaxis and analytically confirming well-known formulas obtained intuitively earlier as well as casting some doubts on a few stereotypes existing in mathematical phyllotaxis. The presentation of phyllotaxis morphogenesis as a recursive process allowed the author to formulate the hydraulic model of phyllotaxis morphogenesis and propose a method for its experimental verification. With the help of artificial intelligence, the author offered methodology for the digital measurement of phyllotaxis allowing a transition to a qualitatively new level in the study of plant morphogenesis. Due to the successful combination of mathematical constructions and their visual presentation, the materials of this study are comprehensible to readers with high school advanced mathematical levels"--
