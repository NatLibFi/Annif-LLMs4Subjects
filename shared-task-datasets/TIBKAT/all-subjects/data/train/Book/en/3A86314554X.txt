Wireless multimedia : a guide to the IEEE 802.15.3 standard
"Wireless Multimedia: A Handbook to the IEEE 802.15.3 Standard clarifies the IEEE 802.15.3 standard for individuals who are implementing compliant devices and shows how the standard can be used to develop wireless multimedia applications. The 802.15.3 standard addresses an untapped market that does beyond 802.11 and Bluetooth wireless technologies. The standard addresses the consumer need for low-cost, high data-rate, ad-hoc wireless connections. Some of these applications include: wireless keyboards and printers, personal video and digital cameras, cordless telephones and intercoms, digital audio players and headphones, gaming (including interactive gaming, multiplayer consoles, handheld multiplayer gaming, digital music, video, and image uploads to handheld games), home theater system and stereo system components, video conferencing, and more! Navigating through the IEEE 802.15.3 standard to find the required information can be a difficult task for anyone who has not spent a considerable amount of time involved in standards development within the IEEE 802.15.3 Working Group. Written by Dr. James Gilb, Technical Editor of the IEEE 802.15.3 Standard, Wireless Multimedia contains an 'insider's view' of the standard in which implementation issues that are not obvious in the text of the standard are highlighted with in-depth explanations. Impact the future of your business Wireless Multimedia: A Handbook to the IEEE 802.15.3 Standard brings it all together for those looking to standardize their wireless applications. It introduces and eases the implementation of devices compliant to the IEEE 802.15.3 standard. You will discover the types of implementations that were anticipated when the standard was developed, which will help you to determine what architectures are ideal for developing IEEE 802.15.3 products."--Publisher's description
