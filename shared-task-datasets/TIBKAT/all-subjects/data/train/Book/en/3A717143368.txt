Renewable energy systems : advanced conversion technologies and applications
"Due to the shortage of world energy resources, there is no time to waste in the development of renewable energy sources and energy-saving power supplies. Presenting more than 100 topologies of advanced converters, this book introduces, solves, and corrects historic problems in conversion technologies. It demonstrates the correct methods to determine the accurate solutions and provides design examples for industrial applications. The text investigates new AC/DC/AC converters which are required in wind-turbine power systems, and DC/AC/DC converters, which are necessary in solar panel power systems. The authors also cover additional applications in renewable energy systems"--
