A guide to Monte Carlo simulations in statistical physics
This updated edition deals with the Monte Carlo simulation of complex physical systems encountered in condensed-matter physics, statistical mechanics, and related fields. It contains many applications, examples, and exercises to help the reader. It is an excellent guide for graduate students and researchers who use computer simulations in their research
Introduction -- Some necessary background -- Simple sampling Monte Carlo methods -- Importance sampling Monte Carlo methods -- More on importance sampling Monte Carlo methods for lattice systems -- Off-lattice models -- Reweighting methods -- Quantum Monte Carlo methods -- Monte Carlo Renormalization Group methods -- Non-equilibrium and irreversible processes -- Lattice gauge models: a brief introduction -- A brief review of other methods of computer simulation -- Monte Carlo methods outside of physics -- Outlook.
