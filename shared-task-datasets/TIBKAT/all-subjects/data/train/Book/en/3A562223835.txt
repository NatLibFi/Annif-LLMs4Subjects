Inorganic reactions in water
This book will describe the reactions of the elements and their simpler compounds, primarily inorganic ones and primarily in water, organized to facilitate reference. It will emphasize similarities and differences in actual chemical behavior as opposed to electronic structure and theories. The book will offer the more comprehensive coverage of descriptive aqueous chemistry in older sources, interpreted with the added insights of the last seven decades, plus new information, including reactions of the recently discovered elements. It will include more recent information on equilibrium constants
