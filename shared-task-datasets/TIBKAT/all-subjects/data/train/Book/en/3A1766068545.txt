Resilient control architectures and power systems
"This book establishes a perspective for readers on the unique challenges of automation in our society, with a focus on a common element we all depend upon, the power grid. Perspectives are provided on a simulation of this real-life system, providing a backdrop on how a power control system works and how it can fail. In addition, the book addresses how systems fail due to threats from cyber security, human error and complex interdependencies. The book also discusses promising concepts that are being investigated to make these control systems more resilient to threats. Resilience fundamentals and applications are also investigated to ensure adequate operation in complex control systems."--
