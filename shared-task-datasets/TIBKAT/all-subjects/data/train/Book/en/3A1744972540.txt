Analysing the role of multinational investors in emerging Asian economies and the implications for regional economic integration, this astute study examines the increasing role being played by Asian countries in the global economy. Encompassing a large number of diverse manufacturing and service sectors, this book highlights the cultural and strategic challenges faced by multinational investors in the region in which they invest. It shows that despite high rates of economic growth in Asian countries presenting multinational traders and investors with unparalleled market opportunities, there have been only tentative moves towards regional economic integration. Areas such as trade facilitation, uniform customs clearance, removal of non-tariff barriers and labour deployment issues are yet to be adequately addressed. Multifaceted and multidimensional in approach, Emerging Asian Economies and MNCs Strategies will appeal to students and scholars of Asian economies and business management in the region. Its presentation of the sociopolitical and investment environment will also prove invaluable in informing business investors targeting Southeast Asian markets
