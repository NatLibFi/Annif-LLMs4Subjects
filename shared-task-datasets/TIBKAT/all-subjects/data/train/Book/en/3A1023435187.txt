Handbook of research on social entrepreneurship
This timely Handbook provides an empirically rigorous overview of the latest research advances on social entrepreneurship, entrepreneurs and enterprises. It incorporates seventeen original chapters on definitions, concepts, contexts and strategy, including a critical overview and an agenda for future research in social entrepreneurship. What are the forms and manifestations of social entrepreneurship? To what extent should current developments lead to a redefinition of stakeholdersâ€™ strategies and roles in the quest for better consideration of the social dimension? The highly regarded group of contributors addresses these questions in some detail. They also explore social entrepreneurship from a multicultural perspective in order to highlight the diversity of social entrepreneurship forms and practices and, from a strategic perspective, to investigate the essential role played by various actors and factors in the development of social entrepreneurship.
