To the ends of the Earth : pentecostalism and the transformation of world Christianity
The growth of Christianity in the global South is one of the most important religious stories of the last decade. In no branch of Christianity has that growth been more rapid than Pentecostalism. There are over 100 million Pentecostals in Africa, and Pentecostal practices infuse Catholic, Anglican, and Independent churches. In the traditional Catholic stronghold of Latin America, Pentecostalism now vies with Catholicism for the soul of the continent. And the largest Pentecostsal church in the world, with over 800,000 members, is in Seoul. In To the Ends of the Earth, Allan Anderson offers a historical and theological examination of the growth of global Pentecostalism. Examining such issues as revivalism, healing, gender, worship, and globalization, Anderson seeks to show how the growth of global Pentecostalism is changing the face of Christianity as a whole.
