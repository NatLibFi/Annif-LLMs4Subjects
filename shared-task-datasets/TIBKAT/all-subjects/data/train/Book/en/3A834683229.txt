Particle methods for multi-scale and multi-physics
Multi-scale and multi-physics modeling is useful and important for all areas in engineering and sciences. Particle Methods for Multi-Scale and Multi-Physics systematically addresses some major particle methods for modeling multi-scale and multi-physical problems in engineering and sciences. It contains different particle methods from atomistic scales to continuum scales, with emphasis on molecular dynamics (MD), dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). This book covers the theoretical background, numerical techniques and many interesting applications of the particle methods discussed in this text, especially in: micro-fluidics and bio-fluidics (e.g., micro drop dynamics, movement and suspension of macro-molecules, cell deformation and migration); environmental and geophysical flows (e.g., saturated and unsaturated flows in porous media and fractures); and free surface flows with possible interacting solid objects (e.g., wave impact, liquid sloshing, water entry and exit, oil spill and boom movement). The presented methodologies, techniques and example applications will benefit students, researchers and professionals in computational engineering and sciences --
