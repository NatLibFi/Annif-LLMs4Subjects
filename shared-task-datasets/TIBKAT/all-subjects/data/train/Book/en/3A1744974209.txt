Appreciative inquiry and knowledge management : a social constructionist perspective
The authors of this book advance the Appreciative Sharing of Knowledge (ASK), a unique approach by which organizations create a culture that facilitates the sharing of information. Using social constructionist approaches, historical data, and case studies, the authors demonstrate that appreciation - or affirmation - is the key ingredient for people to trust each other and overcome their inhibitions and concerns about sharing what they know
