"Designing Software Synthesizer Plugins in C++ provides everything you need to know to start designing and writing your own synthesizer plugins, including theory and practical examples for all of the major synthesizer building blocks from LFOs and EGs to PCM samples and morphing wavetables, along with complete synthesizer example projects. The book and accompanying SynthLab projects include scores of C++ objects and functions that implement the synthesizer building blocks, and six synthesizer projects ranging from virtual analog and physical modelling to wavetable morphing and wave-sequencing that demonstrate their use. You can start using the book immediately with the SynthLab-DM product that allows you to compile and load mini-modules that resemble modular synth components, without needing to maintain the complete synth project code. The C++ objects all run in a standalone mode, so you can incorporate them into your current projects or whip up a quick experiment. All six synth projects are fully documented from the tiny SynthClock up to the SynthEngine objects allowing you to get the most from the book while working at a level that you feel comfortable with. This book is intended for music technology and engineering students along with DIY audio programmers and anyone wanting to understand how synthesizers may be implemented in C++"--
