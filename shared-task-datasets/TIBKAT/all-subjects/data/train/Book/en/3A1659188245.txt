Fundamental principles of engineering nanometrology
Working at the nano-scale demands an understanding of the high-precision measurement techniques that make nanotechnology and advanced manufacturing possible. This new edition of Fundamental Principles of Engineering Nanometrology provides a road map and toolkit for metrologists engaging with the rigor of measurement and data analysis at the nano-scale, from the fundamentals of precision measurement, to different measurement and characterization techniques. This book is an essential guide for the emerging nanomanufacturing and nanofabrication sectors, where measurement and standardization requirements are paramount both in product specification and quality assurance. Updated to cover new and emerging technologies, and recent developments in standards and regulatory frameworks, this second edition includes many new sections covering, for example, new technologies in scanning probe and e-beam microscopy (including DLS, NTA), recent developments in interferometry, and advances in co-ordinate metrology
