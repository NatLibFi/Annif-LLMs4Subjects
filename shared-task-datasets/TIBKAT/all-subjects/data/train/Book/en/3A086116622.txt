Johnson, writing, and memory
"Greg Clingham examines Johnson's writing, including his biographical writing, as it intersects with eighteenth-century thought on literature, history, fiction, and law, and in its subsequent compatibility with, and resistance to, modern theory. Clingham's widely researched study provides an account of Johnson's intellectual positions that incorporates the challenges they pose to recent critical theory, and argues for Johnson's inclusion in a new theorization of terms such as "authority," "nature," and "memory.""--Jacket
