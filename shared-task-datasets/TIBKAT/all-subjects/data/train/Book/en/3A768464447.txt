The Feynman lectures on physics : Volume I ; mainly mechanics, radiation, and heat
Timeless and collectible, The Feynman Lectures on Physics are essential reading, not just for students of physics, but for anyone seeking an insightful introduction to the field from the inimitable Richard P. Feynman. "When I look at The Feynman Lectures on Physics, I feel a very personal sense of closeness to them," said Feynman, looking back on the origins of these books. Ranging from basic Newtonian dynamics through such formidable theories as Einstein's relativity, Maxwell's electrodynamics, and Dirac's forumulation of quantum mechanics, these collected lectures stand as a monument
