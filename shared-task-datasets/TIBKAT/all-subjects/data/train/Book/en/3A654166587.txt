Catalytic methods in asymmetric synthesis : advanced materials, techniques, and applications
"This book covers advances in the methods of catalytic asymmetric synthesis and their applications. Coverage moves from new materials such as chiral ionic liquids, supported catalysts and flow reactors; to homogeneous metal-free catalysts and homogeneous metal catalysts. The applications of several methodologies for the synthesis of biologically active molecules are discussed. Part I addresses recent advances in new technologies related to asymmetric catalysis. Part II covers advances and milestones with amino acids, both natural and unnatural, as powerful organocatalysts - including applications for the synthesis of biologically active molecules"-- Provided by publisher
