Logistics and retail management : emerging issues and new challenges in the retail supply chain
The fourth edition of Logistics and Retail Management has been substantially updated to take account of recent developments in retail logistics. Retailers have recognised the need to have more involvement in supply chains and noted that benefits can be achieved in both service levels and cost reduction. Notwithstanding the major strides made, numerous challenges remain, and new issues are constantly emerging. This book brings together well-known academics and practitioners, who share their research, ideas and experience of current thinking on supply chain management in retail. Reflecting the changing needs of the global marketplace and responding to the challenges faced by retailers, the new book will have a chapter on International Fashion Supply Chain Management and another on CSR and the textile supply chain.
