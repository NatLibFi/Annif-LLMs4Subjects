Essential Advanced Physics is a series comprising four parts: Classical Mechanics, Classical Electrodynamics, Quantum Mechanics and Statistical Mechanics. Each part consists of two volumes, Lecture notes and Problems with solutions, further supplemented by an additional collection of test problems and solutions available to qualifying university instructors. This volume, Classical Mechanics: Problems with solutions contains detailed model solutions to the exercise problems formulated in the companion Lecture notes volume. In many cases, the solutions include result discussions that enhance the lecture material. For the reader's convenience, the problem assignments are reproduced in this volume
