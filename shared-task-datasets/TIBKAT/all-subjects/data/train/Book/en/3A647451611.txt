Fashion and cultural studies
This book addresses the growing interaction between the two fields. Bridging theory and practice, it draws on cultural diversity in fashion, dress and style in the context of globalization and its varied cultural-historical underpinnings. While the book is organized around specific subjects, such as ethnicity, class, gender and nation, the overall goal is to highlight the ways in which these interact and overlap. A wide range of cross-cultural case studies analyze fashion as a multi-ethnic, transnational, and multiply gendered, classed, and sexualized phenomenon
