International joint venture performance in South East Asia
Craig Julian argues that the International Joint Venture (IJV) phenomena represents two opposing trends. On the one hand, an analysis of the number of new IJVs reveals that they are becoming increasingly popular as a mode of overseas market entry and expansion. On the other hand, however, the significance of a robust growth trend is overshadowed by the incidence of high failure. The book examines the factors influencing the marketing performance of IJVs in South East Asia, including market characteristics, conflict, commitment, product characteristics, marketing orientation, control, trust, partner's contributions and partner's needs. A unique composite measure incorporating financial, strategic and perceptual tools is used to determine the marketing performance of IJVs, and directions for future research are provided. Managers are then guided in better managing and improving the success of their IJVs, and the importance of top management team composition to IJV performance is also highlighted. International Joint Venture Performance in South East Asia provides the most comprehensive list of references on joint venture academic research to date with 60 pages of references on joint venture research. As such, this book will be invaluable to both academics and practitioners with an interest in international business research and the management of IJVs
