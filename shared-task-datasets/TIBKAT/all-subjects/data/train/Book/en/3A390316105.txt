Coupled models for the hydrological cycle : integrating atmosphere, biosphere and pedosphere ; with 20 tables
Modeling groundwater is a tool familiar to all working in this field. Coupling different compartments has emerged as a challenge to the modeling community. This book contributes to these discussions and gives a state-of-the-art summary of the different ways of coupling. Firstthe cycles which have to be taken into account are beeing presented, then the scale issue and multiple equilibria are discussed. Inter- and intra-compartmental coupling is dealt with, followed by a debate on non-linearities and questions of parameterization. All these issues are dealt with on a theoretical level before applied to the hydrological cycle itself. Case studies exemplify how coupling can help to solve special questions from the local to the global cycle.
