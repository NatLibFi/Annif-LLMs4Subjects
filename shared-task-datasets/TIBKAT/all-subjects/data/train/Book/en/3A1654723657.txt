Production and Efficiency Analysis with R
Introduction -- Linear Production Model -- Production Functions -- Production Functions with Panel Data -- Introduction to Linear Programming -- Data Envelopment Analysis -- Stochastic Data Envelopment Analysis -- Stochastic Frontier Analysis -- Panel Data Stochastic Frontier Analysis
This textbook introduces essential topics and techniques in production and efficiency analysis and shows how to apply these methods using the statistical software R. Numerous small simulations lead to a deeper understanding of random processes assumed in the models and of the behavior of estimation techniques. Step-by-step programming provides an understanding of advanced approaches such as stochastic frontier analysis and stochastic data envelopment analysis. The text is intended for master students interested in empirical production and efficiency analysis. Readers are assumed to have a general background in production economics and econometrics, typically taught in introductory microeconomics and econometrics courses
