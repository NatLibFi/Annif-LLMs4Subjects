Smart villages : generative innovation for livelihood development$dedited by Robert Krueger, Hermine Vedogbeton, Mustapha Fofana and Wole Soboyejo
This book asserts that the goal of smart villages should shift from one of extraction to one of community value creation. To begin this conversation, we examine the smart village discourse, debates in design theory, non-western traditions of innovation, and sustainable development. Through case studies of smart village co-design we offer a way forward. This book is relevant for engineers, social scientists, and development practitioners. The book will be of special interest to those seeking to expand their inquiry into the role of science and technology in low and middle-income countries. Reconstructs the goals of smart villages to a community centric model. Intertwines the concepts of sustainable development and smart villages. Describes case studies achieving local value creation and circulation
