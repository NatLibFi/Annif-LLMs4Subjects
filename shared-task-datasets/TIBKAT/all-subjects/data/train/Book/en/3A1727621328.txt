Physics and Chemistry of Rare-Earth Ions Doped Glasses
The aim of this work is to review the latest developments in glass science and technology. It presents various types of glass, of both academic and technological importance, in which the host is doped with rare-earth ions. Glass science has reached a very interesting stage in its development, with scope for a wider-ranging investigation of technologically oriented glasses. One of the primary goals of this book, "Physics and chemistry of Rare Earth ion doped glasses", is to highlight new developments and opportunities in glass science, with the emphasis on research into rare-earth ion doped glasses for the development of new optical glasses of technological importance to the next generation.The contents reflect the quality and standards, of recent advances in glass research, for the benefit of the whole academic community, particularly doctoral researchers, for whom it will act as an essential reference guide to glassy materials. Ions in crystal found a wide application in luminescent lamps and later in laser crystals. In these eight papers contributors describe designs and applications of different types of host glasses doped with rare earth ions. Their topics include lanthanide glass spectroscopy and fiber lasers, analysis of the laser transition and non-radiative properties of certain types of neodymium in novel fluorophosphates glasses, applications in integrated optical amplifiers, and a range of glasses doped with rare earth ions, including the synthesis and spectroscopic properties of bismuth or borate glasses, optical properties of the rare earth ions in fluoride glasses, structure and emission properties of doped sulfide glasses, luminescence spectra in doped zinc boro silicate and lead bismuth germanate glasses, and the optical properties of lithium boro-tellurite glasses doped with rare earth ions.
