One-dimensional finite elements : an introduction to the FE method
"This textbook presents finite element methods using exclusively one-dimensional elements. The aim is to present the complex methodology in an easily understandable but mathematically correct fashion. The approach of one-dimensional elements enables the reader to focus on the understanding of the principles of basic and advanced mechanical problems. The reader easily understands the assumptions and limitations of mechanical modeling as well as the underlying physics without struggling with complex mathematics. But although the description is easy it remains scientifically correct. The approach using only one-dimensional elements covers not only standard problems but allows also for advanced topics like plasticity or the mechanics of composite materials. Many examples illustrate the concepts and problems at the end of every chapter help to familiarize with the topics."--
