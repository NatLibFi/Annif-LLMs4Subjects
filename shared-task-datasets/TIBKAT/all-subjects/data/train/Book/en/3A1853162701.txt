Design of deep braced excavation and earth retaining systems under complex built environment : theories and case studies
This book presents basic design theories and principles and provides detailed analysis for excavation failure cases based on the author's research experience, aiming to provide a comprehensive picture of the subject matter. It focuses on the basal heave stability analysis, the apparent earth pressure as well as the strut force determination, the retaining wall deflection, the ground settlement, the protection measures such as jet grouting slabs or piles, case reports, back analysis methodology. From the very basic to the most advanced, it tries to attain theoretical rigorousness and consistency. On the other hand, this book also tries to cope with design practice, implemented by the recent publications from the authors. Students, researchers, and design engineers working in the field of civil engineering could benefit from this book.
