Nuclear Fission : Theories, Experiments and Applications
Chapter 1: Generalities / Overview -- Chapter 2. Fission Cross Sections-.Chapter 3. Properties of Fission Fragments and Fission Products -- Chapter 4. Prompt Fission Neutrons and Gammas -- Chapter 5. Impact on Science and Technology -- Appendix A. Facilities and target fabrication -- Appendix B. Existing detector setups -- Appendix C. Modelling fission in transport code simulations -- Appendix D. Summary/Tables of experimental, theoretical and evaluated values of fission data -- Appendix A. Uncertainties in fission data.
This book provides advanced students and postdocs, as well as current practitioners of any field of nuclear physics involving fission an understanding of the nuclear fission process. Key topics covered are: fission cross sections, fission fragment yields, neutron and gamma emission from fission and key nuclear technologies and applications where fission plays an important role. It addresses both fundamental aspects of the fission process and fission-based technologies including combining quantitative and microscopic modeling.
