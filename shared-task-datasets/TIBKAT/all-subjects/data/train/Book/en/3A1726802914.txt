Molecular breeding for rice abiotic stress tolerance and nutritional quality
"The chapters of this book aim to contribute the latest understandings of molecular and genetic bases of abiotic stress tolerance, yield and quality improvement of rice to develop strategies for abiotic stress tolerance and biofortification, which leads to enhanced crop productivity under abiotic stress conditions, as well as better utilization of natural resources to ensure food security through modern breeding. Topics covered include: - Rice adaptation to climate change - Molecular breeding for improving UB-radiation tolerance in rice - Molecular breeding for improving abiotic oxidative stress tolerance in rice - Molecular breeding for grain quality improvement in rice - Application of rapid generation advance system in rice breeding for the development of stress tolerant rice varieties This book will provide comprehensive information on each topic, much needed by scientists and plant breeders for developing new stress tolerant rice varieties"--
