Structure and chemistry of crystalline solids
Crystallographers have an elegant system using definitive notation for describing crystal structures, but it does not serve as well the needs of many others working with crystalline solids. Most chemists, metallurgists, mineralogists, geologists and workers in material sciences need a simple system and notation for describing crystal structures. Structure and Chemistry of Crystalline Solids presents a widely applicable system with simple notation giving important information about the structure and the chemical environment of ions or molecules. It is easily understood and used by those concerned with applications dependent on structure-properties relationships. This book addresses the needs of people working with crystal structures in several fields, while most other books on crystal structures are more than two decades old. Early chapters provide an introduction to crystal structures and symmetry for readers with a variety of backgrounds. Insight into crystal structures, including some complex silicates, is aided by the use of the CrystalMaker computer program. The bundled CD-ROM, which uses CrystalMaker for instruction and demos on both Windows and Macintosh platforms, allows the user to manipulate the structures. Key Features: Understandable by anyone concerned with crystals or solid state properties dependent on structure Presents a general system using simple notation to reveal similarities and differences among crystal structures Depicts more than 300 selected and prepared figures illustrating structures found in thousands of compounds Includes a CD-ROM with CrystalMakerTM data files to allow the reader to view and manipulate the structures on both Windows and Macintosh platforms
