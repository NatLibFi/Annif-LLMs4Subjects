Service Engineering : European Research Results
Service-oriented systems are increasingly challenging traditional software engineering approaches including distribution, componentization, composition, requirements, specification, verification, and evolution. Continuous mutual impact between service-oriented computing and software engineering has been seen in the last decade, and can increasingly be witnessed. The book aims to introduce the state-of-the-art service engineering methods and on-going research efforts from the perspective of research results elaborated in European research projects. Essential problems such as service specification and service composition are addressed by innovative approaches. Emerging requirements of adaptive service and pervasive service are met with new infrastructures. The book provides an integrated vision of the most important research directions in service engineering. This book is intended for scientists to be inspired with new ideas, for researchers new to the exciting field of service engineering and provides a consolidated overview on service engineering, thus supporting practitioners to facilitate their service-oriented architectures.
