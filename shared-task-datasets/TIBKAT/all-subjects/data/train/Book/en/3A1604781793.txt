Statistical methods for handling incomplete data
"With the advances in statistical computing, there has been a rapid development of techniques and applications in missing data analysis. This book aims to cover the most up-to-date statistical theories and computational methods for analyzing incomplete data through (1)vigorous treatment of statistical theories on likelihood-based inference with missing data, (2) comprehensive treatment of computational techniques and theories on imputation, and (3) most up-to-date treatment of methodologies involving propensity score weighting, nonignorable missing, longitudinal missing, survey sampling application, and statistical matching. The book is suitable for use as a textbook for a graduate course in statistics departments or as a reference book for those interested in this area. Some of the research ideas introduced in the book can be developed further for specific applications"--
