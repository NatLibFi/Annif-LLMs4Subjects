Experimental techniques in magnetism and magnetic materials
"The field of magnetism and magnetic materials has diverse applications in areas including information technology, wireless communication, microelectronics, information storage, and biotechnology. This text discusses experimental techniques for the high-resolution measurements of magnetic properties of materials, both, at the macroscopic and microscopic levels. It is meant to be a comprehensive introduction to graduate students and academicians in the fields of physics and materials science, wishing to conduct research. It covers fundamental concepts of magnetism and applications in biomedical, actuators, ferromagnetic nanoparticles, and ferrofluids. Starting with a brief history of the subject and insights into its contemporary applications the book provides a concise exposition of the phenomenology of magnetism. It then covers a wide spectrum of experimental methodologies to study both the microscopic and macroscopic aspects of various kinds of magnetic phenomena and materials. The physical principles behind each kind of experimental technique with a broad base introduction to instrumentation are also presented. The main text is augmented by appendices on the generation of the magnetic field, units in magnetism, and demagnetization fields"--
