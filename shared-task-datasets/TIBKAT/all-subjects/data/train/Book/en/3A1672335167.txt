Over recent decades, innovative diagnostic technologies, new therapeutic approaches and steady progress in medical genetics have helped establish the field of bone disease as a stand-alone specialty.Summarizing current knowledge, the physiology of calcium, magnesium and phosphate metabolism, the technique of bone biopsy and uses and pitfalls of bone density scanning are discussed. The main part of this publication describes in detail the disorders associated with hypocalcemia, hypercalcemia, rickets, phosphate metabolism, primary and secondary osteoporosis. The genetic nature of many of these conditions is highlighted and each condition is referred to by the number of its OMIM entry. The final chapter, which distinguishes this book from previous publications on the topic, comprises case reports illustrating some of the problems that are examined in previous chapters.This comprehensive account of disorders related to bone and mineral metabolism makes essential reading for pediatric endocrinologists as well as for clinicians who wish to gain a practical understanding of this important topic
