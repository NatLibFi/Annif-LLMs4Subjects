(En)countering native-speakerism : global perspectives
The notion of the 'native speaker' has historically dominated the profession of English language teaching to the extent that native-speakerism has become a wide-spread, tenacious and much 'taken-for-granted' ideology. These perceptions have become commonplace despite substantial, serious challenge to its coherence and value in the 21st century, when English is a world 'lingua franca'. With chapters written by ELT author-practitioners working world-wide, this volume investigates and challenges the 'native speaker' phenomenon in the real-world of international classrooms and the wider community. The book presents current findings about the extent to which the dominant ideology lingers or is being dismantled by new perspectives about the realities of who teaches English and what they teach in the second millennium.
