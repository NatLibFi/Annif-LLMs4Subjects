"Melodrama is one of the most important and most misunderstood categories in film studies. Challenging what have become conventional readings and attitudes toward melodrama, the contributors to this collection articulate new ways of thinking about melodrama that underscore its pervasiveness in global film culture, and its distinct ability to depict our understanding of the world. Melodrama Unbound includes essays by leading film scholars and historians to provide new approaches to melodrama that challenge some of the most persistent assumptions about the genre: that it is a Western form aimed at women and characterized by overwrought emotions. Thus, the essays examine how melodrama has traveled to and been transformed in new places such as India, China, Japan, and South America; the melodramatic aspects of action genres that appeal to both male and female audiences; how melodrama mixes with other genres such as romance, comedy, and even realism; how melodrama speaks to the realities of everyday life and dramatizes and expresses vital experiences for audiences; and the genre's relationship to history and modernity. Divided into two sections - "Melodrama's Transnational Histories" and "Aesthetics and Politics: Debates in Melodrama Theory" - the book will be a strong mix of film history and theory"--
