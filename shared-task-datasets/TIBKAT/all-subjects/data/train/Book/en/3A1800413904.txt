High-performance materials from bio-based feedstocks
"This book presents recent developments in the research, manufacture and application of advanced materials from bio-based feedstocks. Focusing not only on bio-based polymers, but also on inorganic components of biomass and conversion of biomass to advanced materials, the wealth of potential offered by such systems is illuminated. The structural properties of materials are correlated with various real life applications such as use in medicine (as tissue scaffolds or drug delivery), in construction (for greener pavements or buildings), in synthesis (as catalysts or solvents), in energy storage (for batteries or supercapacitors), in agriculture (for slow release fertilizers or remediation), and in food (packaging materials and nutrient delivery). This book targets many such applications and presents deep insights into the materials production, properties and performance. Topics covered include: *Advanced materials for chemistry: *Biomass to medical devices *Advanced bio-based inorganic materials *Advanced bio-based materials for energy storage applications *From farm to advanced materials"--
