The economics of motivation and organization : an introduction
In this unique book, Peter-J. Jost provides a comprehensive economic-psychological approach for successfully managing employees. Based on the analysis of the employeeâ€™s individual work behavior, he illustrates that instead of treating employees as input elements of production, and managing and controlling their work, organizations need to motivate their employees to act in the interest of the firm and in accordance with its goals.
