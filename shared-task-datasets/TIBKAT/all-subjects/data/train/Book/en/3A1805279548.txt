The alpha sequence : electromagnetic origin of the strong and weak nuclear forces
"The present book is about the study of the role the fine structure constant 'alpha' plays in the regularities exhibited by plots of the elementary particle lifetimes and energies. The author presented a phenomenological investigation of the recent experimental data, which reveals a clear-cut 'alpha'-quantization of the elementary particle lifetimes, and also of the conjugate particle energies"--
