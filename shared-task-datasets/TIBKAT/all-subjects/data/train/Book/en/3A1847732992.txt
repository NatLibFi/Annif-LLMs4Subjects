Together by design : the art and architecture of communal living
A growing area in the sharing economy, intentional communities (co-living, communal living, and cohousing projects) are explored in this timely survey via architecture, public policy, sociology, and sustainability. In recent years, the Atlantic, Forbes, Time, and Curbed have reported on the growth of intentional communities-collective housing alternatives that initially gained popularity in the United States in the early 1990s and originated in Denmark in the 1960s. Featuring fifteen to twenty contemporary projects that address the challenges and benefits of shared resources and spaces, Intentional Communities addresses a growing population: according to the Pew Research Center, nearly one in three adults in the United States lives in a shared household. From Copenhagen to Washington, DC, this survey covers architecture, public policy, design, lifestyle, culture, and environmental sustainability
