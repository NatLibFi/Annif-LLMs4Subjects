Bioethanol : biochemistry and biotechnological advances
"This new book, Bioethanol: Biochemistry and Biotechnological Advances, presents some insightful perspectives and important advances in the bioethanol industry. The volume goes into detail on the biochemical and physiological parameters carried out by the main bioethanol-producing microorganisms as well as the discusses the potential applications that bioproducts can have and the advantages they generate. The chapter authors discuss a variety of issues, including the physiology of ethanol production by yeasts, by Zymomonas mobilis, and by Clostridium thermocellum. Other sources of biofuel, such as sweet sorghum, Agave americana L. leaves waste, and fungi are included as well. Chapters also discuss the genetic regulation and genetic engineering of principal microorganisms and then go on to address ways to increase ethanol tolerance in industrially important ethanol fermenting organisms, methods for developing sustainable fermentable substrates, and new strategies for ethanol purification. Chapters explore the design and engineering requirements for bioreactors, bioelectrosynthesis of ethanol via bioelectrochemical systems, and more. The book will be a valuable resource for faculty and students in this area as well as for scientists, researchers, and managers in the biofuel industry in the area of biofuel production, fermentation process, environmental engineering and all other related scientific areas"--
