Globalisation, development and transition : conversations with eminent economists
This unique book provides a comprehensive survey of the major economic issues that have helped shape the modern world. It includes discussions of the latest research findings in the international economic development literature and scrutinises some of the most important debates in contemporary economics. Brian Snowdon examines the many controversies relating to long-run growth and development, problems of transitions from socialism to capitalism, international competitiveness and the impacts of globalisation. To shed light on these critical issues Brian Snowdon interviewed eleven leading economists who are featured in this book: Daron Acemoglu, Alberto Alesina, Padma Desai, William Easterly, Stanley Fischer, JÃ¡nos Kornai, Michael Porter, Dani Rodrik, Jeffrey Sachs, Xavier Sala-i-Martin and Jeffrey Williamson. Globalisation, Development and Transition provides an all-encompassing guide to the contemporary literature on economic development and related fields, as well as an extensive and up-to-date list of references. It will be an essential resource for all scholars and students of economics, especially those with an interest in economic growth and development, economic history, trade and globalisation, and the economics of transition
