Atmospheric modeling using PcModWin©/MODTRAN®
"MODTRAN® is a powerful tool for atmospheric modeling that can intimidate newcomers. This book guides readers through test cases relevant to their interests and discusses the mathematics and atmospheric physics incorporated in the software. Over the course of eight chapters, readers will (1) devise realistic exercises to apply MODTRAN, (2) correctly set up problems (which is half the task), and (3) solve said problems"--
Introductory material -- MODTRAN® modeling capability -- Getting started: transmittance calculations -- Getting started: atmospheric spectral radiance -- Multiple-scattering in MODTRAN® -- Surface reflectance in MODTRAN® -- Clouds and fog in MODTRAN® -- Special topics.
