Fluid dynamics of oil production
Fluid Dynamics of Oil Production is the perfect guide for understanding and building more accurate oil production models. It is dedicated to the theoretical and numerical study of fluid dynamic models, and much attention is paid to the analysis of the results of the hydrodynamic calculations based on these models and their use in the predictive estimates of the regulatory process of oil production. Other items include: a careful description of over 30 different mathematical models of oil formations; unconventional scenarios, such as models describing the process of foaming in oil formations and the combination of reservoir flow with liquid flow in wells; coverage of more complex and multi-dimensional models, including oil filtration results and methods
