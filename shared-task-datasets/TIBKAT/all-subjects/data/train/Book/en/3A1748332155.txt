CMOS RFIC design principles
Turn to this practical resource for comprehensive, expert guidance on designing CMOS RF integrated circuits. You get complete design details on elemental and advanced CMOS RF circuits, from low noise amplifiers, general gain amplifiers, mixers, and oscillators, to voltage controlled oscillators, phase lock loops, frequency synthesizers, and power amplifier architectures. The book discusses ideal circuit topologies and then looks at non-ideal CMOS circuit elements to provide insight into circuit modifications needed to achieve design specifications.
