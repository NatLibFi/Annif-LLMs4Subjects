Planning cities for the future : the successes and failures of urban economic strategies in Europe
Planning cities for the future links the study of urban economic competitiveness with urban planning and is able to ascertain the crucial factors for success in this area of public policy. These factors include effective governance, leadership and monitoring of performance. The author also reveals how economic turbulence--macro-economic stagnation, the emergence of competitors such as China and Central Europe and the introduction of the euro for example--all have distinct impacts on the economic development of cities. He also suggests that today's economic strengths may create tomorrow's social pathologies, a fact which city planners must always keep in mind. Peter Kresl's book offers examples of cities that got it right and others that did not
