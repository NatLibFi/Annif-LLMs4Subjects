Electroacoustics
"Based on twenty years of teaching, this text covers electric acoustic transducers such as microphones and loudspeakers, with additional material on array, radiation impedance, acoustic center, and modern loudspeaker enclosures. It include appendices on basic filter theory, electrical circuit theory, and homework problems in each chapter. Students can easily grasp the key scientific and engineering principles necessary to understand the practical design methods. It also contains information on how the rooms in which these transducers are used influence their acoustical behavior and how the properties of such transducers is assessed"--
