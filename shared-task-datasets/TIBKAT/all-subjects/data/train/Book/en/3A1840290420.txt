A Modern Introduction to Mathematical Analysis
This textbook presents all the basics for the first two years of a course in mathematical analysis, from the natural numbers to Stokes-Cartan Theorem. The main novelty which distinguishes this book is the choice of introducing the Kurzweil-Henstock integral from the very beginning. Although this approach requires a small additional effort by the student, it will be compensated by a substantial advantage in the development of the theory, and later on when learning about more advanced topics. The text guides the reader with clarity in the discovery of the many different subjects, providing all necessary tools â€“ no preliminaries are needed. Both students and their instructors will benefit from this book and its novel approach, turning their course in mathematical analysis into a gratifying and successful experience.
