Functional MRI : Basic Principles and Clinical Applications
Drs. Scott H. Faro and Feroze B. Mohamed of Drexel University College of Medicine have succeeded in translating benchmark research on functional MRI into clinical applications for the non-scientist physician, providing those unfamiliar with fMRI physics with much needed background. This practical and timely volume presents an overview of the principles of fMRI and explains experimental research design, outlines the challenges and limitations of fMRI, provides a detailed neuroanatomic atlas, and describes the clinical applications of fMRI in cognitive, sensory, motor, and pharmacological cases. Contributors to this comprehensive text include internationally recognized neurologists, radiologists, and psychologists.
