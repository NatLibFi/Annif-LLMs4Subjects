Problems in linear algebra and matrix theory
"This is the revised and expanded edition of the problem book Linear Algebra: Challenging Problems for Students, now entitled Problems in Linear Algebra and Matrix Theory. This new edition contains about fifty-five examples and many new problems, based on the author's lecture notes of Advanced Linear Algebra classes at Nova Southeastern University (NSU-Florida) and short lectures Matrix Gems at Shanghai University and Beijing Normal University. The book is intended for upper division undergraduate and beginning graduate students, and it can be used as text or supplement for a second course in linear algebra. Each chapter starts with Definitions, Facts, and Examples, followed by problems. Hints and solutions to all problems are also provided"--
