Programming with types : with examples in TypeScript
Introduction to typing -- Basic types -- Composition -- Type safety -- Function types -- Advanced applications of function types -- Subtyping -- Elements of object-oriented programming -- Generic data structures -- Generic algorithms and iterators -- Higher kinded types and beyond.
Common bugs often result from mismatched data types.  By precisely naming and controlling which data are allowable in a calculation, a strong type system can eliminate whole classes of errors and ensure data integrity throughout an application.  As a developer, skillfully using types in your everyday practice leads to better code and saves time tracking down tricky data-related errors.  "Programming with Types" teaches type-based techniques for writing software that's safe, correct, easy to maintain, and practically self-documenting.  Designed for working developers, this clearly written turtorial sticks with the practical benefits of type systems for everyday programming tasks.  Following real-world examples coded in TypeScript, you'll build your skills from primitive types up to more-advanced concepts like functors and monads
