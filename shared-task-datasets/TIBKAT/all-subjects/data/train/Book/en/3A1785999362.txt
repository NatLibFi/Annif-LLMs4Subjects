Classical systems in quantum mechanics
This book investigates two possibilities for describing classical-mechanical physical systems along with their Hamiltonian dynamics in the framework of quantum mechanics.The first possibility consists in exploiting the geometrical properties of the set of quantum pure states of "microsystems" and of the Lie groups characterizing the specific classical system. The second approach is to consider quantal systems of a large number of interacting subsystems - i.e. macrosystems, so as to study the quantum mechanics of an infinite number of degrees of freedom and to look for the behaviour of their collective variables. The final chapter contains some solvable models of "quantum measurement" describing dynamical transitions from "microsystems" to "macrosystems"
