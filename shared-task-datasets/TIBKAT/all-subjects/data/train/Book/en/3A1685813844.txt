Human resource management and evolutionary psychology : exploring the biological foundations of managing people at work
Answering pressing questions regarding employee selection and mobbing culture in the workplace, Andrew R. Timming explores the unique intersection of the biological sciences and human resource management. With a rich set of theoretical and empirical chapters, the author shines an innovative light on the fields of human resource management, organizational behavior and evolutionary psychology, engaging with the nature vs. nurture debate as well as offering a ground-breaking explanation for workplace bullying, unconscious bias, and employee selection decision-making. At times poignant and controversial, the book illustrates the dark side of human nature, with a unique focus on our primordial instincts. An excellent exploration into an emerging area, this Footprint will be ideal for human resource management and organizational behavior academics, as well as those interested in applied evolutionary, social, organizational, and experimental psychology
