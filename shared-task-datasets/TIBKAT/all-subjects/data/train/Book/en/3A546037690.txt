This handbook provides a definitive global survey of the interaction of religion and politics. Featuring contributions from an international team of experts, it examines the political aspects of all the world`s major religions, including such crucial contemporary issues as religious fundamentalism, terrorism, the war on terror, the `clash of civilizations` and science and religion. Four main themes addressed in this title include: the World religions and politics; religion and governance; religion and international relations; and, religion, security and development. References at the end of each chapter guide the reader towards the most up-to-date information on various topics. In addition, large amounts of information make this book an indispensable source of information for students, academics and the wider public interested in the dynamic relationship between politics and religion.
