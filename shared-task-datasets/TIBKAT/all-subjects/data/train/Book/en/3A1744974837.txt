Economics and the social sciences : boundaries, interaction and integration
This book is based on the premise that mainstream economics has become excessively specialized and formalized, entering a state of de facto withdrawal from the study of the economy in favour of exercises in applied mathematics. The editors believe that there is much scope for synergies by engaging in an encounter with economics and the other social sciences. The chapters in this book offer important new contributions to such a development
pt. 1. Economics and other social sciences : relationships and boundaries -- pt. 2. New light on rationality, social relations and the environment -- pt. 3. Flexibility, routines and production in economics and social sciences.
