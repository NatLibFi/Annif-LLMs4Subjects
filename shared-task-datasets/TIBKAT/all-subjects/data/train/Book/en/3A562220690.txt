Thermal processing of packaged foods
This is the second edition of Holdsworth and Simpson's highly practical work on a subject of growing importance in this age of convenience foods. As before, it discusses the physical and engineering aspects of the thermal processing of packaged foods, and examines the methods which have been used to establish the time and temperature of processes to sterilize or pasteurize the food. However, there is lots of new material too. Unlike other texts on thermal processing, which cover very adequately the technology of the subject, the unique emphasis of this text is on processing engineering and its relation to the safety of processed foods products.
