Cybersecurity : public sector threats and responses
"Written as a reference, but easily adaptable for classroom use, this book explains the importance of cyber security, why readers should care, and what threats to watch for. It also offers information on how to improve an operating environment and better safeguard the constituents organizations serve. Based on research that claims that cyber security policy is often set at less senior levels of corporations, and left to IT security professionals, this book explains why security should be addressed by senior level management.
