Analysis of multinational strategic management : the selected scientific papers of Alan M. Rugman and Alain Verbeke
Characterized by new analytical insights and methods in the field of international business, this collection of articles by Alan Rugman and Alain Verbeke celebrates their long and productive work together on issues facing top managers of multinational enterprises. Fueled by their belief in the need for better theory in multinational strategic management, the authors have explored a number of different facets in this increasingly important realm. They have organized the work into five sections: the foundations of a new theory of multinational strategic management, a radically new examination of multinational strategic management, national competitiveness, the relatively under-researched but increasingly important issue of environmental strategies of multinational enterprises, and the interactions between multinational strategic management and public policy. This outstanding collection, inspired by the occasion of Alan Rugman's 60th birthday, will be of great interest to scholars and practitioners of international business and management, as well as to economists and lawyers
