This book presents the fatigue properties of structural materials used for the production of ceramics. It explains the cyclic deformation and how failures occur by fatigue. Dislocations related to fatigue are examined. The way that fatigue induces structural changes in material undergoing cyclic deformation is explained as well. A special chapter considers the importance of environmental effects on fatigue. Surface treatment such as shot pinning, sand blasting and laser treatment are described. The book explains how design should be carried out considering all the major factors leading to reduced fatigue resistance.
