Computational Wave Propagation
The papers contained in this volume represent a snap-shot of current applied mathematics research in wave propagation and scattering. Although the mathematical underpinnings of the research contained herein are rooted in classical asymptotic and numerical analyses, each author is motivated by a complex technological problem which requires a resolution. The problems range from using underwater sound to monitor and predict global warming, to periodically embedding phase-sensitive amplifiers in optical fibres to insure long range digital communication. Such variety shows that wave propagation and scattering remain vital and important areas of mathematical and scientific endeavors
