Proteomics of microorganisms : fundamental aspects and application$nElektronische Ressource
The quest for the elucidation of the molecular anatomy of life has been the key driver for all the genome projects and the development of a variety of new technological areas, e.g. Genomics, Functional Genomics, Differential Display, DNA-Chips, Transcriptomics, and Proteomics. In contrast to the Genome which reflects a huge but still countable number of genes and DNA building blocks (information), the number of possible Proteomes which reflect the dynamic adaptation of protein networks in a given organism (function) to all kinds of changes is infinite. In the last decade, experimental approaches and all kinds of supporting technologies were developed which now allow scientists to address most of the problems in Proteome Analysis and Proteomics. In the present volume, the editors and authors have focused on the impact of Proteomics on products and processes, the application of Proteomics in microbiology and industrial biotechnology, as well as new important technology developments in Proteomics
