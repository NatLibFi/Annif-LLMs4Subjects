Metamorphoses : resurrection, body and transformative practices in early Christianity
How were ideas and experiences of transformation expressed in early Christianity and early Judaism? This volume explores the social and philosophical frameworks within which transformative ideas such as resurrection and practices of becoming "a new being" were shaped. It also explores the analogies and parameters by which transformation was being observed, noted and asserted.
