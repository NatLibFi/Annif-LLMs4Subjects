Introduction to experimental methods
"Introduction to Experimental Methods succinctly explains fundamental engineering concepts in mechanics, dynamics, heat transfer, and fluid dynamics. From conceptualizing an engineering experiment to presenting the results with lab experiments, this book enables students to work through the design process and analyze experimental results. Offering a complete overview of instruction for engineering lab methodology, the book includes practical lab manuals for student use, directly complimenting the instruction. The book presents numerous worked examples and problems, as well as several hands-on experiments presented in individual lab manuals. It discusses how to write lab reports, various instruments and equipment, as well as failures in experimentation. The book is intended for senior undergraduate engineering students taking courses in Experimental Methods. Instructors will be able to utilize a Solutions Manual for their course"--
