Photonic Crystal Fibers : Properties and Applications
This book is intended to provide expert guidance through the properties of photonic crystal fibers, with a specific focus on the telecommunication aspects. This is the first book to report a complete overview of photonic crystal fiber analysis and design for telecom applications. The authors believe that photonic crystal fibers can revolutionize the field of guided optics and its applications.
Photonic crystal fibers, also known as microstructured or holey fibers, have recently generated great interest in the scientific community thanks to the new ways provided to control and guide light, not obtainable with conventional optical fibers. Proposed for the first time in the 90's, photonic crystal fibers have driven an exciting and irrepressible research activity all over the World, starting in the telecommunication field and then touching metrology, spectroscopy, microscopy, astronomy, micromachining, biology and sensing.This book is intended to provide an expert guidance through the p
