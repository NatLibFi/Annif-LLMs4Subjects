A practical guide to power-line communication
"This excellent resource synthesizes the theory and practice of power line communication (PLC), providing a straightforward introduction to the fundamentals of PLC as well as an exhaustive review of the performance, evaluation, and security of heterogeneous networks that combine PLC with other means of communications. It advances the groundwork on PLC, a tool with the potential to boost the performance of local networks, and provides useful worked problems on, for example, PLC protocol optimization. Covering the PHY andMAC layers of the most popular PLC specifications, including tutorials and experimental frameworks, and featuring many examples of real-world applications and performance, it is ideal for university researchers and professional engineers designing and maintaining PLC or hybrid devices and networks"--
