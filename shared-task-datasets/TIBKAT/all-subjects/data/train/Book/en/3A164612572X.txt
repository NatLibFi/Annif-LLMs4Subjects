Diffusion in Solids : Fundamentals, Methods, Materials, Diffusion-Controlled Processes
This book describes the central aspects of diffusion in solids, and goes on to provide easy access to important information about diffusion in metals, alloys, semiconductors, ion-conducting materials, glasses and nanomaterials.Coverage includes diffusion-controlled phenomena including ionic conduction, grain-boundary and dislocation pipe diffusion. This book will benefit graduate students in such disciplines as solid-state physics, physical metallurgy, materials science, and geophysics, as well as scientists in academic and industrial research laboratories.
Diffusion is a vital topic in solid-state physics and chemistry, physical metallurgy and materials science. Diffusion processes are ubiquitous in solids at elevated temperatures. A thorough understanding of diffusion in materials is crucial for materials development and engineering. This book first gives an account of the central aspects of diffusion in solids, for which the necessary background is a course in solid state physics. It then provides easy access to important information about diffusion in metals, alloys, semiconductors, ion-conducting materials, glasses and nanomaterials. Several diffusion-controlled phenomena, including ionic conduction, grain-boundary and dislocation pipe diffusion, are considered as well. Graduate students in solid-state physics, physical metallurgy, materials science, physical and inorganic chemistry or geophysics will benefit from this book as will physicists, chemists, metallurgists, materials engineers in academic and industrial research laboratories.
