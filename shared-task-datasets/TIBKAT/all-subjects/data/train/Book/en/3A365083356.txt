History of regional science and the regional science association International : the beginnings and early history
A well-written and exciting historical account of the way in which regional science and the formation of the society associated with the field, Regional Science Association International, developed. It starts with the rise of Hitler, the advent of the Keynesian Revolution, the intense mathematization of economics and relates how an individual's creative thinking effectively combated the strong resistance of conventional social sciences. The text has been written by the founder of the Regional Science Association and current President of the North American Regional Science Council. It is of interest to regional scientists, economists, sociologists, urban- and regional planners, geographers, and transportation researchers.
