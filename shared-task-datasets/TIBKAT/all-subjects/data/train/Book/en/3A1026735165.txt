Android phones for dummies
This book documents all the features of the Android phones, approaching them from the point of view of a smart person who is intimidated by the technology and baffled by the scant documentation and online support. All topics for the Android phone will be covered, from setup and configuration, to use of the phone features: texting, e-mailing, accessing the Internet, maps, navigation, camera and video, synching with a PC, and expanding the phones potential with new software. As usual, humor is generously sprinkled throughout the text. The accessible and fun writing style provides relief but never gets in the way of the books important content. The reader will end up keeping this book close, referring to it often as they explore the features of their Android phone. It covers all the updates to the OS through the latest version release
