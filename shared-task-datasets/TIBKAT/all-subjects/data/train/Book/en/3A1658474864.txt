Effective Spacetime : Understanding Emergence in Effective Field Theory and Quantum Gravity
This book discusses the notion that quantum gravity may represent the "breakdown" of spacetime at extremely high energy scales. If spacetime does not exist at the fundamental level, then it has to be considered "emergent", in other words an effective structure, valid at low energy scales. The author develops a conception of emergence appropriate to effective theories in physics, and shows how it applies (or could apply) in various approaches to quantum gravity, including condensed matter approaches, discrete approaches, and loop quantum gravity.
Introduction: Spacetime and quantum gravity -- Emergence and reduction -- Effective field theory -- Universality, higher organising principles and emergence -- Spacetime as described by EFT -- Discrete approaches to quantum gravity -- Loop quantum gravity -- Conclusion: Now here from nowhere.
