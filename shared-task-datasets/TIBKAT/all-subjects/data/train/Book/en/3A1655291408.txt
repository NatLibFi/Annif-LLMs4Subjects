Topics in Set Theory : Lebesgue Measurability, Large Cardinals, Forcing Axioms, Rho-functions
During the Fall Semester of 1987, Stevo Todorcevic gave a series of lectures at the University of Colorado. These notes of the course, taken by the author, give a novel and fast exposition of four chapters of Set Theory. The first two chapters are about the connection between large cardinals and Lebesque measure. The third is on forcing axioms such as Martin's axiom or the Proper Forcing Axiom. The fourth chapter looks at the method of minimal walks and p-functions and their applications. The book is addressed to researchers and graduate students interested in Set Theory, Set-Theoretic Topology and Measure Theory
