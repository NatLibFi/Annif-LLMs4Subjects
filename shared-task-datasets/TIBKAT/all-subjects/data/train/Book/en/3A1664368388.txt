A textbook of cultural economics
"This book is written as an introduction to cultural economics; it assumes no knowledge of economics, even of supply and demand, and each economic concept is explained as it is introduced in the text. The book represents my kind of cultural economics and my motive for writing this book is to expand cultural economics beyond its earlier scope to include the creative industries and the issues of copyright law that relate to them."
