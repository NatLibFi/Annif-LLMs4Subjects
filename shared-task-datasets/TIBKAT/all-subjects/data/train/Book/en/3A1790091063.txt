This volume aims to broaden our understanding of the related genres of parables, fables, and similes in the Graeco-Roman world. These genres, which make use of narrative analogy, appear in early Christian and ancient Jewish literatures and in various Graeco-Roman sources. However, despite the fact that these texts were part of the wider cultural context of Graeco-Roman antiquity, they have not yet been thoroughly studied in relation to each other. The present volume brings together contributions on a range of Graeco-Roman, Jewish, and Christian sources, so as to contribute to the study of parables, fables, and similes across disciplinary boundaries. The contributions highlight the fluid boundaries between these different genres, but also demonstrate how their adoption and adaption in different literary works give expression to the distinct identities of the composers.Survey of contentsAlbertina Oegema/Martijn Stoutjesdijk: Beyond the Parable-Fable Dichotomy: An Introduction to the Volume− Jonathan Pater: Parables in the New Testament and Rabbinic Literature between Simile and Fable: A status quaestionis    Greek and Roman Literature    Jeremy B.
