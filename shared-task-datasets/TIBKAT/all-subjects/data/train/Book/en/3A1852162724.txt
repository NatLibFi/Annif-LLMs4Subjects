Continuum micromechanics : theory and application to multiscale tectonics
The book integrates theory, numerical methods, and practical applications seamlessly. MATLAB and MathCad programs are provided for readers to master the theory, understand the approach, and to further develop and apply the methods to geological problems. Multiscale and multi-physics investigations of Earth and planetary processes have been an active trend of research in Earth Sciences, thanks to the development of scientific computation and computer software and hardware. Based on the author's research and teaching over the past 15 years, the book stands alone as the first comprehensive text in unifying fundamental continuum micromechanics theory, geometric/kinematic analysis, and applications. The book should appeal to a broad audience of students and researchers, particularly those in the fields of structural geology, tectonics, (natural and experimental) rock deformation, mineral physics and rheology, and numerical modeling of multiscale and coupling processes.
