Architecture & human rights : a book on urban thinking
The striking inequalities in living conditions in today?s cities and metropolises reveal one of the greatest humanitarian challenges of our time. Ascertaining that architecture can never be neutral, those involved in this field of design are called on to recognize and to act on their social responsibility ? not only ? in the city-making process. Their work should therefore not be limited to creating living space as questions of the distribution of resources, so closely interwoven with architectural design, must also play a role. This book is conceived as a collage of narratives, photos and critical conversations on the link between human rights and architecture. In its hybrid form, all of the people involved at every level are given a voice and encouraged to question whether the architecture of the towns, streets and buildings for which they are responsible contributes to the protection and advancement of human rights. The ultimate goal is that the consideration of human rights become an architect?s powerful tool for better and fairer urban planning
