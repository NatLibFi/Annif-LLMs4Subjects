Individual chapters from the world's top experts in the field explores the ways in which political psychology impacts on issues as diverse as migration, conflict and violence as well as electoral politics while also situating the discipline within the realm of political decision-making and policy on important debates relating to foreign policy and relations, political participation and terrorism amongst a variety of other issues.  Furthermore, the collection offers analytical illustrations of Social Identity Theory, psychoanalytic approaches, Dialogical Self Theory, Social Representations Theory and Self-Categorisation Theory, allowing for an in-depth engagement across theoretical contributions to the field.  Using theoretical and methodological approaches in conjunction with empirical evidence, this Handbook maps the diverse field of political psychology in its entirety and explores its future direction. The resulting volume is a KEY addition to the libraries of all those who study or harbour an interest in political psychology.  "--
