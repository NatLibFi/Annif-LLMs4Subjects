New suburbanisms
"Historically, we see the city as the cramped, crumbling core of development and culture, and the suburb as the vast outlying wasteland - convenient, but vacant. Contemporary urban design proves us wrong. In New SubUrbanisms, Judith De Jong explains the on-going "flattening" of the American Metropolis, as suburbs are becoming more like their central cities - and cities more like their suburbs through significant changes in spatial and formal practice as well as demographic and cultural changes. These revisionist practices are exemplified in the emergence of hybrid sub/urban conditions such as parking practices, the residential densification of suburbia, hyper-programmed public spaces and inner city big-box retail, among others"-Provided by publisher
