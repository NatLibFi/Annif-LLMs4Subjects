Readers of this book will be able to: utilize the fundamental principles of fluid mechanics and thermodynamics to analyze aircraft engines, understand the common gas turbine aircraft propulsion systems and be able to determine the applicability of each, perform system studies of aircraft engine systems for specified flight conditions, perform preliminary aerothermal design of turbomachinery components, and conceive, analyze, and optimize competing preliminary designs for conventional and unconventional missions. Early coverage of cycle analysis provides a systems perspective, and offers context for the chapters on turbomachinery and components Broader coverage than found in most other books - including coverage of propellers, nuclear rockets, and space propulsion - allows analysis and design of more types of propulsion systems In depth, quantitative treatments of the components of jet propulsion engines provides the tools for evaluation and component matching for optimal system performance Worked examples and end of chapter exercises provide practice for analysis, preliminary design, and systems integration
