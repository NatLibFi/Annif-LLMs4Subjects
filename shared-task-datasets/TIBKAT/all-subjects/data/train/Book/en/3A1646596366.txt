Cardiac CT imaging : diagnosis of cardiovascular disease
CT is an accurate technique for assessing cardiac structure and function, but advances in computing power and scanning technology have resulted in increased popularity. It is useful in evaluating the myocardium, coronary arteries, pulmonary veins, thoracic aorta, pericardium, and cardiac masses, because of this and the speed at which scans can be performed, CT is even more attractive as a cost-effective and integral part of patient evaluation. This book collates all the current knowledge of cardiac CT and presents it in a clinically relevant and practical format appropriate for both cardiologists and radiologists. The images have been supplied by an experienced set of contributing authors and represent the full spectrum of cardiac CT. As increasing numbers have access to cardiac CT scanners, this book provides all the relevant information on this modality. A CD-ROM is included containing a large number of cardiac CT images and videos, providing the reader with a dynamic primer in cardiac CT diagnosis.
