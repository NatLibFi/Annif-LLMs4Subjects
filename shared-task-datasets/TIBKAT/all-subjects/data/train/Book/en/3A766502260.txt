Beginning partial differential equations
"Featuring a challenging, yet accessible, introduction to partial differential equations, Beginning Partial Differential Equations provides a solid introduction to partial differential equations, particularly methods of solution based on characteristics, separation of variables, as well as Fourier series, integrals, and transforms. Thoroughly updated with novel applications, such as Poe's pendulum and Kepler's problem in astronomy, this third edition is updated to include the latest version of Maples, which is integrated throughout the text. New topical coverage includes novel applications, such as Poe's pendulum and Kepler's problem in astronomy"--
