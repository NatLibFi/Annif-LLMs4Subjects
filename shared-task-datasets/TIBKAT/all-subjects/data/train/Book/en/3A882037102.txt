Atelier Bow-Wow : commonalities of architecture
Each year the Wouter Mikmak Foundation invites a designer to lecture for the series ?Designers of the Future?. This publication presents projects realized by the Tokyo-based office Atelier Bow-Wow, founded in 1992 by Yoshiharu Tsukamoto and Momoyo Kaijima. Their vision calls for a shift in architectural design from individuality to commonality, through the notion of architectural ?behaviorology?. Behaviour in this sense is an inclusive term that not only denotes human practice, but also a building?s behaviour as material typology, as well as phenomena produced by natural elements like light, air, heat, and water. An architecture based on commonalities is key to their architectural philosophy and design
