Exhibition design
Successful exhibition design is more than the presentation of products, objects and ideas, going beyond the mere conveyance of information related to them. A functioning concept must contribute to a deeper understanding. It must also tell a story. The basic and defining concept is to not only allow but to actually initiate communication and interaction between the exhibit and the observer. The interdisciplinary fusion of architecture, graphic design, digital media, and interior design, occasionally even including scenographic elements gives creativity a very large space to bloom. The permanent and contemporary projects presented in this volume include museums and art exhibitions, installations, as well as the presentation of products at fair booths and in show rooms
"Exhibition Design showcases 60 exceptional projects which have more to show than the simple exhibition of objects. The ingeniously developed concepts and artistic stagings presented in this volume stimulate our senses in a special way and tell stories, inspired by mediality and transformation."--
