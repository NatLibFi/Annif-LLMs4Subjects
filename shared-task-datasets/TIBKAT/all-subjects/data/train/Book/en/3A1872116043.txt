Genocidal violence : concepts, forms, impact
This volume offers an introduction about theoretical concepts, forms, and the impact of genocidal violence. It thereby intends to serve as a source of texts that can be used in a variety of introductory courses on genocide and the violence that occurs during genocidal events in particular.
