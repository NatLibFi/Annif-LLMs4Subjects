The economics of cultural diversity
The populations of many countries in the world are becoming more culturally diverse. This spurs a growing need for an informed debate on the socio-economic implications of cultural diversity. This book offers a solid statistical and econometric perspective on this topical subject by bringing together studies from different countries in Europe and North America. The research in this volume sheds light on several consequences of cultural diversity, including positive impacts on innovation, growth and entrepreneurship. The original and quantitative contributions also highlight the negative social effects on communities. Throughout the volume, it is evident that the effects of cultural diversity on socio-economic outcomes depend largely on the characteristics of local economies, populations and communities. Utilising a broad spectrum of research methods over a multitude of research areas, this comprehensive overview of the socio-economic impacts of cultural diversity is a valuable resource for students and academics.
