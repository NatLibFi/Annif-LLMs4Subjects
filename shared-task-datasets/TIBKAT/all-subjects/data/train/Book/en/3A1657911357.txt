Introduction to Particle Cosmology : The Standard Model of Cosmology and its Open Problems
Introduction -- The Standard Model of Particle Physics -- General Relativity -- Cosmological Models -- Thermodynamics of the Early Universe -- Inflation -- Baryogenesis -- Big Bang Nucleosynthesis -- Dark Matter (DM) -- Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation -- Large Scale Structures -- Dark Energy.
This book introduces the basic concepts of particle cosmology and covers all the main aspects of the Big Bang Model (expansion of the Universe, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, Cosmic Microwave Background, large scale structures) and the search for new physics (inflation, baryogenesis, dark matter, dark energy). It also includes the majority of recent discoveries, such as the precise determination of cosmological parameters using experiments like WMAP and Planck, the discovery of the Higgs boson at LHC, the non-discovery to date of supersymmetric particles, and the search for the imprint of gravitational waves on the CMB polarization by Planck and BICEP. This textbook is based on the authorsâ€™ courses on Cosmology, and aims at introducing Particle Cosmology to senior undergraduate and graduate students. It has been especially written to be accessible even for those students who do not have a strong background in General Relativity and quantum field theory. The content of this book is organized in an easy-to-use style and students will find it a helpful research guide.
