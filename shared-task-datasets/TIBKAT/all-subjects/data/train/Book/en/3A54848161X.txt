Extending the frontiers : essays on the new transatlantic slave trade database
"The essays in this book provide statistical analysis of the transatlantic slave trade, focusing especially on Brazil and Portugal, from the 17th through the 19th century. It contains the most up-to-date and comprehensive research on slave ship voyages, origins, destinations, numbers of slaves per port, country, year, and period. In 1999 the same authors published The Transatlantic Slave Trade Dataset (Cambridge, book and CD), but it did not include data on Brazil and Central America, which this book fills in."--Provided by the publisher
