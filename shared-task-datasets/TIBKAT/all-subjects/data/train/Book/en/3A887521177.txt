"Among the many materials investigated in the infrared (IR) field, narrow-gap semiconductors are the most important in IR photon detector family. Although the first widely used narrow-gap materials were lead salts (during the 1950s, IR detectors were built using single-element-cooled PbS and PbSe photoconductive detectors, primary for anti-missile seekers), this semiconductor family was not well distinguished. This situation seems to have resulted from two reasons: the preparation process of lead salt photoconductive polycrystalline detectors was not well understood and could only be reproduced with well-tried recipes; and the theory of narrow-gap semiconductor bandgap structure was not well known for correct interpretation of the measured transport and photoelectrical properties of these materials"--
