Salivary Gland Disorders
Co-edited by Eugene N. Myers, a world-famous expert in the field, this has got to be the last word on salivary gland disorders. The disorders themselves cover a broad array of diseases, both benign and malignant. Thus, the contents of this book have been organized to reflect the diverse nature of salivary gland anatomy, physiology, and dysfunction in various states of disease. In this way, the evolution of the field and its diagnostic and therapeutic management are better demonstrated. Covering everything from practical diagnosis to gland tumor therapy, this really is a crucial work for any surgeon working in the facial or neck regions.
