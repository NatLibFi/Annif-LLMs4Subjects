Skyscrapers : a history of the world's most extraordinary buildings
"This book is not meant to be a comprehensive guide but a selective survey of landmark skyscrapers that have pushed the art of the very tall building upward. It is organized chronologically to show the stylistic evolution of the skyscraper from its structurally rigorous beginnings in the 1880s in frontier Chicago to the extravagant Manhattan creations that epitomized the golden age between the two world wars; then onward through the ascendancy of the International Style, the vigorous recycling of postmodernism, and to the hybridization of modernist, postmodern, and vernacular styles."--
This completely revised and full-color edition presents 10 new buildings, among them The Shard in London (2012, Renzo Piano), the International Commerce Centre in Hong Kong (2010, Kohn Pedersen Fox), the Shanghai Tower (2014, Gensler Architects), and the Kingdom Tower in Jeddah (2018, Adrian Smith), which will be the tallest building in the world when completed. Arranged chronologically by date of building construction, each informative spread has photos of the featured building from various angles, building plans, diagrams, the building's historical background, and technological information. Skyscrapers also offers additional information on such topics as the ancient roots of skyscrapers and visionary cities of the future.--
