Bourdieu and higher education : life in the modern university
This book introduces Bourdieu in the context of higher education for unfamiliar readers or those who would like to see his theories applied in the higher education setting. It builds upon previous research into higher education leadership and administration to examine how the university sector has changed over recent decades and how it has been reshaped into its current form. The book draws together various aspects of higher education influenced by the mass-market higher education system to examine how these forces have affected each other positively and negatively and demonstrate the culminating impact of these forces on the sector. It also focuses on the realities of what drives work and life in the modern university. It traces the steps the sector has taken in some areas to address equity issues by increasing diversity and inclusion and highlights the systemic issues that persist.
