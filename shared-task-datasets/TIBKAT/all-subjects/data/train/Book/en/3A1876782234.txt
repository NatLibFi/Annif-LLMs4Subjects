"This publication offers a handy key to the period 2016-2022. Published in English, it aims to show the rest of the world what Danish architecture is about, as part of the 2023 celebrations when Denmark is host for the international Year of Architecture. Using professional photography and drawings, the book tells the story of 50 different projects, new builds as well as conversions and restaurations, representing a wide range of fields: housing, culture, religion, transport, etc. Each project is displayed across three full spreads with descriptive texts and factual information. Besides a summary of its formal background, each individual work is characterized through a brief quote from the review of it in the journal ARKITEKTEN."
