The social machine : designs for living online
"Donath presents new approaches to creating interfaces for social interaction. She addresses such topics as visualizing social landscapes, conversations, and networks; depicting identity with knowledge markers and interaction history; delineating public and private space; and bringing the online world' s open sociability into the physical world. Donath asks fundamental questions about how we want to live online and offers thought-provoking design that explore radically new ways of interacting and communicating."--
