"Corpus Linguistics has revolutionised the world of language study and is an essential component of work in Applied Linguistics. This book, now in its second edition, provides a thorough introduction to all the key research issues in Corpus Linguistics, from the point of view of Applied Linguistics. The field has progressed a great deal since the first edition, so this edition has been completely rewritten to reflect these advances, whilst still maintaining the emphasis on hands-on corpus research of the first edition. It includes chapters on qualitative and quantitative research, applications in language teaching, discourse studies, and beyond. It also includes an extensive discussion of the place of Corpus Linguistics in linguistic theory, and provides numerous detailed examples of corpus studies throughout. Providing an accessible but thorough grounding to the fascinating, fastmoving field of Corpus Linguistics, this book is essential reading for the student and the researcher alike"--
