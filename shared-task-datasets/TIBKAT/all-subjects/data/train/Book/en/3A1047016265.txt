Productivity and innovation in SMEs : creating competitive advantage in Singapore and Southeast Asia
"This book analyses the determining factors behind productivity and innovation amongst Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Singapore, and within the context of South East Asia, in order to offer recommendations for increasing productivity and aiding economic growth. This book investigates the factors determining productivity amongst SMEs across the manufacturing, retail and food and beverage domains. It utilises personal interviews with global experts and CEOs, combined with primary data collected from a major international Delphi survey, and interviews with two hundred and fifteen SME owners and managers in Singapore. This data helps us to better understand how these productivity-enhancing factors can be used to increase performance amongst SMEs. By investigating the nature and process of total factor productivity in Singapore's SMEs, this book tells the policy story behind the revolution. To provide a comparative analysis, Singapore's story is placed within a South East Asian context. The unfolding narrative contains important lessons for policy-makers and industry globally, as they assess the strategic choices available to them for improving productivity and innovation. This book will be of great interest to students and scholars of innovation and productivity, as well as economic development officers, government policy advisors, SME business managers and to sustainable businesses"--
