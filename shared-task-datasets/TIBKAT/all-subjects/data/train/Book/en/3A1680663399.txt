Probabilistic machine learning for civil engineers
"The book introduces probabilistic machine learning concepts to civil engineering students and professionals, who typically do not have the background necessary to understand the subject from a purely computer science perspective. It presents key approaches among the three sub-fields of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. The methods are demonstrated through step-by-step examples and copius illustrations in order to simplify abstract concepts. The book will prepare readers to access the vast body of literature from the field of machine learning"--
