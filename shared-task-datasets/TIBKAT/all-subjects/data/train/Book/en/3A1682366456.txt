This Spotlight teaches the commands necessary to analyze spectroscopic data (Raman/FTIR) using MATLAB. It explains how to build an analysis routine step by step and perform pre-processing and multivariate analysis with a single click. The script for support vector machines (SVMs) is also briefly addressed so that readers can build a script tailored to their own laboratory routine
