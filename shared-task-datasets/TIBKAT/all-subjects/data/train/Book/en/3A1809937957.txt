Handbook of materials for percussion musical instruments
This book describes the properties of materials used for making percussion instruments for classical music played by a symphony orchestra in which the instruments could be played as a soloist instrument or as a group or several groups of instruments, as they are included into a musical work. A chapter is devoted to the bells. The scope of this book is primarily confined to percussion instruments of symphony orchestras taking into account the centuries of musical art and tradition. This book bridges the gap in the technical literature on describing the properties of materials for percussion instrumentsâ€”timpani, other drums, marimba, xylophone, vibraphone, gong, cymbal, triangle, celesta, castanets.
