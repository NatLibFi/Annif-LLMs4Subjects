Biomedical applications of mesoporous ceramics : drug delivery, smart materials, and bone tissue engineering
"This book provides a comprehensive overview of silica-based mesoporous materials with special attention given to their use in drug delivery systems, sophisticated stimuli-responsive materials, and bone tissue engineering. The text provides a comprehensive overview of the basic aspects of the properties of mesoporous materials, with a focus on textural properties such as surface and porosity. Starting from this consolidated knowledge, it then addresses various aspects of more sophisticated stimuli-responsive materials, where drugs can be encapsulated inside the porous framework and then released when desired. The final chapters are dedicated to bone tissue engineering"--Provided by publisher
