Landscape and labour : work, place, and the working class in Eliot, Hardy, and Lawrence
"In the novels of George Eliot, Thomas Hardy, and D. H. Lawrence a miniature history of the English working class can be found. They transformed working-class culture from a patronizing pastiche into a vital reality. Landscape and Labour offers a sense of direction for contemporary politics by rediscovering the vital force of working-class culture"--
