Smart grid and enabling technologies
"A "smart grid" is an electrical grid which includes a variety of operational and energy measures including smart meters, smart appliances, renewable energy resources, and energy efficiency resources. Electronic power conditioning and control of the production and distribution of electricity are important aspects of the smart grid. Integration of renewable energy resources and energy storage into the smart grid involve many aspects, such as: efficiency, reliability and energy conversion cost, forecasting of energy production capability, safe connection to the electric grid and/or capability to control micro-grids, efficient energy storage with low environmental impact, development of advanced control and monitoring algorithms, and networking of the sources/consumers"--
