Marine climate and climate change : storms, wind waves and storm surges
Marine environmental conditions such as storms, storm surges and wave heigths are directly experienced by, for example, off-shore operations or coastal populations. The authors review and bring together the state-of-the-art and present day knowledge about historical changes, recent trends and concepts on how marine environmental conditions may change in the future. Consequences and implications for future off-shore operations and coastal defence are covered.
Brings together the knowledge about historical changes, trends and concepts on how marine environmental conditions may change.
