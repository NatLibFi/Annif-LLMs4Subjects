Geo-topology : theory, models and applications
Geo-Topology is an exploration of the depth and breadth of the relationships between Geography and Topology, with applications ranging from Landscape Geography to Social Geography and from Spatial Analysis to Geospatial Technologies. It shows how topics of geographical research (landscapes, borders, spatial social relationships etc) can be examined by using mathematical concepts and methods of Topology, exposing the realm of geo-topological modelling and visualization through Point-Set Topology, Knot Theory, Reeb graphs, Topological Surfaces (i.e. MÃ¶bius bands and Klein bottles), Differential Topology, Network Analysis, Combinatorial Topology, Braid Theory and Ultrametric Topology. Besides geographers, this book is a trove of new ideas for landscape ecologists, mathematicians, data scientists, sociologists, psychologists, anthropologists and educators. Geo-Topology is a systematic introduction to topological thinking in Geography, also by highlighting the significance of Topology for Geographical Education, as well as for the Philosophy and Epistemology of Geography.
