Star Clusters and How to Observe Them
Astronomy enthusiasts will all appreciate the detailed yet easily-assimilated description of star clusters, how they were formed as our Milky Way galaxy, how they evolved, and how they are classified. The latest research has revealed a vast amount of fascinating information about the clusters, along with some spectacular photographs. Modern commercially-made telescopes enable amateur astronomers to see a surprising amount of detail, and to record - using CCD cameras, video, webcams or even film - some remarkably beautiful and detailed images. Contained here also is detailed information on using refractors, reflectors, and, of course, Meade and Celestron's ubiquitous range of computer-controlled SCT telescopes.
