Experimenting with religion : the new science of belief
This text showcases several experiments as examples of how psychologists can study religion and spirituality, casting a light on both the ingenuity and limitations of each. Ultimately, this book demonstrates that such scientific experiments are works of imagination that can help us discover truths about the human mind's proclivity for religious ideas, as long as we can adapt and learn along the way.
