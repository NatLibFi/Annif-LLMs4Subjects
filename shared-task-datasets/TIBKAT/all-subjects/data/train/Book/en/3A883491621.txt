Impact on Composite Structures
Composites are used extensively in engineering applications. A constant concern is the effect of foreign object impacts on composite structures because significant damage can occur and yet be undetectable by visual inspection. Such impacts can range from the most ordinary at low velocity - a tool dropped on a product - to the hypervelocity impact of space debris on a spacecraft. This book explains how damage develops during impact, the effect of impact-induced damage on the mechanical behavior of structures, and methods of damage prediction and detection. Numerous examples are included to illustrate these topics. Written for graduate students, as well as researchers and practising engineers working with composite materials, this book presents state-of-the-art knowledge on impact dynamics while requiring only basic understanding of the mechanics of composite materials
