Buddhism, conflict, and violence in modern Sri Lanka
"Buddhism, Conflict and Violence in Modern Sri Lanka explores dilemmas that Theravada Buddhism faces in relation to the continuing ethnic conflict and violence in recent decades. In this book, scholars in the fields of anthropology, history, Buddhist Studies and Pali examine multiple dimensions of the problem. It discusses in detail various Buddhist responses to the crisis and suggests ways how resources found within Buddhism and Buddhist institutions can help create peace in Sri Lanka. Evaluating the role of Buddhists and their institutions in bringing about an end to war and violence, this collection puts forward a critical analysis of the religious conditions contributing to continuing hostilities."--Jacket
