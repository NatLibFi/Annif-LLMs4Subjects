Homotopy Theoretic Methods in Group Cohomology
This book looks at group cohomology with tools that come from homotopy theory. These tools give both decomposition theorems (which rely on homotopy colimits to obtain a description of the cohomology of a group in terms of the cohomology of suitable subgroups) and global structure theorems (which exploit the action of the ring of topological cohomology operations)
