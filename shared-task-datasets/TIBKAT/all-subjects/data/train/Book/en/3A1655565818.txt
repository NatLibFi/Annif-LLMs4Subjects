Learn Apple HomeKit on iOS : A Home Automation Guide for Developers, Designers, and Homeowners
This book is the complete guide to Apple's home automation technology, HomeKit. You’ll learn the HomeKit platform structure and how it supports devices—existing and planned—and you’ll get a thorough grounding on new and useful apps that deliver a new generation of home automation in a secure and innovative environment. Learn Apple HomeKit on the Mac and iOS shows you how to move to secure, home automation projects that integrate with your digital world automatically—after you set them up as described in the book. Having your calendar and appointments control your lights, locks, thermostat, and other home devices is the heart of home automation. In homes and small offices, you can banish notes taped to switches and controls that say, "Do not turn off this switch" or "Leave the thermostat alone." The book gets you up to speed on HomeKit, and it also answers some of the pesky questions, such as "What happens when the power goes out?" Along the way there are tips and suggestions for app developers, hardware manufacturers, interior designers, and real estate professionals. For programmers, there's an entire chapter (plus sections in other chapters) dedicated to the core coding issues. For non-programmers, this book is the perfect resource mastering the amazing potential of Apple HomeKit. With a knowledge of the framework, you can start from HomeKit and let your imagination run wild as you design compatible devices with unlimited capabilities. Go build your killer app, your game-changing product, or service!
