Machine learning, animated
"The release of ChatGPT has kicked off an arms race in Machine Learning (ML), however ML has also been described as a black box and very hard to understand. This book eases you into basic ML concepts and summarises the learning process in three words: initialize, adjust and repeat. This is illustrated step by step with animation to show how machines learn: from initial parameter values to adjusting each step, to the final converged parameters and predictions. [eBook+ Version] In addition, this eBook+ version allows readers to witness these principles in action, containing 24 distinct and engaging animations created from lessons within the book. This book teaches readers to create their own neural networks with dense and convolutional layers, and use them to make binary and multi-category classifications. Readers will learn how to build deep learning game strategies and combine this with reinforcement learning, witnessing AI achieve super-human performance in Atari games such as Breakout, Space Invaders, Seaquest and Beam Rider. Written in a clear and concise style, illustrated with animations and images, this book is particularly appealing to readers with no background in computer science, mathematics or statistics"--
