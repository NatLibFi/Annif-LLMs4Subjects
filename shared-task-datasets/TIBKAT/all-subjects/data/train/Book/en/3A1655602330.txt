Volterra integral and differential equations
Most mathematicians, engineers, and many other scientists are well-acquainted with theory and application of ordinary differential equations. This book seeks to present Volterra integral and functional differential equations in that same framwork, allowing the readers to parlay their knowledge of ordinary differential equations into theory and application of the more general problems. Thus, the presentation starts slowly with very familiar concepts and shows how these are generalized in a natural way to problems involving a memory. Liapunov's direct method is gently introduced and applied t
