Environmentally responsible design : green and sustainable design for interior designers
"Covering everything from theory to current practices, eight leading design educators present the tools and knowledge needed to implement an environmentally responsible approach for any interior design project. It opens with a broad perspective on global sustainability followed by a timeline of human and environmental interactions. This sets the stage for the book's coverage of the day-to-day issues of environmentally responsible interior design." "The author sets forth and examines a variety of essential design standards and philosophies, including LEED-CI, William McDonough's "Cradle to Cradle," Minnesota Sustainable Design Guide, and Energy Star. The final part of the book is dedicated to two in-depth case studies that demonstrate how the principles and practices discussed in the book have been successfully put into action. Throughout the presentation, detailed illustrations enable you to better understand how environmentally responsible design works. A bibliography at the end of the book leads you to additional resources." "Armed with this book as a reference, students and professional interior designers will make sound design decisions that incorporate the principles of sustainability with aesthetics and functional requirements."--BOOK JACKET
