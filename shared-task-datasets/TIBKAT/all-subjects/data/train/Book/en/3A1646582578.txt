Practical Pathology Informatics : Demstifying informatics for the practicing anatomic pathologist
Practical Pathology Informatics introduces and demystifies a variety of topics in the broad discipline of pathology informatics with a focus on issues of particular relevance to the practicing anatomic pathologist. Early chapters contain basic information about computers and databases which is applicable to any discipline, with the later chapters containing more anatomic pathology specific topics. Chapters can be read in any order and are divided into short sections. Organized in an easy-to-read format, the book is aimed at providing pathologists and pathology residents with the practical information they need to make intelligent, informed decisions about the deployment and use of information technology tools in their day-to-day practice, and ultimately, better position themselves for informed decision making and intelligent communication with the information systems groups at their institutions. John Sinard, MD, PhD is Associate Professor of Pathology in the Department of Pathology and Director, Pathology Informatics Program at Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.
