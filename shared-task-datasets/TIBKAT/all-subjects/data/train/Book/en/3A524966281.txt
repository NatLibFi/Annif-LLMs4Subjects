Traceability in Chemical Measurement
Metrological traceability of chemical measurement results means the establishment of a relation to metrological stated references through an unbroken chain of comparisons. This volume collects 56 outstanding papers on the topic, mostly published in the period 2000-2003 in the journal 'Accreditation and Quality Assurance'. They provide the latest understanding, and possibly the rationale why it is important to integrate the concept of metrological traceability including suitable measurement standards such as certified reference materials, into the standard measurement procedures of every analytical laboratory. In addition, this anthology considers the benefits to both the analytical laboratory and the user of the measurement results.
