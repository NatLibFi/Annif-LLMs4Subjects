Multimodal theory and methodology : for the analysis of (inter)action and identity
"This concise guide outlines core theoretical and methodological developments of the growing field of Multimodal (Inter)action Analysis. The volume unpacks the foundational relationship between multimodality and language and the key concepts which underpin the analysis of multimodal action and interaction and the study of multimodal identity. A focused overview of each concept charts its historical development, reviews the essential literature, and outlines its underlying theoretical frameworks and how it links to analytical tools. Norris illustrates the concept in practice via the inclusion of examples and an image-based transcript, table, or graph. The book provides a succinct overview of the latest research developments in the field of Multimodal (Inter)action Analysis for early career scholars in the field as well as established researchers looking to stay up-to-date on core developments and learn more about a complementary approach to systemic functional and social semiotic frameworks"--
