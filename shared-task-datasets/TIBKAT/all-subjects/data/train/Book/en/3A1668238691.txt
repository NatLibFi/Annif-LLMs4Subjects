Multicultural education : issues and perspectives
"Multicultural Education: Issues and Perspectives, 10e, is designed to help current and future educators acquire the concepts, paradigms, and explanations needed to become effective practitioners in culturally, racially, linguistically, and social-class diverse classrooms and schools. An important goal of this book is to help teachers attain a sophisticated understanding of the concept of culture and to view race, class, gender, social class, and exceptionality as interacting concepts rather than as separate and distinct. Consequently, intersectionality--or how race, class, gender, and exceptionality are fluid variables that interact in complex ways--is an overarching concept in this book. Racial, cultural, ethnic, linguistic, and religious diversity presents both opportunities and challenges to educators. Diversity continues to increase in the United States. There is a wide and growing ethnic, cultural, social-class, and linguistic gap between most of the nation's teachers and their students. Teachers are faced with both the challenges and opportunities of dealing with diversity creatively and constructively in their classrooms and schools"--
