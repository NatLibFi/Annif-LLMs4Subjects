Bounded symmetric domains in Banach spaces
"The latest book which discusses recent advances in geometric analysis on bound symmetric domains of both finite and infinite dimensions. A unique feature is the use of Jordan theory in tandem with Lie theory to treat geometric and analytic topics such as rank and boundary structures, dynamics, Siegel domains and symmetric cones, classification, as well as function theory It contains a chapter on Jordan and Lie structures in Banach spaces, which are used to present a self-contained proof of a Riemann mapping theorem asserting that every bounded symmetric domain can be realized as the open unit ball of a complex Banach space with a Jordan structure"--
