Dominique Coulon - Traversées
The writing of Dominique Coulon & Associés, nominated twice for the Mies van der Rohe award, reflects the agency?s work in connection with different contextual postures and the construction of complex spatial relationships.00In circumstances that are often difficult, buildings add value to their locations, transforming them. This book explores the public dimension of architecture taking a new look at the eclectic work of Dominique Coulon; his production of public buildings illustrates the complexity of his architectural approach. Dominique Coulon plays with context, light, and materiality to produce public places that are detailed and welcoming. The areas he proposes affect and accompany the body. His architecture is part of a dynamic relationship, mobilising the senses to propose a specific universe, which may be cheerful, or dramatic. These spaces serve the public dimension of his architecture
