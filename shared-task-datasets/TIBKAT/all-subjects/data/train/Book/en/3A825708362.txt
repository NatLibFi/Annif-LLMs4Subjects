High art : Public art on the High Line
This book surveys the first five years of art on the High Line, the unique elevated park in New York City created through the repurposing of an abandoned railway line. Since 2009, when the High Line was opened to the public, nineteen million visitors have been witness to more than 100 public art projects animating the grounds of this unique "park in the sky." The works include sculpture, installation, billboards, video, performance, and sound works by a range of artists, from established figures such as John Baldessari, El Anatsui, Maurizio Cattelan, Gilbert & George, and Ed Ruscha, to critically acclaimed mid-career artists such as Carol Bove, Sarah Sze, and Mark Grotjahn. The High Line is steadily broadening the audience for contemporary art while pushing the boundaries of traditional public art programs. This beautifully illustrated volume features the High Lines diverse projects thematically, including full-color images and short texts on the various projects, along with an introduction by curator Cecilia Alemani; an essay on the High Lines effect on Chelsea, the neighborhood cultural hub where it is located; and a roundtable discussion about public art today
