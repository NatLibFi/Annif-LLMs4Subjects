Forensic Pathology Reviews
A collection of cutting-edge accounts of special topics from various fields of forensic pathology and death scene investigation. The authors offer critical insight into the medicolegal investigation of bodies found in water, the forensic aspects of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection of the central nervous system, deaths in a head-down position, and forensic bitemark analysis. Additional chapters address taphonomic changes in human bodies during the early postmortem interval, arrhythmogenic ventricular dysplaisia that produces sudden death in young people, the postmortem diagnosis of death in anaphylaxis, and iatrogenici deaths. The forensic aspects of suicide, murder-suicide, and suicide trends in the United States are also discussed, along with the evaluation of fatal pulmonary thromboembolism and the use of radiology in medicolegal investigations.
