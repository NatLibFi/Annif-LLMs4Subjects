Making use of the archive materials, visual sources and museum collections, the authors pointed out the richness of the region and the role of women in promoting new ideas of modernity. The information contained here will help the public to better know and understand the part of women's sociability in building new nations and constructing new identities along South-Eastern Europe and beyond
