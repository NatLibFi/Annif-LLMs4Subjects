Introduction to ergodic rates for Markov chains and processes : with applications to limit theorems
The present lecture notes aim for an introduction to the ergodic behaviour of Markov Processes and addresses graduate students, post-graduate students and interested readers.Different tools and methods for the study of upper bounds on uniform and weak ergodic rates of Markov Processes are introduced. These techniques are then applied to study limit theorems for functionals of Markov processes.This lecture course originates in two mini courses held at University of Potsdam, Technical University of Berlin and Humboldt University in spring 2013 and Ritsumameikan University in summer 2013.
