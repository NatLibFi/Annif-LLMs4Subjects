Phyllotactic patterns : a multidisciplinary approach
Phyllotactic Parameters -- Dynamical Models -- Statistical and Probabilistic Approaches -- Role of Genes in the Framework of Biochemical and Molecular Models -- Biophysical Aspects of Phyllotaxis -- Concluding Remarks: Critical Analysis and Critique of the State of the Discipline.
"The book provides a current review of the field of phyllotaxis from a variety of perspectives, that is, morphological, developmental, biochemical, molecular genetics, biophysical, and evolutionary. This unique book covers phyllotactic processes from the level of genes involved in the establishment of patterns to modeling the emergence of those patterns in space and time. The models in question (deterministic or stochastic) touch on various fields, including geometry, biochemistry, and biophysics. Not only providing a recent review but also current critique and analysis of the discipline, the book will appeal to a variety of individuals involved in developmental modeling as well as pattern initiation and formation. The text is highly illustrated with excellent pictures representing recent developments in the field. A biological context or perspective to models and ideas is explored in the book. Terminology specific to the discipline is defined and updated as well"--
