The Routledge companion to corporate branding
"This companion is a prestige reference work that offers students and researchers a comprehensive overview of the emerging co-created, multi-stakeholder and sustainable approach to corporate brand management, representing a paradigm shift in the literature. The volume contains 30 chapters, organised into 6 thematic sections. The first section is an introductory one, which underscores the evolution of brand management thinking over time, presenting the corporate brand management field, introducing the current debates in the literature and discussing the key dimensions of the emerging corporate brand management paradigm. The next five sections focus in turn on one of the key dimensions that characterize the emerging approach to corporate brand management: co-creation, sustainability, polysemic corporate narratives, transformation (history and future) and corporate culture. Every chapter provides a deep reflection on current knowledge, highlighting the most relevant debates and tensions, and offers a roadmap for future research avenues. The final chapter of each section is a commentary on the section, written by a senior leading scholar in the corporate brand management field. This wide-ranging reference work is primarily for students, scholars and researchers in management, marketing and brand management, offering a single repository on the current state of knowledge, current debates and relevant literature. Written by an international selection of leading authors from the USA, Europe, Asia and Australia, it provides a balanced, authoritative overview of the field and convenient access to an emerging perspective on corporate brand management"--
