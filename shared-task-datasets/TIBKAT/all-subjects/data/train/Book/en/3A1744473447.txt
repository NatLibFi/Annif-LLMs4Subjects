Fundamentals of microelectronics : with robotics and bioengineering applications
"One salient feature of this book is its synthesis- or design-oriented approach. Rather than pulling a circuit out of a bag and trying to analyze it, I set the stage by stating a problem that we face in real life (e.g., how to design a cellphone charger). I then attempt to arrive at a solution using basic principles, thus presenting both failures and successes in the process.When we do arrive at the final solution, the student has seen the exact role of each device as well as the logical thought sequence behind synthesizing the circuit. Another essential component of this book is "analysis by inspection." This "mentality" is created in two steps. First, the behavior of elementary building blocks is formulated using a "verbal" description of each analytical result (e.g., "looking into the emitter, we see 1/gm."). Second, larger circuits are decomposed and "mapped" to the elementary blocks to avoid the need for writing KVLs and KCLs. This approach both imparts a great deal of intuition and simplifies the analysis of large circuits"--
