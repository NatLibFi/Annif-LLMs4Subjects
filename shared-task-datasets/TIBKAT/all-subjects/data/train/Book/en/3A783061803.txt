Relativity for scientists and engineers
"An ideal choice for undergraduate students of science and engineering, this book presents a thorough exploration of the basic concepts of relativity. The treatment provides more than the typical coverage of introductory texts, and it offers maximum flexibility since many sections may be used independently, in altered order, or omitted altogether. Numerous problems -- most with hints and answers -- make this volume ideal for supplementary reading and self-study. Nearly 300 diagrams illuminate the three-part treatment, which examines special relativity in terms of kinematics and introductory dynamics as well as general relativity. Specific topics include the speed of light, the relative character of simultaneity, the Lorentz transformation, the conservation of momentum and energy, nuclei and fundamental particles, the principle of equivalence and curved space-time, Einstein's equations, and many other topics.
