The Oxford handbook of sociology, social theory, and organization studies : contemporary currents
This title examines how contemporary currents in sociology and social theory have influenced the field of organisation studies. It aims to combat the tendency towards myopia in the organisation studies field, which encourages reliance on resources and references drawn from within the field and discourages scholars from going beyond these boundaries to find inspiration and ideas. The contributing authors show how sociologists and sociological concepts from the US and Europe have provided new insights into the functioning of organisations.
