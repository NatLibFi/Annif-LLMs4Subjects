Understanding lasers : an entry-level guide
An up-to-date and easy-to-follow introduction to laser technologyLaser technology has become important in a wide range of practical applications, ranging from medicine and consumer electronics to telecommunications and military technology. Lasers are also vital tools on the cutting edge of research-eighteen recipients of the Nobel Prize received the award for laser-related research, including the laser itself, holography, laser cooling, and Bose-Einstein condensates.Updated to reflect advancements since publication of the previous edition, Understanding Lasers, Third Edition offers an introduction to lasers and associated equipment at a level that nontechnicians can fundamentally understand. The author focuses on real-world lasers and assumes only a minimal background in algebra, making the book a practical, easy-to-follow guide for a broad audience.Beginning with an overview of how lasers work, what they do, and how they're used, the book goes on to explore:. Optics and laser accessories. Semiconductor diode lasers. Gas lasers. Low-power laser applications. Solid-state and fiber lasers. High-power laser applications. Lasers in researchComplete with conceptual drawings, tables, and multiple-choice quizzes with answers provided at the back of the book, Understanding Lasers, Third Edition serves as an ideal introduction to the subject for advanced high school students, undergraduate physics and engineering students, and professionals who work with lasers but lack formal training
