The Selberg-Arthur Trace Formula : Based on Lectures by James Arthur
This book based on lectures given by James Arthur discusses the trace formula of Selberg and Arthur. The emphasis is laid on Arthur's trace formula for GL(r), with several examples in order to illustrate the basic concepts. The book will be useful and stimulating reading for graduate students in automorphic forms, analytic number theory, and non-commutative harmonic analysis, as well as researchers in these fields.
