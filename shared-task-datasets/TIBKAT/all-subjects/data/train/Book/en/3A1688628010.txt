Rubus : an overview
"Rubus blackberries are grown worldwide and are known for their excellent nutritional and bioactive characteristics, particularly due to their high content of nutrients such as sugars, dietary fibre, minerals, and phenolic compounds. Rubus: An Overview summarizes the available data on nutrients, bioactive compounds, and health-promoting properties of the most studied Rubus blackberries. Similarly, the authors review the role of the phenolic compounds in Rubus blackberries in the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Experimental studies suggest that anthocyanins of these fruits can improve cognition and human health. The main pathogens and phytoparasites that cause damage in raspberries, thus causing important economic losses in the crop, are also received. The concluding chapter suggests that increasing the role of genomics and genome editing technologies in Rubus presents new opportunities to develop more focused molecular tools for gene discovery and deployment"--
