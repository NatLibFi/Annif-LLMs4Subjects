Advanced thermoforming : methods, machines and materials, applications, and automation
"This book offers an overview and new insights into thermoforming, for which there are different processes available depending on the needed application. Refinements in machine technology leads to higher productivity, better quality parts, lower material costs, and better profitability. Mold technology and flexible molds are also critical to thermoforming application, and this book highlights both the existing and new standards in this technology. This book also addresses the simulation of formed parts as well as applications of technical parts and packaging. The reader is guided through the path of development, design, machine and mold technology and production. Along with updating content, this edition adds new coverage of sustainability in packaging, mold technology, electromotive, and developments in new materials"--
