The neoliberal revolution in eastern Europe : economic ideas in the transition from communism
This unique book develops two different but related research agendas: the study of the spread of 'neoliberalism' - as seen from the perspective of Eastern European post-communist evolutions; and the study of Eastern European transition - as seen from an ideas-centred perspective. It challenges a series of misunderstandings and myths about the spread of neoliberal economic ideas in Eastern Europe and offers a clearer understanding of progress since market reform began
