Anion receptor chemistry
This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, Anion recognition plays a critical role in a range of biological processes, and a variety of receptors and carriers can be found throughout the natural world. Chemists working in the area of supramolecular chemistry have created a range of anion receptors, drawing inspiration from nature as well as their own inventive processes. This book traces the origins of anion recognition chemistry as a unique sub-field in supramolecular chemistry while illustrating the basic approaches currently being used to effect receptor design. The combination of biological overview and summary of current synthetic approaches provides a coverage that is both comprehensive and comprehensible. First, the authors detail the key design motifs that have been used to generate synthetic receptors and which are likely to provide the basis for further developments. They also highlight briefly some of the features that are present in naturally occurring anion recognition and transport systems and summarise the applications of anion recognition chemistry.  Providing as it does a detailed review for practitioners in the field and a concise introduction to the topic for newcomers, Anion Receptor Chemistry reflects the current state of the art. Fully referenced and illustrated in colour, it is a welcome addition to the literature
