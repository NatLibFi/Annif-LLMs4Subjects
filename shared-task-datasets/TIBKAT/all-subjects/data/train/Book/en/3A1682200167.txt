Vitamins and minerals bio-fortification of edible plants
"This book will report on specific biofortification of edible crops using modern biotechnology and omics technologies in their broad and targeted sense. This discipline is attracting the interests of the scientific community who are involved in the development of novel biofortified edible crops, describing how the modern biotechnological tools and omics technologies can be used to improve the nutritional characteristics and nutritional health benefits of edible plants focusing on vitamins and minerals. Some work have been published on phytonutrients enhancement of crops, but few work reported on vitamins and minerals. This book will include, but is not limited to, modification and enhancement of edible crops at the molecular level, frequently dubbed as "modern biotechnology" or "Omics technologies". This book will also concentrate on recent developments of biotechnology used in edible development and will present biotechnology and omics as provider of powerful and useful tools, in a continuum of technical evolution that contributes or could contribute to the improvement of nutritional quality of edible crops"--
