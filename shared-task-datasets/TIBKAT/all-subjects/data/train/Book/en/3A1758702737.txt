Parks of the 21st century : reinvented landscapes, reclaimed territories

Among the subthemes: Development of parks in Asia and Europe; historical precedent for parks from the 19th and 20th centuries built on former infrastructure. Environmental contribution of parks--how park features (including constructed wetlands or porous edges) can filter pollutants, rehabilitating/remediating the damaged land and contributing to a cleaner environment. How parks can mitigate major storms and protect against flooding by collecting water and releasing back into the environment only slowly. Social impact of new parks: they increase real estate values and thus often lead to gentrification, but can also improve traditionally underserved/neglected areas and neighborhoods"--
