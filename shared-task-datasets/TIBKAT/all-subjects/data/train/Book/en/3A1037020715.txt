MetaNet
"The papers in this collection document the work of the first research project on metaphor that incorporates the findings of Frame Semantics, Conceptual Metaphor Theory, and Construction Grammar with Corpus Linguistics techniques for the analysis of linguistic expressions of metaphor in very large natural language corpora. Under severe constraints, the MetaNet project, based at the International Computer Science Institute designed and populated a sophisticated and accessible repository of conceptual metaphors, developed a formalization for Conceptual Metaphor Theory, and created tools and techniques for the automatic identification and analysis of the linguistic expression of metaphor. For those interested in metaphor, be that from a linguistic, literary, poetic, cognitive, or computational perspective, this book is a must-read. Originally published in Constructions and Frames 8:2 (2016)"--
