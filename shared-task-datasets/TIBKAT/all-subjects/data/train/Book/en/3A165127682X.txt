The Cinderella.2 Manual : Working with The Interactive Geometry Software
Cinderella.2, the new version of the well-known interactive geometry software, has become an even more versatile tool than its predecessor. It now consists of three connected parts: An enhanced geometry component with new features like transformations and dynamic fractals, a simulation laboratory to explore basic laws of Newton mechanics, and an easy to use scripting language that enables any user to quickly extend the software even further. The Cinderella.2 Manual is the first book to offer complete instruction and techniques for using Cinderella.2. It contains a wealth of examples, in particular for the CindyScript language which interacts smoothly with the geometry and simulation components, and a complete reference. Cinderella.2 is Math in Motion all the way, and this book provides comprehensive documentation from start to finish.
