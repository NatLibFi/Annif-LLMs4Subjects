Encyclopedia of Latin American literature
"Invaluable for translators as well as scholars, students, and teachers. Bibliography following each entry includes information about work in translation; numerous lesser-known writers and countries are covered well; long thematic entries discuss such individual topics. Dick Gerdes' 'Translation,' for example, offers a fine overview of work and trends in both Brazil and Spanish America. Highly recommended"--Handbook of Latin American Studies, v. 58
