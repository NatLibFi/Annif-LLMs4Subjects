"This book describes cutting-edge research and development on electromagnetic vortex waves, including their related wave properties and a variety of potential transformative applications. It is divided into three parts. The first part presents the generation/sorting/manipulation and interesting wave behavior of vortex waves in the infrared and optical regimes with custom-designed nanostructures. The second cluster deals with the generation/multiplexing/propagation of vortex waves at microwave and millimeter-wave frequencies. The last group of chapters exhibit several representative practical applications of vortex waves from a system perspective ranging from microwave frequencies to optical wavelengths. Each chapter is contributed by an internationally recognized author or group of authors covering the latest research results"--
