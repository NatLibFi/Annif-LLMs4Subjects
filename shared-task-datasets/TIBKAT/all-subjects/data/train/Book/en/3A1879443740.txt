Essays in economic theory, growth, and labour markets : a festschrift in honour of E. Drandakis
The distinguished contributors in this volume provide a variety of essays, which are written in honor of Emmanuel Drandakis. These essays fall into four uniform areas of economics: economic growth, general equilibrium, labor economics and game theory and applications. The editors focus on a select set of issues that stand high on the agenda of academic research. They provide fresh insights and approaches to the analysis of these issues, and thus open up wider avenues for our understanding of the dilemmas posed for theory and policy. Readers are offered new empirical evidence on such thorny social problems as, for example, unemployment, the intergenerational transmission of human capital and the response of wages to price and endowment changes. These contributions, in conjunction with the realisation that the papers are written by some of the most distinguished economists in the respective areas, make the volume an attractive addition for all who are interested in the contemporary research and teaching of economics
