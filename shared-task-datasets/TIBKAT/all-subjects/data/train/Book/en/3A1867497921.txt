Wastewater treatment using green synthesis
"Wastewater Treatment Using Green Synthesis discusses advances in wastewater treatment with a focus on biological processes. Major topics discussed include bioremediation through microorganisms, green and iron-based nanoparticles in wastewater treatment, TiO2 Doped Lignocellulosic Biopolymer with an emphasis on their photodegradation potential for a variety of pollutants, and permanent film growth. It further includes remediation of industrial sludges/effluents with a particular emphasis on biological treatment, phytoremediation, and de-ballasting water treatment technology. It focuses on the implementation of effective wastewater treatment with orientation towards biological processes and covers both biological and physico-chemical waste and wastewater treatment processes, focusing on emerging techniques. The book reviews computational method approaches, the application of TiO2-doped biopolymers, iron nanoparticles and the use of molecular techniques for wastewater treatment and illustrates molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, homology modeling, and biodegradation pathways prediction. The book also includes dedicated chapters on biological wastewater treatment. This book is aimed at graduate students and researchers in environmental and chemical engineering with focus on wastewater treatment"--
