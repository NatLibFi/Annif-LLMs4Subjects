The Routledge handbook of pidgin and creole languages
"The Routledge Handbook of Pidgin and Creole Languages is a state-of-the-art volume on Pidgin and Creole studies. Providing unique coverage and equal coverage of nearly all parts of the world where such languages are found, as well as in situating each area within a rich socio-historical context, this book presents fresh and diverse interdisciplinary perspectives from leading voices in the field. Divided into five sections, its analysis covers: Areal perspectives on pidgin and creole languages; Ideology, history and theoretical constructs; Pidgin and Creoles and the evolution of human languages; Sociolinguistic perspectives on pidgin and creole languages; Creoles as socio-cultural forms; In all instances where two or more different languages come into contact, be that in a financial transaction, alongside a border, during long journeys, in war and in trade, the possibility arises for new words, sounds, and phrases to transfer from one language onto another. This requires an understanding of the dynamics of different forms of labour, such as slavery, and the effects of power on language learning. This book will show you how fundamentally human and natural these communication systems are, rich in expressive power and sophisticated in their complexity, on a par with any other language spoken out there. The Routledge Handbook of Pidgin and Creole Language features original contributions from an international range of renowned scholars as well as academics at the forefront of innovative research and is an essential reference for anyone with an interest in this area"--
