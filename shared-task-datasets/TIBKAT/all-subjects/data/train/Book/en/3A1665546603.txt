Polymer science : a textbook for engineers and technologists
Each chapter is written starting from simple concepts and progressively getting more complex towards its end, to help the reader decide how deep to go into each topic. Each chapter also presents the solution of many proposed problems, guiding the reader to solve numerically the everyday problems polymer technologists face, by applying theoretical concepts. Additionally, at every chapterâ€™s end there is a list of problems for the reader to check his/her understanding of the topics.
This is an introductory textbook on polymer science aimed at lecturers/professors, undergraduate and graduate students of polymer science and technology courses as well as engineering (materials, chemical, civil, food, etc.), chemistry, and physics. It is also aimed at engineers and technologists.
The book contains a list of more than 10 experiments to perform in the laboratory, linked to some of the concepts discussed in the book. It also serves as a long-term reference with many figures, diagrams, tables, chemical equations containing frequently needed information. It contains as well an appendix with a long list of chemical structures of the main commercially available polymers.
