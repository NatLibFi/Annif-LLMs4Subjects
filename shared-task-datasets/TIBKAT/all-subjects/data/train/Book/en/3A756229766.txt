Afrofuturism : the world of black sci-fi and fantasy culture
Evolution of a space cadet -- A human fairy tale named black -- Project imagination -- Mothership in the key of Mars -- The African cosmos for modern mermaids (mermen) -- Divine feminine in space -- Pen my future -- Moonwalkers in paint and pixels -- A clock for time travelers -- The surreal life -- Agent change -- Future world. In this hip, accessible primer to the music, literature, and art of Afrofuturism, author Ytasha Womack introduces readers to the burgeoning community of artists creating Afrofuturist works, the innovators from the past, and the wide range of subjects they explore. From the sci-fi literature of Samuel Delany, Octavia Butler, and N. K. Jemisin to the musical cosmos of Sun Ra, George Clinton, and the Black Eyed Peas’ will.i.am, to the visual and multimedia artists inspired by African Dogon myths and Egyptian deities, the book’s topics range from the “alien” experience of blacks in America to the “wake up” cry that peppers sci-fi literature, sermons, and activism. With a twofold aim to entertain and enlighten, Afrofuturists strive to break down racial, ethnic, and social limitations to empower and free individuals to be themselves.
