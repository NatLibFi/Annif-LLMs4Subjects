Digital satellite navigation and geophysics : a practical guide with GNSS signal simulator and receiver laboratory
"Bridge the gap between theoretical education and practical work experience with this hands-on guide to GNSS, which features: [bullet] A clear, practical presentation of GNSS theory, with emphasis on GPS and GLONASS [bullet] All the essential theory behind software receivers and signal simulators  [bullet] Key applications in navigation and geophysics, including INS aiding, scintillation monitoring, earthquake studies and more [bullet] Physical explanations of various important phenomena, including the similarity of code delay and phase advance of GNSS signals, and negative cross-correlation between scintillation intensity and phase variations. Whether you are a practising engineer, a researcher or a student, you will gain a wealth of insights from the authors' 25 years of experience. You can explore numerous practical examples and case studies and get hands-on user experience with a bundled real-time software receiver, signal simulator and a set of signal data, enabling you to create your own GNSS lab for research or study"--
"This book is about global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), their two main instruments, which are a receiver and a simulator, and their applications. The book is based on operational off-the-shelf real-time software GNSS receiver and off-the-shelf GNSS signal simulator. The academic versions of these tools are bundled with this book and free for a reader to use for study and research"--
