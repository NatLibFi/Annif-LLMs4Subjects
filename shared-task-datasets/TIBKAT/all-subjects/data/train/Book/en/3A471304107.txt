Encyclopedia of Judaism
Containing about 800 entries, this encyclopedia--part of the Facts On File Encyclopedia of World Religions series--covers Judaism from its origins to the present time. It is a daunting task to compress almost 3,000 years into one modest-sized encyclopedia, but the authors have performed admirably in their eclectic choice of topics, including prominent places, major personalities, historical events, ritual practices, and objects, among numerous other subjects. Each entry ranges from a few paragraphs to several pages and includes a useful bibliography with well-described citations. The index provides easy access and helpful cross-references, and the text is enhanced with 80 black-and-white photographs, a chronology, and an interesting introductory essay.
