The chapter : a segmented history from antiquity to the twenty-first century
"The book first examines what a chapter is, then discusses its emergence and function in ancient writings, scripture, legal texts, and other nonfictional forms, and finally traces the role of the chapter in the novel. Beyond a material history of the chapter, however, this book reads various manifestations of the chapter as a guide to the way writers have imagined time, and how the metaphor of the chapter maintains a ubiquitous and structuring presence in our lives and experiences. As Dames observes, "We 'start a new chapter' in our lives with dread or excitement; we 'close that chapter of my life' with regret or relief... This book can then be thought of as a study of the long, slow coming into being of the conditions of the chapter metaphor and its persistent grip on how we speak and think of change, transition, boundaries in time."
