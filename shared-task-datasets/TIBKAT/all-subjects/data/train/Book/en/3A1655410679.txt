Numerical Range : The Field of Values of Linear Operators and Matrices
This book is dedicated to presenting the fundamentals of numerical ranges. In order to make it quickly informative the authors place and keep the subject in a complex Hilbert space. This setting is the heart of the numerical range theory for bounded linear operators T. This text is a particularly well prepared account of a beautiful and interesting part of functional analysis which appears to have important applications in numerical analysis
