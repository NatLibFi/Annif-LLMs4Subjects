Computational Physics : Selected Methods Simple Exercises Serious Applications
"Computational Physics. Selected Methods, Simple Exercises, Serious Applications" is an overview written by leading researchers of a variety of fields and developments. "Selected Methods" introduce the reader to current fields, including molecular dynamics, hybrid Monte-Carlo algorithms, and neural networks. "Simple Exercises" give hands-on advice for effective program solutions from a small number of lines to demonstration programs with elaborate graphics. "Serious Applications" show how questions concerning, for example, aging, many-minima optimisation, or phase transitions can be treated by appropriate tools. The source code and demonstration graphics are included on a 3.5" MS-DOS diskette. The diskette: Text folgt (Stand: 27.03.1996)
