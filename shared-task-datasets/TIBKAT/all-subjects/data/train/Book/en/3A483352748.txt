The evolution, principles and practices of distance education
The evolution, principles and practices of distance education describes distance education as it is today and does so against the background of its history. Basic concerns are how the constituent elements of distance education, i.e. subject-matter presentation and interaction, have been brought about at different stages in this history and what their character has been and is. Thus online conferences and other possibilities opened by modern technology are given attention in the presentation of today's practice. So are theoretical approaches to the subject and the application of these to the practice of distance education. The discussion of student's independence in distance education is thus followed from Hermod and Lighty to Peters. The everyday concerns of distance educators are further carefully dealt with. This book summarises and updates the author's earlier writings at the same time as it pays attention to the evolutionary development of distance education. It is based on the literature available and empirical studies made as well as on the author's practical experience. <engl.>
