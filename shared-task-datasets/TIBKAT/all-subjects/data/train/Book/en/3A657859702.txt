Building structures
"This new edition continues its legacy as the reference of choice for architects studying contemporary issues and design practices for building structures by taking a conceptual approach that foregos complicated mathematics. Looking at the role of the structure as a building subsystem, it offers the fundamentals of computational methods for design of wood, steel, and reinforced concrete structures, along with new material such as discussion of the LRFD method of design. Profusely illustrated with new case studies, this go-to guide is perfect for non-engineers to understand and visualize structural design"--
