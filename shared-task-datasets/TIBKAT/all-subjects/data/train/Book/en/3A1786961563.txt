Efficient unconventional models of multi-component magnetic hysteresis
"This unique compendium deals with modeling magnetic media exhibiting hysteresis using computationally efficient phenomenological models that may be utilized in a wide spectrum of both coupled and non-coupled situations. The main factors affecting the behavior of media exhibiting hysteresis -- such as magnetic field, mechanical stress and temperature -- are dealt with from a higher-level perspective. The volume offers a brief review of well-established definitions of the hysteresis phenomena and widely utilized models. It then presents in its separate chapters a set of innovative efficient multi-component hysteresis models, some of which involves novel operators and/or neural network activation functions as primitive building blocks. Identification methodologies, simulations and experimental verifications for the presented models are also prominently highlighted. This useful reference text offers a great resource material for academics, professionals, researchers and graduate students in electrical and electronic engineering, superconductivity, magnetic materials and mechanical engineering."--Publisher
