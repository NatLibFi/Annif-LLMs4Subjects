Advances in Lithium Ion Batteries Introduction -- The Role of Surface Films on Electrodes in Li-Ion Batteries -- Carbon Anodes -- Manganese Vanadates and Molybdates as Anode Materials for Lithium-Ion Batteries -- Oxide Cathodes -- Liquid Electrolytes -- Ionic Liquids for Lithium Ion and Related Batteries -- Lithium-Ion Secondary Batteries with Gelled Polymer Electrolytes -- Lithium Polymer Electrolytes -- Lithium-Ion Cell Production Processes -- Low Voltage Lithium-Ion Cells -- Temperature Effects on Li-Ion Cell Performance -- Mathematical Modeling of Lithium Batteries -- Aging Mechanisms and Calendar-Life Predictions in Lithium-Ion Batteries -- Scale-Up of Lithium-Ion Cells and Batteries -- Charging, Monitoring, and Control -- Electrochemical Supercapacitors.
In the decade since the introduction of the first commercial lithium-ion battery research and development on virtually every aspect of the chemistry and engineering of these systems has proceeded at unprecedented levels. This book is a snapshot of the state-of-the-art and where the work is going in the near future. The book is intended not only for researchers, but also for engineers and users of lithium-ion batteries which are found in virtually every type of portable electronic product.
