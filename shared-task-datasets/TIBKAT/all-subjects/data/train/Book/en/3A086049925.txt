The new Iraq : rebuilding the country for its people, the Middle East, and the world
Braude sheds light on a country unknown to Westerners after a decade of international isolation and shows how a viable Iraqi economy will help transform the Middle East. Confronting future challenges with optimism, Braude outlines the transition of Iraq's political system; the reconstitution of its worn-out military into an army of nation-building; the promotion of religious tolerance; new business opportunities, and the revitalization of its entertainment industry, media, education, and legal systems. Braude, who was born to an Iraqi-Jewish family, is a business consultant to governments and businesses on the Middle East
