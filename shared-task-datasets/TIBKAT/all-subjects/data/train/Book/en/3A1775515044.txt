Handbook on smart battery cell manufacturing : the power of digitalization
"The transformation towards electric mobility requires the highest quality mass production of battery cells. However, research in battery cell engineering seldom focuses beyond new cell chemistries. As a consequence, there exists a huge gap between basic battery research and comparable scientific approaches to battery cell production. This handbook bridges the gap between basic electrochemical battery cell research and battery cell production approaches. To run lithium-ion battery gigafactories successfully and sustainably, high-quality battery cell production processes and systems are required. The Handbook on Smart Battery Cell Manufacturing provides a comprehensive and well-structured analysis of every aspect of the manufacturing process of smart battery cell, including upscaling battery cell production, accompanied by many instructive practical examples of the digitalization of battery products and manufacturing systems using an integrated life cycle perspective"--
