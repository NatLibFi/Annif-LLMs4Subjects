Image super-resolution and applications
"This book is devoted to the issue of image super-resolution - obtaining high-resolution images from single or multiple low-resolution images. - Instead of approaching image interpolation as either a polynomial-based problem or an inverse problem, this book breaks the mold and compares and contrasts the two approches. It presents two directions for image super-resolution: super-resolution with a priori information and blind super-resolution reconstruction of images. - Supplying complete coverage of image super-resolution and its applications, the book illustrates applications for image interpolation and super-resolution in medical and satellite image processing. It uses MATLAB programs to present various techniques, including polynomial image interpolation and adaptive polynomial image interpolation."--
