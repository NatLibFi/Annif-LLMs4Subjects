Nano interconnects : device physics, modeling and simulation
Prefatory concepts and more -- Interconnect modeling  -- Repeater buffer modelling  -- Signal integrity analysis.
"This textbook comprehensively covers on-chip interconnect dimension and application of carbon nanomaterials for modeling VLSI interconnect and buffer circuits. It provides analysis of ultra-low power high speed nano-interconnects based on different facets like material modelling, circuit modelling and the adoption of repeater insertion strategies and measurement techniques. It covers important topics including on-chip interconnects, interconnect modeling, electrical impedance modeling of on-chip interconnects, modeling of repeater buffer and variability analysis. Pedagogical features including solved problems and unsolved exercises are interspersed throughout the text for better understanding"--
