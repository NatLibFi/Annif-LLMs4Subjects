Micellar enhanced ultrafiltration : fundamentals & applications
"Micellar enhanced ultrafiltration employs surfactant micelles to solubilize inorganic and organic pollutants from the effluent stream with about 90% efficiency. Illustrating the theory of surfactants, this book presents state-of-the-art research with a detailed description of various aspects of this technology. It covers the fundamentals, selection of surfactants, capability of pollutant removal efficiency, recovery of surfactants, as well as various flux enhancement techniques and the problems associated with them. The text focuses on wastewater treatment and includes case studies, examples, and applications such as the recovery of precious metals and the use of biosurfactants"--
