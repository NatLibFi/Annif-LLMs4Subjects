Military laser technology for defense : technology for revolutionizing 21st century warfare
"Lasers in War will provide the basic konwledge to create, design, and implement laser systems for the battlefield, including only unclassified or declassified information. The first three parts of the book provide background material: optics and lasers for war; propagation of laser light in the atmosphere; and propagation of laser light in fiber and optical waveguides. The nest three parts describe military systems involving propagation through the atmosphere: weapons damage systems military systems for information communication; and military systems for sensing. The last part describes military systems involving propagation through optical fiber. This book is timely, as conflicts of late have accelerated progress in military laser system development. Laser weapons are not only effective for directed energy destruction but also for use against personnel by blinding, for countermeasures against heat seeking IR missiles, and for applications in space where communication and GPS satellites need protection. Practical concerns and limits of laser technology will be addressed in each area of application"
