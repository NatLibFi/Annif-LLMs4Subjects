Sediment transport and morphodynamics modelling for coasts and shallow environments
"This guide to sediment transport and morphodynamics modelling in nearshore environments covers hydrodynamics of estuarine and coastal environments, seafloor and estuarine composition, and hydro-environmental interactions; emphasising the inter-relations of small and large scale processes. For engineers and graduate students"--
