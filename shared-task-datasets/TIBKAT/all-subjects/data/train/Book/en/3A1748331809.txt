Signal processing and performance analysis for imaging systems
From image resampling to image fusion, this hands-on book brings a wealth of cutting-edge signal and image processing tools into focus. You get step-by-step details on a super-resolution image reconstruction methods that produces superior high-resolution images from low-cost, low-resolution video. You discover an image deblur/restoration technique that works even in the presence of high noise. The book includes contrast enhancement tools for generating the highest-contrast images in low-light situations, as well as non-uniformity correction (NUC) methods that most effectively reduce fixed-pattern noise from the imaging sensor. What's more, the book presents a special tone scale technique that creates the best image presentation whether on-screen or in print. You also find powerful image fusion techniques for improving such tasks as target recognition and identification. This well-illustrated book is supported with nearly 350 time-saving equations
