A Real Variable Method for the Cauchy Transform, and Analytic Capacity
This research monograph studies the Cauchy transform on curves with the object of formulating a precise estimate of analytic capacity. The note is divided into three chapters. The first chapter is a review of the Calder√≥n commutator. In the second chapter, a real variable method for the Cauchy transform is given using only the rising sun lemma. The final and principal chapter uses the method of the second chapter to compare analytic capacity with integral-geometric quantities. The prerequisites for reading this book are basic knowledge of singular integrals and function theory. It addresses specialists and graduate students in function theory and in fluid dynamics
