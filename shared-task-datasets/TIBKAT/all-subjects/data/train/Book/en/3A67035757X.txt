Passive RF component technology : materials, techniques, and applications
Focusing on novel materials and techniques, this pioneering volume provides engineers with a solid understanding of the design and fabrication of smart RF passive components. Professionals find comprehensive details on LCP, metal materials, ferrite materials, nanomaterials, high aspect ratio enabled materials, green materials for RFID, and on-chip silicon techniques. --
Moreover, this practical book offers expert guidance on how to apply these materials and techniques to design a wide range of cutting-edge RF passive components, from MEMS switch-based tunable passives and 3D passives, to metamaterial-based passives and on-chip passives. Supported with over 145 illustrations, this forward-looking resource summarizes the growing trend of smart RF passive component design and serves as a guide to the performance-improving and cost-down solutions this technology offers the next generation of wireless communications. --Book Jacket
