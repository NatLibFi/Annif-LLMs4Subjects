Mathematical Modeling and Signal Processing in Speech and Hearing Sciences
1 Background Signal Processing, Statistical and Optimization Methods -- 2 Speech Modeling -- 3 Auditory Modeling -- 4 Speech Recognition -- 5 Blind Source Separation and Speech Enhancement
The aim of the book is to give an accessible introduction of mathematical models and signal processing methods in speech and hearing sciences for senior undergraduate and beginning graduate students with basic knowledge of linear algebra, differential equations, numerical analysis, and probability. Speech and hearing sciences are fundamental to numerous technological advances of the digital world in the past decade, from music compression in MP3 to digital hearing aids, from network based voice enabled services to speech interaction with mobile phones. Mathematics and computation are intimately related to these leaps and bounds. On the other hand, speech and hearing are strongly interdisciplinary areas where dissimilar scientific and engineering publications and approaches often coexist and make it difficult for newcomers to enter
