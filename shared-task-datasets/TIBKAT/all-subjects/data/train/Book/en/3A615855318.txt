Women educators in the Progressive Era : the women behind Dewey's Laboratory School
"In 1896, John Dewey established the Laboratory School at the University of Chicago--an experimental school whose creation coincided with the development of the philosophy of pragmatism. This book explores the experiences and writings of four teachers at the Laboratory School, both to investigate their lives as female professionals during the Progressive era, and to add to our understanding of this innovative institution and how these philosophies and innovations have carried out to this day"--Provided by publisher
