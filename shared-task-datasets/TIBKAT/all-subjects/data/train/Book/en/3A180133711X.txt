Hydrologic measurements with flexible liners and other applications
"This book provides hydrologists the information needed for the characterization of contaminated subsurface hydrologic sites. It explains how to seal boreholes, map contaminant distribution in a formation, map the flow zones and measure the hydraulic head distribution through a single flexible liner. Results of the measurement methods provided demonstrate the reality and reliability of the unique FLUTe techniques. These measurements will help predict contaminant migration and aid in the design of the groundwater remedy. Limitations of several methods are provided to allow an intelligent choice of methods and a well-informed selection of devices among the alternative methods"--
