Fine-Kinney-based fuzzy multi-criteria occupational risk assessment : approaches, case studies and Python applications
Fine-Kinney Occupational Risk Assessment Method and its Extensions by Fuzzy Sets: A State of the Art Review -- Fine-Kinney Based Occupational Risk Assessment Using Fuzzy Quality Function Deployment -- Fine-Kinney Based Occupational Risk Assessment Using Interval Type-2 Fuzzy TOPSIS -- Fine-Kinney Based Occupational Risk Assessment Using Interval Valued Pythagorean Fuzzy VIKOR -- Fine-Kinney Based Occupational Risk Assessment Using Intuitionistic Fuzzy TODIM -- Fine-Kinney Based Occupational Risk Assessment Using Hesitant Fuzzy MULTIMOORA -- Fine-Kinney Based Occupational Risk Assessment Using Single Valued Neutrosophic TOPSIS -- Fine-Kinney Based Occupational Risk Assessment Using Interval Type-2 Fuzzy QUALIFLEX -- Fine-Kinney Based Occupational Risk Assessment Using Interval Type-2 Fuzzy VIKOR.
This book presents a number of approaches to Fine-Kinney-based multi-criteria occupational risk-assessment. For each proposed approach, it provides case studies demonstrating their applicability, as well as Python coding, which will enable readers to implement them into their own risk assessment process. The book begins by giving a review of Fine-Kinney occupational risk-assessment methods and their extension by fuzzy sets. It then progresses in a logical fashion, dedicating a chapter to each approach, including the fuzzy best and worst method, interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy VIKOR and interval type-2 fuzzy QUALIFLEX. This book will be of interest to professionals and researchers working in the field of occupational risk management, as well as postgraduate and undergraduate students studying applications of fuzzy systems
