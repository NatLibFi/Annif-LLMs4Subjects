Providing an introduction to the use of nutrition and health claims, this book explores these claims around the world and the impact of the different legislations on consumers as well as likely developments in the future. As nations tackle the food and health issues of the 21st century, this book will provide a single source drawing together all of these topics. In recent years, nutrition and health claims displayed on food packaging have become more regulated with the dual aims of protecting consumers from false claims and promoting consumption of foods with proven health benefits. Edited by Siân Astley, with contributions from renowned experts, chapters describe the legislation underpinning nutrition and health claims globally, explain the permitted use of claims globally in theory and practice and explore differences between the various legislative frameworks. This book will be of interest to those involved in food health and dietary impact research, as well as food manufacturers, legal and healthcare students with an interest in food, nutrition, bioactive compounds and human health
