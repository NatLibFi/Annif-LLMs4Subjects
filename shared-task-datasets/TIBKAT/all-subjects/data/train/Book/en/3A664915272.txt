Time-triggered communication
"Addressing key concepts, properties, and algorithms, this book offers a conceptual foundation of time-triggered communication. Contributions from experts help readers understand the various time-triggered communication protocols, including their differences and commonalities. Communication protocols covered include TTP, FlexRay, TTEthemet, SAFEbus, TTCAN and LIN. Protocols range from low-cost time-triggered fieldbus networks to ultra-reliable time-triggered networks for safety-critical applications. The text also presents information about the use of FlexRay in cars, TTP in railway and avionic systems, and TTEthemet in aerospace applications"--
"Embedded computers are by far the most common type of computer in use today. Ninety-eight percent of all computing devices are embedded in different kinds of electronic equipment such as automotive, industrial automation, telecommunications, consumer electronics and health/medical systems. Due to the many different and, partially, contradicting requirements, there exists no single model for building embedded systems. Well-known tradeoffs are predictability versus flexibility or resource adequacy versus best-effort strategies. Therefore, the chosen system model depends strongly on the requirements of the application"--
