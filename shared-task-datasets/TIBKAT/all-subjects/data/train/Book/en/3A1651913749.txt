Mössbauer Spectroscopy : Tutorial Book
Tutorials on Mössbauer Spectroscopy Since the discovery of the Mössbauer Effect many excellent books have been published for researchers and for doctoral and master level students.  However, there appears to be no textbook available for final year bachelor students, nor for people working in industry who have received only basic courses in classical mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, chemistry and materials science.  The challenge of this book is to give an introduction to Mössbauer Spectroscopy for this level.  The ultimate goal of this book is to give this audience not only a scientific introduction to the technique, but also to demonstrate in an attractive way the power of Mössbauer Spectroscopy in many fields of science, in order to create interest among the readers in joining the community of Mössbauer spectroscopists.  This is particularly important at times where in many Mössbauer laboratories succession is at stake.
