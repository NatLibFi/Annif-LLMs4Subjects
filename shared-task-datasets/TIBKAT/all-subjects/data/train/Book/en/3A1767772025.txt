Pre-treatment methods of lignocellulosic biomass for biofuel production
"Bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuel is materially obstructed by the compositional and chemical complexity of biomaterials, resulting in a challenge to use these as raw materials for biofuel production process. This book explains various lignocellulosic biomass pre-treatment methods with emphasis on concepts, practicability, mechanisms of action, advantages and disadvantages and the potential for industrial applications. It also highlights the main challenges and suggests possible ways to make these pre-treatment technologies feasible for the biofuel industry. Features: Presents different pre-treatment technologies available for lignocellulosic biomass in a concise manner. Covers use of different pre-treatments methods in laboratory to industrial scale. Includes combined pre-treatment and deep eutectic solvents methods. Discusses problems related to industrial adaptation and corresponding economics of different techniques. Explores significant fuels and chemicals derived from lignocellulosic biomass. This book aims at graduate students and researchers working on biomass conversion, characterization, cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, microbial enzymes, fermentation technology, and industrial biotechnology"--
