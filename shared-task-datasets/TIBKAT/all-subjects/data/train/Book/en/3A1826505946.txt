Land art as climate action : designing the 21st century city park
The Land Art Generator Initiative and the 2023 German Bundesgartenschau (BUGA 23) present a new perspective on the renewable energy transition. "Land Art as Climate Action: Designing the 21st Century Park" presents dozens of beautiful energy landscapes within a city park, integrating sustainable infrastructure into the built environment to improve human thriving. These exceptional climate solutions are regenerative artworks that provide a range of social co-benefits and inspire people about the beauty, abundance, and vibrancy of a fossil-free world
