Superconvergence in Galerkin Finite Element Methods
This book is essentially a set of lecture notes from a graduate seminar given at Cornell in Spring 1994. It treats basic mathematical theory for superconvergence in the context of second order elliptic problems. It is aimed at graduate students and researchers. The necessary technical tools are developed in the text although sometimes long proofs are merely referenced. The book gives a rather complete overview of the field of superconvergence (in time-independent problems). It is the first text with such a scope. It includes a very complete and up-to-date list of references
