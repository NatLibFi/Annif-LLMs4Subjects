The internationalisation of business R&D
It has become clear that over the past few decades enterprises not only produce and sell abroad but increasingly also develop goods and services outside their home countries; a development now known as the internationalisation of business R&D. This book presents a comprehensive picture of the current state of internationalisation of R&D in the business sector. The contributors explore key patterns of the internationalisation of R&D across various countries and sectors using case studies to underpin empirical evidence. They examine the drivers of the process, revealing the impacts of R&D internationalisation on both home and host countries using both qualitative and quantitative analysis. Topics discussed include: why firms locate R&D activities abroad, data availability, quality and comparability, the role of the EU and the US in the internationalisation of R&D, country-level factors such as size, workforce and FDI as determinants of R&D internationalisation, impacts of R&D internationalisation on home and host countries. This book will prove an insightful read for academics, researchers and students with an interest in economics - particularly the economics of innovation - business and management, and science and technology. It will also prove a valuable resource for R&D policymakers and public administrators
