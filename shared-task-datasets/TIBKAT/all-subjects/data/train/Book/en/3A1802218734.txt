Middle English medical recipes and literary play, 1375-1500
This is a detailed, book-length study of Middle English medical recipes in their literary, imaginative, social, and codicological contexts. It explores how the words and structures of recipes could contribute to late medieval manuscripts' healing purpose, but could also confuse, impede, exceed, and redefine that purpose.
