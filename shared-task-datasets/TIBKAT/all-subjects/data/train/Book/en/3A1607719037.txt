Chemistry of pyrotechnics : basic principles and theory
"Chemistry of Pyrotechnics: Second Edition is simply the most definitive reference in this field. Author J.A. Conkling covers the requisite background in chemistry, thermodynamics, and light emission; introduces oxidizing agents, fuels, binders, and retardants; and then explores virtually every aspect of formulating pyrotechnics. Topics include the requirements for and preparation of high-energy mixtures, ignition and propagation, heat and delay compositions, and color and light production, including sparks, flitter, and glitter"--
