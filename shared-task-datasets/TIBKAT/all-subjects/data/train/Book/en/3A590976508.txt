Architecture in times of need : make it right - rebuilding the New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward
"Architecture in Times of Need is the first book to document the projects and progress made by the Make It Right Foundation, established by actor Brad Pitt, during the redevelopment of New Orleans' vibrant Lower Ninth Ward which was devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Instigated by the Make It Right Foundation, a group of high-profile and influential international architects, including David Adjaye, GRAFT, MVRDV, and Shigeru Ban, set about developing affordable, green housing for the area, incorporating the latest in innovative and sustainable design. As one of the reconstruction's key initiators, Brad Pitt offers insights throughout the book and guides the audience through the various stages of this ambitious venture."--BOOK JACKET
