Handbook on sustainable urban tourism
"In this multidisciplinary and multi-jurisdictional account of sustainability in urban tourist destinations, the Handbook on Sustainable Urban Tourism draws together the latest academic research and provides key practical insights on this developing area of study. It not only considers the importance of cities as ideal tourist destinations due to their complex characteristics and the variety of attractions they offer, but also the challenges they are confronted with, most notably sustainability. Leading scholars expertly analyse the contemporary challenges facing sustainable urban tourism while presenting practical solutions for implementing sustainable tourism development in urban destinations. Chapters feature discussions relating to the contribution of urban destinations towards advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The Handbook also provides a comprehensive overview of key topics such as overtourism, social justice, environmental protection, and local community participation, while exploring sustainable urban tourism practices and challenges. Expanding the literature on this relatively under-researched field of study, this Handbook will be of great interest to academics and students interested in tourism management, business management, development studies, geography, sustainable cities and community studies, alongside urban and regional studies. The applied nature of the text will also be of benefit to tourism management professionals"--
