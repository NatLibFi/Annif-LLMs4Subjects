Pituitary surgery : a modern approach ; a comprehensive overview on the management of pituitary adenomas
The management of pituitary adenomas and other sellar tumors is one of the most difficult tasks for neurosurgeons and endocrinologists. Optimal treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach; neurological, ophthalmological, and endocrinological tests are all required. Fortunately, the past decade has seen rapid improvements in the management of patients with pituitary adenomas and other sellar tumors. Transsphenoidal surgery has gone from being an innovative approach to pituitary adenomas to having become the standard procedure for a whole variety of sellar and para-sellar lesions. The authors contributing to this book expertly detail the state-of-the-art treatment of patients with pituitary adenomas, covering operative approaches, peri-operative management, surgical pathology as well as the newer extensions such as image guidance and endoscopy. They also identify the complementary roles of radiosurgery and transcranial surgery in the approach to sellar and suprasellar tumors. In addition the text gives a glimpse at what the future may hold for the treatment of such tumors.The present volume of Frontiers of Hormone Research will be of great value for endocrinologists, neurosurgeons, neuropathologists, neuro-ophthalmologists, and otolaryngologists in the treatment of patients with pituitary adenomas
