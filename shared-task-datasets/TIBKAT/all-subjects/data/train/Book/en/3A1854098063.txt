Reflections on slope stability engineering
"This book contains the detailed reflections of its author who has practised and researched in the field for over a half century. It is written in an informal style that makes it an interesting and thought-provoking practitioner guide to landslides and slope problems and their investigation, analysis, and remediation, considering both natural and man-made slopes and earthworks, and without the need for the usual equations and illustrations. Reflections on Slope Stability Engineering is targeted primarily at practitioners working in the investigations of slope instability and the design and construction of treatments of the problem, especially those early in their careers, but the accessible style also suits students who are developing an interest in the subject and even those engineers with only a casual interest in this branch of geotechnics"--
