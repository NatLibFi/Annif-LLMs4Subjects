Hysteresis Phenomena in Biology
Introduction -- Bifurcation Theory and Bistability -- Preisach Models -- Examples of Hysteresis Phenomena in Biology
The occurrence of hysteresis phenomena has been traditionally associated with mechanical and magnetic properties of materials. However, recent studies on the dynamics of biological processes suggest switch-like behavior that could be described by mathematical models of hysteresis. This book presents the milestones and perspectives of biological hysteresis and provides a comprehensive and application-oriented introduction to this subject. The target audience primarily comprises researchers but the book may also be beneficial for graduate students
