Recent studies on jatropha research
"Plants from the genus Jatropha belong to the Euphorbiaceae family, which accounts for nearly 175 species distributed mainly in America, Asia, and Africa. Jatropha species have been of interest in many research fields due to their multifaceted applications, mainly attributed to their chemical, nutritional, and phytochemical content. Some of the most studied species are J. curcas, J. isabelli, J. gossypiifolia, J. integerrima, and J. platyphylla, which have been of interest as a sustainable crop and in biofuel and ethnopharmacological studies. To date, there are no precedents of a scientific compilation that comprehensively reviews recent information regarding Jatropha species. Only a few publications have been published on J. curcas, mainly focusing on its potential source of compounds to produce biofuels. This work aims to comprehensively review the available information from the web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus databases to assess all possible subjects regarding Jatropha studies. For instance, in this work, we will assess the agronomic, botanical, industrial applications, and biopharmacological potential of Jatropha crops and their phytochemical constituents"--
