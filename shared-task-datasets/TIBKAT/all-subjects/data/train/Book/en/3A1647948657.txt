This volume surveys the spectral properties of the spin Dirac operator. After a brief introduction to spin geometry, we present the main known estimates for Dirac eigenvalues on compact manifolds with or without boundaries. We give examples where the spectrum can be made explicit and present a chapter dealing with the non-compact setting. The methods mostly involve elementary analytical techniques and are therefore accessible for Master students entering the subject. A complete and updated list of references is also included
