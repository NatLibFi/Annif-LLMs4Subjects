Nanocarbon electrochemistry
"Electrochemistry is an extensively utilized field of chemistry that integrates chemicals and electric fields. A well-designed electrode material is the key of electrochemistry. The connection of electrochemistry with carbon materials such as graphite, diamond, carbon fibers has been a long history. The discoveries new carbon materials such as fullerene, graphene, carbon nanotubes, graphene nanoribbon, carbon dots, and graphdiyne in past decades have triggered more research advances with respect to their electrochemical preparation, characterization and applications"--
