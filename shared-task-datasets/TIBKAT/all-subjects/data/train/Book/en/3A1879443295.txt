Globalisation of accounting standards
In this book, Jayne Godfrey and Keryn Chalmers explore the intricacies of the globalisation of accounting standards - arguably one of the most significant business developments of the wider globalisation process during the past two decades. They examine the key issues and implications of this harmonisation of accounting standards from the perspectives of a diverse range of worldwide stakeholders. Globalisation of Accounting Standards shows that globalisation approaches differ significantly because countries seek to maintain varying degrees of sovereignty over their regulations. International differences in economic, political, legal, religious and social characteristics also affect globalisation approaches and, in turn, influence national accounting standard-setting agendas. The book explores why countries relinquish their existing national accounting standard-setting regimes to join the global movement. It also seeks to resolve questions such as: To what extent are national incentives altruistic, economic, political or social? Who are the winners and losers in the process? This authoritative book is thoroughly researched and expertly informed. Written by both academics and regulators, it tackles a critical and controversial issue in the globalisation movement. As such, it will be of great interest to a wide-ranging audience including: international, national, private and public sector standard-setters, economic regulators, accounting academics and political economists and strategists
