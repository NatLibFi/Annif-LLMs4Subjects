Ramsete : Articulated and Mobile Robotics for Services and Technologies
This monograph stems out of the research project RAMSETE (Articulated and Mobile Robots for SErvices and TEchnologies). The main objective of this book is to provide robotic researchers and developers with a reliable and authoritative source, meaningful and feasible developments as well as significance and impact of new problems in the field. The monograph emphasises all the implementation aspects related to major robotic subsystems, i.e. both technology structures and specific methodologies. The study of robotic subsystems aimed at the integration in a single complex system, with autonomous motion capabilities, represents the current frontier of scientific research in the field of robotics
