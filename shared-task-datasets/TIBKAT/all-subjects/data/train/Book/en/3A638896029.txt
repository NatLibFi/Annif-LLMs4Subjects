Symmetry and the standard model : mathematics and particle physics
This volume "will emphasize algebra, primarily group theory.  In the first part we will discuss at length the nature of group theory and the major related ideas, with a special emphasis on Lie groups.  The second part will then use these ideas to build a modern formulation of quantum field theory and the tools that are used in particle physics.  In keeping with the theme, the formulations and tools will be approached from a heavily algebraic perspective.  Finally, the first volume will discuss the structure of the standard model (again, focusing on the algebraic structure) and the attempts to extend and generalize it."--p. viii-ix
"The first volume of a series intended to teach math in a way that is catered to physicists.  Following a brief review of classical physics at the undergraduate level and a preview of particle physics from an experimentalist's perspective, the text systematically lays the mathematical groundwork for an algebraic understanding of the Standard model of particle physics.  It then concludes with an overview of the extensions of the previous ideas to physics beyond the standard model.  The text is geared toward advanced undergraduate students and first-year graduate students."--p. [4] of cover
