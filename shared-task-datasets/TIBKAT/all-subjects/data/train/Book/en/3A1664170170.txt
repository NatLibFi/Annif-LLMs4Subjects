Integrated silicon-based optical modulators : 100 Gb/s and beyond
Backgrounds -- Introduction to integrated optical modulators -- Optical circuits and waveguides in integrated Mach-Zehnder optical modulators -- Electronic and optoelectronic properties of high-speed phase shifters -- Oprtical, electrical, and electro-optical characteristics of integrated silicon-based optical modulators -- Transmission characteristics of integrated silicon-based optical modulators -- Photonic-electronic integration with silicon-based optical modulators.
"This book discusses the principles and the latest progress of silicon optical modulators as cutting-edge integrated photonic devices on silicon-photonic platforms, which play key roles in modern optical communications with low power consumption, small footprints, and low manufacturing costs. Silicon Mach-Zehnder optical modulators are emphasized as the principal small-footprint optical modulator because of its superior performance in high-speed optical modulation at operational temperatures beyond 100 degrees Celsius without power-consuming thermo-electric cooling in spectral bands over 100 nm"--
