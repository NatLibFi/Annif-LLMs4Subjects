This book reviews the history of technology and suggests how it will continue to develop in relation to human use. Technology and humans are bound together inextricably as more of our daily life, and even emotions, are influenced by objects which in turn are designed to reflect nature. Throughout the chapters, the authors take readers through the various uses of technology. They discuss archifact analysis, usability and cognitive engineering, as well as motivation and emotion in user interface design. The book also crucially introduces a new, holistic approach to designing human-technology interaction. The book is suitable for researchers, postgraduate and undergraduate students of cognitive and social psychology as well as all those who are interested in technological design and its societal impact
