Nanoscopy and nanospectroscopy
"This book builds a narrative on the near-field optical and spectroscopic studies with an emphasis on plasmonic and photonic assisted nano-optics as a tool for super-lensing. Deliberations on near-field studies using confined light in various applications are included along with their commercial implications. Single molecule detection utilizing efficient surface-enhanced Raman scattering phenomenon in the far-field and plasmonic tip-enhanced Raman scattering studies in the near-field measurements for fast analysis upto trace level is discussed. Features: Covers the broad area of nano-optical spectroscopy from the perspective of putting the concepts and innovations in the field to use. Discusses entire spectra of near-field optics and spectroscopy using light. Includes dielectric nanophotonics and optical confinement. Studies acoustic phonon confinement for analysis of chemical, biological and other materials. Explores gas/chemical sensing using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in the Kretschmann configuration. This book is aimed at graduate students and researchers in material science, analytical chemistry, nanotechnology, and electrical engineering"--
