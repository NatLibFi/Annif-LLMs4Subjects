Fourier ptychographic imaging : a MATLAB tutorial
This book demonstrates the concept of Fourier ptychography, a new imaging technique that bypasses the resolution limit of the employed optics. In particular, it transforms the general challenge of high-throughput, high-resolution imaging from one that is coupled to the physical limitations of the optics to one that is solvable through computation. Beginning as a collection of lecture notes and MATLABÂ® simulation examples, this book has grown to include discussions on the experimental implementation and recent developments in the teaching of the Fourier ptychography technique. In teaching this technique in a graduate course, students were able to develop a better conceptual understanding of Fourier ptychography. This book will be of interest to researchers and engineers learning simulation techniques for Fourier optics and the Fourier ptychography concept.
