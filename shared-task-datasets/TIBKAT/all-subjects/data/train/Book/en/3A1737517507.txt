AI and UX : Why Artificial Intelligence Needs User Experience
As venture capital and industrial resources are increasingly poured into rapid advances in artificial intelligence, the actual usage and success of AI depends on a satisfactory experience for the user. UX will play a significant role in the adoption of AI technologies across markets, and AI and UX explores just what these demands will entail. Great effort has been put forth to continuously make AI “smarter.” But, will smarter always equal more successful AI? It is not just about getting a product to market, but about getting the product into a user’s hands in a form that will be embraced. This demands examining the product from the perspective of the user. Authors Gavin Lew and Robert Schumacher have written AI and UX to examine just how product managers and designers can best strike this balance. From exploring the history of the parallel journeys of AI and UX, to investigating past product examples and failures, to practical expert knowledge on how to best execute a positive user experience, AI and UX examines all angles of how AI can best be developed within a UX framework. The new world of AI necessitates an equally new UX lens through which to see all potential products. While massive inroads have created strides in AI technology, it must be accessible and easy to use for the consumer. Innovators in the field need to shift thinking from “it works” to “it works well,” which makes all the difference in increasing adoption. Let your users enhance your data, and let the UX of your product do the selling for you. AI and UX is your roadmap for the future.
