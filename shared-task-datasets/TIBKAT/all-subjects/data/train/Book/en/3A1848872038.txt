Some Fundamentals of Mathematics of Blockchain
This book provides a foundation for the mathematics of blockchain. It is inspired by a general analysis and synthesis of the current knowledge of blockchain technology and starts by laying a foundation for the mathematics of blockchain. The aim is for research in the area of blockchain to lead their study from the construction highlighted in this book. First, the basis of a blockchain is set: block, transaction contents, block header, Merkle tree, nonce, Proof-of-Work. Connections with elliptic curves and cryptographic signatures are made. Second, the book ties this with a Graph and Matrix Theories approach and models the peer-to-peer relationship through the Bitcoin Network. Third, it is proposed further modelling, notably around halving, optimal storing, or diffusion of information, which are consequences of the mathematical foundation. The notion of Entropy of Privacy and the Particles model are introduced. Finally, the mathematical statements therein are proven and essential reminders can be found before each section, so the content can be accessible from a graduate level.
