Speed and politics : an essay on dromology
Speed and Politics (first published in France in 1977) is the matrix of Virilio's entire work. It presents a topological account of the entire history of humanity, honing in on the technological advances made possible through the militarization of society. Parallel to Heidegger's vision of technology, Virilio sees speedÃÅ - not class or wealth - as the primary motor behind civilization. In this "technical vitalism," multiple projectiles - inert fortresses and bunkers, the "metabolic bodies" of soldiers, transport vessels, and now information and computer technology -  mutually prosthetize each other in a permanent assault on the world and, through it, on human nature.
