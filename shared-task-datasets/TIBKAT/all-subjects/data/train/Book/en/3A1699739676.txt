Arc-search techniques for interior-point methods
"This book discusses one of the most recent developments in interior-point methods, the arc-search techniques. Introducing these techniques result in an efficient interior-point algorithm with the lowest polynomial bound, which solves a long-standing issue of the interior-point methods in linear programming, i.e., the algorithm with the best polynomial bound is the least efficient and the most efficient interior-point algorithm cannot be proved to converge. The book also covers important results since 1990s and the extensions of the arc-search techniques to the general optimization problems, such as convex quadratic programming, linear complementarity problem, and semi-definite programming"--
