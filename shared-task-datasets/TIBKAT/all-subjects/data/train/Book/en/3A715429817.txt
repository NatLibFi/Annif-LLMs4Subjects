Introduction to heat transfer
Presenting the basic mechanisms for transfer of heat, this book gives a deeper and more comprehensive view than existing titles on the subject. Derivation and presentation of analytical and empirical methods are provided for calculation of heat transfer rates and temperature fields as well as pressure drop. The book covers thermal conduction, forced and natural laminar and turbulent convective heat transfer, thermal radiation including participating media, condensation, evaporation and heat exchangers. This book is aimed to be used in both undergraduate and graduate courses in heat transfer and thermal engineering design in industry and by consultancy firms--
