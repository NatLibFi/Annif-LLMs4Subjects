The difficult politics of peace : rivalry in modern South Asia
In 'The Difficult Politics of Peace', Christopher Clary traces the India-Pakistan rivalry from both countries' independence in 1947 to the present. Drawing on personal interviews and recently declassified documents, Clary offers new insights into the political struggles of Indian and Pakistani national leaders as they sought to navigate domestic politics and international politics simultaneously, and in so doing reveals how the causes of war and peace are inextricably linked to political circumstances within rival states.
