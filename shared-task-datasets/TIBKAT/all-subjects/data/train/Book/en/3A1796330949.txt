Urbanism for a difficult future : practical responses to the climate crisis
"Urbanism for a Difficult Future: Practical Responses to the Climate Crisis is a much-needed guide for launching the next generation of land use planning and urbanism that will enable us to adapt to and survive through the consequences of climate change. The book offers strong and straightforward measures for creating a landscape of resilience via pockets of self-sufficiencies. It demonstrates how to secure systems that sustain life (energy, water, food, waste, and production of essential goods) as well as political and social protocols enabling agile decisions in managing these systems effectively at the local scales. It also provides the design principles for creating the kind of built environment that will enable the kind of localization we need for adaptation. The book explores how it is possible to create a life that does not depend on large-scale regional sustenance systems which are likely to be disrupted or fail. This book uncovers how to enable people to be creative, productive, and supportive at local scales, so that we can achieve strong and diverse local economies that can sustain life. It will appeal to students, planners, and policy makers working in environmental studies, environmental engineering, urban and regional planning, architecture, landscape architecture, and urbanism"--
