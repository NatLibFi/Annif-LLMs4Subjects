Neutron and X-ray Spectroscopy
- Up-to-date account of the principles and practice of inelastic and spectroscopic methods available at neutron and synchrotron sources- Multi-technique approach set around a central theme, rather than a monograph on one technique- Emphasis on the complementarity of neutron spectroscopy and X-ray spectroscopy which are usually treated in separate books
Scientific research involving neutrons or synchrotron radiation is performed in large experimental installations at a few sites around the world. Taking full advantage of such techniques requires a wide range of specialized expertise not found in any university course. Therefore, there is a need for reference books and training courses to introduce young scientists to the underlying principles and methods.  Neutron and X-Ray Spectroscopy delivers an up-to-date account of the principles and practice of inelastic and spectroscopic methods available at neutron and synchrotron sources, including recent developments. The chapters are based on a course of lectures and practicals (the HERCULES course at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility) delivered to young scientists who require these methods in their professional careers. Each chapter, written by a leading specialist in the field, introduces the basic concepts of the technique and provides an overview of recent work. This volume, which focuses on spectroscopic techniques in synchrotron radiation and inelastic neutron scattering, will be a primary source of information for physicists, chemists and materials scientists who wish to acquire a basic understanding of these techniques and to discover the possibilities offered by them. Emphasizing the complementarity of the neutron and X-ray methods, this tutorial will also be invaluable to scientists already working in neighboring fields who seek to extend their knowledge.  Written for:Scientists using large neutron and synchrotron radiation facilities all around the world, PhD students and beginning scientists working in synchrotron radiation or inelastic neutron scattering, in particular participants of the past and future HERCULES courses  Keywords: Absorption spectroscopy Emission spectroscopy Inelastic neutron scattering Neutrons X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy
