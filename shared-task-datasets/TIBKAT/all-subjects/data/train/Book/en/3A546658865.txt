Diffuse Matter from Star Forming Regions to Active Galaxies : A Volume Honouring John Dyson
Provides the introductory reviews to a number of the key hydrodynamic processes and to the sources themselves. The reviews in this work provide an introduction to the astrophysics of diffuse sources suitable for postgraduate students and researchers in astrophysics
John Dyson has contributed to the study of the hydrodynamic processes that govern a wide variety of astrophysical sources which he has helped explain. In this volume dedicated to him, introductory reviews to a number of the key processes and to the sources themselves are given by leading experts. The book provides a coherent introduction to the astrophysics of diffuse sources suitable for postgraduate students and researchers in astrophysics.
