The tiny house handbook
"The Tiny House Handbook is not an inspirational coffee-table book featuring beautiful photos of tiny houses. This book is a functional and instructional guide to planning, designing, and building a tiny house. Produced in author Charlie Wing's signature "Visual Handbook" style, with minimal text and heavily illustrated spreads, this book guides readers step-by-step through the building process from cost estimating and site planning to a completed tiny house. There are very few books on the market that reach this level of detail. This book is based on the newly revised 2018 International Residential Code (IRC) Appendix Q and includes sample construction drawings and sample floor plans for mobile (8'-wide trailers and RVs), movable (12'-wide, no transport permit), and extra-wide (>12'-wide, permit required) tiny homes."--
