Activated carbon : solutions for improving water quality
"Many books have been written about granular activated carbon. Some focus on the theory of performance and removal mechanisms while others focus on design features. This book focuses on solutions. It describes the challenges facing water providers to provide safe water that is acceptable to their customers, utility experiences using activated carbon, activated carbon applications, and design and procurement approaches. The appendices include detailed case studies and a life-cycle assessment demonstrating favorable sustainability considerations for activated carbon when compared to other treatment technologies. Never before has all of this information been together in one location. The what, why, and how of activated carbon are connected in this book and demonstrate why this treatment technology has maintained its status as an integral treatment technology in the quest for pure water over millennia"--
