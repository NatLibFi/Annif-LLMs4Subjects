Self-assembly : from surfactants to nanoparticles
"This book covers state-of-the-art tools in surfactant self-assembled structures in a single reference. The book begins with basic fundamental concepts that have been well established by a long history of research on more classical self-assembly systems based on surfactants or polymers, and then progressively builds in complexity in terms of the types of assembling building blocks, leading ultimately to complex biomolecular self-assemblies to hybrid, multicomponent assemblies, for example involving nanoparticles and amphiphilic molecules. Cutting edge topics of hierarchichal self-assembly are included, such as assembly of primitive membranes. The book is suitable as a supplementary text for a physical and chemical separation processes or basic colloidal phenomena class"--Provided by publisher
