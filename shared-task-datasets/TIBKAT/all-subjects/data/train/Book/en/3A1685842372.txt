Built on sand : the science of granular materials
Grains, seeds, and powders -- Grain production -- Piles of grains -- The packing fraction -- Making contacts -- Manifestations of disorder -- Force chains -- Granular flow -- From sand castles to clay towers -- Sticky grains -- Fluids in granular materials -- Grains in a fluid.
"Granular materials are composed of macroscopic particles, not molecules, and yet they can assemble in disordered configurations, such is present in glass, and they exhibit both fluid-like and solid-like behaviors. This book gives a broad introduction to granular materials, a fast-developing field that impacts most science and engineering disciplines, describing the different types and origins of grains, natural and fabricated, and explaining the physical properties of a "pile" of grains. All the physical concepts that have been investigated during the last thirty years are described and illustrated in simple terms"--
