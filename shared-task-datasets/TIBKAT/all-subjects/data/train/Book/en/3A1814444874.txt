Biotechnological approaches in waste management
"Waste generation from industrial and domestic sectors are imposing a very challenging environment and intervention of biotechnology offers a viable solution for their effective management. This book deals with the employment of biotechnological aspects for waste treatment including the basic concepts, biochemical processes and various technologies for pollutant reduction and production of value-added products for a cleaner environment. It covers different aspects of biotechnology in the conservation of environment dealing with the sustainable management of waste through the concept of waste-to-economy along with the management of environmental pollutants and natural resource conservation. Focusses on ecological approaches i.e. the use of biocatalysts and biotechnological approaches for waste management Explores the different biotechnology-based solution for the removal of environmental pollutants Covers various microbiological routes, technological options for waste to energy, removal of contaminants and the production of value-added products Reviews the bioremediation potential of microbial strains and enzymes Explores the significant routes of biotechnological means of obtaining eco-friendly products substituting the hazardous chemical-based products This volume is aimed for researchers, professionals in environmental, biotechnology and chemical engineering"--
