European Robotics Symposium 2006
This unique reference represents a cross-section of forefront robotics research, ranging from robotics and systems to learning, autonomy and failure detection, from vision and navigation to localization and mapping, which are based on the papers presented at the 1st European Robotics Symposium (EUROS-06) held in Palermo, Italy from 16-18 March, 2006. The European Robotics Symposium (EUROS) is a brand-new International scientific event promoted by EURON, the European Robotics Network. Since its inception in 2000, EURON links most of the European robotics research teams and today (2006) involves more than 165 universities and companies across all of its member states. The EUROS meeting will be held in Europe every other year, but international participation at all levels is strongly encouraged making it a meeting place for high-quality presentation of interesting international research on robotics.
