Shock wave-boundary-layer interactions
"This is the first book devoted solely to the phenomenon of Shock Wave Boundary Layer Interactions and covers all flow regimes where SBLI's occur"--Provided by publisher
"Shock Wave/Boundary Layer Interaction (SBLI) is a fundamental phenomenon in gas dynamics and frequently a defining feature in high speed aerodynamic flowfields. The interactions can be found in practical situations, ranging from transonic aircraft wings to hypersonic vehicles and engines. SBLI's have the potential to pose serious problems and is thus a critical issue for aerospace applications. This is the first book devoted solely to a comprehensive, state of the art explanation of the phenomenon with coverage of all flow regimes where SBLI's occur. The book includes contributions from leading international experts who share their insight into SBLI physics and the impact of these interactions on practical flow situations. This book is aimed at practitioners and graduate students in aerodynamics who wish to familiarise themselves with all aspects of SBLI flows. It is a valuable resource for the specialist because it gathers experimental, computational and theoretical knowledge in one place"--Provided by publisher
