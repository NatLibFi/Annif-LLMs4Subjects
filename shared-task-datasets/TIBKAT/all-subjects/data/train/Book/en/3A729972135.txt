Shaping Policy Reform and Peer Review in Southeast Asia : Integrating Economies Amid Diversity
The Southeast Asian region has experienced remarkable economic dynamism in the past few decades. An interesting feature of recent developments in the region, is that in spite of its diversity, several initiatives have been launched towards integration. The peer review mechanism has been a tried and tested instrument for OECD member states to work together successfully over the past decades. This tool could benefit the Southeast Asian region as it helps identify good practices, establish standards and principles and ultimately improve the performance of participating economies. This publication presents the proceedings of a conference in which  the possible application of peer reviews to address regional and domestic challenges in Southeast Asia were discussed.
