La Caja MÃ¡gica - Dominique Perrault Architecture
"The Magic-Box, carried out by Dominique Perrault Architecture, is more than a public sports facility. It is a whole conceptual, urbanistic and constructive manifesto through the insertion of a radically contemporary building in a sensitive environment, and which has helped to regenerate the southern edge of the city of Madrid and to roud off the urban banks of the Manzanares River."--
