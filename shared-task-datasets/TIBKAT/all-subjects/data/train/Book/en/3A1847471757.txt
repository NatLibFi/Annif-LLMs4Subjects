An introduction to condensed matter physics for the nanosciences
The book provides an accessible introduction to the principles of condensed matter physics with a focus on the nanosciences and device technologies. The basics of electronic, phononic, photonic, superconducting, optics, quantum optics, and magnetic properties are explored, and nanoscience and device materials are incorporated throughout the chapters. Many examples of the fundamental principles of condensed matter physics are taken directly from nanoscience and device applications. This book requires a background in electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics at the undergraduate level. It will be a valuable reference for advanced undergraduates and graduate students of physics, engineering, and applied mathematics. Features Contains discussions of the basic principles of quantum optics and its importance to lasers, quantum information, and quantum computation. Provides references and a further reading list to additional scientific literature so that readers can use the book as a starting point to then follow up with a more advanced treatment of the topics covered. Requires only a basic background in undergraduate electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics
