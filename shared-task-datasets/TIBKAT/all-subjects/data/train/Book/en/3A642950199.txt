Integration of ferroelectric and piezoelectric thin films : concepts and applications for microsystems
This book contains four parts. The first one is dedicated to concepts. It starts with the definitions and examples of what is piezo-pyro and ferroelectricity by considering the symmetry of the material. Thereafter, these properties are described within the framework of Thermodynamics. The second part described the way to integrate these materials in Microsystems. The third part is dedicated to characterization: composition, structure and a special focused on electrical behaviors. The last part gives a survey of state of the art applications using integrated piezo or/and ferroelectric films
