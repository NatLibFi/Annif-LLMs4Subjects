Introduction to the Theory of Stability
The present book deals with the issues of stability of Motion which most often are encountered in the analysis of scientific and technical problems. There are many comprehensive monographs on the theory of stability of motion, with each one devoted to a separate complicated issue of the theory. The main advantage of this book, however, is its simple yet simultaneous rigorous presentation of the concepts of the theory, which often are presented in the context of applied problems with detailed examples demonstrating effective methods of solving practical problems
