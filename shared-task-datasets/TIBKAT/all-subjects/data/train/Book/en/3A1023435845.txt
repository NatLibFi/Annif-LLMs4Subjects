Handbook of Chinese organizational behavior : integrating theory, research and practice
This comprehensive Handbook explores limitations and challenges arising from attempts to develop indigenous theories and constructs applicable to Chinese social reality. Key contributors integrate the literature in their topic areas, providing directions for pushing forward the frontiers of research into a more culturally sensitive and powerful representation of Chinese organizational behavior. Areas examined include emotional intelligence, creativity and motivation, leadership, team conflicts, trust, power and business ethics. Experienced practitioner input is included. -- ‘The book serves us by collecting and examining an enormous amount of organizational studies that address management, leadership, organizational development and psychology. . . Bravo to the ground staff for the enormous amount of preparatory work and guidance they have provided in this volume, enabling and encouraging us to launch out on new explorations.’ (George Simons, Dialogin).
