This book analyses the efficiency of the recognised surgical procedures, it is rooted in evidence-based medicine. Indications, techniques, complications, and specific follow-up treatments in the realm of sleep medicine have been compiled in the form of a primer.

The complete surgical and sleep medicine know-how of the authors, as well as the experience of numerous international courses on sleep surgery, have been incorporated into this volume.
