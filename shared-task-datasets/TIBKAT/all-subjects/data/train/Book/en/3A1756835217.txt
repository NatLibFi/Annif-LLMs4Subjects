The palimpsest catena of Codex Zacynthius : text and translation
This edition presents the complete palimpsest undertext of Codex Zacynthius (Cambridge, University Library MS Add. 10062) for the first time in print. Relying on state-of-the-art multispectral images produced for the Codex Zacynthius project, supplemented by significant new textual parallels identified by the CATENA project, a full transcription is given of each page of this unique ancient commentary on the Gospel according to Luke preserving the distinctive format of the catena. On the facing pages, the first-ever English translation of a New Testament catena makes the commentary accessible to a broad readership. This volume complements the digital edition of the manuscript in the Cambridge Digital Library and a set of studies of Codex Zacynthius also published in the Texts and Studies series
