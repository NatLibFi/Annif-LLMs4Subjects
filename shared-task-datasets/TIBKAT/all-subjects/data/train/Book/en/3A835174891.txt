"Fantasy has been an important and much-loved part of children's literature for hundreds of years, yet relatively little has been written about it. Children's Fantasy Literature traces the development of the tradition of the children's fantastic - fictions specifically written for children and fictions appropriated by them â€’ from the sixteenth to the twenty-first century, examining the work of Lewis Carroll, L.
