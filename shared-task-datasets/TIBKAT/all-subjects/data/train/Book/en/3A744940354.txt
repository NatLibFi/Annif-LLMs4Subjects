Wave Physics : Oscillations - Solitons - Chaos
The classical physics of oscillations and waves is developed here at a more advanced mathematical level than is customary for second-year courses. The detailed explanation of the classical phenomena provides a sound basis for the introduction to wave mechanics that follows. A chapter on nonlinear waves and solitons, as well as contributions by M.C. Gutzwiller (USA), and A.V. Gaponov-Grekhov and M.I. Rabinovich (Russia) on chaos and associated phenomena, broadens the concepts of wave behavior, while introducing the reader to important topics in current wave physics.This textbook is directed primarily at undergraduate students in physics, mathematics and engineering, but it will also be useful as a reference for graduate students, and for professors looking for examination problems. For this new edition, a number of examples and problems have been added, and typographic errors corrected
