This book integrates bioengineering for solving health issues. It shows how the use of applied mechanics and strength of materials using 3D printing models, digital correlation techniques and computed tomography images, provides solutions to biology, medicine and mechanical engineering. The book provides clear processes and illustrations, several worked examples, and many projects. It helps scientists to analyze different modes of applying mechanical and biomedical concepts, physical principles to develop devices, sensors, prosthesis, orthotic systems, new materials and techniques that may improve the health system. It can be used in courses such as biomechanics and orthopedics, rehabilitation and mechanical engineering, also in rehabilitation or sports medicine.
