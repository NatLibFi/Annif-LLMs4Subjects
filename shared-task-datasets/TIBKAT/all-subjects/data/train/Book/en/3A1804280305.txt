This volume of the Encyclopedia of Complexity and Systems Science, Second Edition, focuses on current challenges in the field from materials and mechanics to applications of statistical and nonlinear physics in the life sciences. Challenges today are mostly in the realm of non-equilibrium systems, although certain equilibrium systems also present serious hurdles. Where possible, pairwise articles focus on a single topic, one from a theoretical perspective and the other from an experimental one, providing valuable insights. In other cases, theorists and experimentalists have collaborated on a single article. Coverage includes both quantum and classical systems, and emphasizes 1) mature fields that are not covered in the current specialist literature, (2) topics that fall through the cracks in disciplinary journals/books, or (3) developing areas where the knowledge base is large and robust and upon which future developments will depend. The result is an invaluable resource for condensed matter physicists, material scientists, engineers and life scientists.
