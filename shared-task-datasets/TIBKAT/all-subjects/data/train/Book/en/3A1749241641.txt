The Rowman & Littlefield handbook on aging and work
"This handbook will serve as a comprehensive resource for students, scholars and practitioners who are seeking either a broad overview of important and inter-related topics concerning the aging workforce or insightful discussions of specific issues and challenges.These issues include why extended lifespans and better health are allowing older workers to delay retirement and stay on the job. In fact, the labor force participation rate for people sixty-five and older is growing faster than the rate for all younger age groups. The scope and content of the handbook will go beyond traditional academic research on aging which has traditionally been sociologically focused by including new research done in the Gerontology, Demography, Economics, Social Policy, Psychology, Gender Studies, Social Work and Business Management disciplines.The handbook will also encompass emerging and relevant themes regarding the aging workforce in the United States, describing the impact of those conditions and developments on the individual worker, on organizations and employers, and on society as a whole."
