Solar buildings and neighborhoods : design considerations for high energy performance
Principles of solar design -- Introduction building envelope -- Selected high-performance building envelopes -- Active solar technologies -- Advanced solar envelope design -- Residential, low-density neighborhoods.
This book presents the main principles for designing buildings and neighborhoods with increased potential to capture and utilize solar energy. It discusses practical issues in the design of the built environment and their impact on energy performance; and a range of design considerations, from building components (e.g. the building envelope) to urban planning issues (e.g. density and street layouts). In addition to design guidelines on how to increase buildingsâ€™ potential to capture solar energy, the book provides creative tips to increase the aesthetic value of solar technology integration in buildings. Helping readers plan energy-efficient buildings with innovative building envelope technologies, and to understand the impact of early-stage design considerations on the energy performance of buildings and communities, the book offers a valuable source of information for building professionals, including architects, engineers, and urban planners. It can also serve as a reference guide for academics and students of energy efficiency in buildings and urban planning.
