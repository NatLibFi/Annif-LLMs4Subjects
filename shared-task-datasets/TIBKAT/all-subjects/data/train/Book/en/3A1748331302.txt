Special design topics in digital wideband receivers
Offering engineers a thorough examination of special, more advanced aspects of digital wideband receiver design, this practical book builds on fundamental resources on the topic, helping professionals gain a more comprehensive understanding of the subject. This in-depth volume presents a detailed look at a complete receiver design, including the encoder. Moreover, it discusses the detection of exotic signals and provides authoritative guidance on designing receivers used in electronic warfare. From frequency modulation and biphase shifting keys, to parameter encoders in electronic warfare receivers and the use of the simulation and probability density function to predict the false alarm parameter, this book focuses on critical topics and techniques that help engineers design digital wideband receivers for top performance. The authoritative reference is supported with over 310 illustrations and more than 180 equations
