Encyclopedia of general topology
Generalities -- Basic constructions -- Maps and general types of spaces defined by maps -- Fairly general properties -- Spaces with richer structures -- Special properties -- Special spaces -- Connections with other structures -- Influences of other fields -- Connections with other fields
This book is designed for the reader who wants to get a general view of the terminology of General Topology with minimal time and effort. The reader, whom we assume to have only a rudimentary knowledge of set theory, algebra and analysis, will be able to find what they want if they will properly use the index. However, this book contains very few proofs and the reader who wants to study more systematically will find sufficiently many references in the book. Key features: & bull; More terms from General Topology than any other book ever published & bull; Short and informative articles & bull; Authors include the majority of top researchers in the field & bull; Extensive indexing of terms
