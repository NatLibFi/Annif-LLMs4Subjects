Societal Self-empowerment in Germany : A Comparison of Fridays for Future and Corona Skepticism
Most recently, various groups have drawn attention to their political causes by demonstratively breaking the law, whether it is violating compulsory education in Fridays for Future demonstrations or refusing to abide by pandemic containment measures among critics of the Corona policy. This book explores what lies behind these rule-breaking events: supporters of the Fridays for Future movement, while dissatisfied with climate policy, are well integrated into the political system; people who do not abide by Corona rules, on the other hand, sometimes exhibit considerable alienation from and distrust of the political system.
