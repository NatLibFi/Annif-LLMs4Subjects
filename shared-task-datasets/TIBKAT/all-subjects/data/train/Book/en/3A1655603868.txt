Integrated design and simulation of chemical processes
This title aims to teach how to invent optimal and sustainable chemical processes by making use of systematic conceptual methods and computer simulation techniques. The material covers five sections: process simulation; thermodynamic methods; process synthesis; process integration; and design project including case studies. It is primarily intended as a teaching support for undergraduate and postgraduate students following various process design courses and projects, but will also be of great value to professional engineers interested in the newest design methods. Provides an introduction to the newest design methods. Of great value to undergraduate and postgraduate students as well as professional engineers. Numerous examples illustrate theoretical priciples and design issues
