Megaprojects for megacities : a comparative casebook
"Megaprojects for Megacities is a collection of 14 international case studies of transportation, urban development, and environmental megaprojects completed during the last ten years in North America, Asia and Europe. It goes beyond the previous megaproject literature to look at how and why each project was conceived, planned, engineered, financed, and delivered, and how particular planning and delivery practices shaped successful and unsuccessful outcomes. With individual chapters on high-speed rail, urban metro systems, bus rapid transit, roadway tunnels and bridges, new and improved airports, waterfront redevelopment projects, new towns, urban parks and renewable energy projects, this book is unparalleled in its coverage, depth and takeaways for practice. It incorporates current examples from across the world, including North America, Asia, the UK, and Europe. This collection of case studies is presented in an approachable way that will prove valuable to academics, researchers and students as well as practicing professionals, financiers and senior government officials interested in infrastructure planning, financing, project management and delivery"--
