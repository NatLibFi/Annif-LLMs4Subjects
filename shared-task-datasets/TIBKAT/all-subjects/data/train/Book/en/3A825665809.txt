"It is a linguistic and anthropological truism that each natural human language carves out its unique lexical landscape. The resulting differences between languages constitute attractive articles of edutainment. It is indeed both amazing and amusing that the same dessert known as a floating island in English and in Spanish (albeit pluralized as: islas flotantes) is called 'snow eggs' in German (Schnee-Eier), 'nothing soup' in Polish (zupa nic), and 'bird's milk' in Romanian (lapte de pasare)"--
"The first practical study of its kind, Lexical Conflict presents a taxonomy of cross-linguistic lexical differences, with thorough discussion of zero equivalence, multiple equivalence and partial equivalence across languages.
