Carbohydrate Chemistry and Biochemistry : Structure and Mechanism
Carbohydrates play important roles in biological systems as energy sources, as structural materials, and as informational structures, This graduate textbook is aimed at providing researchers new to the subject with information on the structure and mechanisms in the chemistry, biochemistry or processing of carbohydrates.  The book contains everything the reader needs to know about a non-synthetic carbohydrate research project. It gives excellent coverage of carbohydrate chemistry and biochemistry, particularly including the principles of reactivity, in the process industries, such as pulp, paper and food.  It also employs use of the same concepts to describe enzymic and non-enzymic reactivity
