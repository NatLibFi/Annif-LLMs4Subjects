Numerical Mathematics
This English translation of the highly successful German textbook Numerische Mathematik covers the usual classical topics of numerical analysis, and also includes an up-to-date treatment of both splines and linear optimization methods. The text is designed to be used in a first course in numerical analysis at the upper division undergraduate level or at the beginning graduate level. It features a careful balance between mathematical rigor and numerical insight and includes many worked out numerical examples. Each section concludes with an extensive set of exercises which instructors should find useful in helping students to master the material. Moreover, the authors have also provided carefully researched historical notes which will be of particular interest to experts as well as students
