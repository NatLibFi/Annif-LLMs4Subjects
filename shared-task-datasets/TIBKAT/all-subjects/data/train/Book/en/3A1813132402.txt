Coloniality in discourse studies : a radical critique
"The volume examines the discourse-based critique of coloniality. It brings together an extensive interdisciplinary dialogue which reveal what different research fields - such as sociology of language, social psychology, history, and political science, among others - have to say about discourse criticism and de/coloniality. In doing so, it also invites a critique of critical thinking, acknowledging the relevance of dissonant voices that arise from this debate. The essays in this volume discuss possibilities to decolonize discursive studies without losing sight of its contradictions. The book delves into how one can, as an intellectual who enjoys the privileges of coloniality in academic environments of the Global North, deal with the limitations and paradox of a radical critique through discourse. It discusses how ideas, entrenched in privilege, can be extracted, shared, and applied while ensuring the radicality of their local contextualization. These ideas then must not only make sense within themselves but also resonate with other contexts, readings, and peoples, in the South, without repeating the mistakes of hermetic scholarly lexicons. A key reading on decoloniality, critical thinking, methodologies, ideas, ideologies, language, and critical discourse analysis, this volume will be of immense interest to scholar and researchers of language and literature, political science, the social sciences, and Global South Studies"--
