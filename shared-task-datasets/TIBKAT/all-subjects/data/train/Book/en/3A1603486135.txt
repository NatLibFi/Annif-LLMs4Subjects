Microfabrication for microfluidics
"Providing a definitive source of knowledge about the principles, materials, and process techniques used in the fabrication of microfluidic systems and devices, this practical volume is an essential reference for novices and practicing professionals in the field. This unique book not only focuses on the fabrication aspects, but also covers the basic purpose, benefits, and limitations of the fabricated structures as they are applied to microfludic sensor and actuator functions. Practitioners find guidance on rapidly assessing options and trade-offs for the selection of fabrication methods with several tabulated examples from the field. More than 100 illustrations support and clarify key concepts throughout the book."--BOOK JACKET
