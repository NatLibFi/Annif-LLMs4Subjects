Urbanization, urbanism and urbanity in an African city : home spaces and house cultures
"This book makes an important contribution to global urban studies through an in-depth and inter-disciplinary study of Maputo as a key case study for rapid urbanization, emerging urbanism and actual urbanity across Africa. It builds on decades of experience in the region, as well as a recent detailed empirical study which included unique longitudinal elements--contextualizing the relevance of this more generally. Its focus on the physical aspects of the city, linked to socio-cultural analysis, place[s] it in a unique position in current critiques of writing on Africa"--Provided by the publisher
