Essays in media and cultural studies : in transition
"Spanning a decade of key research, this collection brings together the essays and chapters of leading media scholar Graeme Turner for the first time. The organising theme of transition within this book focuses on both the state of the media as it continues its evolution into the digital era, and the fields of media and cultural studies as they grapple with modifying their approaches and assumptions in response to the changing dynamics of the systems they study. In their own attempts to understand a range of contemporary moments over the decade, these essays also provide a personal history of Graeme Turner's participation in the key debates within media and cultural studies. The essays deal with the shifting states of television, with the changing relation between the media and the state, rise of celebrity, and the role of a critical agenda for media and cultural studies in the future. The collection is introduced and concluded by two new essays, respectively assessing the recent past and the necessary futures for these fields of study. Providing key insights into a range of topics, this book is ideal for students and scholars looking to deepen their understanding of the transitory nature of media and cultural studies"--
