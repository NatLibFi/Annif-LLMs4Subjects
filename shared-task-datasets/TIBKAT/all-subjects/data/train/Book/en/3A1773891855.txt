Calixarene chemistry, at the turn of the millennium, is a field approaching true maturity. In many areas, applications are real and important, and the arsenal of structures based on calixarenes provides tools effective in numerous areas of supramolecular chemistry. In this book, chapters contributed by a broad spectrum of international authors provide a variety of perspectives upon the progress and future of calixarene chemistry. Issues covered in depth include: Calixarene synthesis, with all its subtleties and sophistication. Forces at play in the inclusion of neutral and charged molecules by calixarenes. Theoretical analyses of calixarene properties. Dynamics and thermodynamics of calixarenes and their complexes. Nanocomposite construction based on calixarene aggregates. Calixarenes on surfaces. Analytical applications of calixarenes. Catalysis by calixarenes and their complexes. Resource recovery and waste treatment with calixarenes. New directions in calixarene chemistry. Hetero- and homo-calixarenes. Bioactive calixarenes. Coordination chemistry of calixarenes. Calixarenes in the solid state.
