Cotton and flax fibre-reinforced geopolymer composites : synthesis, properties and applications
This book provides an overview on the latest advances in the synthesis, properties and applications of geopolymers reinforced with natural fibres such as pulp fibre, cotton, sisal, flax and hemp. The influence of adding various natural fibres and nanofillers on the mechanical properties of these composites is discussed. Potential challenges and future directions of these composites are highlighted and addressed. The content of this book caters to students, researchers and academics who are interested in the synthesis and applications of geopolymers composites.
Introduction -- Materials and Methodology -- Physical Properties -- Mechanical Properties -- High-Temperature Thermal Stability and Durability -- Applications -- Conclusions.
