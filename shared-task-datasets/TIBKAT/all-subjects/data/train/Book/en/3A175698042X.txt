Alonso de Garay : Taller ADG
Taller ADG is an architecture studio founded in 2012 by Alonso de Garay, based in Mexico City. This first extensive monograph of its work showcases the company's range through representative projects of different scales and typologies, including stadiums, houses, apartment buildings, housing prototypes and restaurants, such as the stunning and critically acclaimed designs for the New York City restaurants of chefs Enrique Olvera and Daniela Soto-Innes, Cosme and Atla. Lush photographs and intricate architectural models present these works, which blend Mexico's rich modernist past and its equally rich vernacular architecture. A powerful exemplar of this blend is the masterful Casas Izar: twin houses set into a forested hillside that, with their illusion of low slung volumes, alternating wood-slatted sloped roofs and rooftop gardens, seem to fade into the landscape from afar but from up close and inside, display the austere open plans and cathedral-like spaces of high modernism
