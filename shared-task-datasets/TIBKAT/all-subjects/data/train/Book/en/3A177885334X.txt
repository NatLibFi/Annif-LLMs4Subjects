Plasticulture engineering and technology
"The utilization of successful plasticulture engineering technology can ideally optimize crop yields and provide both economic and environmental benefits, such as reducing the need for water and fertilizer. This book discusses the myriad important aspects of crop production that utilize plastic, such as micro irrigation, water management, plastic mulch films, protected cultivation and low tunnels, crop covers, canal linings, silage bags, and more. It also examines the latest methods for vertical farming and technological aspects, such as smart agriculture using the internet of things (IOT). The current state of the art, as well as potential future uses for plastics are discussed in addition to the benefits and limitations of plastics applications in agriculture generally"--
