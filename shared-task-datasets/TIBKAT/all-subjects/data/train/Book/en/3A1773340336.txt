Self-potential method: theoretical modeling and applications in geosciences
The book deals primarily with the aspects of advances in Self-Potential geophysical data modeling, different interpretation techniques, new ideas and an integrated study to delineate the subsurface structures associated with exploration, contamination, buried paleochannels, archaeological investigations, glaciology, geomorphology, subsurface mapping and also in hydrocarbon exploration.The book is specifically aimed with the state-of-art information regarding research advances and new development in these areas of study, coupled to extensive modelling and field investigations obtained from around the world. It is extremely enlightening for the students, research workers, scientists, faculty members in Applied Geophysics, Near Surface Geophysics, Potential field, Electrical and Electromagnetic methods, Mathematical Modeling Techniques in Earth Sciences, as well as Environmental and other practical problems associated with Earth Sciences.
