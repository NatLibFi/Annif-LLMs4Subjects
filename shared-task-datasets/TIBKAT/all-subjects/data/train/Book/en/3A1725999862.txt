Core/shell quantum dots : synthesis, properties and devices
This book outlines various synthetic approaches, tunable physical properties, and device applications of core/shell quantum dots (QDs). Core/shell QDs have exhibited enhanced quantum yield (QY), suppressed photobleaching/blinking, and significantly improved photochemical/physical stability as compared to conventional bare QDs. The core-shell structure also promotes the easy tuning of QDsâ€™ band structure, leading to their employment as attractive building blocks in various optoelectronic devices. The main objective of this book is to create a platform for knowledge sharing and dissemination of the latest advances in novel areas of core/shell QDs and relevant devices, and to provide a comprehensive introduction and directions for further research in this growing area of nanomaterials research. .
