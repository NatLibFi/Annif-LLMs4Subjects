Metal chelation in medicine
Metal chelators are emerging as versatile tool with many medical applications. Their versatility allows them to be used in chelation therapy for treating diseases caused by toxic and heavy metal poisoning, chelating agents are capable of binding to toxic metal ions to form complex structures which are easily excreted from the body removing them from intracellular or extracellular spaces. In addition, metal chelators can also be applied as contrast agents in MRI scanning. Metal Chelation in Medicine provides a clear and timely perspective on the role of chelating agents in the management of metal intoxications and storage diseases. Written by leaders in the field of chelators, this publication is at the cutting-edge of the subject. It covers a broad range of topics such as the use of metal chelators in non-invasive assessment of brain iron overload, and the treatment of systemic iron overload and neurodegenerative diseases. As such it is particularly valuable to clinicians treating metal poisonings and metal storage diseases. However, it is also a useful text for researchers, industry professionals and university students with a specific interest in medicinal chemistry, chelation, metal ions, imaging and non-invasive techniques
