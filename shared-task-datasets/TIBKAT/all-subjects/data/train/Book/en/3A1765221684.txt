Strongly interacting matter under rotation
This book addresses the needs of growing community of graduate students and researchers new to the area, for a survey that covers a wide range of pertinent topics, summarizes the current status of the field, and provides the necessary pedagogical materials for newcomers. The investigation of strongly interacting matter under the influence of macroscopic rotational motion is a new, emerging area of research that encompasses a broad range of conventional physics disciplines such as nuclear physics, astrophysics, and condensed matter physics, where the non-trivial interplay between global rotation and spin is generating many novel phenomena. Edited and authored by leading researchers in the field, this book covers the following topics: thermodynamics and equilibrium distribution of rotating matter; quantum field theory and rotation; phase structure of QCD matter under rotation; kinetic theory of relativistic rotating matter; hydrodynamics with spin; magnetic effects in fluid systems with high vorticity and charge; polarization measurements in heavy ion collisions; hydrodynamic modeling of the QCD plasma and polarization calculation in relativistic heavy ion collisions; chiral vortical effect; rotational effects and related topics in neutron stars and condensed matter systems.
