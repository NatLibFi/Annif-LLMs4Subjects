Dream pools : enchanting pools of Italy's Emerald Coast
"Swimming pools: whether they look directly out over the sea or are set in a garden, whether they have a free form or are more geometrically shaped, whether they are designed to take your breath away or are a discreet addition to their surroundings, pools have become an integral component in the project of a holiday home and are inescapably connected in the minds eye with well-being and relaxation. This volume, which takes us into some of the most beautiful villas on the Costa Smeralda, includes a selection of exceptional examples of pools that differ greatly: sometimes it all looks as though it was created by nature, but it was a human hand, Filigheddu Costruzioni, that selected and created the high-profile technical handcrafted solutions. A freshwater pool set in one of the most spectacular stretches of the whole mediterranean coastline necessarily requires that it be designed with great sensibility and with expert knowledge of materials, using both the most innovative, high-tech solutions and consummate craftsmanship."--Boomerang Books
