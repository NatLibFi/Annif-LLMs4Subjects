Inhibitors of molecular chaperones as therapeutic agents
This book aims to provide a comprehensive examination of the field of molecular chaperone inhibition and its application to pharmaceutical research. With several small molecule inhibitors in oncology clinical development, there is clearly intense interest in the chaperones as a molecular target. Filling a significant gap in the market by providing a detailed comparison of discovery programs across the industry, this text will find broad interest among researchers in the field of molecular chaperone pharmaceutical research, oncology research, and medicinal chemistry. Arranged into three main se
