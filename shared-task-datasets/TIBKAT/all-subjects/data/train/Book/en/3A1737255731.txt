Antennas : rigorous methods of analysis and synthesis
"The book contains new variant of solving the equation of Leontovich, which is most rigorous equation for the current in a thin linear antenna. This solution based in particular on the method of constants variation permits to calculate the sum of any members of series, as well as the total sum of the series members, i.e. solve a problem that has agitated specialists for more than half a century. The book gives a consistent exposition of the theory of integral equations and discusses the features of their application for analyzing different types of antennas. The book considers new ways of analyzing antennas: method of calculating an antenna gain based on its main radiation patterns, procedure of calculating the directional characteristics of radiators with known distribution of current amplitude, method of electrostatic analogy which permits to compare the electromagnetic fields of high-frequency currents with electrostatic charges fields located on linear conductors and to improve the directional characteristics of log-periodic and director-type antennas"--
