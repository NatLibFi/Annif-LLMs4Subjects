Spain's African colonial legacies : Morocco and Equatorial Guinea compared
"The African cities of Bata and Al-Hoceima were created during the Spanish colonial rule of Equatorial Guinea and Morocco. This book constructs their local history to analyse how Spanish colonialism worked, what its legacies were and the imprints it left on their national histories. The work explains the revision of collective memories of the past in the present as a form of decolonisation that seeks to build different foundations for the future in a transnational and glocal framework. The result is an exciting puzzle of individual and collective memories in which Africans contest their colonial cultural heritage and shape their identities at a global level"--
Introduction: Cities at the decolonial margins -- Al-Hoceima and Bata: local histories, global impacts -- Colonial imprints in African city formation -- Cities after colonial independence: the search for collective affirmation and decolonial contestation -- Conclusions: African cities asserting themselves in a global world.
