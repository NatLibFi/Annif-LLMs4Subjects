The contemporary Spanish-American novel : Bolaño and after
"The Contemporary Spanish-American Novel provides an accessible introduction to an important World literature. While many of the authors covered--Aira, Bolaño, Castellanos Moya, Vásquez--are gaining an increasing readership in English and are frequently taught, there is sparse criticism in English beyond book reviews. This book provides the guidance necessary for a more sophisticated and contextualized understanding of these authors and their works. Underestimated or unfamiliar Spanish American novels and novelists are introduced through conceptually rigorous essays. Sections on each writer include: the author's reception in their native country, Spanish America, and Spain; biographical history; a critical examination of their work, including key themes and conceptual concerns; translation history; scholarly reception. The Contemporary Spanish-American Novel offers an authoritative guide to a rich and varied novelistic tradition.
