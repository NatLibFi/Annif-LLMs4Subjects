Essential mathematics for the physical sciences / Brett Borden (Department of Physics, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, USA), James Luscombe (Department of Physics, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, USA) ; Volume 1: Homogeneous boundary value problems, Fourier methods, and special functions
Physics is expressed in the language of mathematics; it is deeply ingrained in how physics is taught and how it's practiced. A study of the mathematics used in science is thus a sound intellectual investment for training as scientists and engineers. This first volume of two is centered on methods of solving partial differential equations and the special functions introduced. This text is based on a course offered at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) and while produced for NPS needs, it will serve other universities well.
