"This Tutorial Text delivers essential information concerning fiber Bragg gratings to professionals and researchers with an approach based on rules of thumb and practical aspects, enabling quick access to the main principles and techniques, and allowing readers to set up their own laboratory or application. It provides detailed information about how to operate and use these novel sensors, particularly with respect to the required infrastructure, daily operation, and possible applications. After a discussion of the primary concepts, practical aspects regarding the development of a FBG laboratory and how these components are manufactured and used in practical applications are presented. The following chapters outline the operation of Bragg gratings and, for instance, discuss how measurement information can be retrieved (interrogation techniques), calibration methods, and how to prepare and deploy the devices in real monitoring conditions. The final chapters present several successful, real-world applications of the technology"--
