C카vit훮s S찾o Paulo
This richly illustrated monograph explores the city-building aspirations of the Brazilian modern masters through their buildings in S찾o Paulo. Works by Vilanova Artigas, Lina Bo Bardi, Salvador Candia, Rino Levi, Oscar Niemeyer and Paulo Mendes da Rocha were designed in response to the chaotic growth of one of the world's largest metropolises. 'CIVITAS' brings together for the first time a unique collection of nineteen buildings, proposing a fresh take on them through new photographs especially taken for the book and graphic elements re-drawn by the author. Some of the works are today references in the urban public space, underlining the contemporary relevance of this architecture
