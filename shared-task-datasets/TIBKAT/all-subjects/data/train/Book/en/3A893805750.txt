Cuban cultural heritage : a rebel past for a revolutionary nation
Introduction -- Negotiating the past, representing the nation: the contested uses of heritage during the Republic (1898-1959) -- Heritage as passion: the early years of the Cuban Revolution (1959-1973) -- The institutionalization of the Cuban heritage field (1973-1990) -- The reification of ideology as heritage and the return of the nation between 1990 and 2014 -- The office of the city historian of Havana and the nation as heritage after 1990: a path towards reconciliation or towards touristification? -- The coloniality of heritage in postcolonial Cuba
This book shows that understanding Cuba's past and heritage is fundamental to shed light upon its future trajectories. It examines the role that cultural heritage played in the construction of a sense of national identity in post-colonial Cuba, from the Cuban independence from Spain in 1898 up until Cuban-American rapprochement in 2014. The book illustrates how political and ideological shifts have influenced ideas about heritage and how, in turn, heritage has been utilized by different social actors and classes in the reproduction of their status, the spread of new ideologies, and the consolidation of political regimes
