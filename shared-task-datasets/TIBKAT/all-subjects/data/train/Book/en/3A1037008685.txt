Papal power and church-state relations -- The romanized church -- The resurgent church -- The missionary church -- The reformist church -- The progressive church
"This book examines the emergence of progressive Catholicism in Guatemala and the interaction between clerics and indigenous Mayan communities. By the 1920s, the Guatemalan church (whose power was diminished by the anticlerical reforms of the nineteenth century) reemerged as a temporal political force. This revival was fueled by the expansion of papal power, the proliferation of Church-sponsored lay organizations, and immigration."--Provided by publisher
