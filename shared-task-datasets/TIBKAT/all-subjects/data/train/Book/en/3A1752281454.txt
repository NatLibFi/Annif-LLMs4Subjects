Bash command line and shell scripts : pocket primer
"The goal of this book is to introduce readers to an assortment of powerful command-line utilities that can be combined to create simple yet powerful shell scripts. While all examples and scripts use the "bash" command set, many of the concepts translate into other command shells (such as sh, ksh, zsh, and csh), including the concept of piping data between commands, regular expression substitution, and the sed and awk commands. Aimed at a reader relatively new to working in a bash environment, the book is comprehensive enough to be a good reference and teach a few new techniques to those who already have some experience with creating shell scripts. This short book contains a variety of code fragments and shell scripts for data scientists, data analysts, and other people who want shell-based solutions to "clean" various types of text files. In addition, the concepts and code samples in this book are useful for people who want to simplify routine tasks. This book takes introductory concepts and commands in bash and then demonstrates their use in simple yet powerful shell scripts"--
