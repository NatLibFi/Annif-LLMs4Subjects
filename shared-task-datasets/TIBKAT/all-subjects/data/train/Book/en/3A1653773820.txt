Classical Fourier Analysis
The main goal of this text is to present the theoretical foundation of the field of Fourier analysis on Euclidean spaces. It covers classical topics such as interpolation, Fourier series, the Fourier transform, maximal functions, singular integrals, and Littlewood-Paley theory. The primary readership is intended to be graduate students in mathematics with the prerequisite including satisfactory completion of courses in real and complex variables. The coverage of topics and exposition style are designed to leave no gaps in understanding and stimulate further study. This third edition includes new Sections 3.5, 4.4, 4.5 as well as a new chapter on “Weighted Inequalities,” which has been moved from GTM 250, 2nd Edition. Appendices I and B.9 are also new to this edition.  Countless corrections and improvements have been made to the material from the second edition. Additions and improvements include: more examples and applications, new and more relevant hints for the existing exercises, new exercises, and improved references. Reviews from the Second Edition: “The books cover a large amount of mathematics. They are certainly a valuable and useful addition to the existing literature and can serve as textbooks or as reference books. Students will especially appreciate the extensive collection of exercises.” -Andreas Seager, Mathematical Reviews “This book is very interesting and useful. It is not only a good textbook, but also an indispensable and valuable reference for researchers who are working on analysis and partial differential equations. The readers will certainly benefit a lot from the detailed proofs and the numerous exercises.” -Yang Dachun, zbMATH
