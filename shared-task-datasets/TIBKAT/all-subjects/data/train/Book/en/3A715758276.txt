Green buildings pay : design, productivity and ecology
"There is growing recognition that the environmental quality of workplaces has a measurable impact on health, wellbeing and hence productivity. There is also increasing evidence that the environmental design of classrooms enhances learning and that green schools bring wider social and economic benefits beyond that of reduced energy consumption. The third edition of Green Buildings Pay presents new evidence and new arguments concerning the institutional and business case that can be made for green design. Green Buildings Pay examines, through case studies of commercial and educational buildings, how different approaches to green design can produce more sustainable patterns of development.
