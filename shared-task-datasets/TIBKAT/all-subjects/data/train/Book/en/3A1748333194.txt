Broadband microwave amplifiers
"This authoritative resource offers a complete understanding of state-of-the-art and cutting-edge techniques for designing and fabricating broadband microwave amplifiers. The book covers the complete design cycle, detailing each stage in a practical, hands-on manner." "This comprehensive reference illustrates the formulation of small- and large-signal device models to help professionals accurately simulate amplifier performance, and covers all the practical aspects and circuit components used in fabrication. Engineers find design examples of various types of amplifiers that are applicable in broadband systems such as optical communications, satellite communications, spread-spectrum communications, wireless local area networks, electronic warfare, instrumentation, and phased array radar. The book also provides an in-depth treatment of ultra-broadband microwave amplifiers."--Jacket
