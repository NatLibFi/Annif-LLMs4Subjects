Time-Resolved Spectroscopy in Complex Liquids : An Experimental Perspective
Time-Resolved Spectroscopy in Complex Liquidsis intended to introduce the experimental researchers to state-of-the-art techniques in the study of the dynamics of complex liquids. The contributors concentrate on time-resolved optical spectroscopy, which recently produced many relevant results and new information about complex liquids. This is an emerging topic of soft-matter science and this book provides the most up-to-date account of new development.
"Many fundamental aspects of experimental research never appear in standard scientific reports, since writing space is limited in scientific journals. Often a researcher building a new experiment says: ""why they do not tell us this clearly ?"" This book is intended to introduce the experimental researchers, the ""screwdriver scientists"", to state-of-the-art techniques in the study of the dynamics of complex liquids. In Time-Resolved Spectroscopy in Complex Liquids, the contributors concentrate on time-resolved optical spectroscopy, which recently produced many relevant results and new information about complex liquids. This is an emerging topic of soft-matter science, studying the innovative phenomena appearing in molecular liquids when a process of strong intermolecular interaction takes place. In the book, the contributors stress the experimental aspects, even the simple ones. This book succeeds in the full description of the ""experimental procedure"", overcoming the often-ocurring break between ""introduction"" and the ""results discussion""."
