Astrophysics of the Interstellar Medium
The space between the stars includes a large variety of objects, where physical processes occur that are fundamental for the structure and evolution of galaxies. This book gives the reader some basic knowledge of these processes and at the same time, presents estimates of the main quantities relevant to the study of the interstellar medium. The book could be used as an introductory course on the interstellar medium  by science students or by readers interested in astrophysics with an adequate physics and mathematics background
