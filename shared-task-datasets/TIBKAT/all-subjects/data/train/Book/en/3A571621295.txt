Cryptographic engineering
"Cryptographic Engineering covers the theory and practice of engineering of cryptographic systems, including encryption and decryption engines, digital signature and authentication systems, true random number generators, and the design, implementation, testing, and validation of cryptographic systems. This book also addresses cryptanalysis of security systems for the purpose of checking their robustness and their strength against attacks, and building countermeasures in order to thwart such attacks by reducing their probability of success."--BOOK JACKET
