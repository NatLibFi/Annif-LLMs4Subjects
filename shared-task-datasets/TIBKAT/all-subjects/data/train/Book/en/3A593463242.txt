OECD investment policy reviews : Viet Nam 2009 ; policy framework for investment assessment
This publication finds that the progress Vietnam has achieved in less than two decades in putting into place a legal framework and implementing policies that mobilize private investment, including international direct investment, to support economic growth and the prosperity of Vietnam's citizens has been remarkable. Starting from a situation in which the economy was essentially closed to private and international investment, Vietnam is now considered to be one of the very attractive economies in the world for investment.--Publisher's description
