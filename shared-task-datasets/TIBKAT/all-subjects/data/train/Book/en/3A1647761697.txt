Crisis Management in Acute Care Settings : Human Factors and Team Psychology in a High Stakes Enviroment
This book addresses all issues relevant to error prevention and safe practice in the acute and emergency health-care setting. It begins with the basic principles of human behavior and decision making and then partitions into three sections where the individual, the team, and the organizational influences within the health-care system are discussed in greater depth. Case reports and proven strategies help to ground psychological theory in daily practice. This book has emerged from a long-standing cooperation between clinicians and psychologists and blends the strengths of both professions into a readily accessible text.
