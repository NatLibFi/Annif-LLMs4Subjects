The Frontal Sinus
Addressing disease of the frontal sinus successfully remains, perhaps, one of the most technically challenging issues encountered by otolaryngologists. The intricate anatomy, combined with a narrow aperture and relatively acute angle of approach, leads to complexity not encountered elsewhere in surgery of the sinuses. This comprehensive volume with contributions by over 30 of the world's leading rhinologists will help to shed light on this difficult topic. Thorough discussions of anatomy and pathophysiology of a variety of frontal sinus diseases provide a background for in-depth chapters on aspects of both medical and surgical management. A variety of surgical approaches are discussed, including the latest endoscopic techniques, as well as more traditional open and microscopic approaches. Heavily illustrated, this volume will be a "must have" for the rhinologist managing disease in the frontal sinus.
