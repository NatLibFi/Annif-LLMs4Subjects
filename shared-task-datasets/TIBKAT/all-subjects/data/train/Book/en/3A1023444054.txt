The competitive dynamics of entrepreneurial market entry
Research on general market entry usually focuses on large enterprises. Often, however, small entrants can alter the competitive dynamics of an industry. This volume brings together the most prominent thought leaders and the best research on the asymmetric entrant-incumbent dynamics. The ideas presented offer a more nuanced perspective on how, when, where and with what consequences small, single-product firms enter markets that are dominated by large, multiproduct and multimarket incumbents. -- Large enterprises often enjoy a number of advantages that young, small ventures (as well as matured, but still small firms) lack. These differences manifest not only in how large and small firms operate and in their resource-capability mix, but also in how they compete and interact with each other. Research on general market entry and competitive dynamics is extensive yet it focuses on entrants and incumbents that are of similar profile â€“ similar size, comparable asset mixes, related product strategies, and equivalent organizational capabilities. The unique contribution of this volume is its concentration on asymmetric entrant-incumbent dynamics.
