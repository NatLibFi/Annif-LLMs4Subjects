Practical Numerical Algorithms for Chaotic Systems
The goal of this book qre to present an elementary introduction on chaotic systems for the non-specialist, and to present and extensive package of computer algorithms ( in the form of pseudocode) for simulating and characterizing chaotic phenomena. These numerical algorithms have been implemented in a software package called INSITE (Interactive Nonlinear System Investigative Toolkit for Everyone) which is being distributed separately
