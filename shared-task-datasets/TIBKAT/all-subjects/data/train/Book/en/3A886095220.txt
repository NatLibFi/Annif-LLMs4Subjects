Race and work : persistent inequality
"This book provides a reasoned, unflinching analysis of how race and paid work are linked in U.S. society. It offers readers the rich conceptual and empirical foundation needed to understand key issues surrounding both race and work.  Loscocco traces current patterns to their historical roots, showing that the work lives of people from different race and ethnic groups have always been interrelated. Chapters document the U.S.'s multicultural labor history, discuss how labor markets and jobs became segregated, and explain key racial-ethnic patterns in work opportunities. The book also addresses common misconceptions about why women and men from some racial-ethnic groups end up with better jobs than others. It closes with a look at contemporary developments and suggests a future in which race-ethnicity no longer affects work opportunities and experiences.  Race and Work deepens understanding and elevates the discussion of race, racism, and work in an engaging, accessible style. It will be an essential resource for anyone interested in work, race-ethnicity, social inequality, or intersections among race, gender, and class"--
