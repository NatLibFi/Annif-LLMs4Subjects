Remodeling tiny lofts : creating an upper level
"The loft, which is essentially an urban construction, is an ideal way of converting one's own home to a unique space that reflects and extends the personality of those who dwell there. The intention of this book is to demonstrate that not only is it possible, but also that often these compact solutions can stand on their own in comparison with the enormous lofts of London or Manhattan. And even though most of them are small, all of them demonstrate how it is possible to convert what could be a small apartment into a spacious loft. This is achieved by using great care in the design."--Back cover
