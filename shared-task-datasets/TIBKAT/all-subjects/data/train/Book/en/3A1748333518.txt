Design of linear RF outphasing power amplifiers
This is the first book devoted exclusively to the outphasing power amplifier, covering the most recent research results on important aspects in practical design and applications. A compilation of all the proposed outphasing approaches, this is an important resource for engineers designing base station and mobile handset amplifiers, engineering managers and program managers supervising power amplifier designs, and R & D personnel in industry. The work enables you to: design microwave power amplifiers with higher efficiency and improved linearity at a lower cost; understand linearity and performance tradeoffs in microwave power amplifiers; and understand the effect of new modulation techniques on microwave power amplifiers
