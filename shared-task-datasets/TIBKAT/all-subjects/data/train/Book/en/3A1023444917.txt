Creativity and entrepreneurship : changing currents in education and public life
While creativity and entrepreneurship may appear to be unlikely allies, they are increasingly intersecting to produce economic and social value in new and exciting ways. This groundbreaking volume examines how creativity and entrepreneurship can be used in conjunction to foster positive change and innovation, particularly in areas such as higher education and sustainable global development. -- The essays in this volume discuss the ways in which creativity and entrepreneurship challenge and disrupt conventional structures and effect positive transformations in people, institutions, cultures and societies. The contributors hail from a variety of backgrounds – including academia, business, the arts and sciences and public policy – and offer a wealth of interdisciplinary perspectives and new ways of thinking about creative and entrepreneurial processes. In addition to its lucid and comprehensive discussion of current issues in the field, this book also offers insightful education and policy recommendations for developing and fostering future collaboration between creative and entrepreneurial enterprises in both theoretical and practical contexts.
