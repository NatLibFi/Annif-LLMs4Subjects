Splitting methods for partial differential equations with rough solutions : analysis and MATLAB programs
Operator splitting (or the fractional steps method) is a very common tool to analyze nonlinear partial differential equations both numerically and analytically. By applying operator splitting to a complicated model one can often split it into simpler problems that can be analyzed separately. In this book one studies operator splitting for a family of nonlinear evolution equations, including hyperbolic conservation laws and degenerate convection-diffusion equations. Common for these equations is the prevalence of rough, or non-smooth, solutions, e.g., shocks
