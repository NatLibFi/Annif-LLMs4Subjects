Representation Theory and Complex Geometry
The book is largely self-contained...There is a nice introduction to symplectic geometry and a charming exposition of equivariant K-theory. Both are enlivened by examples related to groups...An attractive feature is the attempt to convey some informal âwisdomâ rather than only the precise definitions. As a number of results [are] due to the authors, one finds some of the original excitement. This is the only available introduction to geometric representation theory...it has already proved successful in introducing a new generation to the subject.
