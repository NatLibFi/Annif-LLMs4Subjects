Wireless sensor networks : deployments and design frameworks
Annotation, Wireless Sensor Networks: Deployments and Design Frameworks takes a practical, experience driven view of wireless embedded networked sensing systems, providing a comprehensive discussion of design and deployment problems and guidance for future development. The book: -Reviews the state of the art with respect to practical WSNs and their adoption -Presents seven notable real-life WSN design/deployment case studies -Provides informed, systematic support towards new application design and implementation -Synthesizes strategies for design and deployment suitable for both academia and industry -Highlights key issues and trade-offs in the WSN design space Wireless Sensor Networks: Deployments and Design Frameworks will help the practitioner approach the design of WSN-oriented application systems from an informed standpoint. To be successful in development and deployment of WSNs, it is important to build upon the past achievements and experiences of others, and to follow examples of good design; this book enables both
