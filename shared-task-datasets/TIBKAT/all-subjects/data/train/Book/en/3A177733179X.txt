"This innovative and original book explores the relationship between blockchain and antitrust, highlighting the mutual benefits that stem from cooperation between the two and providing a unique perspective on how law and technology could cooperate. Delivering a legal, economic, and technical analysis of antitrust and blockchain, Thibault Schrepel provides a well-rounded examination of their mutual flaws and the limitations that occur when they ignore each other. He explores the anticompetitive practices that may arise in the field as well as covering enforcement issues before showcasing the potential of blockchain and antitrust to complement one another. He offers different ways of creating effective regulations and enforcement mechanisms for the purpose of benefiting their common interests. Covering key topics such as decentralization, blockchain evolution, and the objectives of competition law, this book will be of particular interest to academics and students researching at the intersection of law and technology. It will also be useful for legal practitioners interested in blockchain, as well as antitrust agencies and policy-makers"--
