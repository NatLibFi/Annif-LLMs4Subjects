Introduction to graphene-based nanomaterials : from electronic structure to quantum transport
"Graphene is one of the most intensively studied materials, and has unusual electrical, mechanical and thermal properties, which provide almost unlimited potential applications. This book provides an introduction to the electrical and transport properties of graphene and other two dimensional nanomaterials, covering ab-initio to multiscale methods. Updated from the first edition, the authors have added chapters on other two dimensional materials, spin related phenomena, and an improved overview of Berry phase effects. Other topics include powerful order N electronic structure, transport calculations, ac transport and multiscale transport methodologies. Chapters are complemented with concrete examples and case studies, questions and exercises, detailed appendices and computational codes. It is a valuable resource for graduate students and researchers working in physics, materials science of engineering who are interested in the field of graphene-based nanomaterials"--
