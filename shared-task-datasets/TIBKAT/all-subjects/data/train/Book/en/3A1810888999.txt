Process operations : lessons learned in a nontechnical language
"Geared to young and seasoned professionals alike, "Process Operations: Lessons Learned in Nontechnical Language" is designed to present a straightforward approach to mastering the principles and concepts all process engineers should be able to apply without the need of a computer. While simulations and models are useful for examining long-term operational issues, they cannot replace the dimension of human logic and reason required when tackling the array of complex-and sometimes life-threatening-situations that occur in process plants. Using experiences from my more than 57-year career in the process industry, "Process Operations: Lessons Learned in a Nontechnical Language" provides approaches to understanding core process concepts in ways that will equip the engineer to walk out of an office into a plant and directly resolve process deficiencies via small operational changes or simple retrofits"--
