Passive macromodeling : theory and applications
"In the first comprehensive treatment of passive macromodeling on the market, macromodeling experts Stefano Grivet-Talocia and Bjorn Gustavsen address the complex subject with examples of effective, proven methods. Finally, students and researchers may turn to a text that tends to the theoretical background essential to comprehending the algorithms' advantages and disadvantages. With the latest information on black-box passive macromodeling and software implementation, this book is a foolproof guide to both the basics and complexities of passive macromodeling"--
"This book offers coverage of developments in linear macromodeling, with a focus on effective, proven methods. After starting with a definition of the fundamental properties that must characterize models of physical systems, the authors discuss several prominent passive macromodeling algorithms for lumped and distributed systems and compare them under accuracy, efficiency, and robustness standpoints. The book includes chapters with standard background material (such as linear time-invariant circuits and systems, basic discretization of field equations, state-space systems), as well as appendices collecting basic facts from linear algebra, optimization templates, and signals and transforms. The text also covers more technical and advanced topics, intended for the specialist, which may be skipped at first reading"--
