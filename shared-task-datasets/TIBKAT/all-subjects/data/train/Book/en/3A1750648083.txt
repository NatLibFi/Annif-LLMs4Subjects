Postcolonial theory and organizational analysis: a critical engagement
This book takes up a question that has rarely been raised in the field of management: 'Could modern Western colonialism have important implications for the practices and theories that inform management and organizations?' Employing the frameworks of postcolonial theory, an international group of scholars addresse this question, and offer remarkable insights about the implications of the colonial encounter for management. Wide-ranging in scope, the book covers major topics like cross-cultural management, control and resistance, corporate culture, the discourse of exoticization in museums and tourism, and stakeholder issues, and sheds new light on the troubling legacy of colonialism. Scholars and practitioners searching for a new idiom of management will find this book's critique of contemporary management invaluable.
