Strong Asymptotics for Extremal Polynomials Associated with Weights on ‚Ñù
0. The results are consequences of a strengthened form of the following assertion: Given 0 <p1. Auxiliary results include inequalities for weighted polynomials, and zeros of extremal polynomials. The monograph is fairly self-contained, with proofs involving elementary complex analysis, and the theory of orthogonal and extremal polynomials. It should be of interest to research workers in approximation theory and orthogonal polynomials
