Labor and Value : Rethinking Marx's Theory of Exploitation
In this book Ernesto Screpanti provides a rigorous examination of Marx's theory of exploitation, one of the cornerstones of Marxist thought. With precision and clarity, he identifies the holes in traditional readings of Marx's theory before advancing his own original interpretation, drawing on contemporary philosophy and economic theory to provide a refreshingly interdisciplinary exegesis.
