The fiber optic essentials
Fiber Optic Essentials starts with a basic discussion on lightwaves and the phenomenon of refraction and reflection. It then goes on to introduces the reader to the field of fiber optics and covers some of the recent developments, such as fiber amplifiers, dispersion compensation and nonlinear effects. A number of other applications are also presented. Examples and comparison with everyday experience are provided wherever possible to help the reader's comprehension. Diagrams are also included to aid in the visualization of certain concepts.
