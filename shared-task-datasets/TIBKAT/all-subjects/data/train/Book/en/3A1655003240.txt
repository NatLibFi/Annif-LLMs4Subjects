EnvironmentalStats for S-Plus® : User’s Manual for Version 2.0
EnvironmentalStats for S-PLUS is an add-on module to S-PLUS and the first comprehensive software package for environmental scientists, engineers, and regulators. EnvironmentalStats for S-PLUS provides a set of powerful yet simple-to-use pull-down menus and functions for performing graphical and statistical analyses of environmental data, parameter and quantile estimation, methods for dealing with non-detects, power and sample size calculations, prediction and tolerance intervals, and probabilistic risk assessment. EnvironmentalStats for S-PLUS includes an extensive hypertext help system that explains methods from the environmental literature and regulatory guidance documents, along with a glossary of commonly used statistical and environmental terms. This new edition of the User's Manual provides the documentation for Version 2.0 (which runs under S-PLUS 6.0), and includes extensive examples using data sets from regulatory guidance documents. All examples show how to produce the results by using the new pull-down menus or by calling functions from the command line
