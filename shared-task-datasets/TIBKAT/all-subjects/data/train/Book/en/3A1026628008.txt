Labour mobilization, politics and globalization in Brazil : between militancy and moderation
This book analyses the conflicts that emerged from the Brazilian labour movement's active participation in a rapidly changing political environment, particularly in the context of the coming to power of a party with strong roots in the labour movement. While the close relations with the Workers' Party (PT) have shaped the labour movement's political agenda, its trajectory cannot be understood solely with reference to that partyâ€™s electoral fortunes. Through a study of the political trajectory of the Brazilian labour movement over the last three decades, the author explores the conditions under which the labour movement has developed militant and moderate strategies.
