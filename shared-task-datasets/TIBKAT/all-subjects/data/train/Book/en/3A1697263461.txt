Planning wild cities : human-nature relationships in the urban age
"For urban and environmental planners seeking to support sustainability-led change charting the task ahead remains complex, turbulent and unclear. Is it possible for planning to better serve, protect and nurture our human and non-human worlds? Many have serious doubts about the prospects for planning but there is a real opportunity for planning to better engage with how real places and spaces are produced and change. This book critically engages with the contemporary challenges of planning wild cities in a climate of change. Drawing on the international literature and case-study examples from the developed and developing country contexts, key issues around urban (in)security, critical infrastructure and the rights to the city for both humans and nature are highlighted.
