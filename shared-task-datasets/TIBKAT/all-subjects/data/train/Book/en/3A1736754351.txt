Electro-oxidation : principles, materials and applications
"Electro-Oxidation: Principles, Materials and Applications provides an overview of the most relevant literature and novel research in nanostructured Pt-based electrocatalysts for low-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells directly fed by C2-C4 alcohols. An overview of different voltammetric sensors based on the electro-oxidation of clinically important compounds is provided, and the applications of voltammetry extended from single to multi-component determination are discussed. Additionally, a brief review is provided regarding the main results and conclusions obtained and published by the authors' research groups in recent years related to the preparation and characterization of different types of electrocatalysts using aBCs as catalyst support"--
