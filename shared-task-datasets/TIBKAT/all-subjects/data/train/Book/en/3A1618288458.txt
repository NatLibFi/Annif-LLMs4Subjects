Neuroadaptive systems : theory and applications
"With contributions from international professionals and researchers, this book is one of the first texts to address the emerging field of Neuroadaptive Systems and presents the state of the art developments in the field. It discusses neuroscience and human factors, as well as brain activity measurement. Topics covered include operator functional state (OFS) and neuroadaptive systems; psychological constructs versus neuronal mechanisms; object recognition versus object-directed grasping; mental fatigue, sleeplessness, and neural mechanisms of control; and attentional network and error related negativity associated with sleep deprivation"--
