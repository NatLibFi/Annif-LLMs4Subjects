This book focuses on the structure and sociolinguistics of Nigerian Pidgin English. Its major aim is to serve as a compendium which touches different major aspects of NPE as it has been observed that earlier works in this area have focused only on one aspect or the other. It will offer a broad survey of the form and functions of Nigerian Pidgin (NP) in different domains. The book promises to investigate the use of NP in such domains as popular culture, advertisement, social media and online discussion fora. One major strong point of this volume is the fact that it will direct attention to different fertile areas of NP by focusing, inter alia, on its social functions, its morphology and syntax, its regional varieties, its (possible) use as a viable medium of instruction in school, the changing attitudes of people towards its use, the place of NP in relation to language planning and policy in Nigeria as well as sociolinguistic variation within NP. The book will make a significant contribution to the existing literature on NP as, unlike earlier studies in this area, it will explore the grammatical, sociolinguistic and perceptual aspects of the language. By bringing together the expertise of renowned Nigerian and international scholars who have conducted research in this area, the volume will be an essential resource for researchers, graduate and undergraduate students interested not only in Nigerian Pidgin but also on contact linguistics
