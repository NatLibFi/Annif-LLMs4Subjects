Globalizing education : policies, pedagogies, & politics
Because <globalization> is expressed in many ways and evokes complex responses, it demands various lines of analysis. Globalizing Education shows how this phenomenon is mediated and mitigated by a range of educational policies, pedagogies, and politics. It identifies the forms of educational governance associated with neoliberal globalism and their manifold effects on nation-state education systems, highlighting the colonizing minority-world imperatives and retraditionalizing ramifications. It also shows how the global cultural economy - the disjunctive flows of images, people, and ideas - both challenges and reinforces conventional educational trajectories. The global/national mesh-works created by drugs, technology, and unions are among the complicated connectivities explored. This book exposes the more pernicious effects on education of neo-liberal and corporate globalization and explores and identifies innovative and transformative educational policies, pedagogies, and politics
