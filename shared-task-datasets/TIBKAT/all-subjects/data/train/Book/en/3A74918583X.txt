Impulsive Control Theory
This book presents a unified theoretical framework of some recent developments on the impulsive control theory and its applications to engineering problems. Different structures of impulsive control systems and impulsive control strategies are presented. The following theoretical aspects are also addressed: basic knowledge of impulsive differential equations; controllability and stability of linear impulsive control systems; stability of nonlinear impulsive control systems including: practical stability, global stability, absolute stability, stability in terms of two measures; and optimal impulsive control. This book presents also some engineering applications of impulsive control theory. The readers of this book are scientists, engineers, researchers and graduate students interested in impulsive control, nonlinear control systems, chaotic communications systems and nano-electronics
