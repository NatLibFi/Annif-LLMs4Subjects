This book outlines a vast array of techniques and methods regarding model categories, without focussing on the intricacies of the proofs. Quillen model categories are a fundamental tool for the understanding of homotopy theory. While many introductions to model categories fall back on the same handful of canonical examples, the present book highlights a large, self-contained collection of other examples which appear throughout the literature. In particular, it collects a highly scattered literature into a single volume. The book is aimed at anyone who uses, or is interested in using, model categories to study homotopy theory. It is written in such a way that it can be used as a reference guide for those who are already experts in the field. However, it can also be used as an introduction to the theory for novices.
