Implantable bone conduction hearing aids
Three decades after the introduction of the first bone-anchored hearing aids, the available systems have improved significantly and the field is expanding faster than ever. New technologies such as digital signal processing have opened new avenues unique to bone conduction hearing aids. Better insights into the physiology of bone-conducted hearing have not only changed the field but also provided ideas for new areas of application.In this volume of Advances in Oto-Rhino-Laryngology, renowned researchers and experienced clinicians from all over the world present the latest findings and practices. Reviews on the theoretical background of bone conduction hearing, presentation of currently available hearing aid systems, chapters on monaural and binaural hearing with implantable bone conduction hearing aids, a comparison with conventional hearing aids and a glimpse into the future of implantable bone conduction hearing aids render this volume an invaluable reference book to ENT surgeons, audiologists, hearing aid acousticians and researchers alike
