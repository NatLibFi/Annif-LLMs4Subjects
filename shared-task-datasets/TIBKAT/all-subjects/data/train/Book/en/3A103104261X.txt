Introduction to photon science and technology
"This book provides a sound and up-to-date description of the theory and applications of photon science. It starts by discussing the foundations and fundamental development of theory before introducing concepts such as optical angular momentum, quantum entanglement, and vacuum fluctuations. Applications such as photodetection, spectroscopy, and elementary particle physics are addressed, as well as optical communications, optical fabrication and manipulation, nonlinear optics, quantum information and computing, imaging, energy harvesting, and lighting. The book concludes with a brief perspective on the future of photonics. Although all of the key equations are included, substantial theory is delivered with a light touch, and the text is copiously illustrated with color figures"--
