Architecture ? a discipline dominated by materials Materials and their finishes lend buildings and interiors their distinctive characters. Yet, which criteria persuade architects to use or not use a particular material? How do they find the right one among a seamlessly endless array of materials? Today, material selection is usually kept completely separate from local conditions and traditions and is rarely restricted by design requirements.00This volume, part of the ?Best of Detail? series, provides guidance while presenting different approaches of renowned architecture firms in how they select materials. It also provides an insight into material research and technological innovations that are perfect for experimentation. Last but not least, several completed architectural projects from Detail publications from the past four years offer abundant inspiration for the reader?s own work
