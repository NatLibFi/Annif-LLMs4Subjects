Beginning R 4 : from beginner to pro
Learn how to use R 4, write and save R scripts, read in and write out data files, use built-in functions, and understand common statistical methods. This in-depth tutorial includes key R 4 features including a new color palette for charts, an enhanced reference counting system (useful for big data), and new data import settings for text (as well as the statistical methods to model text-based, categorical data). Each chapter starts with a list of learning outcomes and concludes with a summary of any R functions introduced in that chapter, along with exercises to test your new knowledge. The text opens with a hands-on installation of R and CRAN packages for both Windows and macOS. The bulk of the book is an introduction to statistical methods (non-proof-based, applied statistics) that relies heavily on R (and R visualizations) to understand, motivate, and conduct statistical tests and modeling. Beginning R 4 shows the use of R in specific cases such as ANOVA analysis, multiple and moderated regression, data visualization, hypothesis testing, and more. It takes a hands-on, example-based approach incorporating best practices with clear explanations of the statistics being done. You will: Acquire and install R and RStudio Import and export data from multiple file formats Analyze data and generate graphics (including confidence intervals) Interactively conduct hypothesis testing Code multiple and moderated regression solutions.
