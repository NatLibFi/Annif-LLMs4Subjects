Big data systems : a 360-degree-approach
"Big Data Systems encompass massive challenges related to data diversity, storage mechanisms, and requirements of massive computational power. Further, capabilities of big data systems also vary with respect to type of problems. For instance, distributed memory systems are not recommended for iterative algorithms. Similarly, variations in big data systems also exist related to consistency and fault tolerance. The purpose of this book is to provide a detailed explanation of big data systems. The book covers various topics including Networking, Security, Privacy, Storage, Computation, Cloud Computing, NoSQL and NewSQL systems, High Performance Computing, and Deep Learning. An illustrative and practical approach has been adopted in which theoretical topics have been aided by well-explained programming and illustrative examples"--
