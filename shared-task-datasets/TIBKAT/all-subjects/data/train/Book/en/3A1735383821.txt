A systematic approach to personal support plans
"A personal support plan provides a system of supports that is tailored to the strengths and needs of the individual and facilitates the attainment of their personal goals and the enhancement of their well-being. A personal support plan follows that assessment of the individual's support needs and the intensity of those needs, as with the Supports Intensity Scale--Adult Version (SIS-A) and the Supports Intensity Scale-Children's Version (SIS-C). This guide describes in detail the steps involved in the systematic approach to the development of personal support plans."--Cover
