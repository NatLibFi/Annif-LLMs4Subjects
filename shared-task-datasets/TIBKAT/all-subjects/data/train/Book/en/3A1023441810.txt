Handbook of water economics
Water scarcity, whether in the quality or quantity dimension, afflicts most countries. Decisions on water management and allocation over time, space, and among uses and users involve economic considerations. This Handbook assembles research that represents recent thinking and applications in water economics. The book chapters are written by leading scholars in the field who address issues related to its use, management, and value. The topics cover analytical methods, sectoral and intersectoral water issues, and issues associated with different sources of water. -- ‘The Handbook of Water Economics provides a comprehensive treatment of the​ economics of water. Compiling contributions from over 40 water economists, the​ book encompasses a breadth of topics ranging from theoretical frameworks to​ methods, and from traditional problems to emerging challenges. Accessible to​ graduate students, researchers, and professionals, the book offers a broad​ overview​ of water-related issues, and covers essential material for developing a solid understanding​ of the role economics plays in driving water use, informing policy and​ ​designing long-term solutions.’ (Cloe Garnache, Water Economics and Policy).
