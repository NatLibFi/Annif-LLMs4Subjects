The ESD control program handbook
"An essential guide providing engineers involved with electronics production with the understanding and practical skills needed to develop and maintain an effective ESD control program for manufacturing, storage, and handling of ESD sensitive components. Every company that handles ESD susceptible components such as semiconductor devices needs an understanding of ESD control in order to avoid ESD damage in their processes. Despite this, there are very few books available on the subject and much of the currently available literature is not aligned with current practices and the ESD program standards IEC 61340-5-1 and ESD S20:20. Because within the industry, people often move into a position of responsibility for ESD control from different backgrounds with a minimal knowledge of the subject, The ESD Control Program Handbook explains the principles and practice of ESD control in an easily accessible way whilst also providing more depth and a wealth of references for those who want to gain a deeper knowledge of the subject. It covers the scientific basis of ESD, an overview of ESD susceptible components, principles of ESD control, development of an ESD control program, ESD training and how to do the most commonly used ESD related measurements. Key features : Gives the reader a sound understanding of the subject to analyse the ESD control requirements of their manufacturing processes, and develop an effective ESD control program. As well as dispensing the practical knowledge, it also contains enough theory and background for readers to understand the principles of ESD control"--
