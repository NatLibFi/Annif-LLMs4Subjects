Differentiated resourceful utilization of rural organic wastes
This book systematically introduces the key technologies for differentiated resourceful utilization of rural organic wastes based on high-efficiency anaerobic fermentation and bio-augmented composting, and discusses differentiating sources of organic wastes, integrating recycling technologies, developing key equipment, and researching management mechanisms. In addition, it describes the development of viable techniques and low-pollution, low-cost, and low-maintenance equipment. It also includes the technical specifications for the differentiated resourceful utilization of rural organic wastes and presents the energy-fertilizer integrated resourceful utilization method for rural organic wastes. Providing technological insights into improving the resourceful utilization level of rural organic wastes, this book is a valuable reference resource for administrative staff, researchers in the field of environmental protection, and technicians in enterprises involved in the treatment and disposal of solid wastes.
