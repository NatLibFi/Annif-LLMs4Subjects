Towards the third generation university : managing the university in transition
pt. 1. Towards the third generation university -- pt. 2. Know-how creation and exploitation -- pt. 3. Organising the third generation university
Universities are undergoing massive change, evolving from science-based, government-funded institutions into 'international know-how hubs' dubbed third generation universities, or 3GUs. J.G. Wissema explores this dramatic change, tracing the historic development of universities, and exploring the technology-based enterprises, technostarters and financiers for start-ups and young enterprises that are the main partners of these 3GUs. He goes on to illustrate that universities play a new role as incubators of new science or technology based commercial activities and take an active role in the exploitation of the knowledge they create. The book concludes with suggestions regarding the way in which changes in the university's mission should be reflected in subsequent organisational changes
