Physical kinetics : classical and quantum problems and solutions
This book includes problems based on the material in the course of physical kinetics for the students of general and applied physics. It contains 60 problems with detailed solutions. The comments to the problems reflect the connection with the problems and methods of modern physical kinetics. A brief introduction gives the necessary information for solving and understanding the problems. The book is proposed for students and postgraduates studying the theoretical physics. The book is used as a supplement to the textbooks published on physical kinetics. The purpose of the book is to help students in training the practical skills and mastering the basic elements of physical kinetics. To understand the subject matter, it is sufficient to know the traditional courses of theoretical physics.
