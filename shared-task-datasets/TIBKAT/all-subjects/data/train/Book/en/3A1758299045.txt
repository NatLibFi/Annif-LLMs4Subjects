Elfriede Jelinek : Provokationen der Kunst
"Alongside her image as a social troublemaker, Elfriede Jelinek uses her works to provoke in myriad ways her ownmost field--art and the doxa that applies in the literary field. The contributions in this volume analyze the power of the Nobel Prize winner's aesthetic provocation, from her first novel to her most recent theater texts, making a new contribution to research on literary provocation in contemporary literature."--Publisher's website
