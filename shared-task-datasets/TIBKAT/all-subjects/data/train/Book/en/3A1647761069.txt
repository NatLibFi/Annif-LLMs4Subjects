Handbook of Pediatric Cardiovascular Drugs
Provides the health care practitioner with general clinical and practical guidelines regarding the use of pediatric cardiovascular drugs. This book reviews basic pediatric cardiovascular principles and compiles information required to assist practitioners involved in the care of pediatric patients with heart disease in their day-to-day practice
This handbook of drugs used in pediatric cardiac care will satisfy the need for a quick reference source of common drug therapy. There are no major texts available in the field of pediatric cardiology that exclusively provide therapeutic drug information. Several sources are available that present drug information for cardiology, but these place no emphasis on pediatric care and are written for general cardiac specialists.
