Entropy beyond the second law : thermodynamics and statistical mechanics for equilibrium, non-equilibrium, classical, and quantum systems
Entropy Beyond the Second Law presents a coherent formulation of all aspects of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics with entropy as the unifying theme. This includes formulating equilibrium theory and explaining the role of the Second Law in establishing the equilibrium state. It also establishes the foundations of non-equilibrium theory by generalizing the concept of entropy in an appropriate way. Finally, it addresses the relationship between classical and quantum statistical mechanics by invoking the collapse of the wave function into entropy states. A secondary purpose is to increase the understanding of entropy and the Second Law, and to correct misapprehensions and errors that have arisen over the years.
