Information systems and healthcare enterprises
"The United States' healthcare industry consumes roughly 20% of the gross national product per year. This huge expenditure not only represents a large portion of the country's collective interests, but also an enormous amount of medical information. This book examines the special issues related to the collection, disbursement, and integration of various data within the healthcare system."--Provided by publisher
