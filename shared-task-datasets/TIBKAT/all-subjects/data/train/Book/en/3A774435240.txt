Culture - theory - disability : encounters between disability studies and cultural studies
Which theoretical and methodological approaches of contemporary cultural criticism resonate within the field of disability studies? What can cultural studies gain by incorporating disability more fully into its toolbox for critical analysis? Culture - Theory - Disability features contributions by leading international cultural disability studies scholars which are complemented with a diverse range of responses from across the humanities spectrum. This essential volume encourages the problematization of disability in connection with critical theories of literary and cultural representation, aesthetics, politics, science and technology, sociology, and philosophy
What does Disability Studies gain by opening itself up to the larger field of Cultural Studies, and which theoretical frameworks of contemporary cultural criticism can it employ to rethink disability? At the same time, what can Cultural Studies gain by incorporating disability more fully as an object of inquiry and as a framework for critical analysis? This collection of essays enriches the thriving discourse of Cultural Disability Studies. In order to contour the various >>contact zones<< between the two fields, the volume works transdisciplinarily, drawing on fields such as sociology, literary studies, art history and philosophy.
