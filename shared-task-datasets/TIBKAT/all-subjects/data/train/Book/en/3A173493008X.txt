Methods of Fundamental Solutions in Solid Mechanics
Methods of Fundamental Solutions in Solid Mechanics presents the fundamentals of continuum mechanics, the foundational concepts of the MFS, and methodologies and applications to various engineering problems. Eight chapters give an overview of meshless methods, the mechanics of solids and structures, the basics of fundamental solutions and radical basis functions, meshless analysis for thin beam bending, thin plate bending, two-dimensional elastic, plane piezoelectric problems, and heat transfer in heterogeneous media. The book presents a working knowledge of the MFS that is aimed at solving real-world engineering problems through an understanding of the physical and mathematical characteristics of the MFS and its applications. Explains foundational concepts for the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) for the advanced numerical analysis of solid mechanics and heat transfer Extends the application of the MFS for use with complex problems Considers the majority of engineering problems, including beam bending, plate bending, elasticity, piezoelectricity and heat transfer Gives detailed solution procedures for engineering problems Offers a practical guide, complete with engineering examples, for the application of the MFS to real-world physical and engineering challenges
