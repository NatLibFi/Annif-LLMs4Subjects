Paris Kanonen - the Paris guns (Wilhelmgesch√ºtze) and Project HARP : the application of major calibre guns to atmospheric and space research
Klappentext: During the preparation of a work material covering Project HARP, or High Altitude Research Programme - that was the development of large calibre guns to the upper atmosphere and space, the authors wanted to trace any appropriate background material relating to the development of large calibre artillery. It was during this information gathering that the manuscript and files of Fritz Rausenberger were found that concentrated on the development of the Heavy German Guns that fired on Paris at ranges up to 127 kilometers in March 1918.
