Mechanochemistry and emerging technologies for sustainable chemical manufacturing
"This unique volume describes advances in the field of mechanochemistry, in particular the scaling up of mechanochemical processes. Scalable techniques employed to carry out solvent-free synthesis are evaluated. Comparability to continuous flow chemistry, the current industrial benchmark for continuous efficient chemical synthesis, is presented. The book concludes that mechanochemical synthesis can be scaled up into a continuous, sustainable process. It demonstrates that large scale mechanochemistry can meet industrial demands especially in the pharmaceutical industry. The case studies conducted on MOF Technologies and Deasyl demonstrate how mechanochemistry is employed on a pilot plant scale"--
