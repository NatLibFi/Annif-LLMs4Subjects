An introduction to biomaterials
"The second edition of this popular text includes seven new chapters that provide a comprehensive and up-to-date educational framework for biomaterials education. A new chapter on the biology of wound healing sets the stage for the basic requirements of standardized biomaterials testing and explains the reactions between biomaterials and the living system into which it is implanted. The book explains <EM>in vitro</EM> and <EM>in vivo</EM> testing paradigms and provides numerous examples in the chapters on experimental design, laboratory assays, and animal models. Emphasizing the importance of the regulatory process, it describes how innovation in the biomaterials process relates to patentability and inventorship"--
