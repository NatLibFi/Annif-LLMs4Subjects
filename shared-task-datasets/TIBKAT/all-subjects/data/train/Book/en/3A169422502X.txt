Advances in carbon management technologies / editors: Subhas K. Sikdar (Retired, Cincinnati, OH, USA, formerly Associate Director for Science, National Risk Management Research Laboratory, US Environmental Protection Agency, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA), Frank Princiotta (Retired, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA, formerly Director, Air Pollutant Prevention and Control Division, National Risk Management Research Laboratory, US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) ; Volume 1: Carbon removal, renewable and nuclear energy
"UN climate models predict global average temperature increases due to cumulative rise of atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions. This will have serious implications on life on Earth. Scientists have been engaged in research for reducing such emissions from current technologies as well as for developing low carbon and carbon neutral energy technologies. This book was motivated by the desire to compile recent advances in carbon management to examine promises and limitations of emissions measurements, energy efficiencies, carbon capture and sequestration, biomass waste utilization, electric power generation, energy storage, and carbon neutral power from nuclear, hydro, solar and wind"--
