Soil remediation and plants : prospects and challenges
"Soil Remediation and Plants: Prospects and Challenges addresses fundamental concepts as well as modern research approaches, from the basis of metal contamination in soil to the mechanisms by which plants uptake, translocate and remediate contamination. Chapters include approaches for strengthening phytoremediation (using plants to remediate soil pollutants), as well as coverage of the various heavy metals and different plant types that can be used for remediation."--
