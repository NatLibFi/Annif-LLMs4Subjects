Delta-sigma A/D-converters : practical design for communication systems
The emphasis of this book is on practical design aspects for broadband analog-to-digital converters for communications. The embedded designs are employed for transceivers in the field of Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) solutions and Wireless Local-Area Network (WLAN) applications. An area- and power-efficient realization of a converter is mandatory to remain competitive in the market. The right choice for the converter topology and architecture needs to be done very carefully to result in an attractive figure-of-merit (FOM). The book begins with a brief overview of basic concepts about ADSL and WLAN to understand the requirements on Analog-to-Digital (A/D) converters. --
