Picturing Wright : an album from Frank Lloyd Wright's photographer
A revised and expanded edition of this intimate photographic chronicle the world of Frank Lloyd Wright by his official photographer Pedro E. Guerrero. When twenty-two-year-old Pedro Guerrero took his short portfolio to Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin West in 1939, he didn't know that he was about to start his long career by being Wright's official photographer for the next twenty years. Picturing Wright draws together 175 of Guerrero's photographs of the master architect, his homes, and his legendary workshops, including rarely seen color photographs published for the first time. The result is a moving, personal album that will delight everyone who is entranced by Wright and his work. Now back in print with several dozen images unseen in the original edition, this book comes alive with Guerrero's illuminating, often humorous stories, augmented in this edition by his widow, Dixie Guerrero. Picturing Wright remains one of the most thoroughgoing visual profiles of a man who meticulously crafted and managed his public persona, but seen here in numerous unguarded moments. The value of Guerrero's rare access extended to Wright's late works; some of the photos are the only ones documenting projects on completion, before changes made by subsequent owners
