This tutorial fully explains cathode ray tube (CRT) based displays in a single, easy-to-understand narrative. Detailed explanations and insights into performance properties and safety limits of the various glass melts follow a discussion of the fundamentals. In addition, other topics covered include the architectural differences between color and monochrome, the cathode (electron beam source) as a failure mode for all CRTs, types of cathodes available and their life expectancy. Phosphors, the metrics involved in defining a pixel and how distortions can influence the net results, defining CRT compliance with the DICOM Grayscale Standard Display Function (GSDF), test patterns and how they provide information about display performance, and video cards round out this informative work
