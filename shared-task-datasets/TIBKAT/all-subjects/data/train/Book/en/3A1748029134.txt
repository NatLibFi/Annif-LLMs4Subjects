Digital decarbonization : achieving climate targets with a technology-neutral approach
Decarbonization through optimized energy flows. In this book you will learn how a significant reduction in climate changing greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved through systemic optimization of our energy systems. The authors clearly demonstrate how energy-intensive processes can be optimized flexibly by using technology-neutral simulation methods to ensure that significantly fewer greenhouse gases are emitted. Such field-tested, data-based energy models described in this publication prove that "digital decarbonization" enables an economy that releases significantly fewer climate changing emissions while maintaining its production output. This is a promising message in view of ongoing climate change. Contents Fields of action and technology for a decarbonized economy Technology-neutral approach through data-based optimization Use cases to reduce climate changing greenhouse gas emissions Target Groups The publication is addressed to readers who are interested in the decarbonization of the economy and the effective transformation towards a low-emission energy system.
