Dynamics: Numerical Explorations : Accompanying Computer Program Dynamics
The handbook Dynamics: Numerical Explorations describes how to use the program, Dynamics, to investigate dynamical systems. Co-author J.A. Yorke, while working with the Maryland Chaos Group, developed an array of tools to help visualize the properties of dynamical systems. Yorke found it useful to combine these various basic tools with each other into a single package. The resulting program is Dynamics which requires either a Unix workstation running X11 graphics or an IBM PC compatible computer. The program together with the manual Dynamics: Numerical Explorations provides an introduction to and an overview of fundamental, sophisticated tools and numerical methods together with many simple examples. All numerical methods described in this handbook are implemented in the program Dynamics. Some of the program's capabilities are: iterating maps and solving differential equations; plotting trajectories; featuring an array of simple commands; printing a created picture in resolution higher than that of the screen
