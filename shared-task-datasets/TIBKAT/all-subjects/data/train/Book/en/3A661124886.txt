Numerical analysis of partial differential equations
"This book provides a comprehensive and self-contained treatment of the numerical methods used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), as well as both the error and efficiency of the presented methods. Featuring a large selection of theoretical examples and exercises, the book presents the main discretization techniques for PDEs, introduces advanced solution techniques, and discusses important nonlinear problems in many fields of science and engineering. It is designed as an applied mathematics text for advanced undergraduate and/or first-year graduate level courses on numerical PDEs"--
