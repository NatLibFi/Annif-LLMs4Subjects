Human factors in the built environment
"Human Factors in the Built Environment is a comprehensive and up-to-date resource that integrates the relationship of the human body and space planning to the design process for designers involved with the physical planning and detailing of interiors. Key topics include proxemics, anthropometrics, ergonomics, sensory components, diversity, global concerns, health and safety, environmental considerations, special populations and universal (inclusive) design. The text broadly covers space planning applications and the relationship of human factors to the design process for commercial and residential spaces from programming to post-occupancy evaluation. Nussbaumer addresses barrier-free design for new construction and retrofitting issues, and various contract design types such as offices, hospitality, and healthcare design. A global approach throughout includes U.S. imperial and metric systems of measurement."--Publisher's website
