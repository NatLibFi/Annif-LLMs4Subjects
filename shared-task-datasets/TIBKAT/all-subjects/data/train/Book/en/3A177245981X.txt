Applied smart health care informatics : a computational intelligence perspective
"Health care informatics aka medical informatics refers to application of information engineering and management to the field of health care covering essentially the management and use of patient health care information. By means of a multidisciplinary approach, it uses health information technology for the purpose of improving health care by resorting to newer and higher quality opportunities. As per the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) health informatics is defined as "an interdisciplinary study of the design, development, adoption and application of IT-based innovations in health care services delivery, management and planning. Essentially, it effects the optimization of the acquisition, storage, retrieval, and use of information in health and bio-medicine. Intelligent health care informatics augments the purview of the existing health care amenities by enveloping intelligent technologies to the information engineering aspects. Intelligent analysis of the information therein enhances the overall management as far as usage of resources is concerned"--
