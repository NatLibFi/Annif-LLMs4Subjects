Climatology in cold regions
"This volume systematically covers fundamental aspects and current challenges of climatology in cold regions, including cloud, wind, precipitation, radiation, and snow. It focuses on the role of land-atmosphere interactions in cold regions, the nature of land surface processes, soil frozen-thawing processes, snow melting processes, and surface diabatic heating. By introducing new ways of climate modelling in cold regions, this reference will serve to improve seasonal climate prediction via the of use of cryospheric signals. The concepts and date presented here will be of interest to those working and studying in the fields of meteorology, hydrology, and ecology alike."--
