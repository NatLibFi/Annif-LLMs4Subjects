Graphs and Algorithms in Communication Networks : Studies in Broadband, Optical, Wireless and Ad Hoc Networks
Algorithmic discrete mathematics plays a key role in the development of information and communication technologies, and methods that arise in computer science, mathematics and operations research - in particular in algorithms, computational complexity, distributed computing and optimization - are vital to modern services such as mobile telephony, online banking and VoIP.This book examines communication networking from a mathematical viewpoint. The contributing authors took part in the European COST action 293 - a four-year program of multidisciplinary research on this subject. In this book they offer introductory overviews and state-of-the-art assessments of current and future research in the fields of broadband, optical, wireless and ad hoc networks. Particular topics of interest are design, optimization, robustness and energy consumption.The book will be of interest to graduate students, researchers and practitioners in the areas of networking, theoretical computer science, operations research, distributed computing and mathematics.
