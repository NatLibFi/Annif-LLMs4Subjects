The economics of climate resilience and adaptation
"Managing climate change requires action on both its causes (reducing emissions) and its consequences (adapting to impacts that can no longer be avoided). Human societies can thrive in many climatic conditions. However, such adaptation is not necessarily smooth, and it cannot be taken for granted. This book synthesises the contribution of economics to the study and practice of climate resilience and adaptation. Including an original introduction by the editor, it brings together in one volume some of the most influential articles by economists on climate change adaptation since the topic became a subject of academic interest"--
