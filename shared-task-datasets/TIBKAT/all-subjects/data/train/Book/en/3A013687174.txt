Molecular evolutionary genetics
Nei, a widely published authority in population genetics, has incorporated data from hundreds of prime source journal papers into this comprehensive study on the role of altered DNA base pair sequences in evolutionary change. He covers current evolutionary schemes, the molecular basis of heredity, gene mutations, and the inclusion of altered genes into populations. Nei has made a significant scholarly contribution, presenting the leading edge of current evolutionary thought. This volume will prove invaluable to students and scholars in the field. It is definitely not for the lay reader. Highly recommended for academic libraries.Frank Reiser, Biology Department, Nassau Community College, Garden City, N.Y.
