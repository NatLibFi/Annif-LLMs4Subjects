Simplicial Methods for Operads and Algebraic Geometry
This book is an introduction to two new topics in homotopy theory: Dendroidal Sets (by Ieke Moerdijk) and Derived Algebraic Geometry (by Bertrand ToÃ«n). The category of dendroidal sets is an extension of that of simplicial sets, based on rooted trees instead of linear orders, suitable as a model category for higher topological structures. Derived algebraic geometry deals with functors from simplicial commutative rings to simplicial sets subject to a homotopical descent condition. The material in the book is an enhanced version of lecture notes from courses given within a special year on Homotopy Theory and Higher Categories at the CRM in Barcelona.
