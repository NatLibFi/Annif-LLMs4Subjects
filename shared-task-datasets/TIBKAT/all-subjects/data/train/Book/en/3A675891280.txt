Optical coherence tomography : a clinical and technical update
Optical coherence tomography represents the ultimate noninvasive ocular imaging technique, though it has been in the field for over two decades. This book encompasses medical and technical developments and recent achievements. Contributors cover the field of application from the anterior to the posterior ocular segments (Part I) and present a comprehensive review on the development of OCT. Important developments towards clinical applications are covered in Part II, ranging from adaptive optics to the integration on a slit-lamp, and passing through new structural and functional information extraction from OCT data. The book is intended to be informative, coherent and comprehensive for the medical and technical communities.--
