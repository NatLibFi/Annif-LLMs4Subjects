Multidetector-Row Computed Tomography : Scanning and Contrast Protocols
Multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) has advanced the approach to diagnostic assessment of many pathologies and now plays an integral role in imaging of both abdominal and cardiovascular diseases. The possibility to acquire diagnostic images with shorter scan duration, longer scan ranges, and/or thinner sections, MDCT has facilitated the opening of new horizons, such as interventional MDCT and functional imaging in stroke and oncology. In addition, advanced postprocessing techniques now permit high quality volumetric imaging in combination with maximum intensity projections, volume rendering, curved planar reformations and multiplanar reconstructions. This volume gathers contributions by internationally renowned specialists in the field who, through presenting their clinical experience, provide a thorough overview not only of MDCT and its practical applications, but also of workflow management in everyday clinical practice. Focussing on scanning and contrast protocols, the current advantages and disadvantages of non-enhanced vs. enhanced MDCT are discussed, along with insights into likely future developments. The volume represents an up-to-date source of technical and practically-oriented clinical information which should prove of great benefit to all who wish to improve or consolidate their knowledge and expertise in MDCT.
