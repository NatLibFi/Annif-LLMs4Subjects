The theory of Hardy's Z-function
"This book is an outgrowth of a mini-course held at the Arctic Number Theory School, University of Helsinki, May 18-25, 2011. The central topic is Hardy's function, of great importance in the theory of the Riemann zeta-function.It is named after Godfrey Harold Hardy FRS (1877{1947), who was a prominent English mathematician, well-known for his achievements in number theory and mathematical analysis"--
