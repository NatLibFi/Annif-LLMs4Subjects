100 x 100 : arquitectos del siglo XX en México
Can the excitement and genius of Mexican architecture in the 20th century possibly be condensed into 300 pages? This indispensable reference work does it, in a brilliantly conceived guide weaving together the century's 100 top architects and their best-known projects. With over 800 thumbnail photographs, timelines and other graphics, alphabetically organized by architect, editors Fernanda Canales and Alejandro Hernández Glávez offer more than a historical retrospective. The intention of these influential architect-academics is to create dynamic connections into a 21st-century reading of the amazing characters and triumphs of Mexican modern architecture. Architects, libraries, historians and students will see individual projects and larger trends in a new light through this inventive work
