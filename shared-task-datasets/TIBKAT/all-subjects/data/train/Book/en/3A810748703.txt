Transnational Turkish Islam : shifting geographies of religious activism and community building in Turkey and Europe
Transnational Turkish Islam provides a state of the art portrait of the Turkish Islamic infrastructure in seven European countries. The book analyses how the Turkish Islamic organizational landscape has developed over the course of time against the background of three major changes: the transformation of Turkish Muslims from migrants to permanent residents in Europe, the rooting of Islam in Europe, and the societal and political changes in Turkey in the past decades. These changes impact the way Turkish Muslims organize locally, nationally and transnationally. Turkish Islamic organizations today act not just on a national level, but are embedded in a transnational field. The authors take critical issue with the assumption that Islam in Europe should be cut off from its roots and forced into a national model. They argue that maintaining transnational networks is not in contradiction with rooting in the local society
