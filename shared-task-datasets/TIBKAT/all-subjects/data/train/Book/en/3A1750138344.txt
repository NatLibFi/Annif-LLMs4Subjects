Environmental control for ensuring cities safety
This proceedings book is devoted to the development of environmental analysis of the surface layer of atmospheric air and green areas of urbanized areas. The analysis of scientific and methodological developments for assessing the level of environmental safety of urbanized areas, taking into account the influence of chemical and physical factors, is carried out. The choice of criteria for assessing the ecological state of the surface layer of atmospheric air is theoretically substantiated. The hazard index of the surface layer of atmospheric air, taking into account the influence of chemical and physical factors, and a method of its visual representation are proposed. An assessment of the environmental risk of the influence of the surface layer of the atmosphere was carried out. A quantitative assessment of the energy balance of the green zone is carried out for Kyiv city (Ukraine). Schemes for informing the population about the ecological state of air in real time are developed. The book is for researchers, engineers, as well as lecturers and postgraduates of higher education institutions dealing with issues of atmospheric pollution, ecological safety and urbanization. .
