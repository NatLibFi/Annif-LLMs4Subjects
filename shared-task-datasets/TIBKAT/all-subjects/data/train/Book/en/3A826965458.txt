The Cambridge introduction to British poetry, 1945-2010
The Cambridge Introduction to British Poetry, 1945â€“2010 provides a broad overview of an important body of poetry from England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland from the postwar period through to the twenty-first century. It offers a comprehensive view of the historical context surrounding the poetry and provides in-depth readings of many of the period's central poets. British poetry after 1945 has been given much less attention than both earlier British and American poetry, as well as postwar American poetry. There are very few single-author studies that present the entirety of the period's poetry. This book is unique for the comprehensive richness with which it presents the historical and literary-historical scene, as well as for its close-up focus on a wide range of major poets and poems.
