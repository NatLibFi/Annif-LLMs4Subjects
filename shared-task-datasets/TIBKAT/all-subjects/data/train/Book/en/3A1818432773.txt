Valorization of dredged sediments as sustainable construction resources
"Valorization of Dredged Sediments as Sustainable Construction Resources provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of research on the reuse of sediments as a raw material for civil engineering fields. Dredging is increasing in scale worldwide, while deep sea disposal is being eliminated and landfill disposal is becoming less sustainable. Yet these sediments offer a potentially useful resource for constructing pavements, soil, bricks, ceramic and clinker, for they provide fine and lightweight aggregates, supplementary cementitious materials and geopolymer binders. This has sparked considerable research on valorization, which is presented here. Covers the main re-uses of sediments and the valorization required. Focuses on state-of-the-art research on practical guidance. Discusses limitations and future perspectives for sediments valorization. The book suits researchers and students working in the area, as well as industrial engineers and professionals working on recycling and dredging"--
