Morphology design paradigms for supercapacitors
"Depicts the latest advances in the improvement of supercapacitors due to the incorporation of nanomaterials into the design; from zero-dimensional to three-dimensional, and microporous to mesoporous. Coverage includes basic comprehension of capacitive practices at sub-atomic and nanoscales to enhance device performance"--
