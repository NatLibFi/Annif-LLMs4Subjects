Bluetooth security
"This resource examine the most significant attacks on Bluetooth security mechanisms and their implementations, demonstrating how some of these known weaknesses can be avoided with appropriate defensive measures. The book presents concrete examples of how to design security solutions for some Bluetooth applications and products built on these applications. Professionals find real-world case studies including technical algorithms, mechanisms and protocols, and security architecture. These architectures offer valuable guidelines for use in building Bluetooth and non-Bluetooth-specific security mechanisms."--Jacket
