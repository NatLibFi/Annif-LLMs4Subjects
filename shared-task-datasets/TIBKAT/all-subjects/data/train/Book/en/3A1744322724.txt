Model order reduction : volume 2: Snapshot-based methods and algorithms
Frontmatter -- Preface to the second volume of Model Order Reduction -- Contents -- 1 Basic ideas and tools for projection-based model reduction of parametric partial differential equations -- 2 Model order reduction by proper orthogonal decomposition -- 3 Proper generalized decomposition -- 4 Reduced basis methods -- 5 Computational bottlenecks for PROMs: precomputation and hyperreduction -- 6 Localized model reduction for parameterized problems -- 7 Data-driven methods for reduced-order modeling -- Index
An increasing complexity of models used to predict real-world systems leads to the need for algorithms to replace complex models with far simpler ones, while preserving the accuracy of the predictions. This two-volume handbook covers methods as well as applications. This second volume focuses on applications in engineering, biomedical engineering, computational physics and computer science
