Lung Pathology : A Consultative Atlas
A novel and substantive approach to teaching the diagnostic elements of pulmonary pathology. Drawing on 263 challenging, yet exemplary, referral cases taken from files collected over 20 years by internationally renowned lung pathologist, Dr. Eugene Mark, the authors introduce his state-of-the-art approach to the interpretation of pulmonary pathology. They illustrate the principles of his diagnostic approach with high-resolution color images found on the CD accompanying the book. This Lung Pathology Atlas on CD-ROM contains the histological record of each case, usually as five-color images that are representative of the histology seen on the slides that were sent to Dr. Mark in consultation, with the pathology being described in his letters to the referring pathologists. This text includes the primary and/or differential diagnosis and the pertinent histological features of each case, as well as clinical history, when available. Key words or phrases in the text are highlighted and digitally hyperlinked to associated images or regions of interest within those images to assist the readers in their correlation.
