Silicon Photonics III : Systems and Applications
Preface -- A nanophotonic interconnect for high-performance many-core computation -- 200 Gps photonic integrated chip on a silicon platform -- LSI on-chip optical interconnection with silicon nanophotonics -- CMOS Photonics: A Platform for Advanced Optoelectronic Integration -- Silicon based optoelectronics -- Silicon photonics WDM network for multi-chip processor interconnects -- Silicon Photonics: the system on chip perspective -- Silicon photonics for metro/access networks -- Silicon photonics for optical communications -- Silicon photonics for the aerospace industry.
This book is volume III of a series of books on silicon photonics. It reports on the development of fully integrated systems where many different photonics component are integrated together to build complex circuits. This is the demonstration of the fully potentiality of silicon photonics. It contains a number of chapters written by engineers and scientists of the main companies, research centers and universities active in the field. It can be of use for all those persons interested to know the potentialities and the recent applications of silicon photonics both in microelectronics, telecommunication and consumer electronics market.
