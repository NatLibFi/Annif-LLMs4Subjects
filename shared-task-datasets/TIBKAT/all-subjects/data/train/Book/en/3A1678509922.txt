Neighbourhood planning : place, space and politics
"This book carries out an in-depth investigation of a neighborhood planning process that engages critically with the issues surrounding articulation of local concerns in a strategic manner and the prospects of implementing 'bottom up' community initiatives successfully. It highlights the dynamics involved in shaping the content of a neighbourhood plan and the implications of the different ways in which a place is constructed. The book challenges the notions of a singular place that is described in a neighbourhood plan. It examines conceptual, thematic, strategic and performative constructions of place and the capacity for neighbourhood plans to be developed within this context. It explores the value of connecting the formulation of a neighbourhood plan with the emergence of a relevant local plan, allowing for more meaningful local influence on strategic policymaking. With first-hand insights on neighbourhood planning, this book offers a novel contribution to the fields of planning, urban studies, and urban geography"--
