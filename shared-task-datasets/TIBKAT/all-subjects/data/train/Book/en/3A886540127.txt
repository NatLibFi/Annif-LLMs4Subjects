Black South African autobiography after Deleuze : belonging and becoming in self-testimony
In 'Black South African Autobiography After Deleuze: Becoming in Black Self-Testimony', Kgomotso Michael Masemola uses Gilles Deleuze's theories of immanence and deterritorialization to explore South African autobiography as both the site and the limit of intertextual cultural memory. Detailing the intertextual turn that is commensurate with belonging to the African world and its diasporic reaches through the Black Atlantic, among others, this book covers autobiographies from Peter Abrahams to Es'kia Mphahlele, from Ellen Kuzwayo to Nelson Mandela. It proceeds further to reveal wider dimensions of angst and belonging that attend becoming through transcultural memory. Kgomotso Michael Masemola successfully marshalls Deleuzean theories in a sophisticated re-reading that makes clear the autobiographers' epistemic access to wor(l)ds beyond South Africa
