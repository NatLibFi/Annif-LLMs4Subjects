Eco-friendly waterborne polyurethanes : synthesis, properties, and applications
"Waterborne polyurethanes (WPUs) exhibit many advantages over conventional volatile organic compounds (VOCs) based polyurethanes and have emerged as an environmentally friendly alternative. WPUs offer an opportunity to use sustainable raw materials to produce environmentally sustainable polymers, particularly, polyols derived from vegetable oils. This book provides state-of-the-art knowledge of the synthesis, application, and property enhancement of WPUs. Written for polymer chemists, materials scientists, and other researchers and industry, this book serves as a comprehensive reference for readers interested in the development and application of sustainable polymers"--
