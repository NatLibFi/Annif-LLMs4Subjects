Boron science : new technologies and applications
"Boron has made a significant impact in our lives through its quiet use in fertilizers, fungicides, soaps, detergents, and heat-resistant glassware. Boron Science: New Technologies and Applications addresses the applications of boron in chemistry, industry, medicine, and pharmacology by explaining its role in problems such as catalysis and hydroboration as well as its use in superconductors, materials, magnetic/nonmagnetic nanoparticles, and medical applications including cancer therapy.Illustrating the practical versatility of boron, the 29 chapters are divided into seven major sections:Boron for Living: MedicineBoron for Living: Health and NutritionBoron for Living: RadioisotopeBoron for Living: Boron Neutron Capture TherapyBoron for Electronics: OptoelectronicsBoron for Energy: Energy Storage, Space, and Other ApplicationsBoron for Chemistry and Catalysis: Catalysis and Organic TransformationsMore than just an updated compilation of progress in the applied science of boron, this book is a tribute to the legions of workers who have spent years conducting groundbreaking studies. The book celebrates these scientists and their prot©♭g©♭s, who together transformed boron science into the exciting and growing area it is today. "--
