"Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies the flow motion in a discretized space. Its basic scale resolved is the mesh size and time step. The CFD algorithm can be constructed through a direct modeling of flow motion in such a space. This book presents the principle of direct modeling for the CFD algorithm development, and the construction unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS). The UGKS accurately captures the gas evolution from rarefied to continuum flows. Numerically it provides a continuous spectrum of governing equation in the whole flow regimes."--Back cover
