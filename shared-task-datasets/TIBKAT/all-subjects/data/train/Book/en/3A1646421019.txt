Carbon Nanotubes : Advanced Topics in the Synthesis, Structure, Properties and Applications
The carbon nanotubes field has evolved substantially since the publication of the bestseller Carbon Nanotubes: Synthesis, Structure, Properties and Applications . The present volume builds on the generic aspects of the aforementioned book, which emphasizes the fundamentals, with the new volume emphasizing areas that have grown rapidly since the first volume, guiding future directions where research is needed and highlighting applications. The volume also includes an emphasis on areas like graphene, other carbon-like and other tube-like materials because these fields are likely to affect and influence developments in nanotubes in the next 5 years.
