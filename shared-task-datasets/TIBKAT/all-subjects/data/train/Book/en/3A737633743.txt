Optical coding theory with prime
"The new field of optical coding theory helps in designing new classes of optical codes for various coding-based optical applications, such as the well-known optical code division multiple access (CDMA). While there are books on coding theory for wireless communications, there is no book specifically dedicated to optical coding theory. In a clear, concise manner, this book presents the mathematical concepts essential to optical coding theory. It covers Galois fields, vector space, matrix theory, Markov chain, and algebraic tools for performance analysis. After providing readers with the mathematical tools, the authors describe applications of optical codes in various coding schemes along with supporting hardware technologies. They also focus on 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D prime codes"--
