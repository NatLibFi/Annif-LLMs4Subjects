Globalisation, the global financial crisis and the state
The recent global financial crisis has challenged conventional wisdom, and our conception of globalisation has been called into question. This challenging and timely book revisits the relationship between globalisation, the crisis and the state from an interdisciplinary perspective, with law, economics and political science underpinning the analysis. The expert contributors consider the Washington Consensus and its aftermath across Australia, China, the EU, New Zealand and South Africa in light of the financial crisis, encompassing public policy issues including banking reform, privatisation and state owned enterprise. The clash between market and state capitalism and the response of market capitalism to the crisis are also explored. This book draws together truly multidisciplinary discussions of the main issues for contemporary society in the face of globalisation, and defines how these issues relate to each other. As such, it will prove a stimulating read for academics, researchers, postgraduate students and policymakers with an interest in law, economics and politics
