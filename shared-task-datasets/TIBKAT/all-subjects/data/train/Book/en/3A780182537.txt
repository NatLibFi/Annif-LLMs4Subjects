Elgar companion to Hayekian economics
The Elgar Companion to Hayekian Economics provides an in-depth treatment of Friedrich August von Hayek's economic thought from his technical economics of the 1920s and 1930s to his broader views on the spontaneous order of a free society. Taken together, the chapters show evidence both of continuity of thought and of significant changes in focus. Providing a thorough and balanced account of Hayek's work, the authors examine his wide-ranging contribution to thought in the areas of business cycles, socialism and trade unions and the socialist calculation debate, as well as social justice, spontaneous order, globalization and free trade. The authors provide enlightening comparisons between Hayek's views and those of Ludwig von Mises, Ludwig M. Lachmann, Milton Friedman and John Maynard Keynes
