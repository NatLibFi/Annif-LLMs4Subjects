Handbook of research in international human resource management
The second edition of this Handbook provides up-to-date insight into ground-breaking research on international human resource issues today. These issues are faced by multinational companies which can be as small as one person with a computer and Internet connection or as large as a medium-sized country. -- Written by the fieldâ€™s most distinguished researchers, the book will stimulate thought for new research and provide a glimpse of where we have been and where we are going. The book explores issues such as the importance of linking IHRM activities to organizational strategy and culture; talent management; staffing; performance management; leadership development; diversity management; international assignment and mobility issues; and the role of IHRM in the management of global teams and cross-border joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions. -- The Handbook illustrates that IHRM research is both theoretically deep and eclectic. Drawing upon a range of paradigms and perspectives this compendium will prove invaluable for HRM scholars, doctoral students, and others interested in IHRM research.
