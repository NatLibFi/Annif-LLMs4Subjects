Handbook of Coherent Domain Optical Methods : Biomedical Diagnostics, Environmental and Material Science
For the first time in one set of books, coherent-domain optical methods are discussed in the framework of various applications, which are characterized by a strong light scattering. A few chapters describe basic research containing the updated results on coherent and polarized light non-destructive interactions with a scattering medium, in particular, diffraction, interference, and speckle formation at multiple scattering. These chapters allow for understanding coherent-domain diagnostic techniques presented in later chapters. A large portion of Volume I is dedicated to analysis of various aspects of optical coherence tomography (OCT) - a very new and growing field of coherent optics. Two chapters on laser scanning confocal microscopy give insight to recent extraordinary results on in vivo imaging and compare the possibilities and achievements of confocol, excitation multiphoton, and OCT microscopy. This two volume reference contains descriptions of holography, interferometry and optical heterodyning techniques in their application for diagnostics of turbid materials. The most prospective methods of coherent and polarization optical imaging and spectroscopy, including polarization-sensitive optical coherent tomography, polarization diffusion wave spectroscopy, and elastic and quasi-elastic light scattering spectroscopies and image techniques, are presented. Handbook of Coherent Domain Optical Methods will be of interest to researchers, postgraduate and undergraduate students, laser engineers, biomedical engineers and physicians who are interested in the design and application of laser and coherent optical methods and instruments for medicine, material and environmental science.
