Entrepreneurs and the transformation of the global economy
Anthony Ellison cuts through conventional neo-classical interpretations to expose the indispensable contribution of entrepreneurs in driving the market process and, in particular, in accomplishing the deregulation of the transportation, trade, telecommunications and financial regimes both in North America and across the globe.
