This book is required reading for anybody interested in the field: especially for decision-makers, government and military experts, natural scientists, technologists, those working in political and historical science. Among the topics covered are: INF Treaty, nuclear test ban, control of mobile missiles, and fissile material, demilitarization of space, stability and reductions of conventional forces, ban on chemical weapons.
