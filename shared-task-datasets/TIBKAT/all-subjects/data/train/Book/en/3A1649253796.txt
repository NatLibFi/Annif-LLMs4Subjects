IT-Security and Privacy : Design and Use of Privacy-Enhancing Security Mechanisms
Invasion of privacy and misuse of personal data are among the most obvious negative effects of today's information and communication technologies. Besides technical issues from a variety of fields, privacy legislation, depending on national activities and often lacking behind technical progress, plays an important role in designing, implementing, and using privacy-enhancing systems.Taking into account technical aspects from IT security, this book presents in detail a formal task-based privacy model which can be used to technically enforce legal privacy requirements. Furthermore, the author specifies how the privacy model policy has been implemented together with other security policies in accordance with the Generalized Framework for Access Control (GFAC).This book will appeal equally to R&D professionals and practitioners active in IT security and privacy, advanced students, and IT managers
