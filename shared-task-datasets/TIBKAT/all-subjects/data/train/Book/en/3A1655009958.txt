Graded Orders
In a clear, well-developed presentation this book provides the first systematic treatment of structure results for algebras which are graded by a goup. The fruitful method of constructing graded orders of special kind over a given order, culminating in applications of the construction of generalized Rees rings associated to divisors, is combined with the theory of orders over graded Krull domains. This yields the construction of generalized Rees rings corresponding to the central ramification divisor of the orders and the algebraic properties of the constructed orders. The graded methods allow the study of regularity conditions on order. The book also touches upon representation theoretic methods, including orders of finite representation type and other aspects of this theory applicable to the classification of orders. The final chapter describes the ring theoretical approach to the classification of orders of global dimension two, originally carried out by M. Artin using more geometrical methods. Since its subject is important in many research areas, this book will be valuable reading for all researchers and graduate students with an interest in non-commutative algebra
