Language, culture, identity : between ethnolinguistics and ethnomethodology
The contributions gathered in this volume attempt to take varied perspectives on current state of art within the field of linguistics, sociolinguistics and ethnolinguistics. This vast interpretative perspective stretches from the modern European and American conceptualisations of the societal identity, through the extralinguistic reality hidden behind the language expressions and phraseology in order to complete this image with the insightful presentation of various linguistic diasporas. Sociopragmatic and ethnolinguistic considerations accomplish this attempt to represent the leading themes of modern linguistic studies. Diverse methodological and empirical perspectives are employed in the present volume – from socio- and ethnolinguistic issues through (inter)cultural and communication studies to good practices in translatology.
