Computational fluid mechanics and heat transfer
"This book is a fully updated version of the classic text on finite-difference and finite-volume computational methods. As an introductory text for advanced undergraduates and first-year graduate students, the Fourth Edition provides the background necessary for solving complex problems in fluid mechanics and heat transfer. Divided into two parts, the text covers essential concepts, and then moves on to fluids equations in the second part. Designed as a valuable resource for practitioners and students, new examples and homework problems have been added to further enhance the student's understanding of the fundamentals and applications"--
