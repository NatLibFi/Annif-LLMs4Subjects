Solved Problems in Electromagnetics
A mathematical introduction -- Static electric field in vacuum -- Static electric field in dielectrics -- Electric current -- Magnetostatics -- Static magnetic field in presence of matter -- Methods for solving electrostatic and magnetostatic problems -- Electromagnetic induction -- Energy of the electromagnetic field -- Maxwell equations -- Motion of charged particles in electromagnetic fields -- Electromagnetic waves -- Reflection and refraction -- Wave propagation in anisotropic media.
This book presents the fundamental concepts of electromagnetism through problems with a brief theoretical introduction at the beginning of each chapter. The present book has a strong  didactic character. It explains all the mathematical steps and the theoretical concepts connected with the development of the problem. It guides the reader to understand the employed procedures to learn to solve the exercises independently. The exercises are structured in a similar way: The chapters begin with easy problems increasing progressively in the level of difficulty. This book is written for students of physics and engineering in the framework of the new European Plans of Study for Bachelor and Master and also for tutors and lecturers. .
