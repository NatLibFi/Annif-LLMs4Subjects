Functionally graded materials (FGMs) : fabrication, properties, applications, and advancements
"The science and study of Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs) has intrigued researchers over the last few decades. Their application has the capability to produce parts with unmatched properties which are virtually impossible to obtain via conventional material routes. This book addresses various FGM aspects and provides a relevant quality and comprehensive data source. The book covers trends, process classification on various basis, physical processes involved, structure, properties, applications, advantages, and limitations. Emerging trends in the field are discussed in detail and advancements are thoroughly reviewed and presented to broaden the spectrum of FGM applications. This reference book will be of interest to scholars, researchers, academicians, industry practitioners, government labs, libraries and anyone interested in the area of Materials Engineering"--
