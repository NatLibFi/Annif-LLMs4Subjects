This textbook offers a thorough, modern introduction into commutative algebra. It is intented mainly to serve as a guide for a course of one or two semesters, or for self-study. The carefully selected subject matter concentrates on the concepts and results at the center of the field. The book maintains a constant view on the natural geometric context, enabling the reader to gain a deeper understanding of the material. Although it emphasizes theory, three chapters are devoted to computational aspects. Many illustrative examples and exercises enrich the text.
