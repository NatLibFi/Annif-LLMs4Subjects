Handbook of diamond technology
This book is the result of twenty years of experience on the fabrication of active micro-cooling systems, the fabrication of electronic devices (radiation and magnetic sensors, transistors), the fabrication of optical devices (new green LED), and the adaptation of silicon simulation software to diamond. This includes the integration of the current transport models of diamond. The book emphasize the subjects' substrate selection, mechanical and chemical structuring, doping, and metallization. Also included is simulation as a tool to predict the results of the technological steps. Though a state of the art method is far behind in comparison to the silicon and gallium arsenide growth we assume the same state as exists in these technologies, namely that the diamond substrates are commercially available. Contents Sections: 1. Characterization techniques. 2. Surface structuring. 3. Doping techniques. 4. Packaging. 5. Numerical simulation. Fahrner (Chair of Electronic Devices at the U. of Hagen) presents recent information on the fabrication of active micro-cooling systems; electronic devices such as radiation sensors, magnetic sensors, and transistors; and optical devices such as new green LED. Also discussed is the adaptation of silicon simulation software to diamond materials. The book emphasizes the subjects' substrate selection, mechanical and chemical structuring, doping, and metallization. Included is simulation as a tool to predict the results of the technological steps.
