Macroscopic Limits of Quantum Systems : Munich, Germany, March 30 - April 1, 2017
Based on the workshop of the same name, this proceedings volume presents selected research investigating the mathematics of collective phenomena emerging from quantum theory at observable scales. Featured contributions from leading scientists provide a thorough overview of current and active research. Methods from functional analysis, spectral theory, renormalization group theory, and variational calculus are used to prove rigorous results in quantum physics. Topics include superconductivity and mathematical aspects of the BCS theory, the Jellium model and Bose-Einstein condensation, among others. Presenting technical details in an accessible way, this book serves as an introduction to research for advanced graduate students and is suitable for specialists in mathematical physics. The workshop “Macroscopic Limits of Quantum Systems” was held over three days in the spring of 2017 at the Technical University of Munich. The conference celebrated the achievements of Herbert Spohn and his reception of the Max Planck Medal
