Semiconductor quantum dots : organometallic and inorganic synthesis
In the two decades since the term 'quantum dots' was first coined, research into this form of nanocrystal has expanded to form its own sub-discipline and become a key aspect of materials chemistry. Despite the wealth of literature now being published, there has not been a book focused on their synthesis - until now. This book presents an authoritative guide to the synthesis of inorganic and organic quantum dots
