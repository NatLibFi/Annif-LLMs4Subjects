Climate change and flood risk management : adaptation and extreme events at the local level
Climate Change and Flood Risk Management discusses and problematises the integration of adaptation to climate change in flood risk management. -- The book explores adaptation to climate change in relation to flood risk events in advanced industrial states. It provides examples of how flood risk management, disaster and emergency management, and adaptation to climate change may intersect in a number of European and Canadian cases. -- Taken together, the studies show that integration of adaptation in flood risk and emergency management may differ strongly - not only with risk, but with a number of institutional and contextual factors, including capacities and priorities in the specific municipal cases and within a national and wider context. -- The book will be relevant to researchers involved with adaptation to climate change and those involved with comprehensive planning in relation to it. It will also be of interest to academics within the fields of environmental studies and the environmentally-oriented social sciences.
