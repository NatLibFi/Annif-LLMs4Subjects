Geometry of the Standard Model of Elementary Particles
The book deals with the standard model of elementary particles. The exposition emphasizes the naturally geometric character of particle theories. Particles and their interactions are described in terms of vector bundles over spacetime and operations on them. The approach differs from the existing literature by very consistent use of the geometric language. No previous knowledge of physics is assumed. The book can be used by both pure and applied mathematicians including graduate students of mathematics, to quickly learn the basics of particle physics. To physics students, this book offers a brief survey of the central topics in classical particle theory, based on a coordinate-free geometric formulation
