Big data analytics : a guide to data science practitioners making the transition to big data
"Successfully navigating the data-driven economy presupposes a certain understanding of the technologies and methods to gain insights from Big Data. This book aims to help data science practitioners to successfully manage the transition to Big Data. Building on familiar content from applied econometrics and business analytics, this book introduces the reader to the basic concepts of Big Data Analytics. The focus of the book is on how to productively apply econometric and machine learning techniques with large, complex data sets, as well as on all the steps involved before analysing the data (data storage, data import, data preparation). The book combines conceptual and theoretical material with the practical application of the concepts using R and SQL. The reader will thus acquire the skills to analyse large data sets, both locally and in the cloud. Various code examples and tutorials, focused on empirical economic and business research, illustrate practical techniques to handle and analyse Big Data. The book is a valuable resource for data science practitioners, graduate students and researchers who aim to gain insights from big data in the context of research questions in business, economics, and the social sciences"--
