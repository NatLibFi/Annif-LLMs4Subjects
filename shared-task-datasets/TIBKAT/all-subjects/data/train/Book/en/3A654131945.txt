International management in diverse cultural areas
The approach of this book is characterized by the conviction gained in European and more than 25 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America that the decision maker in international corporations as "foreign manager", being confronted by more or less unfamiliar advance information that will enable him to interpret correctly the behaviour of the interaction partner and to forecast more precisely the anticipated effects of his own decisions. That is - in the view of the authors - the specific task of International Management as a special discipline, even facing the general globalization. Most standard academic works on General Management and Business Administration are insufficient background to overcome this specific task.
