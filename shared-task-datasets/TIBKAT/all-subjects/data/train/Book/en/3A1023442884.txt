China's economic miracle : does FDI matter?
This insightful book analyses the impact of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in China as well as making valuable contributions to the theory of FDI more broadly. The authors provide empirical analysis of key factors including the location-specific determinants of FDI; the impact of FDI on domestic investment, income distribution, consumption and tourism; the relationship between FDI inflows and income inequality; causality between FDI, domestic investment and economic growth; and causality between FDI and tourism. The study concludes that FDI plays a crucial and positive role in the economic development of China. Rather than crowding out domestic investment, FDI is found to stimulate economic growth by complementing it. -- Chinaâ€™s Economic Miracle will be warmly welcomed by potential investors who are interested in investing in China. It will be highly useful for academics and postgraduate students with an interest in FDI or the Chinese economy. With strong policy-oriented analyses and discussions on implications the book will also prove invaluable to policy-makers in various government and private sectors who have trade-links with China.
