Geophysical data analysis : discrete inverse theory
Since 1984, Geophysical Data Analysis has filled the need for a short, concise reference on inverse theory for individuals who have an intermediate background in science and mathematics. The new edition maintains the accessible and succinct manner for which it is known, with the addition of: MATLAB examples and problem setsAdvanced color graphicsCoverage of new topics, including Adjoint Methods; Inversion by Steepest Descent, Monte Carlo and Simulated Annealing methods; and Bootstrap algorithm for determining empirical confidence intervalsOnline data sets and MATLAB scripts that can be used as an inverse theory tutorial. Additional material on probability, including Bayesian influence, probability density function, and metropolis algorithmDetailed discussion of application of inverse theory to tectonic, gravitational and geomagnetic studiesNumerous examples and end-of-chapter homework problems help you explore and further understand the ideas presentedUse as classroom text facilitated by a complete set of exemplary lectures in Microsoft PowerPoint format and homework problem solutions for instructors
