Hilbert Space Operators : A Problem Solving Approach
This self-contained work on Hilbert space operators takes a problem-solving approach to the subject, combining theoretical results with a wide variety of exercises that range from the straightforward to the state of the art. Complete solutions to all problems are provided. The text covers the basics of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space and gradually progresses to more advanced topics in spectral theory and quasireducible operators. Written in a motivating and rigorous style, the work has few prerequisites beyond elementary functional analysis, and will appeal to graduate students and researchers in mathematics, physics, engineering, and related disciplines
