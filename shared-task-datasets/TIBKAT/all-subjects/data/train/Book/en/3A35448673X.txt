Underwater acoustic digital signal processing and communication systems
This work describes design and development methodologies in underwater acoustic signal processing. The emphasis is on the implementation and experimental issues such as use of modern (DSP) systems and special hardware realizations. The book assembles a number of contributions dealing with different underwater acoustic signal processing applications. Topics covered include: array processing for detection and localization; matched-field processing; speech coding and transmission for divers; underwater biotelemetry; signal processing for underwater communications (telemetry); communication channel modelling; equalization for underwater high speed communications and neural networks in underwater signal processing.
