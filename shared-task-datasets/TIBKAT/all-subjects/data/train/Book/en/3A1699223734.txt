Transformative planning : radical alternatives to neoliberal urbanism
"Since the 1960s many activists and urban professionals have contested inequalities of class, race and gender in cities around the world. Transformative Planning comes out of this movement and compiles the discussions and debates that appeared in the publications of Planners Network, an association of planners and activists based in North America. Original contributions were added to the collection so that it serves as both a reflection of past theory and practice and a challenge for activists and planners going forward."--
