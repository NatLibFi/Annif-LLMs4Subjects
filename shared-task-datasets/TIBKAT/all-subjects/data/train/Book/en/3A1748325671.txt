Optoelectronic organic-inorganic semiconductor heterojunctions
The book summarizes advances in development of organic-inorganic semiconductor heterojunctions, challenges and possible solutions for material/device design, and prospects for commercial applications. It introduces the concept and basic mechanism of semiconductor heterojunctions. It describes a series of organic-inorganic semiconductor heterojunctions with desirable electrical and optical properties for optoelectronic devices. Typical devices such as solar cells, photo-detectors and optoelectronic memories are discussed. Materials, device challenges, and strategies are discussed to promote the commercial translation of semiconductor heterojunction based optoelectronic devices.
