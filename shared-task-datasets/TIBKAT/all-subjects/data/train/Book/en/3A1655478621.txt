Mathematics of Ramsey Theory
One of the important areas of contemporary combinatorics is Ramsey theory. Ramsey theory is basically the study of structure preserved under partitions. The general philosophy is reflected by its interdisciplinary character. The ideas of Ramsey theory are shared by logicians, set theorists and combinatorists, and have been successfully applied in other branches of mathematics. The whole subject is quickly developing and has some new and unexpected applications in areas as remote as functional analysis and theoretical computer science. This book is a homogeneous collection of research and survey articles by leading specialists. It surveys recent activity in this diverse subject and brings the reader up to the boundary of present knowledge. It covers virtually all main approaches to the subject and suggests various problems for individual research
