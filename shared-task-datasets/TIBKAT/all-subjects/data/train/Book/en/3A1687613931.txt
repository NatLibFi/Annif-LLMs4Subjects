Attitude as style : Rahel Belatchew, architect
Belatchew Arkitekter was founded in 2006, by Rahel Belatchew. Located in Stockholm, Sweden, they are mostly known for their innovative projects in offices, housing and social properties as well as their experimental studio Belatchew Labs. All of their projects are based on careful analysis and reflect an attitude that treats each one as unique, with an individual expression. There is consequently no general building kit that the office utilise, and the results express the significant element of playfulness that permeates their work. In addition, they also have a social ambition that goes beyond specific tasks or formal briefs in terms of a desire to enhance human connection across economic and cultural divides. This monograph covers several key projects of the office such as Buzz Building, Stockholm Loop, Rudbeckia, Florahuset, Discus, Tensta Torn and Norra Djurgårdsstaden. It also includes essays by Paul Finch and Martin Rörby, as well as an interview with Rahel Belatchew by Nils Forsberg
