Grass roots injury prevention : a guide for field workers
The purpose of this book is to translate the principles of injury prevention to the specific circumstances that community workers face. The GRIP Guide contains eight modules. The first module gives an overview of the principles of injury prevention and safety promotion. Modules two through six describe how to address the five categories / types of injuries (burns, falls, drowning, transport injuries, poisoning). Module seven provides a generic approach that covers other unintentional injuries and module eight deals with the response to intentional injuries (violence). This guide takes the form of a series of exercises that reader can use when working with community members to promote community participation and intersectoral collaboration as a means of achieving a safe environment
