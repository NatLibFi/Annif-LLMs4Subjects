Handbook of territorial politics
Territory continues to be an essential part of modern political discussion, evidenced in the recent decentralization of state structures and rise of sub-state nationalist and regionalist parties. With extensive empirical evidence alongside contemporary theory, this multidisciplinary Handbook makes the case for an outright rejection of state-centric views on territorial politics. Original research by political scientists, geographers, sociologists, lawyers, historians and public policy specialists demonstrates how territory continues to have an impact across institutional and political structures, as well as on culture, identity and citizenship. Over four sections, contributions cover institutions and ideas; elections and political parties; public policy concerns; and geographical perspectives, including conflict resolution and gendered approaches to territorial politics. With perspectives from European, North American, South Asian, Middle Eastern and Australasian case studies, Klaus Detterbeck and Eve Hepburn provide a state-of-the-art international Handbook of Territorial Politics. Incorporating public policy, comparative politics, multilevel governance and political geography, this Handbook provides scholars and students with a compelling compendium on territorial politics that will prove invaluable
