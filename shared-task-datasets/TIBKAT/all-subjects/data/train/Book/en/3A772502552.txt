Poland's EU-Council presidency under evaluation : navigating Europe through stormy waters
This volume examines Poland's Presidency term as a crucial example of the rotating EU Council Presidency after the Lisbon Treaty. By covering all relevant policy fields, this in-depth analysis of the arguably most ambitious Presidency since the introduction of the Lisbon Treaty provides a balanced and differentiated evaluation of the profile of the reformed EU Council Presidency. The book embarks on the analysis by relating three main aspects of rotating Presidencies. First, the introduction systematizes the major functions of the rotating Presidency. Against this background, individual chapters analyze Poland's term. Second, the book addresses the tension between the formal neutrality expectation and the tempting opportunity for the country holding the Presidency to foster its national interests through its informal impact on the policies formulated, decided upon, and implemented during the Presidency. Third, it adopts a contingency approach by distinguishing between endogenous and exogenous variables that may affect the outcome and success of the EU Council Presidency. --Provided by publisher
