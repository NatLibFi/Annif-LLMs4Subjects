Bioscience and bioengineering of titanium materials
Bridging the gap between medical/dental and engineering/technology areas, this book organizes and processes the findings from over 2,000 published articles and studies into a coherent and easily accessible manner. The content covers Materials Classifications, Chemical and Electrochemical Reactions, Oxidation, Biological Reactions, Implant-related Biological Reactions, Applications, Fabrication Technologies, Surface Modifications, and Future Perspectives with updated findings, deftly weaving older and newer technologies together to give a clear overview. The author, with extensive work in both academics and industry, helps medical practitioners and students answer a number of practical questions, including: What is titanium?; What type of titanium materials should I use in this case?; Can I use this titanium material for my patient?; Why does this titanium material behave like this? How can I fabricate my design using titanium?; And are there any alternative materials or methods? This book is an essential resource for anyone researching titanium in its fundamental aspects and medical/dental applications. Reviews over 2,000 published articles, drawing information from several types of studies and reports. Provides quick access to the primary literature in this fieldUp-to-date information on nanoscience and nanotechnology developments. Helps readers answer questions about the most appropriate materials and when to use them
