Network security : a decision and game-theoretic approach
"Network security is an important, challenging, and multi-dimensional research field.In its study, theory and practice should function together as parts of a feedback loop.Game, optimization, and control theories, among others, provide a mathematical foundation to formalize the multitude of decision-making processes in network security. The analytical approaches and quantitative frameworks presented lead to better allocation of limited resources and result in more informed responses to security problems in complex networked systems and organizations"--

"Covering attack detection, malware response, algorithm and mechanism design, privacy, and risk management, this comprehensive work applies unique quantitative models derived from decision, control, and game theories to understanding diverse network security problems. It provides the reader with a system-level theoretical understanding of network security, and is essential reading for researchers interested in a quantitative approach to key incentive and resource allocation issues in the field. It also provides practitioners with an analytical foundation that is useful for formalising decision-making processes in network security"--
