Active landscape photography - theoretical groundwork for landscape architecture
"Photographs play a hugely influential, but largely unexamined role in the practice of landscape architecture and design. Through a diverse set of essays and case studies, this seminal text unpacks the complex relationship between landscape architecture and photography. It explores the influence of photographic seeing on the design process, by presenting theoretical concepts from photography, philosophy and cultural theory through the lens of landscape architecture practice to create a rigorous, open discussion. Beautifully illustrated in full color throughout, with over 200 images, subjects covered include the diversity of everyday photographic practices for design decision making, the perception of landscape architecture through photography, transcending the objective and subjective with photography, and deploying multiplicity in photographic representation as a means to better represent the complexity of the discipline. Rather than solving problems and providing tidy solutions to the ubiquitous relationship between photography and landscape architecture, this book aims to invigorate a wider dialogue about how photography influences how landscapes are understood, valued and designed. Active photographic practices are presented throughout for professionals, academics, students and researchers"--
