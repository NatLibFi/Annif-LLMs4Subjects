Flawless : understanding faults in wine
"Flawless is the first book of its kind dedicated to exploring wine faults. It's an interesting and topical subject, not least because there's currently a lot of discussion in the wine trade about "fault" compounds that can, in the right contexts, be seen as desirable. And with the rise of "natural" wines, there is also a lot of interest in how wine faults develop. This book is written in an accessible voice, yet deals with the science in an accurate and balanced way"--Provided by publisher
