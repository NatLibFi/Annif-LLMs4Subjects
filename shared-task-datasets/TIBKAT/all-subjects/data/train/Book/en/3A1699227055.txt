Particulate plastics in terrestrial and aquatic environments
"Particulate Plastics in Terrestrial and Aquatic Environments provides a fundamental understanding of the sources of these plastics and the threats they pose to the environment. It demonstrates the ecotoxicity of particulate plastics using case studies and offers management practices to mitigate environmental contamination"--
