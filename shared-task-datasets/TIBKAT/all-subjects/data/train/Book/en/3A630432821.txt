Handbook of multicriteria analysis
Multicriteria analysis is a rapidly growing field in operations research and management science, with numerous practical applications in a wide range of fields. This book presents all the recent advances in this field, including multicriteria optimization, multiattribute utility theory, outranking methods, disaggregation techniques. Recent developments on robustness/sensitivity analysis, efficiency measurement. decision making under uncertainty and stochastic modeling are also discussed. Special emphasis is also given to applications in several fields, such as environment, management, engineering and economics, together with the implementations in decision support systems. Finally, the interactions of multicriteria analysis with other disciplines are also analyzed, including among others fuzzy sets, rough sets, data mining, artificial intelligence and evolutionary methods.
