Electron Liquids
Electron Liquids discusses newly discovered unusual electronic phenomena in diverse systems, with emphasis on electron correlations. The topics covered include: ð the quantum Hall effect ð high-Tc superconductivity ð electronðhole liquids ð localization ð conductance fluctuations ð 1D organic conductors This second edition has been enlarged by the inclusion of the significant developments in the study of electron systems that have taken place since the publication of the first edition, especially in the areas of high-Tc superconductivity and the quanitzed Hall effect. Also included are such fascinating subjects as crystallization and the stability of matter
