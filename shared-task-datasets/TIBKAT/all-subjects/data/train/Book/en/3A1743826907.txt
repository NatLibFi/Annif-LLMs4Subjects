Community visioning for place making : a guide to visual preference surveys for successful urban evolution
"Community Visioning for Placemaking is a groundbreaking guide to engaging with communities to design better public spaces. It provides a toolkit to encourage and assist organizations, municipalities and neighborhoods to organize visually-based community participation workshops to evaluate their existing community and translate these images into plans that embody their ideal characteristics of places and spaces. The book is based on results generated from hundreds of public participation visioning sessions in a broad range of cities and regions, portraying images of what people liked and disliked. These community visioning sessions are instrumental in generating policies, physical plans, recommendations and codes for adoption and implementation in a range of urban, suburban, and rural spaces, and the book serves as a bottom-up tool for designers and public officials to make decisions that make their communities more appealing. The book will appeal to community and neighborhood organizations, professional planners, social and psychological professionals, policy analysts, architects, urban designers, engineers, and municipal officials seeking an alternative vision for their future"--
