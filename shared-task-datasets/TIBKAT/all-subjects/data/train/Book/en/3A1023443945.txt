The US-China trade dispute : facts, figures and myths
Dealing with a topic that has attracted significant media attention, this highly accessible book provides a detailed analysis of the trade dispute between China and the US. While the Americans accuse China of damaging their economy, the Chinese claim their policies are legitimate and that the US has no right to dictate how the Chinese economy should be run. Imad Moosa addresses contentious issues including: whether the Chinese currency is undervalued, whether the undervaluation of the yuan, should it exist, is the cause of the US trade deficit with China (hence revaluation being a justifiable cure) and whether Chinese economic policies are immoral and illegal according to IMF and WTO rules. This challenging and thought provoking book will prove a stimulating read for academics, researchers, students and policymakers with an interest in international economics, international finance, political economy and Asian studies.
