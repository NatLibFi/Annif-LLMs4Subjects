A maintenance management framework for municipal buildings in developing economies
"The central aim of this book is to investigate and develop frameworks to aid effective maintenance management of municipal buildings in the education sector of developing economies. Using the South Africa education sector as a case study, this book provides readers with two major practical insights. Firstly, it focuses on the theoretical underpinnings of maintenance management research and introduces a maintenance management model through the development of a conceptual framework. This framework aids in explaining the factors underpinning the maintenance of municipal buildings but can also be used in the assessment and management of other public buildings. Secondly, the book highlights and addresses theoretical gaps in existing studies essential for the maintenance management of buildings in developing economies, providing a stimulus for future research. The book will be of interest to researchers in construction management, building technology, estate management, civil engineering, architecture, and urban and regional planning. It is an essential manual for policymakers in the education sector, built environment, construction industry, facility maintenance, facility management, and consultants at government ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) responsible for the maintenance management of public infrastructures and assets"--
