Public places urban spaces : the dimensions of urban design
"Public Places Urban Spaces provides a comprehensive overview of the principles, theory, and practices of urban design for those new to the subject and for those requiring a clear and systematic guide. In this new edition the book has been extensively revised and re-structured. Carmona advances the idea of urban design as a continuous process of shaping places, fashioned in turn by shifting global, local, and power contexts. At the heart of the book are eight key dimensions of urban design theory and practice-temporal, perceptual, morphological, visual, social, functional-and two new process dimensions-design governance and place production. This extensively updated and revised third edition is more international in its scope and coverage, incorporating new thinking on technological impact, climate change adaptation, strategies for urban decline, cultural and social diversity, place value, heathy cities, and more, all illustrated with nearly 1000 carefully chosen images. Public Places Urban Spaces is a classic urban design text, and everyone in the field should own a copy"--
