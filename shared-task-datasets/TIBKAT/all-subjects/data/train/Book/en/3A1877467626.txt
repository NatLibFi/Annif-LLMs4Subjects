Ethics in artificial intelligence: bias, fairness and beyond
This book is a collection of chapters in the newly developing area of ethics in artificial intelligence. The book comprises chapters written by leading experts in this area which makes it a one of its kind collections. Some key features of the book are its unique combination of chapters on both theoretical and practical aspects of integrating ethics into artificial intelligence. The book touches upon all the important concepts in this area including bias, discrimination, fairness, and interpretability. Integral components can be broadly divided into two segments - the first segment includes empirical identification of biases, discrimination, and the ethical concerns thereof in impact assessment, advertising and personalization, computational social science, and information retrieval. The second segment includes operationalizing the notions of fairness, identifying the importance of fairness in allocation, clustering and time series problems, and applications of fairness in software testing/debugging and in multi stakeholder platforms. This segment ends with a chapter on interpretability of machine learning models which is another very important and emerging topic in this area
