Elementary Functions
This textbook focuses on the study of different kinds of elementary functions ubiquitous both in high school Algebra and Calculus. To analyze the functions ranging from polynomial to trigonometric ones, it uses rudimentary techniques available to high school students, and at the same time follows the mathematical rigor appropriate for university level courses. Contrary to other books of Pre-Calculus, this textbook emphasizes the study of elementary functions with rigor appropriate for university level courses in mathematics, although the exposition is confined to the pre-limit topics and techniques. This makes the book useful, on the one hand, as an introduction to mathematical reasoning and methods of proofs in mathematical analysis, and on the other hand, as a preparatory course on the properties of different kinds of elementary functions. The textbook is aimed at university freshmen and high-school students interested in learning strict mathematical reasoning and in preparing a solid base for subsequent study of elementary functions at advanced level of Calculus and Analysis. The required prerequisites correspond to the level of the high school Algebra. All the preliminary concepts and results related to the elementary functions are covered in the initial part of the text. This makes the textbook suitable for both classroom use and self-study. .
