Radio frequency integrated circuit design
No matter which type of communications device requiring RFICs you are designing, you can turn to this comprehensive reference for a practical explanation of the full range of RFICs. This book focuses mainly on bipolar technology to demonstrate circuits, but CMOS is included as well. By emphasizing working designs, this book practically transports you into the authors' own RFIC lab so you can fully understand the function of each design detailed in this book. Among the RFIC designs examined are RF integrated LC-based filters, VCO automatic amplitude control loops, and fully integrated transformer-based circuits, as well as image reject mixers and power amplifiers.n
