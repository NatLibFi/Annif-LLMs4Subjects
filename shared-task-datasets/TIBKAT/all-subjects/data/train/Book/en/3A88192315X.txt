A comprehensive guide to the hazardous properties of chemical substances
"Correlating chemical structure with toxicity to humans and the environment, and the chemical structure of compounds to their hazardous properties, A Comprehensive Guide to the Hazardous Properties of Chemical Substances, Third Edition allows users to assess the toxicity of a substance even when no experimental data exists. Thus, it bridges the gap between hazardous materials and chemistry." "Because it provides information that enables those with a chemistry background to perform assessments without prior data, this comprehensive reference appeals to chemists, chemical engineers, toxicologists, and forensic scientists, as well as industrial hygienists, occupational physicians, Hazmat professionals, and others in related fields."--Jacket
