Cmos Memory Circuits
CMOS Memory Circuits is a systematic and comprehensive reference work designed to aid in the understanding of CMOS memory circuits, architectures, and design techniques. CMOS technology is the dominant fabrication method and almost the exclusive choice for semiconductor memory designers. Both the quantity and the variety of complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) memories are staggering. CMOS memories are traded as mass-products worldwide and are diversified to satisfy nearly all practical requirements in operational speed, power, size, and environmental tolerance. Without the outstanding speed, power, and packing density characteristics of CMOS memories, neither personal computing, nor space exploration, nor superior defense systems, nor many other feats of human ingenuity could be accomplished. Electronic systems need continuous improvements in speed performance, power consumption, packing density, size, weight, and costs. These needs continue to spur the rapid advancement of CMOS memory processing and circuit technologies. CMOS Memory Circuits is essential for those who intend to (1) understand, (2) apply, (3) design and (4) develop CMOS memories.
