Separation process principles
"Completely rewritten to enhance clarity, this third edition provides engineers with a strong understanding of the field. With the help of an additional co-author, the book presents new information on bioseparations throughout the chapters. A new chapter on mechanical separations covers settling, filtration, and centrifugation, including mechanical separations in biotechnology and cell lysis. Boxes help highlight fundamental equations. Numerous new examples and exercises are integrated throughout as well. In addition, frequent references are made to the software products and simulators that will help engineers find the solutions they need"--
