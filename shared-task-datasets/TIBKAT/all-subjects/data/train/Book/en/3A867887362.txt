Rubber stamping : get creative with stamps, rollers and other printmaking techniques
This beautiful book provides a complete guide to printing with rubber stamps. Beginning with a foreword by the artist Rob Ryan and a short history of rubber stamping, it then explains the technical basics: how to cut your stamp, mask prints, make your own printing pads, clean your stamps (making more artwork as you do so!) and what equipment to use. At the heart of the book are forty inventive projects that will inspire readers to create their own rubber stamp art. These include making typefaces and repeat patterns, mail art, creating stickers and labels, printing on t-shirts, making portraits, and translucent and 3D prints. Also covered are other printing approaches such as roller printing, and printing with clay and plaster
