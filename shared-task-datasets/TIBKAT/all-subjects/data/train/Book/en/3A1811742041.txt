Lignocellulose bioconversion through white biotechnology
"White biotechnology is a multidisciplinary branch of the industrial biotechnology dealing with the sustainable production of renewable fuels, chemicals, food and fibers, enzymes, and value-added products at the industrial level. Bio (chem) transformation of lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) delivers renewable fuels and low carbon bulk and specialty chemicals as well as value-added products such as lignocellulosic derived oligosaccharides, pre-biotics, additives etc. These green products are the integral component of white biotechnology. White biotechnology can cater to the growing demand for renewable fuels, chemicals, and materials in a sustainable manner harnessing the potential of LCB leveraging the carbon-neutral circular economy. Essentially, green fuels and chemicals produced from LCB has the potential to reduce the dependency on petroleum derived products/fuels."--
