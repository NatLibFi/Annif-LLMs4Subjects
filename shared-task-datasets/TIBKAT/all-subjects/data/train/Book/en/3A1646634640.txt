Chondral disease of the knee : a case-based approach
This book consists of case studies selected for their clinical value. The text is comprehensive and covers the spectrum of current treatments. Emphasis is placed on clarifying the overall decision-making process involved with cartilage repair and solution implementation. Cases are logically organized by increasing complexity. Injury evaluation, including physical examination and radiographic evaluation, is detailed. Comorbidities and off-label usage of technology are considered as well. Each case concludes with bulleted decision-making factors that further reinforce treatment rational. Brilliant illustrations, many in color, highlight disease presentation and arthroscopic techniques. With its practical, case-based approach, this book advances disease management through improved judgment.
This valuable resource, derived from Drs. Cole and Malek's Articular Cartilage Lesions: A Practical Guide to Assessment and Treatment, features case studies that help the reader develop an understanding of chondral disease and hone the decision-making skills integral to successful cartilage repair and solution implementation. Each case is complemented by brilliant illustrations, many in color, and concludes with bulleted decision-making factors that can be easily incorporated into clinical practice.
