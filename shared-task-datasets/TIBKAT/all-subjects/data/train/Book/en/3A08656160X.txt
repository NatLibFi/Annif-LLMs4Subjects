"Contrasting aesthetic versus linguistic centered visions for critical theory and the analysis of contemporary democratic theory and society, Martin Morris draws special attention to the concept of communicative freedom. He problematizes the paradigm shift within critical theory from the "philosophy of the subject" to the communicative action theory championed by Jurgen Habermas by opposing Habermas's reconstruction of critical theory to that of Theodor W. Adorno."--Jacket
