Ahead of the curve : hidden breakthroughs in the biosciences / [edited by] Michael Levin (Tufts University), Dany Spencer Adams (Tufts University) ; Volume 1
This unique book is a compendium of carefully curated published papers in the biosciences, which have (or will) precipitate a profound change in prevailing paradigms and research programs. A mix of new and classic papers, it shows the limitations of current thought or identifies novel vistas for investigations that have not yet been explored. The purpose of the book is to highlight scientific gems, most unrecognized, that suggest revisions to key pillars of thought in the biological sciences and further the education of young scientists. This will be achieved by including reprints of papers that demonstrate counter-paradigm, novel directions for future research featuring commentary from current, notable researchers in a variety of areas.
