Surgery for the dry eye : scientific evidence and guidelines for the clinical management of dry eye associated ocular surface disease ; presents a wealth of valuable information
All adnexal structures - the tear system, the lids and the orbit as well as neuronal and cellular components of the ocular surface itself, i.e. the cornea and conjunctiva - are involved in tear production and maintenance. If any part of this complex functional unit mutates either primary or secondary to disease, changes in tear film and ocular surface known as dry eye may occur. In this volume a panel of well-established international experts provides the theoretical foundation and describes the interaction of the ocular adnexa and surface in dry eye. Current guidelines for the diagnosis and medical management are also given. The main focus lies on surgical concepts exceeding techniques such as to block the lacrimal drainage system or lid surgery, but encompasses corneal and conjunctival as well as orbital and maxillofacial surgery where often complex transplantation procedures are involved. This volume offers a concise review on surgical treatment of the dry eye to all ophthalmologists dealing with this fairly common eye disorder
