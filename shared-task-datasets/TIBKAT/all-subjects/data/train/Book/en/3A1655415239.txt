This edition of Books IV to VII of Diophantus' Arithmetica, which are extant only in a recently discovered Arabic translation, is the outgrowth of a doctoral dissertation submitted to the Brown University Department of the History of Mathematics in May 1975. Early in 1973, my thesis adviser, Gerald Toomer, learned of the existence of this manuscript in A. Gulchln-i Macanl's just-published catalogue of the mathematical manuscripts in the Mashhad Shrine Library, and secured a photographic copy of it. In Sep­ tember 1973, he proposed that the study of it be the subject of my dissertation. Since limitations of time compelled us to decide on priorities, the first objective was to establish a critical text and to translate it. For this reason, the Arabic text and the English translation appear here virtually as they did in my thesis. Major changes, however, are found in the mathematical com­ mentary and, even more so, in the Arabic index. The discussion of Greek and Arabic interpolations is entirely new, as is the reconstruction of the history of the Arithmetica from Diophantine to Arabic times. It is with the deepest gratitude that I acknowledge my great debt to Gerald Toomer for his constant encouragement and invaluable assistance.
