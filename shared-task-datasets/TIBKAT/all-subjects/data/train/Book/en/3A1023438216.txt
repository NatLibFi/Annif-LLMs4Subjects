Islamic finance in Europe : towards a plural financial system
A thought provoking and scholarly compendium of essays on various important aspects of Islamic finance. The book is wider ranging than its title suggests; the key chapters do focus on the EU, but there are broader and particularly interesting topics including women and Islam and financial stability and development in the context of Islam. Overall a solid assessment of the progress Islamic finance has made in Europe.  John Presley, Loughborough University, UK  Highlighting the impact of current globalization on financial markets, this topical book challenges the universality of Western property rights and interprets Islamic finance in Europe as part of a plural financial system, where different conceptions of economic justice(s) co-exist and influence each other.  The contributing authors analyse key economic development and social integration issues from an Islamic perspective and outline the European approach to accommodating Islamic finance, with particular regard to the peculiarities of individual nation-states. Set in this context, the book presents financial pluralism as a device to enhance a level playing field in the global marketplace, as well as to foster a plural open society.  Providing a comprehensive and methodological guide to Islamic finance in Europe, this book will prove an illuminating and informative read for academics, students and policymakers with an interest in the impact on financial regulation of an increasingly globalized world.
