Corrosion inhibitors : an overview
"Corrosion, which refers to the gradual destruction of materials by chemical and electrochemical reactions with their environment, presents a costly problem for a wide variety of industries. As such, several methods have been developed to inhibit the progression of corrosion. This monograph contains four chapters that explain these corrosion inhibitors in detail. Chapter One overviews fundamental aspects of corrosion inhibitors such as phenomenology, mechanism of corrosion inhibition, and the development of environmentally friendly and sustainable corrosion inhibitors. Chapter Two explains the factors that affect the efficiency of corrosion inhibitors and summarizes the different types of corrosion and their inhibition processes. Chapter Three showcases the various approaches for preventing tin corrosion. Finally, Chapter Four presents most of the aza-heterocycles derivatives which are mentioned in literature for their properties of corrosion inhibitors for steels, metals and alloys, their synthesis, as well as experimental results that have highlighted these materials used for corrosion tests, the proposed mechanisms, acidic or basic media used, and the quantum chemical parameters that are correlated with their properties"--
