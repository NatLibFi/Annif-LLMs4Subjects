Glare : history of the development of a new aircraft material
Glare is the name given to a new material for aircraft structures developed at Delft University in the Netherlands. It consists of thin aluminium layers bonded together by adhesive containing embedded fibres and is very resistant to fatigue. This book gives the inside story of how the development of Glare took place. It took more than two decades from the first tests in Delft to the major breakthrough following the decision of Airbus to apply the material on the A380 super-jumbo. This success was achieved by a small group of people inspired by professor Boud Vogelesang, people who kept believing in the material and fought against all obstacles during the years. This book tells the story of the ups and downs and the final success of their efforts.
