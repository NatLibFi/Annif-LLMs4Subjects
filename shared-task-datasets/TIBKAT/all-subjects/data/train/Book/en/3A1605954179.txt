Fundamentals of micro-optics
"From optical fundamentals to advanced applications, this comprehensive guide to micro-optics covers all the key areas for those who need an in-depth introduction to micro-optic devices, technologies, and applications. Topics covered range from basic optics, optical materials, refraction, and diffraction, to micro-mirrors, micro-lenses, diffractive optics, optoelectronics, and fabrication. Advanced topics, such as tunable and nano-optics, are also discussed. Real-world case studies and numerous worked examples are provided throughout, making complex concepts easier to follow, whilst an extensive bibliography provides a valuable resource for further study. With exercises provided at the end of each chapter to aid and test understanding, this is an ideal textbook for graduate and advanced undergraduate students taking courses in optics, photonics, micro-optics, microsystems, and MEMs. It is also a useful self-study guide for research engineers working on optics development"--
"Micro-optics developed as a branch of classical optics in the latter half of the twentieth century, and focused initially on miniaturized refractive lenses and novel forms of diffractive optics. In recent years it has begun to meld with the capabilities of microsystems such that the fields of micro-optics, optical microsystems, integrated optics, and optical MEMS share many technologies, components, and envisaged applications"--
