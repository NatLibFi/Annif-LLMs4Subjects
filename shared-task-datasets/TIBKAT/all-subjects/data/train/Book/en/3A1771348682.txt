Remote sensing and image processing in mineralogy
"This book presents a broad overview of quantum theory for understanding automatic exploration of minerals, oil and gas in remote sensing data. In this view, the quantum theory can explain away the electromagnetic wave ranges of varieties of remote sensing satellite data from short wavelength to long wavelength. In this context, the principles of remote sensing, imaging and automatic exploration of mineral, oil and gas are addressed based on the quantum image processing, especially, the Schr√∂dinger equation. Finally, the four-dimensional exploration of mineral, oil and gas is also discussed based on the quantum computing"--
