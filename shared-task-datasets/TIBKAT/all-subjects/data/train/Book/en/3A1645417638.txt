East goes West
This is a new edition of a classic and long unavailable text by Younghill Kang, the first Korean-American novelist. Younghill Kang was born in 1903 in what is now North Korea and arrived in New York in 1921. He continued his studies at Harvard and built a name for himself as a scholar of literature and Asian culture and as an author. His fiction was admired by, among others, Pearl S. Buck, H.G. Wells and Thomas Wolfe. Originally published in 1937, East Goes West met with widespread acclaim despite its biting portraits of racism, alienation and hypocrisy at every level of American society. This eagerly anticipated edition includes informative appendices detailing the author's life and writings, including primary source materials that provide insight into the relationship between Kang and his editor, Maxwell Perkins.
