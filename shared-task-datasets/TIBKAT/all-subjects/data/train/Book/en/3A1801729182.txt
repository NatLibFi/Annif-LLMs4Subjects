Sustainable strategies in organic electronics
Sustainable Strategies in Organic Electronics reviews green materials and devices, sustainable processes in electronics, and the reuse, recycling and degradation of devices. Topics addressed include large-scale synthesis and fabrication of safe device materials processes that neither use toxic reagents, solvents or produce toxic by-products. Emerging opportunities such as new synthetic approaches for enabling the commercialization of pi-conjugated polymer-based devices are explored, along with new efforts towards incorporating materials from renewable resources for a low carbon footprint.  Finally, the book discusses the latest advances towards device biodegradability and recycling. It is suitable for materials scientists and engineers, chemists, physicists in academia and industry.- Discusses emerging opportunities for green materials, synthesis and fabrication of organic electronics- Reviews the challenges of integration of sustainable strategies in large-scale manufacturing of organic electronics- Provides an overview of green materials and solvents that can be used as alternatives to toxic materials for organic electronics applications
