The Routledge companion to paradigms of performativity in design and architecture : using time to craft an enduring, resilient and relevant architecture
"The Routledge Companion to Paradigms of Performativity in Design and Architecture focuses on a non-linear, multilateral, ethical way of thinking, positioning the design process as a journey. It expands on the multiple facets and paradigms of performative design thinking as an emerging trend in design methodology. This edited collection explores the meaning of performativity by examining its relevance in conjunction with three fundamental principles: firmness, commodity, and delight. The scope and broader meaning of performativity, performative architecture, and performance-based building design are discussed in terms of how they influence today's design thinking. With contributions from 45 expert practitioners, educators and researchers, this volume engages theory, history, technology and the human aspects of performative design thinking and its implications for the future of design"--
