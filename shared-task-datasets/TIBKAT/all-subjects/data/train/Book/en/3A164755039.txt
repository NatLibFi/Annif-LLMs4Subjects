Encountering development : the making and unmaking of the Third World
"How did the industrialized nations of North America and Europe come to be seen as the appropriate models for post-World War II societies in Asia, Africa, and Latin America? How did the postwar discourse on development actually create the so-called Third World? And what will happen when development ideology collapses? To answer these questions, Arturo Escobar shows how development policies became mechanisms of control that were just as pervasive and effective as their colonial counterparts. The development apparatus generated categories powerful enough to shape the thinking even of its occasional critics while poverty and hunger became widespread. "Development" was not even partially "deconstructed" until the 1980s, when new tools for analyzing the representation of social reality were applied to specific "Third World" cases. Here Escobar deploys these new techniques in a provocative analysis of development discourse and practice in general, concluding with a discussion of alternative visions for a postdevelopment era."--Book cover
"Evaluates development enterprise and development discourse from a critical theory perspective. This view of development policies and control mechanisms employs Colombian case studies of the Programa de Desarrollo Rural Integrado and of the local application of the discourse of women in development"--Handbook of Latin American Studies, v. 57
