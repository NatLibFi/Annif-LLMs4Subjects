Cities and the politics of difference : multiculturalism and diversity in urban planning
"Over the past decade, the growth in visible minority populations in North American cities has outpaced that of the White population. Also there is a growing recognition of the multiple dimensions of diversity that include sexual orientation, income, ethnicity, religion, and disability. Cities and the Politics of Difference looks at the challenges and opportunities that urban planners face in addressing the needs of an increasingly diverse public."--
"Demographic change and a growing sensitivity to the diversity of urban communities have increasingly led planners to recognize the necessity of planning for diversity. Edited by Michael A. Burayidi, Cities and the Politics of Difference offers a guide for making diversity a cornerstone of planning practice. The essays in this collection cover the practical and theoretical issues that surround this transformation, discussing ways of planning for inclusive and multicultural cities, enhancing the cultural competence of planners, and expanding the boundaries of planning for multiculturalism to include dimensions of diversity other than ethnicity and religion--including sexual and gender minorities and Indigenous communities. The advice of the contributors on how planners should integrate considerations of diversity in all its forms and guises into practice and theory will be valuable to scholars and practitioners at all levels of government."--
