Copular Clauses and Focus Marking in Sumerian
Main description: This work is the first comprehensive description of Sumerian constructions involving a copula. Applying the terminology of modern descriptive linguistics, it is accessible to both linguists and sumerologists. Using around 400 fully glossed examples, the book provides an analysis of all uses of the copula and provides a description of the morphological and syntactic devices used to mark identificational, polarity and sentence focus in Sumerian.
