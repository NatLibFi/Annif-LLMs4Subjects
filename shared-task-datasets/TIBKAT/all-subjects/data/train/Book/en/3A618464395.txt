Boundary Integral Equations on Contours with Peaks
The purpose of this book is to give a comprehensive exposition of the theory of boundary integral equations for single and double layer potentials on curves with exterior and interior cusps. The theory was developed by the authors during the last twenty years and the present volume is based on their results. The first three chapters are devoted to harmonic potentials, and in the final chapter elastic potentials are treated. Theorems on solvability in various function spaces and asymptotic representations for solutions near the cusps are obtained. Kernels and cokernels of the integral operators
