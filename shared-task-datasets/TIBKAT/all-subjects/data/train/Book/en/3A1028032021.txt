Covariance and Gauge Invariance in Continuum Physics : Application to Mechanics, Gravitation, and Electromagnetism
This book presents a Lagrangian approach model to formulate various fields of continuum physics, ranging from gradient continuum elasticity to relativistic gravito-electromagnetism. It extends the classical theories based on Riemann geometry to Riemann-Cartan geometry, and then describes non-homogeneous continuum and spacetime with torsion in Einstein-Cartan relativistic gravitation. It investigates two aspects of invariance of the Lagrangian: covariance of formulation following the method of Lovelock and Rund, and gauge invariance where the active diffeomorphism invariance is considered by using local Poincar√© gauge theory according to the Utiyama method. Further, it develops various extensions of strain gradient continuum elasticity, relativistic gravitation and electromagnetism when the torsion field of the Riemann-Cartan continuum is not equal to zero. Lastly, it derives heterogeneous wave propagation equations within twisted and curved manifolds and proposes a relation between electromagnetic potential and torsion tensor
