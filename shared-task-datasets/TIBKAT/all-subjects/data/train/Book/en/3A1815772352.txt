Modeling and simulation in Python
"The use of Python as a powerful computational tool is expanding with great strides. Python is a language which is easy to use, and the libraries of tools provides it with efficient versatility. As the tools continue to expand, users can create insightful models and simulations. While the tools offer an easy method to create a pipeline, such constructions are not guaranteed to provide correct results. A lot of things can go wrong when building a simulation - deviously so. Users need to understand more than just how to build a process pipeline. Modeling and Simulation in Python introduces fundamental computational modeling techniques that are used in a variety of science and engineering disciplines. It emphasizes algorithmic thinking skills using different computational environments, and includes a number of interesting examples, including Shakespeare, movie databases, virus spread, and Chess. Readers do not have to be Python experts, but a working knowledge of the language is required. Students who want to know more about the foundations of modeling and simulation will find this an educational and foundational resource"--
