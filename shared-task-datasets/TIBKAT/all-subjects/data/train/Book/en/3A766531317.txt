Lighting design & process
For nearly two decades, Office for Visual Interaction (OVI) has been creating inventive lighting designs, illuminating the world's most prominent architectural works. The New York Times Building, the United States Air Force Memorial, a streetlight for the City of New York, the historic Rookery Building or the Scottish Parliament, are part of a new design canon that has captivated designers and visitors alike. As the name itself states, OVI is inspired by light's interaction with finishes and materials. Through the activation of surfaces, light and shadow become a natural extension of the architectural language, integrated and woven into the building fabric rather than applied as an additive element. Impeccably designed and illustrated with more than 400 stunning images, sketches, illustrations and graphics, this book is an essential companion to the art and science of lighting design and an unprecedented account of one of the world's leading architectural lighting design firms
