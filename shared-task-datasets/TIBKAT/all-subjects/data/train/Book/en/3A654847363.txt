Electric and hybrid vehicles : design fundamentals
This multi-author, 670-page handbook provides information on alternative vehicular power systems, encompassing advances in the rapidly evolving battery, hybrid and fuel cell technology domains. Vehicles based on these technologies are described in terms of performance, fuel economy, environmental impact, energy sources and costs, and are extensively compared and contrasted to conventional vehicles. For the most advanced concepts in development (fuel cell and long-range electric vehicles), the issue of recharging infrastructure is addressed, as are case studies of alternative vehicles proposed by major automakers. Fitting a manifest market need, this volume will be an invaluable resource≤for electrochemists skilled in battery and fuel cells, mechanical and transport engineers, energy and environment experts, in research institutions, universities and industries worldwide. Contributions from the worlds leading industry and research experts Executive summaries of specific case studies Information on basic research and application approaches
