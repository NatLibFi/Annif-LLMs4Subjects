Thermodynamics with chemical engineering applications
"Master the principles of thermodynamics with this comprehensive undergraduate textbook, carefully developed to provide students of chemical engineering and chemistry with a deep and intuitive understanding of the practical applications of these fundamental ideas and principles. Logical and lucid explanations introduce core thermodynamic concepts in the context of their measurement and experimental origin, giving students a thorough understanding of how theoretical concepts apply to practical situations. A broad range of real-world applications relate key topics to contemporary issues, such as energy efficiency, environmental engineering and climate change, and further reinforce students' understanding of the core material. This is a carefully organized, highly pedagogical treatment, including over 500 open-ended study questions for discussion, over 150 varied homework problems, clear and objective standards for measuring student progress, and a password-protected solution manual for instructors"--
