Freeze drying of pharmaceutical products
"Pharmaceuticals typically rely on compounds that are unstable as aqueous solutions and therefore need to be dried for an extended shelf lifetime. While lyophilization remains the gold standard in dehydration technology, it is among the most expensive and time-consuming unit operations in pharma manufacturing. This book provides an overview of the most recent and cutting edge developments and technologies in the field, focusing on formulation developments and process monitoring and considering new technologies for process development like the micro freeze dryer. Case studies from freeze dryer manufacturer and pharmaceutical companies are discussed"--
