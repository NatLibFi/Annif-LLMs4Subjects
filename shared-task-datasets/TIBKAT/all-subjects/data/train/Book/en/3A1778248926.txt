Legal aspects of crowdfunding
This book offers a comparative perspective on 18 countries’ legal regulation of crowdfunding. In the wake of the financial crises of 2008, use of this alternative financing method has increased substantially, in various forms. Whereas some states have adopted tailor-made regimes in order to regulate but also encourage this way of financing projects, allowing loans to be made by non-banking institutions, others still haven’t specifically addressed the subject. An analysis of these diverse legislative stances offers readers a range of legal solutions for managing crowdfunding activities with regard to e.g. protecting investors, imposing limits on project owners, and finally the role and duties of intermediaries, i.e., companies operating crowdfunding platforms. In addition, the content presented here provides a legal basis for states and supranational organizations interested in regulating this phenomenon to achieve more legal certainty. .
