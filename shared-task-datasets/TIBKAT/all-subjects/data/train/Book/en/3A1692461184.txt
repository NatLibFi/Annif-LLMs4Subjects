Loans in colonial and modern Nahuatl
The dictionary expands on the original idea of Karttunen and Lockhart to map the usage of loans in Nahuatl, by using a much larger and diversified corpus of sources, and by including contextual use, missing in earlier studies. Most importantly, these sources enrich the colonial corpus with modern data â€“ significantly expanding on our knowledge on language continuity and change.
