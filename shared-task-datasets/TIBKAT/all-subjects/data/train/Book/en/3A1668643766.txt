Practical Microservices Architectural Patterns : Event-Based Java Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud
Take your distributed applications to the next level and see what the reference architectures associated with microservices can do for you. This book begins by showing you the distributed computing architecture landscape and provides an in-depth view of microservices architecture. Following this, you will work with CQRS, an essential pattern for microservices, and get a view of how distributed messaging works. Moving on, you will take a deep dive into Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. Coming back to CQRS, you will learn how event-driven microservices work with this pattern, using the Axon 2 framework. This takes you on to how transactions work with microservices followed by advanced architectures to address non-functional aspects such as high availability and scalability. In the concluding part of the book you develop your own microservices application using the Axon framework and true BASE transactions, while making it as secure as possible. You will: Shift from monolith architecture to microservices Build solid architectures without ACID-compliant databases Work with transactional systems Discover the high availability principles in microservices
