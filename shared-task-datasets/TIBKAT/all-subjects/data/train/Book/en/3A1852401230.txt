Geometric quantum mechanics
"Geometric Quantum Mechanics is a textbook for quantum mechanics at the senior undergraduate and graduate level and follows an approach unique to textbooks in this field. The first chapter starts with the discussion of the properties of space leading to an understanding of operator techniques, Pauli matrices, quantum angular momentum, etc. The second chapter extends this to spacetime. This leads to the Lorentz equation, Maxwell's equations, and the Schr√∂dinger/Heisenberg equations, linking different fields to each other. Both chapters extensively use geometric algebra. This approach can be used to describe the motion in and production of electromagnetic fields, leading to the Lorentz and Maxwell equations, respectively. The following chapters discuss applications of quantum mechanics. These are subdivided into single-particle problems, many-particle systems, and collective and emergent phenomena. The coverage includes the fundamental forces, molecules and solids, nuclear physics, mass generation and the Higgs field, superconductivity, superfluidity, etc. The book restricts itself to the essence of these topics allowing the reader to understand how quantum mechanics impacts modern-day physics and chemistry. It appeals to instructors and students due to its different approach with its extensive use of geometric algebra and the broad range of modern applications"--
