The Uncertainty in Physical Measurements : An Introduction to Data Analysis in the Physics Laboratory
The book targets scientists and researchers focused on experimentation in the fields of physics, chemistry and engineering, as well as graduate-level students studying these sciences in an applied way. The central point is the uncertainty in measurements: what are the causes of uncertainty and how do we deal with it? The possible causes of uncertainty are at first phenomenologically explored, leading to understand the necessity of a formal treatment based on probability theory and statistical tools. The basics of probability and statistics are then introduced, in order to support the most rele
