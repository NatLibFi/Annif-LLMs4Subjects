Computer Simulations in Science and Engineering : Concepts - Practices - Perspectives
Introduction -- The universe of computer simulations -- Units of analysis I: Models and computer simulations -- Units of analysis II: Laboratory experimentation and computer simulations -- Trusting computer simulations -- Epistemological functions of computer simulations -- Technological Paradigms -- Ethics and computer simulations
This book addresses key conceptual issues relating to the modern scientific and engineering use of computer simulations. It analyses a broad set of questions, from the nature of computer simulations to their epistemological power, including the many scientific, social and ethics implications of using computer simulations. The book is written in an easily accessible narrative, one that weaves together philosophical questions and scientific technicalities. It will thus appeal equally to all academic scientists, engineers, and researchers in industry interested in questions (and conceivable answers) related to the general practice of computer simulations
