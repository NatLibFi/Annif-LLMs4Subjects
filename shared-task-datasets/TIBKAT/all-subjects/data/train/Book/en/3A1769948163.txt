Randomness and realism : encounters with randomness in the scientific research for physical reality
"The book is based on the premise that the highest purpose of science is to illuminate the human experience. It explores and attempts to use the laws of physics as a lens to perceive the nature of physical reality at its most fundamental level. To do this requires examining not only certain formalisms of physical theories but the foundation on which such theories are constructed and tested by quantified measurements. It is found that an active element common to all phases of these scientific activities is randomness, and so the book is organized around the way in which randomness suffuses the human experience, starting with everyday chance events, followed by developments into modern probability theory, statistical mechanics, scientific data analysis, quantum mechanics, and quantum gravity. One finding is that in order for the physical universe to function as it does and permit conscious beings within to enjoy sanity, irreducible randomness is necessary at the quantum level"--
