Redesigning environmental valuation : mixing methods within stated preference techniques
This comprehensive volume explores the extent to which the challenges facing stated preference environmental valuation can be overcome through mixing methods. In redesigning stated preference, two approaches are considered: mixing methods within conventional stated preference; and then moving away from the conventional to explore the use of group methods within preference construction and forming a social consensus on willingness to pay. These approaches are assessed in the light of qualitative findings evaluating the applicability of environmental valuation
