Lead-Seeking Approaches
High quality leads provide the foundation for the discovery of successful clinical development candidates, and therefore the identi?cation of leads is an essential part of drug discovery. The process for the identi?cation of leads generally starts with the screening of a compound collection, either an HTS of a relatively large compound collection (hundreds of thousands to one million plus compounds) or a more focused screen of a smaller set of compounds that have been preselected for the target of interest. Virtual screening methods such as structure-based or pharmacophore-based searches can c
