Implementing health financing reform : lessons from countries in transition
Since 1990, the social and economic policies of the transition countries of central and eastern Europe, the Caucasus and central Asia have diverged, including the way they have reformed the financing of their health systems. This book analyses this rich experience in a systematic way. It reviews the background to health financing systems and reform in these countries, starting with the legacy of the systems in the USSR and central and eastern Europe before 1990 and the consequences (particularly fiscal) of the transition for their organization and performance. From practical experience of implementing, advising or evaluating health financing policies in the region, the authors offer important lessons, as well as pitfalls to avoid in the reform process. This book is essential reading for health finance policy-makers, advisers and analysts in this region and beyond
