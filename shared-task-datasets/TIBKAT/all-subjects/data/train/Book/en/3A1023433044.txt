Minbaeva, British Journal of Industrial Relations ' ... a rich array of contributors including some of the biggest names in the field.' - Roger Bell, Delta Intercultural Academy. In providing an insightful overview of a wide range of global human resource issues facing MNCs, this pathbreaking Handbook highlights emergent topics and new research findings that could shape the field of future IHRM research. Theoretical discussion of the variables and processes that affect IHRM policies and practices is provided by renowned contributors with widely differing academic backgrounds, paradigmatic orientations, and theoretical and methodological approaches. They explore extensive subject matter including: the importance of linking IHRM policies and activities to organizational strategy, staffing, performance management, leadership development, and diversity management, international assignment and mobility issues, the role of IHRM in the management of global teams and cross-border joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions. Illustrating that IHRM research is theoretically eclectic, and drawing upon a range of paradigms and perspectives, this cutting-edge Handbook will be invaluable to academics and practitioners with an interest in human resource management, industrial and employment relations, management and international business
