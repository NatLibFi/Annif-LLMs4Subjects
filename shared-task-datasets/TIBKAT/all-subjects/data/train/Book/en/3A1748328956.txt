An engineer's guide to automated testing of high-speed interfaces
This second edition of An Engineer#x92;s Guide to Automated Testing of High-Speed Interfaces provides updates to reflect current state-of-the-art high-speed digital testing with automated test equipment technology (ATE). Featuring clear examples, this one-stop reference covers all critical aspects of automated testing, including an introduction to high-speed digital basics, a discussion of industry standards, ATE and bench instrumentation for digital applications, and test and measurement techniques for characterization and production environment. Engineers learn how to apply automated test equipment for testing high-speed digital I/O interfaces and gain a better understanding of PCI-Express 4, 100Gb Ethernet, and MIPI while exploring the correlation between phase noise and jitter. This updated resource provides expanded material on 28/32 Gbps NRZ testing and wireless testing that are becoming increasingly more pertinent for future applications. This book explores the current trend of merging high-speed digital testing within the fields of photonic and wireless testing
