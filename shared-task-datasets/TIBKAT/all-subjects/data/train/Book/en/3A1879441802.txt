The Chinese economy in transition : from plan to market
The Chinese Economy in Transition provides an analysis of the economic reforms introduced under Deng Xiaoping. It attempts to answer the question: what was the economic system that the Chinese were trying to reform and what approach have they adopted to reform it? Whilst the book focuses primarily on economic issues, it also explores the political and social environment and concentrates on three broad areas of the Chinese economy: agriculture, industry and macroeconomic management. Within these broad areas the focus is on two major themes: competition and cooperation, and central authority and regional autonomy. This book will be of special interest to senior undergraduate and postgraduate economics students, academics and China analysts
