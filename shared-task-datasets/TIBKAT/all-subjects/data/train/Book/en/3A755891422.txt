Biomolecular NMR spectroscopy
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful technique for characterization of biomolecular structures at atomic resolution in the solution state. This timely book, entitled "Biomolecular NMR Spectroscopy", focuses on the latest state-of-the-art NMR techniques for characterization of biological macromolecules in the solid and solution state. The editors, Dr. Andrew Dingley (University of Auckland, New Zealand) and Dr. Steven Pascal (Massey University, New Zealand) have organized the book into four sections, covering the following topics: sample preparation, structure and dynamics of proteins, structure and dynamics of nucleic acids and protein-nucleic acid complexes, and rapid and hybrid techniques
