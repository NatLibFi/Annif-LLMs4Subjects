Third Generation Photovoltaics : Advanced Solar Energy Conversion
Photovoltaics, the direct conversion of sunlight to electricity, is now the fastest growing technology for electricity generation. Present `first generation` products use the same silicon wafers as in microelectronics. `Second generation` thin-films, now entering the market, have the potential to greatly improve the economics by eliminating material costs. Martin Green, one of the worlds foremost photovoltaic researchers, argues in this book that `second generation` photovoltaics will eventually reach its own material cost constraints, engendering a `third generation` of high performance thin-films. The book explores, self-consistently, the energy conversion potential of advanced approaches for improving photovoltaic performance and outlines possible implementation paths.
