Antimicrobial Resistance : Beyond the Breakpoint
Preventing, controlling and treating drug-resistant infections is one of the major challenges in modern medicine. Antimicrobial Resistance goes beyond simple definitions and microbiological data to fully explore this rapidly changing area, describing evidence for effective interventions, costs, treatment strategies and directions for future research.Each chapter provides essential background and examines the evidence for an important aspect of prevention and control, treatment strategy or policy decision. Prevention and control strategies are analyzed for inappropriate antimicrobial use, fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms, health-care associated infections and parasitic diseases. Furthermore, treatment strategies for changing resistance patterns are explored for community-acquired pneumonia during an influenza pandemic and infections with community-associated MRSA, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing organisms and fungi. Data for policy making are presented in articles that detail the costs of antimicrobial-resistant infections in healthcare settings and the threat of resistance with the introduction of antiretroviral therapy for large populations in the developing world. These reviews show where interventions, surveillance and research will be most useful in the future. Antimicrobial Resistance is an invaluable contribution for infectious disease physicians and public health officials who are interested in the prevention of antimicrobial-resistant infections
