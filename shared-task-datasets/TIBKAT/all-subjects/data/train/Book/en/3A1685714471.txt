Co-Rotating Twin-Screw Extruders: Fundamentals
Co-rotating twin-screw extruders are extensively used for the preparation, compounding, mixing, and processing of plastics, but also in other industry branches, such as in rubber and food processing, and increasingly in the pharmaceutical industry too. Derived from the classic, bestselling work "Co-Rotating Twin Screw Extruders", this book brings much of the content up to date, with an expanded focus on the fundamentals of co-rotating twin-screw extrusion, including functional zones in the extruder, screw elements, material behavior, flow properties, performance behavior, and application of computational fluid dynamics. Co-rotating twin-screw machines usually have modular configurations and are thus quite flexible for adapting to changing tasks and material properties. Well-founded knowledge of machines, processes, and material behavior is required in order to design and operate twin-screw extruders for economically successful operations. With chapters written by many expert authors from industry and academia, this book provides valuable information on applications from a practical perspective, suitable for both beginners and experienced professional engineers.
