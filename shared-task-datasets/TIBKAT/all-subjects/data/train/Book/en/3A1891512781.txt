International organizations and global development
The third issue of the Yearbook on the History of Global Development aims at collecting contributions about the role of international organizations in shaping the global system of development throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. International organizations – both intergovernmental and NGOs – have played a crucial role, shaping the global system of development by setting agendas, mobilizing people, and framing ideas and practices regarding development on local, national, regional, and global scales.
