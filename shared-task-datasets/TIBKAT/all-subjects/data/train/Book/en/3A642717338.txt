Plant metabolism and biotechnology
"Various plant metabolites are useful for human life, and the induction and reduction of these metabolites using modern biotechnical technique is of enormous potential important especially in the fields of agriculture and health.    Plant Metabolism and Biotechnology describes the biosynthetic pathways of plant metabolites, their function in plants, and some applications for biotechnology. Topics covered include: Photosynthetic carbon metabolism  Starch and sugar biosynthesis Cellulose (cell wall) biosynthesis Lipid biosynthesis  Nitrogen fixation and assimilation Sulfur metabolism Amino acid metabolism Nucleotide metabolism Purine alkaloids  Nicotine   Benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (morphine, codeine)  Flavonoid metabolism  Pigment metabolism   Use of the metabolome for biotechnology   Application to biomass improvement and biodiesel  Plant Metabolism and Biotechnology is an essential guide to this important field for researchers and students of biochemistry, plant biology, metabolic engineering, biotechnology, food science, agriculture, and medicine."--
"This book will describe the biosynthetic pathways of plant metabolites, their function in plants, and some applications for biotechnology such as genetic engineering to produce transgenic plants for agriculture and drug production"--
