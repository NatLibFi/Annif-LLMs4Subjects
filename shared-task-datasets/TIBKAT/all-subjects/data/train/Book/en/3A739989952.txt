De la Casa Scânteii la Casa Poporului : patru decenii de arhitectură în Bucureşti 1945 - 1989
This book, whose author spent half his professional life under communism, is the result of his longstanding interest in researching and above all understanding the causes that influenced the evolution of Romanian architecture within the conditions of a communist state, with direct reference to the architecture of Bucharest in particular. The book is aimed mainly at those who had little direct experience of the period from 1945 to 1989 or who were not practising architects at the time, and therefore it was regarded as opportune that the first part should be general in nature, focussing on the political transformation that took place within the practice of the profession, particularly in the early years of the regime, when the "single model" was imposed and the status of the architectural profession altered radically
