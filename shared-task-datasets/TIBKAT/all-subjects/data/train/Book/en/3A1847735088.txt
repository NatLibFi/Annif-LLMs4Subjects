Phyto-oxylipins : metabolism, physiological roles, and profiling techniques
"Oxylipins are an important class of signalling molecules in plants, particularly in plant defence and innate immunity. Oxylipins have critical roles in plant growth as well as plant responses to physical damage caused by herbivores, insects, and pathogenic microbes. Over the last decade, our understanding of oxylipin production, metabolism, and function, particularly jasmonates, has advanced considerably. Jasmonates have provided further mechanistic insights into enzyme function and signalling cascades. Other oxylipins, such as hydroxy fatty acids, have recently been shown to exhibit individual signalling features and cross-talk with other phytohormones. There is scant literature on plant oxylipins and their relevance to our understanding. Understanding oxylipin production, metabolism, and function are pivotal. As a result, researchers, students, professors, and other book readers will have a thorough understanding of plant oxylipin biosynthesis, structure, and function, assisting in the improvement of plant science"--
