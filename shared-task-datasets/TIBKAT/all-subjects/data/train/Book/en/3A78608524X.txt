The humanities "crisis" and the future of literary studies
"The Humanities 'Crisis' and the Future of Literary Studies explores current debates about the role of the humanities in higher education, puts them in historical context, and offers humanists and their supporters concrete ways to explain the practical value of a humanities education for twenty-first century students.
