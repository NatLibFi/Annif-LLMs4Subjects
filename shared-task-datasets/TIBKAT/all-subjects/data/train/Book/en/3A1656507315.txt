The search and discovery of the Higgs Boson : a brief introduction to particle physics
This book provides a general description of the search for and discovery of the Higgs boson (particle) at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. The goal is to provide a relatively brief overview of the issues, instruments and techniques relevant for this search; written by a physicist who was directly involved. The Higgs boson may be the one particle that was studied the most before its discovery and the story from postulation in 1964 to detection in 2012 is a fascinating one. The story is told here while detailing the fundamentals of particle physics.
