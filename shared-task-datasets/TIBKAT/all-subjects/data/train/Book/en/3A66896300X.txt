Advances in machine learning and data mining for astronomy
"This book provides a comprehensive overview of various data mining tools and techniques that are increasingly being used by researchers in the international astronomy community. It explores this new problem domain, discussing how it could lead to the development of entirely new algorithms. Leading contributors introduce data mining methods and then describe how the methods can be implemented into astronomy applications. The last section of the book discusses the Redshift Prediction Competition, which is an astronomy competition in the style of the Netflix Prize"--
