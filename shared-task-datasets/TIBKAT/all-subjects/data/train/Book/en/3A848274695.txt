"Thepractice of quantitative risk management has reached unprecedented levels of refinement.The pricing, the assessment of risk as well as the computation of the capitalrequirements for highly complex transactions are performed through equally complex mathematical models, running on advanced computer systems, developedand operated by dedicated, highly qualified specialists.
