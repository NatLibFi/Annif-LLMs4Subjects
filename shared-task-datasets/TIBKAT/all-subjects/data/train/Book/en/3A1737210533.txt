Indoor photovoltaics : materials, modeling and applications
"Indoor photovoltaics (IPV) is the most promising power source for indoor electronic devices, especially sensor devices and edge nodes for the Internet of Things, and it will gain considerable interest due to the development of the field. This field of photovoltaics differs to other fields due to irradiance and spectral distribution conditions as well as the (close to) energy autarkic field conditions. The book provides the engineer and researcher with guidelines, provides a comprehensive overview over theoretical models, efficiencies, application design, and first available products"--
