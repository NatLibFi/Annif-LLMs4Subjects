Tange by Tange 1949 - 1959 : Kenzo Tange as seen through the eyes of Kenzo Tange
One of the 20th century's most significant architects, Kenzo Tange combined traditional Japanese styles with modernism, and took on major post-war urban redevelopment projects in Tokyo and abroad. In 1960, Tange - together with photographer Yasuhiro Ishimoto, architect Walter Gropius, and graphic designer Herbert Bayer - published a photobook titled 'Katsura', in which he questioned the conventional historical perspectives on Japanese architecture. Many previously unpublished photographs taken by Tange during the 1950s now appear in this remarkably arranged volume, giving insight to his later works. With an introduction by Saikaku Toyokawa and texts by Kenzo Tange
