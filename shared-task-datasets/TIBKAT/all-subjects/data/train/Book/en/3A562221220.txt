Molecular techniques in the microbial ecology of fermented foods
With the application of new analytical techniques, the field of food fermentation has grown over last few years. Because of this, the approach to study bacteria in food has changed. Consequently new information is available on the structure and dynamics of microbial populations during fermented food production. Molecular Techniques in the Microbial Ecology of Fermented Foods provides the latest information and relevant advances on the microbial ecology of fermented foods and the application of molecular methods. This book serves as a guide for students and researchers on the most advanced techniques to identify bacteria and helps in choosing the most appropriate tools to study fermented food from a microbiological point of view.
