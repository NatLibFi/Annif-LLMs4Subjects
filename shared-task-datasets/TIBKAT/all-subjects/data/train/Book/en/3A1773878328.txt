Mechanical engineering, an engineering discipline forged and shaped by the needs of the industrial revolution, is once again asked to do its substantial share in the call for industrial renewal. The general call is urgent as we face profound issues of productivity and competitiveness that require engineering solutions. The Mechanical Engineering Series features graduate texts and research mo- graphs intended to address the need for information in contemporary areas of mechanical engineering. The series is conceived as a comprehensive one that covers a broad range of concentrations important to mechanical engineering graduate education and - search. We are fortunate to have a distinguished roster of consulting editors on the advisory board, each an expert in one of the areas of concentration. The names of the consulting editors are listed on the facing page of this volume. The areas of concentration are applied mechanics, biomechanics, computational - chanics, dynamic systems and control, energetics, mechanics of materials, pr- essing, production systems, thermal science, and tribology. Professor Finnie, the consulting editor for mechanics of materials, and I are pleased to present Introduction to Contact Mechanics by Anthony C. Fischer- Cripps.
