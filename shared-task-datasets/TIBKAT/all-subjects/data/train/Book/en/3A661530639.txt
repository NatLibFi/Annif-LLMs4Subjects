Nonlinear Conservation Laws and Applications
This volume contains the proceedings of the Summer Program on Nonlinear Conservation Laws and Applications held at the IMA on July 13--31, 2009. Hyperbolic conservation laws is a classical subject, which has experienced vigorous growth in recent years. The present collection provides a timely survey of the state of the art in this exciting field, and a comprehensive outlook on open problems. Contributions of more theoretical nature cover the following topics: global existence and uniqueness theory of one-dimensional systems, multidimensional conservation laws in several space variables and app
