Hazardous wastes : assessment and remediation
"Hazardous waste problems involve thousands of chemicals potentially present in soil, groundwater, surface water, and air. The improper disposal of industrial chemicals over the past century resulted in the contamination of soils and groundwater at tens of thousands of sites throughout the U.S. and the world. Landmark federal legislation in the 1970s now requires industries that generate hazardous waste to treat or dispose of it properly. Therefore, the hazardous waste field has two major problems that need to be addressed: 1. the assessment and cleanup of contaminated sites, and 2. the management of currently-generated hazardous wastes."--
