Promoting sustainable urban development in Europe : achievements and opportunities
With over 70% of Europeans living in urban areas, cities and metropolitan areas are the motors of economic growth and home to most jobs. They play a key role as centres of innovation and the knowledge economy. At the same time, urban areas are the frontline in the battle for social cohesion and environmental sustainability. The development of disadvantaged urban areas is an important step in unleashing economic powers by creating more cohesive and attractive cities. Promoting sustainable urban development is a key element of European Cohesion Policy seeking to exploit Europe's full economic potential. Building on the experience and strengths of the URBAN Community Initiative and the European 'Acquis Urbain', member states and regions have the possibility to design, program and implement tailor-made, integrated development operations in all European cities. This brochure takes stock of what has been achieved so far. By reflecting on the key principles of integrated urban development, by giving examples from across the European Union and by sketching a few paths forward, the brochure provides both guidance for the less-experienced and inspiration for the well-experienced.--Publisher's description
