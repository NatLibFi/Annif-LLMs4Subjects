Emotion in language : theory - research - application
The miracle of children's language development and the joy of expressive language on the one hand and the vulnerability of language and the sorrow and grief caused by its distortion or even loss in people with aphasia or dementia on the other hand show us the inseparability of emotion and language in its extremes. Although the ‘emotional turn’ promised a paradigmatic shift from a rationalistic towards an emotion-integrating conceptualization of language, hardly any interdisciplinary research has focused on the interplay between emotion and language. The present book covers the wide range of work on Emotion in Language with contributions from numerous disciplines in the three areas of Theory, Research, and Application. With contributions both from well-known pioneers in the area of this topic as well as from young scientists, the book offers a broad range of perspectives from linguistics and language development to neurology, psychology and developmental neuropsychology and to the fields of philosophy and phenomenology.
