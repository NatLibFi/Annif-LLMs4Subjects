Human rights in international relations
Reviewed with Jack Donnelly's book Realism and International Relations: " The authors' skill and influence in the study of international relations, international theory, and human rights are indisputably relevant. Both volumes offer scholarship that is of great value to activists, academics, and policymakers with an interest in issues no less important than power on the world stage." Human Rights Quarterly "The book contributes significantly to our broader understanding of international human rights and the way in which such rights can be promoted in the evolving and highly complex politics of the post-Cold War period."
