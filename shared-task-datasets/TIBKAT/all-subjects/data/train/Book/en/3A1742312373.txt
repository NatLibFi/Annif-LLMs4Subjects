As Selenium shows a narrow tolerance limit (40-400mg/day), the problem of both deficiency and toxicity of Se have being identified in many parts of India and the world. Different countries are making efforts to remove Selenium from water using different technologies. Some specific processing technologies include reduction, bioremediation, phytoremediation coagulation, electro-coagulation, co-precipitation, electric kinetics, adsorption, chemical precipitation and membrane technology"--
