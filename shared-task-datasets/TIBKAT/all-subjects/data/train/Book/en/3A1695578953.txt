Nano dielectric resonator antennas for 5G applications
"This book explains basic electromagnetic theory with the help of design formulations i.e. mathematical background on antennas along with experimentations, which has made this book unique. The main purpose of this book is to embed mathematical EM theory of dielectric resonator antennas with experimental validation so that understanding of concepts takes place. Initially, basic understanding of philosophy of dielectric resonators has been discussed, then it is supported with mathematical modeling and later same is implemented with its prototype model along with experimentation"--
