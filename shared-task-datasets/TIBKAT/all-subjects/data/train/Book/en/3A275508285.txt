Dictionary of Christianity in America
Coordinating editor Reid states that "if any emphasis may be detected, . . . it would be an attempt to give comprehensive attention to the evangelical tradition in America. But given the prominent role the evangelical tradition has played in America's religious history, it is doubtful that this emphasis upsets the balance of coverage." The 2600 cross-referenced articles by 430 contributors evenhandedly describe most of the key institutions, movements, churches, and persons in American religious history. Based on the 600 sample articles provided for review, this work will be a worthwhile purchase for a wide range of libraries.
