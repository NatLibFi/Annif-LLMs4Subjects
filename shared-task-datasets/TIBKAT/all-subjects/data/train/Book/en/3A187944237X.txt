Economic policy for the environment and natural resources : techniques for the management and control of pollution
Economic Policy for the Environment and Natural Resources presents some of the most important recent work on the theory and application of environmental policy at both the national and international level. At the national level it focuses on instruments for pollution control. At the international level it discusses measures to promote international cooperation for the protection of the environment. This book covers a wide range of major issues including the legal aspects of environmental protection, environmental policy under oligopolistic conditions, voluntary agreements as a policy instrument, participation in international coalitions and environmental policy in dynamic trade models. In discussing the applications of environmental policy, it includes issues such as the profitability of emission saving techniques, water management and acid rain models. This book will be essential reading for both policymakers and professional economists who are concerned with environmental policy
