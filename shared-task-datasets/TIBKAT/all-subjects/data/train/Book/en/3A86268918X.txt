Polycystic ovary syndrome : novel insights into causes and therapy
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most frequent disorder affecting women of reproductive age. Recent years have shown substantial advances in our understanding of the complex genetic, biochemical, metabolic, cardiovascular, and reproductive issues associated with PCOS. This book presents a comprehensive overview of recent clinical developments in identifying the phenotypic expression of women with PCOS resulting in a completely new recognition of its phenotypic variability. Metabolic and cardiovascular consequences of the syndrome are discussed in detail. Advances made in dealing with secondary forms of PCOS-like syndromes are presented as well as specific therapies of clinical manifestations and their outcomes. Additionally, a number of hot topics are included presenting genetic developments, endothelial causes leading to unfavorable outcomes, and novelties in therapeutic approaches dealing with metabolic and reproductive consequences.Covering phenotypic characteristics, diagnostic criteria, central pathophysiological mechanisms, metabolic, cardiovascular and reproductive aspects, and modern therapeutic approaches, this book is a useful tool for general practitioners, gynecologists, pediatricians, internists, endocrinologists, as well as cardiologists
