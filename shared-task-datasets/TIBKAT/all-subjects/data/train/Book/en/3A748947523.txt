Isotopic Signatures and Sedimentary Records
Chemical modifications of supracrustal materials have occurred at various times in the Earth's history. This reference book gives an overlook over themost recent findings of isotope research in the sedimentary environment. The reader, interested in the diagnetic evolution of sediments, can use the book as a tool for the understanding of mineral-water interactions in the supracrustal level
