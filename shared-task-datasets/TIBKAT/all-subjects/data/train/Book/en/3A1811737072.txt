Urban drainage and storage practices
"Urban Drainage and Storage Practices focuses on the latest developments of urban storm water design methods using drainage and storage approaches for both water quality and quantity control. It covers both the conventional approaches to flood mitigation and low-impact methods for stormwater quality enhancement. Theory, practice, and modelling methods are presented to illustrate how to build a holistic stormwater drainage and storage system using urban open space and parks through multiple land use. Each chapter provides background theory, numerical experiments, illustrations, and Excel spreadsheets that outline design and calculation procedures. All urban watersheds are modelled as a series of cascading planes to drain stormwater from upstream roofs and parking lots onto downstream grass areas and vegetal beds. The drainage system is designed as a 3-layer cascading system with various low-impact units for micro events, conveyance elements for minor events, and storage facilities for macro events. Presents the theory and practice of designing and building a stormwater system. Explains green approaches to designing and managing urban stormwater systems. This text is ideal for graduate students studying urban hydrology, hydraulic engineering, and water resource management. It will also be useful for engineers requiring a technical book with hands-on practical examples"--
