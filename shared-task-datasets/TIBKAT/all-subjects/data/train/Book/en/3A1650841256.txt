Pseudo-Differential Operators: Analysis, Applications and Computations
This volume consists of eighteen peer-reviewed papers related to lectures on pseudo-differential operators presented at the meeting of the ISAAC Group in Pseudo-Differential Operators (IGPDO) held at Imperial College London on July 13 18, 2009. Featured in this volume are the analysis, applications and computations of pseudo-differential operators in mathematics, physics and signal analysis. This volume is a useful complement to the volumes Advances in Pseudo-Differential Operators , Pseudo-Differential Operators and Related Topics , Modern Trends in Pseudo-Differential Operators , New Developments in Pseudo-Differential Operators and Pseudo-Differential Operators: Complex Analysis and Partial Differential Equations published in the same series in, respectively, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010.
