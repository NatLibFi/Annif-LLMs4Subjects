Advances in food process engineering : novel processing, preservation, and decontamination of foods
"This new volume, Advances in Food Process Engineering: Novel Processing, Preservation and Decontamination of Foods, highlights a selection of novel applications for food processing, food preservation, and food decontamination methods. The book discusses novel food processing methods, exploring the principles, benefits, and techniques used; recent developments and applications of ultrasonication; supercritical fluid extraction and supercritical fluid chromatography; extrusion technology; advanced drying and dehydration technologies; and encapsulation methods as important tools in the processing of food. Chapters on membrane technology in food processing address the basic membrane processing technologies along with their advantages and disadvantages, including membrane modules, types of membranes, and membrane technologies as well as various applications of membrane process in dairy processing, food and starch processing, beverage processing, sugar manufacturing, oil processing, and treatment of industrial food processing waste. Mathematical modeling in food processing is also considered in the volume. Chapters present the application and use of mathematical models for measuring and regulating fermentation procedures as well as provide an understanding of how the hydration kinetics of grains can help in optimization and scaling of processes on a large industrial scale. Topics on decontamination methods for foods are included, such as an overview of concepts, basic principles, potential applications, and prospects and limitations of cold plasma technology and irradiation in the food processing sector has been summarized. This volume provides excellent reference material for researchers, scientists, students, growers, traders, processors, industries, and others on novel food processing and preservation techniques"--
