Vascular Surgery
This practical guide is devoted to vascular diseases as dealt with by vascular surgeons primarily with the collaboration of other specialists attending to vascular diseases. Because vascular disease requires a holistic approach that can ideally be delivered by various disciplines working together in the form of vascular centres, the book depicts precisely this approach towards confronting and treating vascular diseases. The readership that will benefit the most would be trainees and practitioners in vascular surgery, angiology and also practicing physicians. The coverage in a comprehensive, yet easy to follow, format of most aspects of vascular diseases will also render this book valuable to physicians of other specialities. The authors comprise distinguished professionals from European Union countries therefore reflecting, besides the theoretical knowledge and information on the practice of vascular specialists, the level and standards of care of vascular diseases in the European Union.
