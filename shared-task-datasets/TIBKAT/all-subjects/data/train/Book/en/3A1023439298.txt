The international handbook of labour unions : responses to neo-liberalism
Since the 1970s, the spread of neo-liberalism across the world has radically reconfigured the relationship between unions, employers and the state. The contributors highlight that this is the major cause and effect of union decline and argue that if there is to be any union revitalisation and return to former levels of influence, then unions need to respond in appropriate political and practical ways. Written in a clear and accessible style, the Handbook examines unions’ efforts to date in many of the major economies of the world, providing foundations for understanding each country. -- Policymakers, analysts, academics, researchers and advanced students in employment, industrial and labour relations as well as political economy will find this unique Handbook an important resource to understanding the contemporary plight and activity of labour unions. -- ‘Gall, Wilkinson, and Hurd have produced an impressive collection of scholarly essays on labour’s responses to neoliberalism. The International Handbook of Labour Unions provides policymakers, analysts, academics, researchers, and advanced students a compelling framework and key insights in identifying the dilemmas facing labour in the ages of globalisation.’ (Edward Webster, University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa ).
