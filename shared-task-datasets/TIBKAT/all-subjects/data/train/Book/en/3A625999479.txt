Internationalisation of Industrial R&D : Patterns and Trends
In an age of globalising production, the internationalisation of industrial R&D is an increasingly pronounced feature in OECD countries. But just how extensive a phenomenon is it? What proportion of national research is under foreign control, and in which sectors? How much R&D do multinational corporations undertake outside their own home countries? This report also analyses the linkages between the production and R&D activities of foreign affiliates in OECD countries, and of affiliates of domestic firms abroad, on a sectoral level. It highlights the need to reassess each country's potential for R&D and innovation, in the light of what is being done both within and beyond its borders.
