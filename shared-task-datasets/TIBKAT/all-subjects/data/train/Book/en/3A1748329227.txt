Microwave radar and radiometric remote sensing
A successor to the classic Artech House Microwave Remote Sensing series, this comprehensive and up-to-date resource previously published by University of Michigan Press provides you with theoretical models, system design and operation, and geoscientific applications of active and passive microwave remote sensing systems. To facilitate understanding and use of the material, the book includes 50 MATLAB-based computer codes and the book's website (http://mrs.eecs.umich.edu/) includes interactive modules based on theoretical and empirical models
