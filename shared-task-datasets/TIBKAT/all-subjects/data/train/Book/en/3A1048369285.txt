New Light Through Old Windows: Exploring Contemporary Science Through 12 Classic Science Fiction Tales
Life … but not as we know -- Transmogrification -- Pandemic -- Life on Mars -- Artificial Intelligence -- Attractive Androids -- Big Data -- Faster Than Light Travel -- Antigravity -- Matter Transmission -- The Sub-microscopic World -- Impact Events
This book presents the reader with some of the earliest classic SF short stories - all of them published between 1858 and 1934, featuring both well-known and long-forgotten writers - dealing for the first time with topics to which science had (some) answers only at much later stages. This includes aspects of alien life forms, transmogrification, pandemics, life on Mars, android robots, big data, matter transmission and impact events to name but a few. The short stories are reprinted in full alongside extensive commentaries which also examine some of the latest scientific thinking surrounding the story’s main theme and provide the reader with suggestions for further reading.
