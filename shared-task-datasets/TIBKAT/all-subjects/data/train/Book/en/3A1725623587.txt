Understanding lesson study for mathematics : a practical guide for improving teaching and learning
An introduction to lesson study -- Perimeter and mastery -- Developing understanding of fraction through context -- Proportional relationships and the double number line -- Communicating mathematically about shape -- Constructing deep geometrical understanding -- Modelling through open-ended tasks -- Early algebra using real-life scenarios -- Sustaining argument about randomness -- Experimental design: connecting statistics to student experience -- Teaching logarithms through problem solving.
"Using the latest research, this book provides an insight into how learning in mathematics can be improved through a lesson study approach. This highly practical resource explores the research and theory that underpins lesson study, and shows the significant impact it can have on teacher development. Divided into ten accessible main chapters that focus in depth on an individual mathematics lesson, each chapter provides research and background to the lesson, an outline of key features, a detailed description and analysis of the lesson in practice, post-lesson discussions and reflections which generalise from the experience, as well as links to helpful resources. Some of the key topics explored include: Fractions; Proportional relationships; Probability and statistics; Geometry; Modelling; Algebra; Dialogic reasoning. Understanding Lesson Study for Mathematics is the perfect resource for all mathematics teachers, trainee teachers, and professional developers who are looking to develop the use of lesson study in their own practice or for those simply seeking new inspiring ideas for the mathematics classroom"--
