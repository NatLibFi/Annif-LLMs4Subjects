Engineered carbohydrate-based materials for biomedical applications : polymers, surfaces, dendrimers, nanoparticles, and hydrogels
"This book addresses the need for a comprehensive book on the design, synthesis, and characterization of synthetic carbohydrate-based polymeric materials along with their biological applications. The first two chapters cover the synthesis and self-assembly of glycopolymers and different techniques for creating these synthetic polymers. Subsequent chapters account for the preparation of block copolymers, branched glycopolymers, glycosurfaces, glycodendrimers, cationic glycopolymers, bioconjugates, glyconanoparticles and hydrogels. While these chapters comprehensively review the synthetic and characterization methods of those carbohydrate-based materials, their biological applications are discussed in detail."--Provided by publisher
