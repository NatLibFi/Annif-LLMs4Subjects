Liquid crystals through experiments
"The aim of the textbook is to introduce liquid crystals into undergraduate courses of general physics. The main motivation for the introduction is the fact that every student spends a significant part of the day looking into liquid crystals hidden in screens of various products with LCD screens. How the LCD screen operates and what are the properties of these special materials called liquid crystals that enable the functioning of the screens. Next, the content of the textbook could be welcome to lecturers and students for illustration of some concepts in thermodynamics and more advanced optics. Liquid crystals as such form an important part of soft matter. So, the textbook can be used for demonstration and laboratory experiments that may accompany lectures on soft matter physics."
