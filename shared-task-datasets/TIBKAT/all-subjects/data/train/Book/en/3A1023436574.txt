National innovation systems, social inclusion and development : the Latin American experience
'This book presents Latin America's innovation systems in a new theoretical and political light. The focus is upon how innovation processes can become inclusive; a major challenge for the non-egalitarian Latin American countries. The analytical framework combines Amartya Sen's capacity approach with a knowledge economics perspective. One major conclusion is that there is a need for ambitious public policy initiatives aiming explicitly at inclusiveness. The book offers a new perspective on innovation systems and innovation policy and it is of interest for innovation scholars as well as for policy makers responsible for the design of development strategies in emerging economies.' (Bengt-Ã…ke Lundvall, Aalborg University, Denmark). -- This unique book brings together new perspectives on inclusive development and the kinds of science, technology and innovation that can foster this form of development. The individual contributions provide distinct yet interrelated reflections on the diverse experiences of Latin American countries. Their common framework is determined by the assumption that economic growth, even if sustained for some time and accompanied by restorative social policies, is not always able to address inequality, a hallmark of inclusive development. -- Offering insights into the theoretical and empirical aspects of national innovation systems, this will be an extremely valuable resource for all academics and students involved with development and innovation studies.
