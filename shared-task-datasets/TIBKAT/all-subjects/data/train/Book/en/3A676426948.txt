Solar power generation : technology, new concepts & policy
"This book provides an overview of the current state of affairs in the field of solar power engineering from a global perspective. In four parts, this well-researched volume informs about (1) established solar PV (photovoltaic) technologies; (2) third-generation PV technologies based on new materials with potential for low-cost large-scale production; (3) solar cell technology based on new (third-generation) concepts such as quantum dot solar cells and nano wire solar cells using silicon and compound semiconductors; and (4) economic implications and effects, as well as policies and incentives in various countries of the world involved with solar energy implementation. Besides manufacturing facts and implementation issues, special emphasis is placed on the implications of policy measures in countries with good PV activity, such as Japan, China, India, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, the United States, and Canada. The volume is intended as a reference text for a global audience of advanced students, R& D and industry professionals, as well as investors and policy-makers with fundamental knowledge of photovoltaic technology"--
