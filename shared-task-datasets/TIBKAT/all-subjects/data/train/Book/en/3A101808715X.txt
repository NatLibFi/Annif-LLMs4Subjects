"This book is written with the intent to understand basic structural deformation and stress analysis as applied to optical systems. This text will provide the tools for first order analyses, required in the design concept phase, before getting into the intricate details of a full-up design. While finite element analysis is paramount to a successful design, the purpose of this text is not to use finite element analysis to validate the hand analysis, but rather to use hand analysis to validate the finite element models. The hand analysis forces a discipline, which aids so much in the understanding of structural behavior. It is the intent, then, not to forget such techniques"--
