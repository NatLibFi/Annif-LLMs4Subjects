Basics of qualitative research : techniques and procedures for developing grounded theory
Significantly revised, the Third Edition of this bestseller takes the form of an informal dialogue, akin to students and teachers working together in a classroom. It shows the evolution of grounded theory method over time and the influence of constructionists and post-modern trends upon the author without loosing its foundations in the grounding of data and the building theory. The Third Edition will include real data to practise with qualitative software, such as MAXQDA as well as student exercises.
