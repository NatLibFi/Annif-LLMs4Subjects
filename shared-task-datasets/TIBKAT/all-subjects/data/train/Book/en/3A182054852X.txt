HOLODECK architects - works
HOLODECK architects work on a wide variety of projects, from urban development to exhibitions. Their impressive body of work is proof that sophisticated architecture need not ignore ecological and social issues. The latter are consciously reflected from concept to realization. For example, HOLODECK have developed strategic solutions as alternatives to single-family homes, apply a sensitive approach to existing structures, and design buildings that make consistent use of natural conditions such as passive solar energy, airflow, cross-ventilation, and natural lighting.This volume also reinterprets the typical architecture book. It consists of two separate yet connected parts; the first presents sketches, plans, studies and models, while the second features texts and lavish photo series.
