Physics of electrons in solids
"Primarily aiming to give undergraduate students an introduction to solid state physics, Physics of Electrons in Solids explains the properties of solids through the study of non-interacting electrons in solids. While each chapter contains a qualitative introduction to the main ideas behind solid state physics, it also provides detailed calculations of utmost importance to graduate students. The introductory chapters contain crystallographic and quantum prerequisites. The central chapters are devoted to the quantum states of an independent electron in a crystal and to the equilibrium properties of conductors, insulators, and semiconductors. The final chapters contain insights into the assumptions made throughout, briefly describing the origin of ferromagnetism and superconductivity. The book ends with exercises and solutions based on a physics course taught by the author at Ã‰cole Polytechnique"--
