Semiconductor gas sensors
Semiconductor gas sensors have a wide range of applications in safety, process control, environmental monitoring, indoor or cabin air quality and medical diagnosis. This important book summarises recent research on basic principles, new materials and emerging technologies in this essential field.The first part of the book reviews the underlying principles and sensing mechanisms for n- and p-type oxide semiconductors, introduces the theory for nanosize materials and describes the role of electrode-semiconductor interfaces. The second part of the book describes recent developments in silicon car
