Marketing fashion : critical perspectives on the power of fashion in contemporary culture
"Fashion as a societal phenomenon has fascinated scholars in different disciplines such as history, sociology, anthropology, psychology, and marketing often from an interdisciplinary perspective. Fashion mirrors societal changes, cultural norms and values over time. It can be interpreted as mundane everyday practices, constructions of identity and status as well as being associated with the art world. In this book, the focus lies on marketing and the role of marketers when fashion permeates society in deliberate and subtle ways. This edited collection critically reflects upon the power of fashion in contemporary society and the role marketing and marketers have in the process of defining, creating and preserving fashion, but also for divesting fashion that is no longer up to date. It expands on existing knowledge to better understand the role marketers play as cultural agents in determining fashion and its markets. Contributors to the book are international, advanced scholars in marketing and sociology challenging traditional ways of thinking. In a society where problems with overproduction and overconsumption represent major challenges, the critical perspective of the role fashion plays in contemporary society and what influence marketing has for shaping fashion is not merely relevant, but necessary. This cutting edge, interdisciplinary book will appeal to scholars across a broad range of fields including fashion marketing, fashion studies, consumer culture and research, as well as sociology and anthropology. It will also be valuable for students in advanced courses of study in a variety of disciplines besides marketing"--
