Elliptic partial differential equations are important for approaching many problems in mathematical physics, and boundary integral methods play a significant role in their solution. This monograph investigates the latter as they arise in the theory characterizing stationary vibrations of thin elastic plates. The techniques used reduce the complexity of classical three-dimensional elasticity to a system of two independent variables, using eigenfrequencies to model problems with flexural-vibrational elastic body deformation and simplifying these problems to manageable, uniquely solvable integral equations. In under 250 pages, Stationary Oscillations of Elastic Plates develops an impressive amount of theoretical machinery. After introducing the equations describing the vibrations of elastic plates in the first chapter, the book proceeds to explore topics including the single-layer and double-layer plate potentials; the Newtonian potential; the exterior boundary value problems; the direct boundary integral equation method; the Robin boundary value problems; the boundary-contact problem; the null field equations. Throughout, ample time is allotted to laying the groundwork necessary for establishing the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the problems discussed. The book is meant for readers with a knowledge of advanced calculus and some familiarity with functional analysis. It is a useful tool for professionals in pure and applied mathematicians, as well as for theoretical physicists and mechanical engineers with practices involving elastic plates. Graduate students in these fields would also benefit from the monograph as a supplementary text for courses relating to theories of elasticity or flexural vibrations.
