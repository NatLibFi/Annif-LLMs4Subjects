Point-of-Care Diagnostics on a Chip
The topic of this book is the development of automated and inexpensive tools that transfer medical tests from a specialized clinical laboratory directly to the point of care, using biochip technology. Immediate access to medically relevant biochemical information for doctors and nurses promises to revolutionize patient care and dramatically lower costs. The miniaturization and automation of medical tests are made possible by biochip technology, that integrates advances in integrated circuits, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microfluidics, and electronics. The target audience for this book includes engineering and biomedical researchers who would like to develop or apply biochip technology. They can use this book as a review of the field and as a guide for the development of novel biochip technology for point of care medicine. This book can also be used as a teaching tool for engineering and biomedical students, as as well as a reference for physicians and health professionals
