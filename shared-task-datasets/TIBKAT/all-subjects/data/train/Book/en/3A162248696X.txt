Metallic and molecular interactions in nanometer layers, pores and particles : new findings at the yoctolitre level
"Metallic and Molecular Interactions in Nanometer Layers, Pores and Particles: New Findings at the Yoctolitre Level describes new developments in the nanochemistry of almost all elements of the periodic system, primarily for the years from 2006-2008." "The main benefit of this book is the actualization of the interest in the elements of the periodic system. Important qualities of ultrathin assemblies, which are not common knowledge to chemists, including magnetism, luminescence, conductivity, thermoelectricity and density functional theory are explained in an introductory chapter. Carbon yocotwells and iron nanoparticles are covered in separate chapters. Other elements are discussed, mostly in connection with interesting new nanocrystal and nanowire phenomena and the packing of molecules and atoms within yoctowells - containers with the volume of a few cubic nanometres."--BOOK JACKET
