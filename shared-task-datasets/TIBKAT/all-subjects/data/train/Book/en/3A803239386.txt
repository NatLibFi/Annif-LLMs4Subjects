Dorte Mandrup arkitekter
The Danish architect Dorte Mandrup is one of the most aesthetic originals as well as one of the most socially committed such of her generation. Her houses prevail as the best of Scandinavian tradition. Down to the very smallest detail, they communicate both with those for whom they are built as well as with the public space around them. Dorte Mandrup never builds without taking a stand. Nor is she ever dull. Her special relationship to reality is apparent in everything from the boldest play with rooms and forms to the delicate restoration of a Danish classic such as Arne Jacobsen's Munkeg√•rd School. Through a long interview, a critical essay and an illustrated presentation of her work, the book portrays Dorte Mandrup and her work, including several exciting unrealised projects. --
