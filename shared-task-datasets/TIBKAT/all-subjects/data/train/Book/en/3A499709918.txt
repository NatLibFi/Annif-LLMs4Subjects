Panel data econometrics : modelling and estimation
This paper presents a survey on panel data methods in which I emphasize new developements. In particular, linear multilevel models with a new variant are discussed. Furthermore, non-linear, nonparametric and semiparametric models are analyzed. In contrast to linear models there do not exist unified methods for nonlinear approaches. In this case FEM are dominated by CML methods. Under REM assumptions it is often possible to use the ML method directly. As alternatives GMM and simulated estimators exist. If the nonlinear function is not exactly known, nonparametric or semiparametric methods should be preferred.
