Laboratory tests for unsaturated soils
"Testing of unsaturated soils is particularly difficult and time-consuming, and guidance for engineers is minimal. This is the first book to systematically collate the various laboratory tests. It covers general background and theory along with test procedures and the interpretation of test results. Test procedures are broken down into simple stages, and the pitfalls are described. Test data and calculation methods are provided along with several numerical examples. It serves for students and researchers who are new to the field as well as for established professionals"--
