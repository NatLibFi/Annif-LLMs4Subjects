"Bad things occur and persist because of the presence of powerful beneficiaries. In this provocative and illuminating book, Imad Moosa illustrates the economic motivations behind the last 100 years of international conflict, citing the numerous powerful individual and corporate war profiteers that benefit from war. Inspired and informed by War is a Racket, the 1935 work of General Smedley Butler, the author explores historic and contemporary incidents of war profiteering, identifying individuals and groups that have increased their wealth through the supply of weaponry, mercenaries, provisions and finance in times of war.

Policy makers will also benefit from this book's comprehensive analysis of wartime policy and practice"--
