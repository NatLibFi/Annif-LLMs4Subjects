Fundamentals of Demographic Analysis
This book offers an ideal introduction to the analysis of demographic data. Inside, readers of all quantitative skill levels will find the information they need to develop a solid understanding of the methods used to study human populations and how they change over time due to such factors as birth, death, and migration.The comprehensive, systematic coverage defines basic concepts and introduces data sources; champions the use of Lexis diagrams as a device for visualizing demographic measures; highlights the importance of making comparisons (whether over time or between populations at a point in time) that control for differences in population composition; describes approaches to analyzing mortality, fertility, and migration; and details approaches to the important field of population projection.Throughout, the author makes the material accessible for readers through careful exposition, the use of examples, and other helpful features. This book's thorough coverage of basic concepts and principles lays a firm foundation for anyone contemplating undertaking demographic research, whether in a university setting or in a professional employment that takes on a demographic dimension requiring in-house training.
