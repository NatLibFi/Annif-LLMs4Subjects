Theory and Practice of Metal Electrodeposition
The authors provide new insights into the theoretical and applied aspects of metal electrodeposition. The theory largely focuses on the electrochemistry of metals. Details on the practice discuss the selection and use of metal coatings, the technology of deposition of metals and alloys, including individual peculiarities, properties and structure of coatings, control and investigations. This book aims to acquaint advanced students and researchers with recent advances in electrodeposition while also being an excellent reference for the practical electrodeposition of metals and alloys
