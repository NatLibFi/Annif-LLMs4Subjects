British imperialism : innovation and expansion 1688 - 1914
"British Imperialism" - a two volume survey which provides the most comprehensive and radical survey of the subject. Presents a new interpretation of the forces behind British imperial expansion. Volume One establishes the concept of 'gentlemanly capitalism', examines the growth of empire and many of its controversial episodes, including the partition of Africa, and concludes - against conventional wisdom - that Britain was still a dynamic imperial power on the eve of World War I.
