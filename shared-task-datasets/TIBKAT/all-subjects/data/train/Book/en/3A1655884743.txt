Financial Education for Youth : The Role of Schools
The importance of financial literacy and specifically the need to promote financial education has been recognised as an important contributor to improved financial inclusion and individualsâ€™ financial well-being as well as a support to financial stability. The relevance of financial education policies is acknowledged at the highest global policy level: in 2012, G20 Leaders endorsed the OECD/INFE High-level Principles on National Strategies for Financial Education that specifically identify youth as one of the priority targets of government policies in this domain. That same year, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Ministers of Finance identified financial literacy as a critical life skill. The publication addresses the challenges linked to the introduction of financial education in schools, and provides practical guidance and case studies to assist policy makers, and a comparative analysis of existing learning frameworks for financial education in the formal school system.
