Magnesium technology : metallurgy, design data, applications
In this book the authors present the current state of both research and technological application of magnesium. In particular, casting and wrought alloys are presented in Chapter 5, followed by a large chapter dedicated to fabrication methods. Corrosion and Protection are treated in Chapter 7. Chapter 8 discusses Engineering Requirements, Strategies and Examples for automobiles in Europe, USA, Asia and Pacific and also for Aerospace and Consumer Articles. Chapter 10 is dedicated to recycling. The experience of authors from seven countries has been combined to produce this book. The book addresses materials researchers as well as design engineers.
