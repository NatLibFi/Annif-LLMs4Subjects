Movement disorder surgery : succinct compilation of current and emerging procedures
Although there have been advances in medical therapy, a large number of patients with Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders continue to be faced with significant motor disabilities and medication-associated adverse effects. Novel treatment strategies need to be considered and surgical procedures to treat patients have been re-examined, aiding and encouraging improvements in neurosurgical techniques and brain imaging and developing microelectrode recording techniques, thus increasing the safety and accuracy of neurosurgical interventions.This volume examines neurosurgical procedures from the standpoint of their pathophysiological rationale, selection of patients that are candidates for surgery, a description of the technical aspects of surgery and what benefits and adverse effects can be anticipated. Emerging therapeutic strategies including neural transplant and gene therapy which may have an important future role are also covered. Stress is given to a multidisciplinary approach to these problems involving neurologists, neurosurgeons and physiologists. Recognized experts in the field present a balanced view of alternate methods and approaches to serve as a state-of-the-art compilation of surgical procedures.This book is of value to neurologists, neurosurgeons, physiologists and health care workers who are involved in the management of patients with movement disorders
