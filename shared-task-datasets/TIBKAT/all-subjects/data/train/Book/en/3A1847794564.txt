Biotic stress management of crop plants using nanomaterials
"This book summarizes nanotechnology-based agricultural research for crop productivity and managing various plant pathogens. It deals with the application of nano-molecules for quick, cost-effective, and precise plant disease diagnostic procedures, plant pests and disease management, nano-pesticides, and nano-diagnostics. Further, it explains nanomaterials for biotic stress management, with an insight into the synthesis and modification of nanomaterials and their potential applications in different domains for disease management. Features: Compiles current research on the Nanomaterials as well as their versatile applications in plant biotic stress management. Describes role of Nanomaterials as enzyme-mimicking nanoparticles, nano-pesticides, nano-fertilizers, and nanomaterials. Reviews day-to-day problems related to crop plants, their diagnostics and stress management. Explores trends in Nanomaterial's utility towards diagnostics, enzyme-mimicking, crop protection and their possible role in plant disease management. Includes pertinent nanomaterials including synthetic strategies, properties, chemistry, and applications. This book aims at researchers and graduate students in plant pathology, genetic engineering, environmental science, botany, bioengineering, and nanotechnology"--
