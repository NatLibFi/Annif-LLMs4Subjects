Electronic conduction : classical and quantum theory to nanoelectronic devices
"Electronic Conduction: Classical and Quantum Theory to Nanoelectronic Devices provides a concise, complete introduction to the fundamental principles of electronic conduction in microelectronic and nanoelectronic devices, with an emphasis on integrating the quantum aspects of conduction. The chapter coverage begins by presenting the classical theory of conduction, including introductory chapters on quantum mechanics and the solid state, then moving to a complete presentation of essential theory for understanding modern electronic devices. The author's unique approach is applicable to microscale and nanoscale device simulation, is particularly timely given the explosion in the nanoelectronics field. Features Self-contained. Gives a complete introduction to classical and quantum aspects of conduction in nanometer scale devices. Emphasizes core principles and provides a fully self-contained treatment of the field. Highlights the bridge to modern electronics, first presenting the physics then the engineering complications related to quantum behaviour. Includes many clear illustrative diagrams and chapter problem sets. Showcases why quantum mechanics is necessary with modern devices due to their size and corresponding electron transport properties. Gives a comprehensive overview of the literature and will enable readers to conduct their own research"--
