Atlas of Endomicroscopy
Endomicroscopy is a newly developed diagnostic tool that enables in vivo microscopy with subcellular resolution during ongoing endoscopy in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. It is a revolutionary technology. Endoscopy and pathology are no longer separate subjects and, as a result, endomicroscopy leads to a close interaction between endoscopist and pathologist. This Atlas of Endomicroscopy is the first book dealing with the new insights of endomicroscopy. It provides an overview about the development, the requirements, the technique, current indications and further possibilities of endomicroscopy.
