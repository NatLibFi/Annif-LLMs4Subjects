Zuber : two hundred years of panoramic wallpaper
"Zuber & Cie wallpapers' fame spreads far and wide (and long) from King Louis Philippe awarding Jean Zuber the Legion of Honor in 1834 to Jackie Kennedy installing Zuber's Vues de l'Am√©rique du Nord in the White House. According to France Today, the company still uses the same antique woodblocks, the same paint formulas, and the same time-honored processes to create its stunning wallpapers as it did in Jean Zuber's time. Gorgeous displays of friezes, borders, ceiling roses and architectural trompe l'oeil, photographed in homes in the U.S., France, and the U.K."--
