The Routledge handbook of religion, gender and society
"In an era, which many now recognise as 'post-secular', the role that religions play in shaping gender identities and relationships has been awarded a renewed status in the study of societies and social change. In both the Global South and the Global North, in the 21st century, religiosity is of continuing significance, not only in people's private lives and in the family, but also in the public sphere and with respect to political and legal systems. The Routledge Handbook of Religion, Gender and Society is an outstanding reference source to these key topics, problems and debates in this exciting subject area. Comprising over forty chapters by a team of international contributors the Handbook is divided into 3 parts: Critical debates for religions, gender and society: theories, concepts and methodologies issues and themes in religions, gender and society the relationships between religion and gender in different regions across the world Within these sections central issues, debates and problems are examined, including: activism, gender analysis, intersectionality and feminism, oppression and liberation, equality, bodies and embodiment, space and place, leadership and authority, diaspora and migration, marriage and the family, generation and aging, health and reproduction, education, violence and conflict, ecology and climate change, and the role of social media. The Routledge Handbook of Religion, Gender and Society is essential reading for students and researchers in religious studies and gender studies, the Handbook will also be very useful for those in related fields, such as cultural studies, area studies, politics, sociology, anthropology and history"--
