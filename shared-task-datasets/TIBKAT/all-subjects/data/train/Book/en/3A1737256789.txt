"Compost Utilization in Production of Horticultural Crops provides information for the compost industry to develop horticulture production efforts and techniques. This highly practical book contains information applicable to current production issues facing the fruit and nuts, vegetable, and ornamentals and turfgrass industry. Written by scientific experts, chapters evaluate the uses of compost for greater crop yields and decreased plant disease and pesticide application, irrigation water and fertilizer demand. Considering compost use increases carbon sequestration, the book provides guidelines on converting safe waste materials into composted soil amendments while minimizing negative impacts on the environment. Chapters cover the diversity and variability on compost uses of available feedstocks; composting methods, application rates, methods and timing; and considers the benefits of application alone or combined with other organic or inorganic nutrient sources"--
