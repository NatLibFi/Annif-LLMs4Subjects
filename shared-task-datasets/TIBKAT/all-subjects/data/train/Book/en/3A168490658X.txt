Recent results in the theory of graph spectra
The purpose of this volume is to review the results in spectral graph theory which have appeared since 1978.The problem of characterizing graphs with least eigenvalue -2 was one of the original problems of spectral graph theory. The techniques used in the investigation of this problem have continued to be useful in other contexts including forbidden subgraph techniques as well as geometric methods involving root systems. In the meantime, the particular problem giving rise to these methods has been solved almost completely. This is indicated in Chapter 1.The study of various combinatorial objec
