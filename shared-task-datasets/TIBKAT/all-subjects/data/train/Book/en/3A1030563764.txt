Chitosan-based adsorbents for wastewater treatment
Chitosan is a natural amino polymer. It is eco-friendly, biocompatible, biodegradable, cost-effective, easily available and has high potential to be utilized as an adsorbent. Because of their excellent chelating power, chitosan-based adsorbents have a very high ability to bind pollutants present in contaminated water and wastewater.
