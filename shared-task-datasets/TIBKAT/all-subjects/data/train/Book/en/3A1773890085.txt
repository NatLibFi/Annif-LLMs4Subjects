Interconnection Noise in VLSI Circuits
Interconnection Noise in VLSI Circuits addresses two main problems with interconnections at the chip and package level: crosstalk and simultaneous switching noise. It is intended to provide the notions required for understanding the problem of modeling starting from physical arguments, so that it is possible to select an appropriate interconnection model that is both simple and accurate for the type of problems arising. Later, simple models of crosstalk and switching noise are used to give an intuitive understanding of these problems. Finally, some verification and test issues related to interconnection noise are discussed. Throughout the book, the examples used to illustrate the discussion are based on digital CMOS circuits, but the general treatment of the problems is made from a fundamental point of view, so that the discussion can be applied to different technologies. The book should be of interest to chip designers, especially for digital designers dealing with interconnect problems who want a deeper explanation of these phenomena. In this sense, the book's orientation is towards giving general information rather than being a compilation of practical cases. Each chapter contains a list of references for the topics dealt with, both recent and classic ones.
