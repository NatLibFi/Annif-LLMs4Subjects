Equity and inclusion in physical education and sport
"An essential component of good practice in physical education is ensuring inclusivity for all pupils, regardless of need, ability or background. Now in a fully revised and updated new edition, Equity and Inclusion in Physical Education fully explores the theoretical and practical issues faced by physical education teachers today. The book amalgamates areas of critical debate within the world of physical education and is structured around the key topics of ability, special educational needs, gender, sexuality, social class, race and ethnicity. These issues are discussed in relation to principles of equity, equality of opportunity, pedagogy, differentiation, curriculum planning and cultural awareness. Other chapters explore contemporary themes such as healthism and obesity and values in physical education and policy, whilst a chapter new to this edition demonstrates the importance of reflexivity and critical self-reflection in good inclusive practice. As well as being a perfect introductory text for any course on inclusion or inclusive practice in physical education, the book offers invaluable, practical advice for established professionals, newly qualified teachers and trainees about how to meet equity and inclusion requirements. Examples of good practice are included throughout, as well as guidance on how to implement an inclusive PE curriculum within the school"--
