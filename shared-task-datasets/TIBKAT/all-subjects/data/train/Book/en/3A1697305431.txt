Water management in South Asia : socio-economic, infrastructural, environmental and institutional aspects
This book highlights various challenges and opportunities for water management and cooperation in South Asia. In light of increasing urbanization and development in the region and related pressure on water resources, the contributions investigate water conflictual and cooperative attitudes and gestures between countries and regions; analyse management trade-offs between nature, agriculture and urban uses; and examine water sustainable management and related policies. By studying major river basins in the region, such as Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Narmada, Godavari and Krishna, the chapters highlight socio-economic, infrastructural, environmental and institutional aspects of water scarcity in South Asia and present best practices for improved sustainable water management and security in the region.
