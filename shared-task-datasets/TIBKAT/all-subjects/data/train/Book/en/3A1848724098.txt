New research on mycorrhizal fungus
"This book focuses on an overview of new advances in mycorrhizal fungi, especially arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The book contains chapters on mycorrhizal fungi populations in mangroves, the growth of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, mycorrhizalization of pears in in vitro culture conditions, mycorrhizal mineralization of nutrients, mycorrhizal roles in improving soil health, the benefits of synergistic application of biochar and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and the ecological functions of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (invasive plant control, mycorrhizal remediation of soil pollution, and mycorrhizal farm management systems). This book can provide theoretical as well as technical support for researchers working on mycorrhizal fungi, and also provide ideas for new research on mycorrhizal fungi in the future"--
