Classical and Quantum Dynamics : from Classical Paths to Path Integrals
In the past 10 to 15 years, the quantum leap in understanding of nonlinear dynamics has radically changed the frame of reference of physicists contemplating such systems. This book treats classical and quantum mechanics using an approach as introduced by nonlinear Hamiltonian dynamics and path integral methods. It is written for graduate students who want to become familiar with the more advancedcomputational strategies in classical and quantum dynamics. Therefore, worked examples comprise a large part of the text. While the first half of the book lays the groundwork for a standard course, the second half, with its detailed treatment of the time-dependent oscillator, classical and quantum Chern-Simons mechanics, the Maslov anomaly and the Berry phase, willacquaint the reader with modern topological methods that have not as yet found their way into the textbook literature
