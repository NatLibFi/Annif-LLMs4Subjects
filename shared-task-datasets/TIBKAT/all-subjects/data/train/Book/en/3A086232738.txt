Materials science of thin films : deposition and structure
This is the first available textbook to provide comprehensive coverage of the science and technology of thin films and coatings. Developed for upper-level undergraduate and beginning graduate students, the book discusses physical and chemical vapor deposition processes; phenomena involving nucleation and growth, stress, diffusion and reaction; structural and chemical characterization techniques; and applications involving coatings, magnetic and optical recording materials, integrated optics, and quantum devices. The book includes chapters on epitaxy and surface modification in addition to discussing emerging technologies such as diamond films and high Tc superconductors. Complete problem sets are provided at the end of each chapter to facilitate self-study.
