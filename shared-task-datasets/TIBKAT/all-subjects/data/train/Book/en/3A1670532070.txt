Learning from my daughter : the value and care of disabled minds
Disability offers a significant challenge to long-held philosophical views of the nature of the good life, what offers meaning in our lives, the importance of care, & the centrality of reason, as well as questions of justice, dignity, & personhood. In this work, the author claims that living with a daughter who has multiple & significant disabilities, including cognitive disabilities, has been transformative for thinking about her training, career & research as a philosopher. Interweaving the personal voice with the philosophical, the text argues that cognitive disability should reorient us to what truly matters; raises the question of whether normalcy is necessary for a good life; & considers the ethical questions regarding prenatal testing & what it implies for understanding disability, the family, & ethically informed bioethics.
