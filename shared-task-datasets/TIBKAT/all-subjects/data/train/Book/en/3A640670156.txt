Endometrial adenocarcinoma : prevention and early diagnosis ; a color cytology atlas of the most common malignant tumor of the female genital tract
The incidence of endometrial adenocarcinoma, the most common malignant tumor of the female genital tract in developed countries, has increased over recent years. A variety of collection techniques are available to obtain cytologic or histopathologic samples for its diagnosis but their interpretation can be difficult without proper collection and preparation. However, this monograph, written by internationally recognized experts, is a most valuable educational resource for the pathologist and cytopathologist in the techniques of endometrial sampling and diagnosis. The chapters are comprehensive and logically organized, covering the epidemiology and pathogenesis of endometrial adenocarcinoma, endometrial sampling techniques and the spectrum of cytomorphologic appearance from benign through hyperplasia to adenocarcinoma of the endometrium. A separate chapter covers non-epithelial uterine malignancies. Throughout the monograph, inclusion of both cytologic and H&E histologic images allows cytohistologic correlation of lesions. In summary, this endometrial handbook seeks to clarify a difficult area of cytodiagnosis and will become an important reference text for cytopathologists, pathologists and cytotechnologists.
