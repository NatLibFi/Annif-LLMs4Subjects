Signaling and switching for packet telephony
This must-have reference on packet switching and signaling offers you an in-depth understanding of the core packet switching architectures, signaling flows, and packet formats, as well as service delivery. It describes in detail the design principles for packet telephone switches and emphasizes the benefits of a distributed architecture and separating bearer and control. Successful carrier-grade deployments of packet telephony entail much more than simply stuffing voice samples into IP packets or ATM cells. They involve deploying multiple protocols, and this book gives you a solid understanding of all protocols used and a clear sense of where individual protocols fit in a packet-based system
