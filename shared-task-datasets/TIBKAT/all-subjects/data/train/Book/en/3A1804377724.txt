Lamprophyres, lamproites and related rocks : tracers to supercontinent cycles and metallogenesis
Paleoproterozoic to Cenozoic lamprophyres, lamproites and related rock types (e.g., orangeites, kimberlites) are volatile-rich mafic magmatic rocks with a unique potential for the investigation of processes affecting mantle reservoirs. They originated from primary mantle-derived melts that intruded both cratons and off-craton regions, which were parts of former supercontinents - Columbia, Rodinia and Gondwana-Pangea. Well-known for hosting economic minerals and elements such as diamonds, base metals, gold and platinum-group elements, they are also significant for our understanding of deep-mantle processes, such as mantle metasomatism and mantle plume-lithosphere interactions, as well as large-scale geodynamic processes, such as subduction-related tectonics, and supercontinent amalgamation and break-up. This book aims to provide a timely overview of the state-of-the-art and recent advances as achieved by various research groups around the world. Mineralogical, geochemical, geochronological and isotope analyses are used to decipher the complex petrogenesis and metallogenesis of these extraordinary rocks, and unravel a complete history of tectonic events related to individual supercontinent cycles
