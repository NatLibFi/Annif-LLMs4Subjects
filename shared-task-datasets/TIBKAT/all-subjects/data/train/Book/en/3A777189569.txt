Tall buildings : structural systems and aerodynamic form
"The structural challenges in building anything that reaches 800 metres into the sky are substantial, particularly for tall buildings. The aim of this book is to provide the basic architectural and structural knowledge which must specifically be taken into account in the design of tall buildings. In presenting examples of steel, reinforced concrete, and composite structural systems for such buildings, it is argued that wind load has a very important effect on the architectural and structural design. The aerodynamic approach to tall buildings is considered in this context, as is earthquake induced lateral loading. Case studies of some of the world's most iconic buildings, illustrated in full colour, will bring to life the design challenges which they presented to architects and structural engineers. The Empire State Building, the Burj Khalifa, Taipei 101 and the Pirelli Building are just a few examples of the buildings whose real-life specifications are used to explain and illustrate core design principles, and their subsequent effect on the finished structure"--
