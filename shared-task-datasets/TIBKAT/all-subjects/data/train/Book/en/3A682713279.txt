Transnationalism in ancient and medieval societies : the role of cross-border trade and travel
This study of early transnational relations explores the routine interaction of people across the boundaries of empires, tribal confederacies, kingdoms, and city-states. It examines obstacles voyagers faced, relatively poor geographical knowledge, and dangers of a fragmented and shifting political landscape, and reveals the important political, economic, and cultural role cross-border trade and travel played in ancient society. - Provided by publisher
