Microgrids : advances in operation, control and protection
This book provides a comprehensive overview on the latest developments in the control, operation, and protection of microgrids. It provides readers with a solid approach to analyzing and understanding the salient features of modern control and operation management techniques applied to these systems, and presents practical methods with examples and case studies from actual and modeled microgrids. The book also discusses emerging concepts, key drivers and new players in microgrids, and local energy markets while addressing various aspects from day-ahead scheduling to real-time testing of microgrids. The book will be a valuable resource for researchers who are focused on control concepts, AC, DC, and AC/DC microgrids, as well as those working in the related areas of energy engineering, operations research and its applications to energy systems. Presents modern operation, control and protection techniques with applications to real world and emulated microgrids; Discusses emerging concepts, key drivers and new players in microgrids and local energy markets; Addresses various aspects from day-ahead scheduling to real-time testing of microgrids.
