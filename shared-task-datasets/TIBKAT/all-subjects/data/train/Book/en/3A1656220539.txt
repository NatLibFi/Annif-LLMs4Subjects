Optimal Control: Novel Directions and Applications
Focusing on applications to science and engineering, this book presents the results of the ITN-FP7 SADCO networkâ€™s innovative research in optimization and control in the following interconnected topics: optimality conditions in optimal control, dynamic programming approaches to optimal feedback synthesis and reachability analysis, and computational developments in model predictive control. The novelty of the book resides in the fact that it has been developed by early career researchers, providing a good balance between clarity and scientific rigor. Each chapter features an introduction addressed to PhD students and some original contributions aimed at specialist researchers. Requiring only a graduate mathematical background, the book is self-contained. It will be of particular interest to graduate and advanced undergraduate students, industrial practitioners and to senior scientists wishing to update their knowledge
