New work, new workspace : innovative design in a connected world
If you can set up your laptop anywhere, what is the meaning of the dedicated workspace? New Work, New Workspace argues that designated space is still needed, but that it is changing fast. As collaborative interaction is favoured over individual toil, with millenials and Gen X taking a very different attitude to work, and as social upheaval and technological innovation influence the form nthat the places take in which we are employed forever. Metrics for measuring the effectiveness of workspace show that good design, which is focused on the environment and wellbeing that a workforce needs, is still valued. At the same time, more generic spaces, such as co-working spaces, have to fit everyone - or at least all of the target community. Detailed case studies showcase all the places where people work - in large and small offices, in home spaces, in ateliers and workshops and architects' studios. With emphasis on the design details of the space, especially the interior, this is a must-have book providing inspiration for all types and scales of workplace. Case studies include: 80 Atlantic Avenue, Toronto, Canada by Quadrangle Nick Vesey Studio and Gallery, Kent, UK by Guy Hollaway Architects Kostner House, Castelrotto, Italy by MoDus Architects GS1 Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal by Promontorio
