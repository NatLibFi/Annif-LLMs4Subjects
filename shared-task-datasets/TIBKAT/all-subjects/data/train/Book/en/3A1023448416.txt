International Management of Research and Development brings together the most influential contributions to managing, organising and coordinating R&D and innovation on a global scale. In addition to papers on the fundamental principles, trends and drivers of international R&D, it covers strategies and operations of global R&D. It also provides an introduction to modern concepts such as knowledge networks, open innovation and virtual innovation. It is a key reference collection for professors and researchers wishing to understand the practical implications of industrial R&D and a valuable resource for chief technology and innovation officers keen to develop their corporate R&D more systematically
