Multivariable Control A Graph-Theoretic Approach
The author's main objective is to present a graph-theoretic approach to the analysis and synthesis of linear time-invariant control systems. Although all the relevant concepts of applied graph theory are introduced, the emphasis is on problems of controller synthesis: appropriate state enumeration in case of large-scale systems, structural controllability and observability, pole assignment under state feedback, disturbance rejection, noninteracting control, pole assignability by static output feedback, decentralized control and output feedback under structural constraints, and dynamic compensators. The book provides both original contributions and a comprehensive survey of the subject under consideration. Numerous examples and many figures are included to illustrate the material of the text. This research monograph is addressed to engineers engaged in control systems research and development, to graduate students specializing in control theory and to applied mathematicians interested in control problems
