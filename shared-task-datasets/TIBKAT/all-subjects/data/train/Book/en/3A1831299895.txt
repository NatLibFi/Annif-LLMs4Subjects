Foundations of antenna radiation theory : eigenmode analysis
"This book focuses on fundamentals of radiation by antennas using eigenmode theory. It begins with the introduction of Maxwell equations, the wave equations, and the theorems for electromagnetic fields. It then investigates the radiation problems in waveguide. Later chapters address the radiation problems in metal cavity resonators, generic antenna properties, and the modal analysis of typical antennas. The book concludes with a chapter that summarizes several typical array synthesis methods based on the array factors, including Schelkunoff unit circle method, Dolph-Chebyshev Method, and the Fourier transform method."--
