Heat pipes : theory, design and applications
Heat pipes are used in a wide range of applications, including electronics cooling, die-casting and injection moulding, heat recovery and energy conservation, de-icing and manufacturing process temperature control, and in domestic appliances. An essential guide for practicing engineers and an ideal text for postgraduate students, the book takes a highly practical approach to the design and selection of heat pipes. It is both a useful sourcebook and an accessible introduction for those approaching the topic for the first time. *Long established as the standard work on heat pipes *Suitable for use as a professional reference and graduate text; contains all information required to design and manufacture a heat pipe *Revised with greater coverage of key electronics cooling application and a new design guide
