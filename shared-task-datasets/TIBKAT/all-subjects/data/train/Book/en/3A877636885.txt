This book introduces fundamentals of information communication. At first, concepts and characteristics of information and information communication are summarized. And then five classic models of information communication are introduced. The mechanisms and fundamental laws of the information transmission process are also discussed. In order to realize information communication, impediments in information communication process are identified and analyzed. For the purpose of investigating implications of Internet information communication, patterns and characteristics of information communication in the Internet and Web 2.0 environment are also analyzed. In the end, case studies are provided for readers to understand the theory
