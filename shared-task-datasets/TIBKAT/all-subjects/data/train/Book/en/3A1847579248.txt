Handbook of research on safe disposal methods of municipal solid wastes for a sustainable environment
"There are several research papers in the scientific literature about specific waste streams, to quantify their effect on the environment in a wide range of fields. However, till now, no systematic efforts have been made to come out with a book which exclusively covers waste management principles and strategies in different fields and corresponding applications. We will try to club different types of waste and waste management strategies in this book so that a reader can look at the range of materials in a single book. The book chapters including results and case studies can be of reference for academicians, researchers and stakeholders for quantifying the comprehensive impacts and for planning integrated solid waste collection and treatment systems, for improving sustainability at a global level. The main objectives are: 1. To improve and manage solid waste systems through the application of modern management techniques. 2. To provide information about the application of waste management strategies in different interdisciplinary areas such as municipal solid waste, plastic waste, bio-medical wastes, hazardous wastes, e-wastes, soil remediation technologies, environmental impact assessment and many more. 3. To focus on the waste management strategies for a sustainable environment that have usually emerged in a decade or two. 4. To cover the content from basic fundamental to complex application logically for a better understanding of the reader. 5. To present the latest information on the increase in solid and hazardous wastes due to economic growth, urbanization, and industrialization. To discuss the main challenge for governments of different nations and international organizations to develop environment-friendly strategies for efficient waste management to save human beings and the environment from its adverse effects"--
