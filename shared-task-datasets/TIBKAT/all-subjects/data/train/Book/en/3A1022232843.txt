Destination resilience : challenges and opportunities for destination management and governance
"The challenge of destination management is to track and understand trends on different levels, to consider socio-economic developments and to respond proactively by addressing the paradigms of sustainability and resilience. By examining tourism and travel trends in a wide range of regions, this book offers new insight into the impacts of economic, social and environmental changes on destination management, governance and development. Topics for discussion include advances and changes in technology, the global economy and governance as well as risk management and destinations' response to disruptions. Within a rapidly changing world, emphasis is given on resilient thinking and strategic management techniques in order to unlock the inner potential of destinations to respond and adapt positively to economic, environmental and social changes. This is valuable reading for tourism students and researchers, destination managers and policy makers"--
