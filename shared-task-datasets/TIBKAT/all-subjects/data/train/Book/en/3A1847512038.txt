Making global society : a study of humankind across three eras
Klappentext: Barry Buzan proposes a new approach to making International Relations a truly global discipline that transcends both Eurocentrism and comparative civilisations. He narrates the story of humankind as a whole across three eras, using its material conditions and social structures to show how global society has evolved. Deploying the English School's idea ofprimary institutions and setting their story across three domains - interpolity, transnational and interhuman - this book conveys a living historical sense of the human story whilst avoiding the overabstraction of many social science grand theories. Buzan sharpens the familiar story of three main eras in human history with the novel idea that these eras are separated by turbulent periods of transition. This device enables a radical retelling of how modernity emerged from the late 18thcentury. He shows how the concept of 'global society' can build bridges connecting International Relations, Global Historical Sociology and Global/World History
"Barry Buzan combines the abstract approach of social science with the narrative approach of historians to convey a living sense of the human story across three eras. His detailed assessment of the material conditions and social structures of humankind transcend Eurocentrism and open the way to understanding global society"--
