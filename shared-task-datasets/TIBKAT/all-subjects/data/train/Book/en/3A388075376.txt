The culture of classroom silence
What role does silence play in adolescents' school experiences and in their developing sense of self?

Applicable to students of any age, The Culture of Classroom Silence is helpful to all teachers, from early childhood educators to university professors. Finally, this book cocnludes with suggestions for how educators and developmentalists can work together to <school the silences> and promote a culture of healthy and happy adolescents
