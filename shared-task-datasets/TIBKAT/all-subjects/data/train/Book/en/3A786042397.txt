Art as behaviour : an ethological approach to visual and verbal art, music and architecture
Why are humans so art-prone, why do we love to sing, dance, tell stories, create visual imges and beautify our environment? In the last two decades, a number of authors have tried to find answers for this intriguing question. In 1979 a study group, sponsored by Reimers foundation in Bad Homburg, was one of the first integrating neurobiology and human ethology into the discourse. Here, an additional approach is taken: performances in the various fields of art can only be well understood if one perceives them as specific forms of behaviour, as communication between the artist and the ones who are addressed by her or him. All art has a solid evolutionary base, from prehistoric to post-modern times. <engl.>
