Macroeconomics
"For intermediate courses in Economics.   A Unified View of the Latest Macroeconomic Events In Macroeconomics, Blanchard presents a unified, global view of macroeconomics, enabling students to see the connections between goods markets, financial markets, and labor markets worldwide. Organised into two parts, the text contains a core section that focuses on short-, medium-, and long-run markets and three major extensions that offer more in-depth coverage of the issues at hand. From the major economic crisis and monetary policy in the United States, to the problems of the Euro area and growth in China, the text helps students make sense not only of current macroeconomic events but also of events that may unfold in the future. Integrated, detailed boxes in the 7th Edition have been updated to convey the life of macroeconomics today; reinforce lessons from the models; and help students employ and develop their analytical and evaluative skills.
