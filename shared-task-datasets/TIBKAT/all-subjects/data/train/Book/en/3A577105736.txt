Electron microscopy of polymers
A study of polymers using Electron Microscopy(EM) necessitates special techniques, precautions and preparation methods, including ultramicrotomy. This book discusses the general characteristics of the various techniques of EM, including scanning force microscopy (AFM). It also presents examples from various classes of polymers
There are many books on electron microscopy, however, the study of polymers using EM necessitates special techniques, precautions and preparation methods, including ultramicrotomy. This book discusses the general characteristics of the various techniques of EM, including scanning force microscopy (AFM). The application of these techniques to the study of morphology and properties, particularly micromechanical properties, is described in detail. Examples from all classes of polymers are presented.
