Service business accounts for more than 75 per cent of the wealth and employment created in most developed market economies. This interdisciplinary Handbook provides a critical and multi-disciplinary review of current service business processes and practices. Broadening our understanding of services in the world economy, the editors push back the frontiers of current critical thinking by bringing together eminent scholars from economics, management, sociology, public policy, planning and geography. Chapters contribute to ongoing debates about the nature and management of service business and the characteristics of service-led economies. Disciplinary perspectives on services, services and core business processes, and the management of service business are explored. Included is a series of case studies from the EU, USA, UK and Australia. Designed as an additional text for undergraduates and postgraduate studies, this book will appeal to students and scholars seeking a multi-disciplinary understanding of this increasingly mainstream field
