Twenty-first century fiction : readings, essays, conversations

The volume also includes extensive discussions of contemporary American short stories and recent British 'pop' literature, an analysis of the similarities between the author J T LeRoy and the rapper Eminem, and an exploration of Holocaust representations in contemporary American novels.
