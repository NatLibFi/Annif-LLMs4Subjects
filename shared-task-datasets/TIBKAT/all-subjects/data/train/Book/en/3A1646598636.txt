The age of nanotechnology is upon us. Engineering at the molecular level is no longer a computer-generated curiosity and is beginning to affect the lives of everyone. Molecules which can respond to their environment and the smart machines we can build with them are and will continue to be a vital part of this 21st-century revolution. Liming Dai presents the latest work on many newly-discovered intelligent macromolecular systems and reviews their uses in nano-devices. Intelligent Macromolecules for Smart Devices features: - An accessible assessment of the properties and materials chemistry of all the major classes of intelligent macromolecules from optoelectronic biomacromolecules to dendrimers, artificial opals and carbon nanotubes - In-depth analysis of various smart devices including a critique of the suitability of different molecules for building each type of device - A concise compilation of the practical applications of intelligent macromolecules including sensors and actuators, polymer batteries, carbon-nanotube supercapacitors, novel lasing species and photovoltaic cells As an exposition of cutting-edge research against a backdrop of comprehensive review, Intelligent Macromolecules for Smart Devices will be an essential addition to the bookshelf of academic and industrial researchers in nanotechnology. Graduate and senior undergraduate students looking to make their mark in this field of the future will also find it most instructive.
