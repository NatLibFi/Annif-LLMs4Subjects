Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy : applications
This book shows how the fundamentals of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy are practically implemented and illustrates the diversity of current applications. The technique is used at various levels, and applications are presented in order of increasing difficulty, with reference to theoretically obtained results. This book features a diverse array of application examples, from fields such as ionizing radiation dosimetry, neurodegenerative diseases, structural transitions in proteins, and the origins of terrestrial life. The final chapter of this book highlights the principles and applications of the technique of ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, followed by a brief introduction to advanced EPR techniques such as electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM), hyperfine sub-level correlation (HYSCORE), pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR), and continuous wave electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) experiments.
