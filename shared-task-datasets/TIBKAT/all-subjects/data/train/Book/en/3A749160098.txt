Knowledge-Based Control with Application to Robots
This monograph considers the integration of knowledge-based soft control with hard control algorithms. As a specific application, the development of a knowledge-based controller for robotic manipulators is addressed. Servo control alone is known to be inadequate for nonlinear and high-speed processes including robots. Furthermore, knowledge-based control such as fuzzy control, when directly included in the servo loop, has produced insatisfactory performance in research robots. These considerations, along with the fact that human experts can very effectively perform tuning functions in process controllers, form the basis for the control structure proposed in this work. The book is suitable for students, researchers and practising professionals in the fields of Automatic Control and Robotics. The material is presented in simple and clear language with sufficient introductory information. Someone with an undergraduate knowledge in dynamics and control should be able to use the book without any difficulty
