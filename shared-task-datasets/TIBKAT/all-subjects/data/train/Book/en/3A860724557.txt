Das Wiener Modell : Wohnbau f√ºr die Stadt des 21. Jahrhunderts
Building on urbanistic and social aspects, Vienna has not only constructed new housing projects with distinctive qualities throughout the city but also founded and revitalized entire quarters. With their historical roots in 'Red Vienna,' these concepts signal dynamic opportunities to enhance the quality of life in a contemporary metropolis by creating model living environments. 'The Vienna Model: Housing for the Twenty-First-Century City' shines the spotlight on sixty prototypical projects from the last hundred years, with a special focus on the public art that has complemented the city's housing since the First Republic. Around 300 illustrations and accompanying texts provide a comprehensive overview of the 'Vienna Model'
