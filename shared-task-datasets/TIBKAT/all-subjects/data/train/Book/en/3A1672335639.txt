Omega-6/Omega-3 essential fatty acid ratio: the scientific evidence : 37 tables
Studies on the evolutionary aspects of diet and molecular studies included in this volume indicate that human beings evolved on a diet that was balanced in the essential fatty acids (EFA). In fact, the ratio of omega–6/omega–3 EFA was 1/1 whereas present day diets in both developed and developing countries have a much higher ratio, between 5/1 and 50/1. Additional studies show that a high ratio of omega–6/omega–3 EFA is detrimental to health and may lead to the development of chronic diseases. Improving the dietary ratio by decreasing the omega–6 fatty acids and increasing the omega–3 fatty acids is essential for brain function and for the management of cardiovascular disease, arthritis and cancer. A ratio of 4/1 or less leads to lower dosage and to the reduction of adverse effects of drugs.This volume should be of interest to a large and varied audience of researchers in academia, industry, and government; cardiologists, geneticists, immunologists, neuroscientists, and cancer specialists; as well as nutritionists, dietitians, food scientists, agriculturists, economists and regulators
