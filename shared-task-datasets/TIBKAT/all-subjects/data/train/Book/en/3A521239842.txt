Applying strategic environmental assessment : good practice guidance for development co-operation
Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is one of the main tools available to achieve integration of the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programs.  This Guidance volume explains the benefits of using SEA in development cooperation and sets out key steps for its application based on recent experiences.  Twelve different entry points are identified for the practical application of SEA in development cooperation.  For each entry point, the text provides a guidance note: a checklist of questions and hands-on case studies.  Evaluation and capacity development for SEA processes are also addressed.--Publisher's description
