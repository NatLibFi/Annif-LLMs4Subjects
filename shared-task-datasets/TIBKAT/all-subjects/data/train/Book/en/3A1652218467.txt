The finite element method in engineering
Finite Element Analysis is an analytical engineering tool developed in the 1960's by the Aerospace and nuclear power industries to find usable, approximate solutions to problems with many complex variables. It is an extension of derivative and integral calculus, and uses very large matrix arrays and mesh diagrams to calculate stress points, movement of loads and forces, and other basic physical behaviors. Students will find in this textbook a thorough grounding of the mathematical principles underlying the popular, analytical methods for setting up a finite element solution based on those mathematical equations. It quickly bridges that knowledge to a host of real-world applications--from structural design, to problems in fluid mechanics and thermodynamics. Professional engineers will benefit from the introduction to the many useful applications of finite element analysis, and will gain a better understanding of its limitations and special uses.
