As the importance and value of information increases, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is rapidly evolving and taking centre stage in everyday life in the 21st century. This is particularly evident in the transport sector, where ICT is greatly influencing our mobility and travel choices as well as travel experience. In this context, ICT for Transport examines the opportunities, threats, underlying principles and practical issues faced when deploying ICT for transport applications, especially in the quest to achieve sustainable transport. Focusing on infrastructure, people and processes, the contributors to this book use diverse case studies from around the world to illustrate the challenges faced by academics, practitioners and policy makers alike. The contents and bibliography provide up-to-date knowledge and expertise drawn from state of the art research in Europe, America, Asia and Africa. ICT for Transport is a valuable source of information for those aiming to be at the forefront of the evolving field of ICT for transport. This analysis of the various threats and opportunities will assist them in making more informed decisions about the future use of ICT for transport and for the benefit of society.
