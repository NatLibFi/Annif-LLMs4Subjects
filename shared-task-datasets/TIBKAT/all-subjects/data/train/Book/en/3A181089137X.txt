Architecture and urban transformation of historical markets : cases from the Middle East and North Africa
"This book explores the complex relationship between societies, architecture and urbanism of market halls, traditional souqs, bazaars, and Speciality Street markets in the Middle East and North Africa. It addresses how these trading environments influence perceptions of place and play an extended social, political and religious role while adapting to their local climates. Through Archival research and social science methodologies, this book records and maps markets in urban fabrics, expanding on practices underlying the push towards historical listings and the development of markets as landmarks in the urban fabric. The role of markets in delivering sustainable place-making strategies and influencing the development of cities' socio-economic and historical strength is addressed as key to their survival in the urban fabric and as place-making landmarks for preserving tangible and intangible heritage. Going beyond heritage and conservation studies, this book discusses how positioning and restoring markets challenges urban renewal policies, access to public space planning, environmental sustainability, security of food supply, cultural heritage, and tourism. This is an ideal read for those interested in history of urban development, architecture and urban planning, and architectural heritage"--
