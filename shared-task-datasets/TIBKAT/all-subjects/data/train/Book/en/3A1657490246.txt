Spectral Theory and Applications of Linear Operators and Block Operator Matrices
Examining recent mathematical developments in the study of Fredholm operators, spectral theory and block operator matrices, with a rigorous treatment of classical Riesz theory of polynomially compact operators, this volume covers both abstract and applied developments in the study of spectral theory. These topics are intimately related to the stability of underlying physical systems and play a crucial role in many branches of mathematics as well as numerous interdisciplinary applications. By studying classical Riesz theory of polynomially compact operators in order to establish the existence results of the second kind operator equations, this volume will assist the reader working to describe the spectrum, multiplicities and localization of the eigenvalues of polynomially compact operators
