ActivEpi Companion Textbook : A supplement for use with the ActivEpi CD-ROM
This Companion Textbook supplements the ActivEpiCD-ROM, sold separately. The ActivEpiCD-ROM provides a multimedia presentation of concepts, commonly taught in an introductory epidemiology course. ActivEpimixes a full array of media to motivate, explain, visualize and apply epidemiological concepts. Virtually all of the material on the ActivEpiCD-ROM is included in the Companion Textbook.

The Textbook can be used as a hardcopy reference of the textual materials contained on the CD-ROM, as a resource for the practice exercises, as a general reference, or even a self-contained textbook.The ActivEpi CD-ROM uses:Video to instill real-world motivation for learning and applying epidemiological conceptsNarrated Expositions to teach the concepts using high-quality audio synchronized with text, pictures, and animationsQuizzes to provide self-evaluation of basic terms and conceptsData Desk to provide practice applying the methods learned to real dataNavigational Tools such as a dynamic table of contents, index and glossary, to allow easy-to-use methods for working through contentWeb Links to augment the material on the CD with complementary content authored by others.ActivEpiincludes 15 lessons and over 50 hours of content via more than 250 launchable activities and homework exercises.
