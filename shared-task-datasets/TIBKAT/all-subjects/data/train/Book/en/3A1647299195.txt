Squamous Cell Head and Neck Cancer : Recent Clinical Progress and Prospects for the Future
Leading expert physicians and investigators from around the world review the state-of-the-art in the management of squamous cell head and neck cancer, with emphasis on coordinating different treatment modalities. The authors address several surgical issues, including laser-based surgery, larynx preservation approaches, salvage surgery, and neck management after non-operative treatment. They also discuss definitive radiation for larynx cancer, brachytherapy, altered fractionation radiation, intensity modulated radiation therapy, and the importance of tumor hypoxia, as well as the role of chemotherapy in sequential, concurrent, and adjuvant multi-modality treatment schedules. Other topics of special interest include targeted and gene therapies, multimodality management of nasopharyngeal cancer, chemoprevention, toxicity modification, quality of life outcomes, symptom palliation, and epidemiology.
