Metal Science: Past, Present and Future
Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters BCI (WoS).Metals, because of their inherent properties, have been in service to mankind from the Early Periods. Metal craft started turning into metal science in the 19th Century and got matured in 20th century. The present book, to the best of author’s memory, is the first attempt to present the history of metal science in one volume, covering both extractive and physical metallurgy. The book is aimed as a supplementary text book for students in metallurgy and materials science and also selectively for general readers. After a brief introduction (Chapter 1), the second and third chapters are devoted to extractive metallurgy. The chapters related to physical metallurgy (4th to 6th) are written in a sequence such that the description of structures is given first, before highlighting the properties of metals and alloys. The final chapter ‘Future Trends’ highlights various topics in contemporary metal science. Drawing on his long academic career in metallurgy, Upadhyaya traces the history of metal science in a single volume. It can serve as a supplementary textbook for students in metallurgy and materials science, he says, but also as a narrative for general readers interested in the history of science and technology. He covers extractive metallurgy from the perspectives of pyrometallurgy, electrometallurgy, and hydrometallurgy. Then he turns to physical metallurgy, looking at the structure of metals and alloys; phase equilibria, diffusion, defects, and properties; and phase transformation, recrystallization, and grain growth. A final chapter considers future trends.
