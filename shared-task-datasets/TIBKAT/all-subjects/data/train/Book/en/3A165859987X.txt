Mathematics for Natural Scientists II : Advanced Methods
This book covers the advanced mathematical techniques useful for physics and engineering students, presented in a form accessible to physics students, avoiding precise mathematical jargon and laborious proofs. Instead, all proofs are given in a simplified form that is clear and convincing for a physicist. Examples, where appropriate, are given from physics contexts. Both solved and unsolved problems are provided in each chapter. Mathematics for Natural Scientists II: Advanced Methods is the second of two volumes. It follows the first volume on Fundamentals and Basics.
1. Elements of linear algebra -- 2. Complex numbers and functions -- 3. Fourier series -- 4. Special Functions -- 5. Fourier Transform -- 6. Laplace Transform -- 7. Curvilinear coordinates -- 8. Partial differential equations of mathematical physics -- 9. Calculus of variations.
