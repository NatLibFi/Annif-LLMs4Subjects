Handbook of speckle interferometry
Fundamentals of interference -- Speckle interference and displacement -- Electronic speckle pattern interferometers -- Illumination and displacement detection -- Transient displacement analysis -- Phase detection -- Overview of applications
This handbook introduces speckle techniques to nonspecialists to help them understand the basic principles of speckle interferometry. The book mainly focuses on the use of speckle patterns with direct phase-measuring methods that produce an instantaneous phase. The major electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) techniques are presented using simplified mathematical notation that includes rigid-body and standard-body displacements to estimate object pose changes with six degrees of freedom. Additionally, the adoption of temporal phase unwrapping instead of spatial phase unwrapping is promoted. This handbook also includes a summary of recent industrial applications, with an update on current research in the ESPI field.
