Shell mechanics : theory and applications
"This book is devoted to shells, a natural or human construction, whose modelling as a structure was particularly developed during the 20th century, leading to current numerical models. It highlights the very strong link between the deformation of geometric surfaces and the mechanics of shells. The book is based on the knowledge acquired by the reader in structural mechanics and provides the necessary information on the geometry of surfaces. It is particularly aimed at students in the fields of engineering using mechanics, as well as professionals wishing to deepen their knowledge of shells"--
