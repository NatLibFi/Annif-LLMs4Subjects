This book covers current developments in membrane-based technologies for the successful recovery of food bioactive ingredients and molecules. Chapters explore emerging technologies, such as microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, and membrane distillation, for the selective concentration and food ingredients from food by-products, as well as techniques, such as pervaporation, for the selective separation and recovery of aroma compounds. The text provides one of the first examinations of other membrane-based technologies, such as liquid membranes (microemulsions), membrane distillation (MD) and pervaporation (PV), as thermal driven membrane processes. The separation of metabolites from microalgae and fermentation broths using membrane technologies is also covered. Researchers in food science, pharmaceutics and biotechnology looking to stay up-to-date on bioactive recovery, as well as membranologists exploring new applications for membrane-based technologies, will find this text a useful resource.
