Design and practice of cruise ports
This book focuses on design technologies and practical engineering applications in connection with cruise ports and terminals. After a brief introduction to cruise ships and global cruise ports, it addresses the location, structure and layout of cruise terminals, the technologies involved, cruise terminal buildings and supporting facilities. The book also explores practical engineering cases, including projects that the authors have worked on, such as the Shenzhen Prince Bay and Shanghai Wusongkou International Cruise Terminal projects. Systematically discussing the design and engineering aspects of domestic and international cruise terminals, the book offers a practical reference guide for engineers, researchers, practitioners and policymakers in relevant fields.
