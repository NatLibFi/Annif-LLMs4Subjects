Physical Principles of Electron Microscopy : An Introduction to TEM, SEM, and AEM
"Scanning and stationary-beam electron microscopes have become an indespensible tool for both research and routine evaluation in materials science, the semiconductor industry, nanotechnology and the biological, forensic, and medical sciences. This book provides an introduction to the theory and current practice of electron microscopy, aimed primarily at undergraduates who need to learn how the basic principles of physics are applied in an important area of science and technology that has contributed greatly to our knowledge of life processes and ""inner space."" However, it will be equally valuable for technologists who make use of electron microscopes and for graduate students, university teachers and researchers who need a concise text that deals with the basic principles of microscopy. Less technical but broader in scope than other microscopy textbooks, Physical Principles of Electron Microscopy is appropriate for undergraduates and technologists with limited mathematical training."
