Urbanisation of the sea : from concepts and analysis to design
The book tells the story of the sea-land continuum based on the case of the North Sea - one of the world's most industrialized seas, in which the Netherlands plays a central role. The space of the North Sea is almost fully planned and has been simultaneously loaded with the task of increased economic production both from new and traditional maritime sectors, and emptied of cultural significance.0 0Through different projects from academia, art, literature and practice, from analysis to design, the book explores synergies for designing this new spatial realm.0Port-city expert Carola Hein, professor of History of Architecture & Urban Planning at Delft University of Technology, and Nancy Couling, associate professor at the Bergen School of Architecture and researcher of the urbanized sea, combine forces to guide the reader through this complex and fascinating topic
