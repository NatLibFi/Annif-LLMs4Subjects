Granular computing : analysis and design of intelligent systems
"Given the nature of the technology, granular computing cuts across a broad range of engineering disciplines. This self-contained book builds upon introductory ideas and provides with illustrative examples that help facilitate a better grasp of more advanced material and enhance its overall presentation. It will be of a particular appeal to those engaged in research and practical developments in computer, electrical, industrial, manufacturing, and biomedical engineering. It will be equally well suited for those coming from non-technical disciplines where information granules assume a highly visible position"--
