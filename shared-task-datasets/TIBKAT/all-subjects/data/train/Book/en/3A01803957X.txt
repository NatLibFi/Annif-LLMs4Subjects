Bumblebees
Bumblebees are attractive and conspicuous insects and can often be identified without being caught. Their behaviour is readily observed and they form ideal subjects for field studies. This book introduces bumblebee natural history, emphasising topics that offer scope for further research. The keys, supported by illustrations in colour and black and white, are designed to enable the reader to name the British species easily and reliably. By including keys, techniques and references as well as ideas, the book aims to encourage and facilitate individual studies of bumblebee biology by students at schools and universities and others interested in natural history
