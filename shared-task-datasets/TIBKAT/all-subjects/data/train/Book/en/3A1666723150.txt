This textbook demonstrates the strong interconnections between linear algebra and group theory by presenting them simultaneously, a pedagogical strategy ideal for an interdisciplinary audience. Being approached together at the same time, these two topics complete one another, allowing students to attain a deeper understanding of both subjects. The opening chapters introduce linear algebra with applications to mechanics and statistics, followed by group theory with applications to projective geometry. Then, high-order finite elements are presented to design a regular mesh and assemble the stiffness and mass matrices in advanced applications in quantum chemistry and general relativity. This text is ideal for undergraduates majoring in engineering, physics, chemistry, computer science, or applied mathematics. It is mostly self-containedâ€”readers should only be familiar with elementary calculus. There are numerous exercises, with hints or full solutions provided. A series of roadmaps are also provided to help instructors choose the optimal teaching approach for their discipline
