Advanced design techniques and realizations of microwave and RF filters
The fundamentals needed to design and realize microwave and RF filters. Microwave and RF filters play an important role in communication systems and, owing to the proliferation of radar, satellite, and mobile wireless systems, there is a need for design methods that can satisfy the ever-increasing demand for accuracy, reliability, and shorter development times. Beginning with a brief review of scattering and chain matrices, filter approximations and synthesis, waveguides and transmission lines, and fundamental electromagnetic equations, the book then covers design techniques for microwave and
