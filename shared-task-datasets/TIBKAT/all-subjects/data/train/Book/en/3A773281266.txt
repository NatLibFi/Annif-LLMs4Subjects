The definitive guide to ARM Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 processors
This book presents the background of the ARM architecture and outlines the features of the processors such as the instruction set, interrupt-handling and also demonstrates how to program and utilize the advanced features available such as the Memory Protection Unit (MPU).   Chapters on getting started with IAR, Keil, gcc and CooCox CoIDE tools help beginners develop program codes.  Coverage also includes the important areas of software development such as using the low power features, handling information input/output, mixed language projects with assembly and C, and other advanced topics.
