Micro frontends in action
Micro frontends deliver the same flexibility and maintainability to browser-based applications that microservices provide for backend systems.  You design your project as a set of standalone components that include their own interfaces, logic, and storage.  Then you develop these mini-applications independently and compose them in the browser.  "Micro Frontends in Action" teaches you to apply the microservices approach to the frontend. You'll start with the core micro frontend design ideas. Then, you'll build an e-commerce application, working through practical issues like server-side and client-side composition, routing, and maintaining a consistent look and feel. Finally, you'll explore team workflow patterns that maximize the benefit of developing application components independently
