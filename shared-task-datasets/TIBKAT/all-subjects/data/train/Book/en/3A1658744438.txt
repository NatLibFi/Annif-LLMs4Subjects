Teaching Gender? : Zum reflektierten Umgang mit Geschlecht im Schulunterricht und in der Lehramtsausbildung
School is not a gender-neutral space. Asymmetrical gender relations and stereotypes are multiply (re-)produced in teaching material, teaching, and interactions. A reflected pedagogy is needed to counteract the differentiations cementing gender dualism. Based on Gender Studies and starting with MINT-subjects, language teaching, aesthetic subjects, and »society learning«, this book presents concrete analyses and exemplary implementations for school teaching. In addition, the contributions introduce tested concepts for the integration of gender into teacher training.
