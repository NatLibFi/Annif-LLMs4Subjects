Nanomedicine in diagnostics
"Nanomedicine is a new and rapidly evolving field of research at the crossroads of nanoscience and medicine. The capability to exploit nanotechnological tools for novel functional materials, biosensors, and cell based detection systems has opened new vistas in medical diagnostics. Research on new sensing concepts has opened the door to a wide variety of microsystems for clinical applications. Such devices are extremely useful for delivering diagnostic information in a fast, simple, and low cost fashion. This book is one of the first to focus on the use of nanotechnology in diagnostics. Designed as a broad survey of the field, this book combines contributions by international experts from divergent fields of study ranging from single molecule diagnostics to cell based systems. The chapters cover: - Nanoscale Driving Mobile Sensing Automata - Nanopore for Single-Molecule Investigation - Protein Nanostructures in Diagnosis - Electrochemical Sensor Systems - Conductive Polymers in Diagnostics - Biosensors Based on Olfactory Receptors - Cell-Based Drug Screening - Nanotechnology for Capture of Tumor Cells - Detection of biofilms "--Provided by publisher
