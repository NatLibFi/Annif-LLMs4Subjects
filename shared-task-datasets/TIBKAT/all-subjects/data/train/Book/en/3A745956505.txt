As a study of lyric poetry, in English, from the early modern period to the present, this book explores one of the most ancient and significant art forms in Western culture as it emerges in its various modern incarnations. Combining a much-needed historicisation of the concept of lyric with an aesthetic and formal focus, this collaboration of period-specialists offers a new cross-historical approach. Through eleven chapters, spanning more than four centuries, the book provides readers with both a genealogical framework for the understanding of lyric poetry within any particular period, and a necessary context for more general discussion of the nature of genre. Presents the idea of lyric poetry as historically situated and as an evolving and changing concept. Covers a broad historical time-span from the early modern period to the present. Engages with questions recently raised as to the historical character and nature of lyric poetry.--Publisher description
