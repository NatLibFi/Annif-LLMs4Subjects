This is an unusual book. It is a book of exercises, exercises in digital imaging engineering, one of the most important and rapidly developing branches of modern information technology. Studying digital imaging engineering, mastering this profession and working in the area is not possible without obtaining practical skills based on fundamental knowledge in the subject. The current book is aimed at providing technical support for this. It contains exercises on all major topics of digital imaging for students, researchers in experimental sciences and, generally, all practitioners in imaging engineering
