Iteration : episodes in the mediation of art and architecture
"This edited volume considers the ways in which multiple stages, phases, or periods in an artistic or design process have served to arrive at the final artefact, with a focus on the meaning and use of the iteration, over the end result. In examining iteration, this collection of essays seeks to explore ways of theorising ideas surrounding series of objects, whether the original, the unfinished, the interim object, or the copy, vis-à-vis antecedents and successive exemplars. It asks how a closer look at iterations of a single object-type - whether art, architecture, or design - might reveal new insight into the production of other objects and the production of thought alike. Written by an international team of contributors, offering a range of perspectives, it will look broadly at meaning and insight offered by the iteration, the multiple, and the design process, for historical research and its methods"--
