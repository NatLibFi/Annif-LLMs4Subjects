MVRDV buildings
Since they amazed the world with their design of the Dutch pavilion at the 2000 World Expo, MVRDV has been regarded as one of the worlds top architecture firms. The architects of MVRDV are famous for their visionary research and thought-provoking projects such as Pig City and Grand Paris. In 20 years of practice the office has also realized a stunning portfolio of buildings and urban plans, including Market Hall Rotterdam, Villa VPRO, WOZOCO, Balancing Barn and Mirador Madrid. How do these buildings perform? What are the philosophy, logic and thinking behind the visually imminent MVRDV concepts? And whats life like in a blue house, on an orange tribune, in a vertical shopping street, in housing silos and inside a mountain of books?
