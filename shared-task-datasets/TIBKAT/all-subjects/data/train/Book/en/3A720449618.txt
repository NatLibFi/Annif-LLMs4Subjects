In search of a forgotten architect : Stefan Sebök ; 1901 - 1941
Stefan Sebök was a Hungarian-born architect who worked with Walter Gropius in Dessau and Berlin in the late 1920s, and then with fellow Hungarian emigré László Moholy-Nagy on his famous Light Prop, and later still moved to the Soviet Union to work with the constructivist architects Ginzburg, the Vesnin brothers and El Lissitzky. In between he carried out numerous projects of his own and found himself central to a key generation of emerging modern architects in Dresden, Berlin and Moscow. Details of this life are revealed through this book written by Sebök's niece, Lilly Dubowitz, who meticulously pieces together clues and details of her uncle's life and work as if like an architectural detective
