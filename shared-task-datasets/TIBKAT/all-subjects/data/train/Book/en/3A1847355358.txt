The Oxford handbook of expertise and democratic politics
This volume brings together investigations from social scientists, philosophers, and legal scholars into the political dimensions of expertise. It is motivated by the sense that growing mistrust in experts represents a danger to democratic politics today, insofar as science and experts are integral to the checks and balances on which liberal democracies depend for their health and functioning. At the same time, the contributions to this handbook recognize that some of the processes that undermine expert authority, including the diversification and socialization of expertise, have had the salutary effect of democratizing expertise. This tension - between the erosion of democracy and the democratization of expertise - animates The Oxford Handbook of Expertise and Democratic Politics, which explores the current debates and new directions in the field.
