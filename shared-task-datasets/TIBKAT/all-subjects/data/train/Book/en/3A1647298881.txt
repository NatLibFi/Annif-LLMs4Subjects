Endocrinology : Basic and Clinical Principles
Maintaining the original goal of the first edition to integrate the basic science of endocrinology with its physiological and clinical principles, this new edition succinctly summarizes in 450 pages the latest findings on hormone secretion and hormone action, as well as all the most recent insights into the physiology and pathophysiology of hormonal disorders. Coverage extends across the entire spectrum of endocrinology-from mammalian cells, plants, and insects to animal models and human diseases-with much increased coverage of diabetes and metabolism. Highlights include cutting-edge discussions of appetite disorders, obesity, reproductive failure, control of thyroid function, hormone action in man and the lower species, and the mechanisms subserving hormone secretion.
