Soft-switching technology for three-phase power electronics converters
Electric power systems: design and analysis, Revised printing / Mohamed E. El-Hawary -- Power system stability / Edward W. Kimbark -- Analysis of faulted power systems / Paul M. Anderson.
"This book focuses on soft switching three-phase converters for applications such as renewable energy and distribution power systems, AC power sources, UPS, motor drives, battery chargers, and more. It begins with an introduction to fundamental of soft switching technology for three-phase conversion. The author provides basic knowledge of soft-switching technology to give readers necessary background information for the following subjects. The book goes on to describe applying soft-switching technology to three-phase rectifiers, then three-phase grid inverters. The author provides porotypes and expermients of each. Finally, the book investigates the impact of silicon carbide (SiC) devices on soft-switching three converters, studying the improvement of efficiency and power density by introducing SiC to soft-switching three-phase converters"--
