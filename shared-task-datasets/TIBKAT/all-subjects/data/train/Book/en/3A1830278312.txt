Soil physics : an introduction
"For undergraduate and graduate students interested in learning basic soil physics and its application to environment, soil health, water quality and productivity, this book provides readers with the basic principles of water and solute transport through vadose zone, the theory behind transport and step-by-step guidance on how to use current computer models in the public domain. Students will develop a deeper understanding of the fundamental processes within the soil profile that control water infiltration, redistribution, evapotranspiration, drainage, and erosion. The second edition features two new chapters, highlights new problems, new computer models, and remediation"--
