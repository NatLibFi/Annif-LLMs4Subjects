Nonlinear science : the challenge of complex systems
This book gives a general, basic understanding of the mathematical structure &quot;nonlinearity&quot; that lies in the depths of complex systems. Analyzing the heterogeneity that the prefix &quot;non&quot; represents with respect to notions such as the linear space, integrability and scale hierarchy, &quot;nonlinear science&quot; is explained as a challenge of deconstruction of the modern sciences. This book is not a technical guide to teach mathematical tools of nonlinear analysis, nor a zoology of so-called nonlinear phenomena. By critically analyzing the structure of linear theories, and cl
