Building cities to last : a practical guide to sustainable urbanism
"Building Cities to LAST presents the myriad issues of sustainable urbanism in a clear and concise system, and supports holistic thinking about sustainable development in urban environments by providing four broad measures of urban sustainability that differ radically from other, less long-lived patterns: these are Lifecycle, Aesthetics, Scale, and Technology (LAST). This framework for understanding the relationship between these four measures and the essential types of infrastructure - grouped according to the basic human needs of Food, Shelter, Mobility, and Water - is laid out in a simple and easy to understand format.
