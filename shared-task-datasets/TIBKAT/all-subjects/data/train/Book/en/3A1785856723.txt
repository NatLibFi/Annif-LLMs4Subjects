Rebirth of form-type : selectied works of Scenic Architecture Office
Scenic Architecture Office always starts with responding to needs from body & mind, nature, and society, and tries to establish a balanced and dynamic relevance among them through ontological orders composed by space-time and tectonics. This collection includes 12 representative works in its 15 years of practice, and each work contains design concept, sketches, tectonic details, and photos. The works are categorised in ?Courtyard Settlement?, ?Extension of Homes?, and ?Free Units?. ?Courtyard Settlement? refers to reconstruction of the spatial formtype of courtyard; ?Extension of Homes?, expansion of the traditional house formtype; and ?Free Units? test of the new formtype. Through explorations of the formtype, they hope to bridge the past, present and future to make architecture a carrier of cultural memory and the times? energy, and a balanced and dynamic connection between human, nature and society
