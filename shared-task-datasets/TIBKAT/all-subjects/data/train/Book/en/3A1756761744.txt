Sovereign debt diplomacies : rethinking sovereign debt from colonial empires to hegemony
This volume offers two important contributions to the literature on sovereign debt. First, it provides a unique genealogy of debt collection practices in terms of their availability, acceptability and efficacy.

Second, this volume reflects critically on the relevance of neo-colonial interpretations in recent cases of sovereign debt disputes
