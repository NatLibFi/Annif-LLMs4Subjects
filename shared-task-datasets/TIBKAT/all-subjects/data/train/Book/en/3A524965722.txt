Macrocyclic Chemistry : Current Trends and Future Perspectives
Macrocyclic Chemistry: Current Trends and Future Perspectives illustrates essential concepts in this expanding research field covering both basic and applied studies. Written by well-known experts from around the world, the topics of the chapters range from new macrocyclic architectures with different functions and self-assembly processes through to the modeling and dynamics of such systems. The content also reflects on application possibilities in analytical chemistry, separation processes, material preparation and medicine. Thus this book serves as a creative source of research strategies and methodic tools. Providing an excellent overview of the field, this book will be a valuable resource for researchers in industry and academic institutions as well as for teachers of science and graduate students. This book is devoted to the long-standing tradition of the International Symposia on Macrocyclic Chemistry (ISMC) and published to coincide with the 30th meeting, Dresden, Germany.
