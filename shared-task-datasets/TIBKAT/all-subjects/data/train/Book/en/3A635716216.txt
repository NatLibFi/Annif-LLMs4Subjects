Thin-film organic photonics : molecular layer deposition and applications
"This book describes how photonic/electronic properties of thin films can be improved by precise control of atomic and molecular arrangements, and demonstrates the prospect of the artificial materials with atomic/molecular-level tailored structures, especially featuring MLD and conjugated polymers with multiple quantum dots (MQDs) called as polymer MQDs. It also describes other related topics including organic electro-optic materials, optical switches, optical circuits, the selforganized lightwave network (SOLNET), a resource-saving heterogeneous integration process, etc. Some applications of the artificial organic thin films to photonics/ electronics are proposed in the fields of optical interconnects within boxes of computers, optical switching systems, solar energy conversion systems, and bio/medicalphotonics like the photodynamic therapy. I would like to thank Prof. K. Asama of Tokyo University of Technology for his helpful advice and encouragement, Drs. K. Kiyota, A. Matsuura, T. Hayano, W. Sotoyama, and S. Tatsuura of Fujitsu Laboratories, Ltd., and students who joined Yoshimura Laboratory in Tokyo University of Technology for their collaboration in the research work that contributes to the writing of this book. I would also like to thank colleagues in Fujitsu Computer Packaging Technologies (FCPT), Inc., San Jose, California. Finally, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Ms. Ashley Gasque and Ms. Catherine Giacari of CRC Press/Taylor & Francis for giving me the great opportunity to write this book, and Ms. Amy Blalock, Mr. John Edwards, and Mr. Michael Davidson for their help in completing this book"--
