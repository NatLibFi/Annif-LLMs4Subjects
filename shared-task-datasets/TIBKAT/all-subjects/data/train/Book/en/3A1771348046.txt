R companion for sampling : design and analysis
"The R Companion for Sampling: Design and Analysis, designed to be read alongside Sampling: Design and Analysis, Third Edition by Sharon L. Lohr (SDA; 2022, CRC Press), shows how to use functions in base R and contributed packages to perform calculations for the examples in SDA. No prior experience with R is needed. Chapter 1 tells you how to obtain R and RStudio, introduces basic features of the R statistical software environment, and helps you get started with analyzing data. Each subsequent chapter provides step-by-step guidance for working through the data examples in the corresponding chapter of SDA, with code, output, and interpretation. Tips and warnings help you develop good programming practices and avoid common survey data analysis errors. R features and functions are introduced as they are needed so you can see how each type of sample is selected and analyzed. Each chapter builds on the knowledge developed earlier for simpler designs; after finishing the book, you will know how to use R to select and analyze almost any type of probability sample"--
