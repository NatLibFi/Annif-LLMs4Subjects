Digital signal processing and applications with the OMAP-L138 eXperimenter
"This is the most comprehensive text available on hands-on teaching of Digital Signal Processing, and the first book to feature the new floating point DSP development system to be promoted by the Texas Instruments University Program: the OMAP L138 eXperimenter and CCS v4 (which replaces the C6713DSK). Using a practical approach, the book provides a large number of real-time example programs that use actual input and output signals and give visible and audible results. It is an excellent teaching aid for professors wishing to teach DSP via laboratory experiments and for students or engineers wishing to study DSP using the inexpensive OMAP L138 eXperimenter"--
