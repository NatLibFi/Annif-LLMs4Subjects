Perl 6 Fundamentals : A Primer with Examples, Projects, and Case Studies
Gain the skills to begin developing Perl 6 applications from the ground up in this hands-on compact book. You’ll learn enough to get started building with Perl 6, using Perl 6’s gradual typing, handy object orientation features, powerful parsing capabilities, and human-usable concurrency. After a short introduction, each chapter develops a small example project, explaining the Perl 6 features used. When the example is done, you’ll explore another aspect, such as optimizing further for readability or testing the code. Along the way you’ll see Perl 6 basics, such as variables and scoping; subroutines; classes and objects; regexes; and code testing. When you’ve mastered the basics,Perl 6 Fundamentals moves onto more advanced topics to give you a deeper understanding of the language. You’ll learn, amongst other things, how to work with persistent storage, how to generate good error messages, and how to write tricky applications such as a file and directory usage graph and a Unicode search tool. You will: Get coding with Perl 6 Work on several hands-on examples and projects Integrate Python libraries into your Perl 6 programs Parse INI files using regexes and grammars Build a date time converter Carry out refactoring and other automated tests
