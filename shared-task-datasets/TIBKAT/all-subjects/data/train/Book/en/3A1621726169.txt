Translation and migration
Translation and Migration examines the ways in which the presence or absence of translation in situations of migratory movement has currently and historically shaped social, cultural and economic relations between groups and individuals. Acts of cultural and linguistic translation are discussed through a rich variety of illustrative literary, ethnographic, visual and historical materials, also taking in issues of multiculturalism, assimilation, and hybridity analytically re-framed. This is key reading for students undertaking Translation Studies courses, and will also be of interest to researchers in sociology, cultural studies, anthropology and migration studies.
