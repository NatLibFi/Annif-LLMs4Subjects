Measurement systems and sensors
"This complete resource on systems and sensors for industrial measurement provides in-depth, practical knowledge of new wireless measurement systems and wireless GSM interfacing that can't be found in any other book. This hands-on reference shows practitioners how to select the right analog-to-digital conversion method best suited for a specific measurement problem, determine whether to use a cable or wireless interface for optimum data transmission, and speed up the data transmission rate in a measurement system with IEEE-488 interface by using the high-speed protocol HS-488. Moreover, the book introduces new, cost-effective measurement technology utilizing WWW servers and LAN computer networks."--Jacket
