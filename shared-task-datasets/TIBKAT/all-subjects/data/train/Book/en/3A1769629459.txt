Structural materials : behavior, testing and evaluation
This book discusses the properties, characterization procedures, and analysis techniques of various structural materials. It presents the latest design considerations and uses of engineering materials as well as theories for fully understanding them through numerous worked mathematical examples. The book gradually builds the concept of materials and the principles of material classifications and their response to different physical disturbances, and finally, about the selection methods based upon the test results of the standard methods to choose appropriate materials for various engineering applications. The principles and related theories predicting the response of different structural materials are introduced in a concise and logical manner. A number of illustrations and examples are also given in all chapters for the help of potential readers. The book will be useful for practicing engineers, researchers, and students in the area of civil engineering, especially structural engineering and allied fields.
