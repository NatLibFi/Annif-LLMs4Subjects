E-Librarian Service : User-Friendly Semantic Search in Digital Libraries
This book introduces a new approach in designing E-Librarian Services. Such a system is able to retrieve multimedia resources from a digital library in a more efficient way than by browsing through an index, or by using a simple keyword search. It combines recent advances in multimedia information retrieval with aspects of human-machine interfaces. The user can enter his question in natural language. The premise is that more pertinent results would be retrieved if the search engine understood the sense of the user's query. The returned results are then logical consequences of an inference rather than of keyword matchings. An E-Librarian Service simulates a human librarian. Hence, it does not return the answer to the user's question, but it retrieves the most pertinent document(s), in which the user finds the answer to his question. Also, an E-Librarian Service always proposes a solution to the user, even if the system concludes that there is no exhaustive answer.
