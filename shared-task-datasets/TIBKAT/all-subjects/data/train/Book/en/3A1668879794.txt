Fundamentals of structural analysis
"This text introduces engineering and architectural students to the basic techniques required for analyzing the majority of structures and the elements of which most structures are composed, including beams, frames, trusses, arches, and cables. Although the authors assume that readers have completed basic courses in statics and strength of materials, we briefly review the basic techniques from these courses the first time we mention them. To clarify the discussion, we use many carefully chosen examples to illustrate the various analytic techniques introduced, and whenever possible, we select examples confronting engineers in real-life professional practice"--
