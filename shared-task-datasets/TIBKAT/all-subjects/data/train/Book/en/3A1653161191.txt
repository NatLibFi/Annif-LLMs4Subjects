Hot embossing : theory and technology of microreplication
Replication processes -- Molding materials for hot embossing -- Molded parts -- Hot embossing process -- Modeling and process simulation -- Hot embossing technique -- Hot embossing tools -- Microstructured mold inserts for hot embossing -- Hot embossing in science and industry
This book is an overview of replication technology for micro- and nanostructures, focusing on the techniques and technology of hot embossing, a scaleable and multi-purpose technology for the manufacture of devices such as BioMEMS and microfluidic devices which are expected to revolutionize a wide range of medical and industrial processes over the coming decade. The hot embossing process for replicating microstructures was developed by the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology) where the author is head of the Nanoreplication Group. Worgull fills a gap in existing information by fully detailing the technology and techniques of hot embossing. He also covers nanoimprinting, a process related to hot embossing, with examples of actual research topics and new applications in nanoreplication. *A practical and theoretical guide to selecting the materials, machinery and processes involved in microreplication using hot embossing techniques. *Compares different replication processes such as: micro injection molding, micro thermoforming, micro hot embossing, and nanoimprinting *Details commercially available hot embossing machinery and components like tools and mold inserts
