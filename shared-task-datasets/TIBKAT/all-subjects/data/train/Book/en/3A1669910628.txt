"The book describes hazardous waste industries, sources of waste generation, characterization and treatment processes/ methods, technique and technology to deal with the treated waste as per the prescribed standard. Advanced treatment based on the microbial remediation, plant-based decontamination, rhizoremediation and nano-based remediation is also explained. Advances in treatment technology using biotechnological tools/bionanotechnology for removal of contaminants are described. This volume will help readers to develop of bio-nano-based technology, which can be transferred from lab to land, pilot to commercial scenario"--
