The digital journey of banking and insurance / Volker Liermann, Claus Stegmann (editors) ; Volume 3: Data storage, data processing and data analysis
This book, the third one of three volumes, focuses on data and the actions around data, like storage and processing. The angle shifts over the volumes from a business-driven approach in "Disruption and DNA" to a strong technical focus in "Data Storage, Processing and Analysis", leaving "Digitalization and Machine Learning Applications" with the business and technical aspects in-between. In the last volume of the series, “Data Storage, Processing and Analysis”, the shifts in the way we deal with data are addressed.
