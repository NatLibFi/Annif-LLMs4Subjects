Lost landscapes
"Rotterdam landscape architects LOLA (Lost Landscapes) design and study landscapes that are forgotten, derelict or on the verge of change. Since its founding in 2006, the office has worked on conceptual as well as realized projects in the city, on the outskirts and in the countryside."--
