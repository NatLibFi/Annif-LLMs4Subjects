Economic analysis for EU accession negotiations : agri-food issues in the EU's eastward expansion
The expanding membership of the EU means significant changes for accession countries' international trade relations, affecting imports, exports, tax revenues, government expenditures and domestic regulatory regimes. There are also significant ramifications for the EU budget. This book is a valuable comprehensive tool kit for analysing the economic effect of EU accession, using examples from the most complex sector for both candidate countries and the EU itself - agriculture. The authors provide a complete set of market configurations with which to analyse harmonisation with the Common Agriculture Policy in both the long and short run. It also provides insights into the questions of regulatory harmonisation in areas of food safety, animal and plant health, the environment, animal welfare, technical standards and the protection of intellectual property. Background is provided on the EU and its policies, economic developments in transition economies and the accession process. The book also provides a unique insight into how negotiating positions can be developed. A wide audience will find this book of great value and interest including policymakers and analysts in governments and related think tanks, businesses and consultancy firms trading in the EU. Scholars and researchers of European studies, international trade and agriculture will also find the book invaluable
