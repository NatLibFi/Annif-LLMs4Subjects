Insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) : theory and design
"Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT): Theory and Design covers basic theory and design aspects of IGBTs, including the selection of silicon, achieving targeted specifications through device and process design, and device packaging. After laying the groundwork in MOS and bipolar disciplines, the author constructs the foundation of power device physics necessary for clearly understanding the subject matter."--Jacket
