Physical foundations of quantum electronics
"Most parts of the book contain the lecture courses taught by David Klyshko at Moscow State University, namely, quantum electronics, nonlinear optics and quantum optics. In every section, the main focus is on observable effects and their physical interpretation. The book emphasizes analogies and relations between seemingly different phenomena and different fields of quantum electronics."--pub. desc
