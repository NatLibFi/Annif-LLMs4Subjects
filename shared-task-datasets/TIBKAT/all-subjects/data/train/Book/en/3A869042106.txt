Magnetic resonance technology : hardware and system component design
Magnetic resonance systems are used in almost every academic and industrial chemistry, physics and biochemistry department, as well as being one of the most important imaging modalities in clinical radiology. The design of such systems has become increasingly sophisticated over the years. Static magnetic fields increase continuously, large-scale arrays of receive elements are now ubiquitous in clinical MRI, cryogenic technology has become commonplace in high resolution NMR and is expanding rapidly in preclinical MRI, specialized high strength magnetic field gradients have been designed for studying the human connectome, and the commercial advent of ultra-high field human imaging has required new types of RF coils and static shim coils together with extensive electromagnetic simulations to ensure patient safety.This book covers the hardware and engineering that constitutes a magnetic resonance system, whether that be a high-resolution liquid or solid state system for NMR spectroscopy, a preclinical system for imaging animals or a clinical system used for human imaging
