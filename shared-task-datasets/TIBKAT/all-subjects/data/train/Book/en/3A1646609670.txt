Oculoplastics and Orbit
Considerable progress has been made in various fields of oculoplastic surgery, e.g. the development of endoscopic transcanalicular as well as endonasal minimal invasive techniques in lacrimal surgery, the use of muscle pedunculated scleral flaps to improve implant motility without pegging. This extraordinary volume enhances your understanding of Graves ophthalmopathy and helps you to define situations suitable for radiotherapy and more differentiated surgical strategies such as orbital fat resection, balance bony decompression and lid lengthening procedures. It exemplifies progress in aesthetic surgery such as endoscopic brow lift and soft techniques for mid-face rejuvenation and discusses general risks of infectious disease transmission using allografts as well as current concepts in the management of conjunctival neoplasms. Not only general and clinical ophthalmologists, but also ophthalmic and plastic surgeons will find this volume a stimulating resource that keeps them up to date on new developments in the interesting field of oculoplastic surgery.
