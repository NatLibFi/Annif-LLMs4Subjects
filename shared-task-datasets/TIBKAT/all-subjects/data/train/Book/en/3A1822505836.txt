This newly updated volume of the Encyclopedia of Complexity and Systems Science (ECSS) presents several mathematical models that describe this physical phenomenon, including the famous non-linear equation Korteweg-de-Vries (KdV) that represents the canonical form of solitons. Also, there exists a class of nonlinear partial differential equations that led to solitons, e.g., Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP), Klein-Gordon (KG), Sine-Gordon (SG), Non-Linear Schrödinger (NLS), Korteweg-de-Vries Burger’s (KdVB), etc. Different linear mathematical methods can be used to solve these models analytically, such as the Inverse Scattering Transformation (IST), Adomian Decomposition Method, Variational Iteration Method (VIM), Homotopy Analysis Method (HAM) and Homotopy Perturbation Method (HPM). Other non-analytic methods use the computational techniques available in such popular mathematical packages as Mathematica, Maple, and MATLAB. The main purpose of this volume is to provide physicists, engineers, and their students with the proper methods and tools to solve the soliton equations, and to discover the new possibilities of using solitons in multi-disciplinary areas ranging from telecommunications to biology, cosmology, and oceanographic studies.
