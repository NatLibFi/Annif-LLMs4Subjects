Handbook of management and creativity
This Handbook draws on current research and case studies to consider how managers can become more creative across four aspects of their business: innovation, entrepreneurship, leadership and organisation – and does so in an accessible, engaging and user-friendly format. -- That managers need to be ‘more creative’ has become something of a mantra, but little has been written about what this actually means and how it might be achieved. The Handbook of Management and Creativity presents a coherent collection of original chapters from leaders in multiple disciplines, combining current research pre-occupations with practical solutions and strategies in the field. Each chapter combines new research, practical examples and tools, case studies, visual aids, and questions for discussion, designed to stimulate debate and reflection in the workplace or in the seminar room. -- The book is thematically organised, making it easy to navigate for the general reader and allowing managers, university course directors and students to extract readings relevant to their individual requirements. It is suitable for managers across all industries and advanced students of management and creativity, as well as researchers interested in applying creativity research to industry.
