Soil microenvironment for bioremediation and polymer production
"The book consists of 21 chapters by subject matter experts and is divided into four parts: Soil Microenvironment and Biotransformation Mechanisms; Synergistic effects between substrates and Microbes; Polyhydroxyalakanoates: Resources, Demands and Sustainability; and Cellulose based biomaterials: Benefits and challenges. Included in the chapters are classical bioremediation approaches and advances in the use of nanoparticles for removal of radioactive waste. The book also discusses the production of applied emerging biopolymers using diverse microorganisms. All chapters are supplemented with comprehensive illustrative diagrams and comparative tables"--
