"Are there connections between the structures of political systems and types of scientific advice to policymaking? This volume unites case studies from the Netherlands, France, the European Union and the USA that provide an overview of different Institutional arrangements focusing on issues such as the independence and balance of advice. Common to all is the question which forms of advice can increase the rationality of policymaking without loss of political legitimacy."--Jacket
