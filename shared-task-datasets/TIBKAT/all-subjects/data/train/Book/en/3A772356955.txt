As  well as showcasing the most dynamic and aesthetically bold work in the  discipline, the book also provides a strong critical through-line,  exploring lighting design from the perspectives of sustainability,  technology, form and structure.With full colour imagery and  insightful commentary this is the ultimate guide to the diverse world of  contemporary lighting design"--
