The science and engineering of cutting : the mechanics and processes of separating, scratching  and puncturing biomaterials, metals and non-metals
The materials mechanics of the controlled separation of a body into two or more parts - cutting -- using a blade or tool or other mechanical implement is a ubiquitous process in most engineering disciplines, be it mechanical, civil, medical, food or process based, and a surprising number of engineers are involved in cutting and the design of cutting tools. There are a wide range of books available on the cutting of metals, but no other text is devoted to the cutting of materials generally, the mechanics of which (toughness, fracture, deformation, plasticity, tearing, grating, chewing, etc) have wide ranging implications for engineers, medics, manufacturers, and process engineers, making this text of particular interest to a wide range of engineers and specialists. * The only book to explain and unify the process and techniques of cutting in metals AND non-metals. The emphasis on biomaterials, plastics and non-metals will be of considerable interest to many, while the transfer of knowledge from non-metals fields offers important benefits to metalcutters. * Comprehensive, written with this well-known author's lightness of touch, the book will attract the attention of many readers in this under-served subject * The clarity of the text is further enhanced by detailed examples and case studies, from the grating of cheese on an industrial scale to the design of scalpels
