The tragedy of Great Power politics
Klappentext: A decade after the end of the Cold War, both policy makers and academics foresaw a new era of peace and prosperity, an era when democracy, open trade, and mutual trust would join hands to banish war from the globe. With insight worthy of Machiavelli's "The Prince", John Mearsheimer exposes the truth behind this idyllic illuscion: in a world where no international authority reigns above states, great powers invariably seek to gain power at one another's expense and to establish themselves as the dominant state.
