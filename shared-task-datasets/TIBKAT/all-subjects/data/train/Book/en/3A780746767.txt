Water for energy and fuel production
"Water in all its forms may be the most important solvent in the development of the new "Energy Economy". This book illustrates that as energy and fuel industries diversify, we are transitioning to an economy where water will play a more and more important role in the supply of energy and fuels. It discusses the role of water in the production of raw fuels such as oil, gas, coal, uranium, and biomass. It also describes methods for how supercritical water and steam are vital for the conversion of raw fuels to synthetic fuels. "--
