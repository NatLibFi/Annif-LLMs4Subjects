Pocket Guide to Critical Care Pharmacotherapy
Because critical care medicine is a cutting-edge medical field that is highly evidence-based, studies are continuously published altering the approach to patient-care. This creates a challenge for many clinicians to keep abreast of the latest data. This book serves as a pocket bedside medical reference, providing the unique element of supplying a step-by-step design that will guide clinicians in giving their patient optimal, evidence-based care. The book provides practical points based on both real patient-care experience and review of current medical literature with the aim of providing guidance to all critical care clinicians. By covering the most common ailments observed in critically ill medical patients and using an algorithmic, easy-to-follow, step-by-step approach while focusing on pharmacotherapeutics with a greater in-depth review of optimal pharmacological principles, clinicians with varying degrees of training will be able to follow. Additionally assessment tools (e.g., sedation assessment), preventative strategies (e.g., stress-related mucosal damage prophylaxis), drug-induced disease states, and pharmacological pearls (e.g. [from sample chapters], neuromuscular blockade reversal, adverse effects of blood transfusions, and propylene glycol content of various medications) are provided, along with up to date references and web-links for many disease states so clinicians who want to review the available literature are able to do so. One order to make the book easy to reference in an emergency or ICU setting, individual chapters utilize one table per disease state. The current books on the market do not emphasis specific disease therapeutics  this book offers very specific context for the therapeutic treatment and management of a disease.
