Introduction to electromagnetic waves with Maxwell's equations
"Written in an accessible style, and based on the author's extensive experience of teaching electromagnetics, this text "simply" presents the well-known topics that all electromagnetics instructors would include in their syllabus. The text is carefully tuned to be relevant to an audience of engineering students who have been exposed to the basic curriculum in linear algebra and multivariate calculus. Maxwell's equations form the backbone of the book; as they are developed step by step in consecutive chapters, related electromagnetic phenomena, as well as accompanying mathematical tools, are discussed simultaneously. Whilst the book will appeal to both undergraduate and post/graduate students, no prerequisite electromagnetics knowledge is required, as it starts with the most fundamental concepts. However, it is expected that the reader is familiar with basic calculus."--
