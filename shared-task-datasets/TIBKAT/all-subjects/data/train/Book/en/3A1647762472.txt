Serial murder and the psychology of violent crimes
This book brings together an international collection of research literature on the topics of criminal profiling and serial violent crime by integrating the respected insights of both scholars and practitioners from around the globe. It explains etiological factors and psychological mechanisms to reveal criminal motives.
The phenomena of serial violent crime has long plagued human civilizations. Far from being a contemporary notion unique to Western societies, serial murderers and other offenders who repeatedly engage in violent crimes such as rape or arson are examples of extreme criminal aberrations that exist in cultures around the world. This book assembles the collective expertise of an international group of scholars and practitioners who seek to explain the psychiatric, psychological and criminological factors that may account for the perpetration of these abhorrent crimes.  The topics covered in this text examine the motivational dynamics of offenders including such dimensions as their apparent behavioral normalcy, sensational interests, sadism, narcissism, commonalties, gender and age patterns. Beyond psychological and etiological factors the topics encompassed by this book also consider investigative techniques, procedures, limitations and failures encountered with these forms of crime. This volume is likely to become an essential reference for forensic scientists, psychiatrists, psychologists and criminal justice, legal and law enforcement personnel involved in the investigation and prosecution of serial violent crimes.
