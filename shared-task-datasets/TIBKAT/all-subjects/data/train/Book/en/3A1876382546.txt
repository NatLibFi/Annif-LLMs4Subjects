Theory of electrostatic waves in hyperbolic metamaterials
This book covers electrostatic properties of hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs), a fascinating class of metamaterials which combine dielectric and metal components. Due to the hyperbolic topology of the isofrequency surface in HMMs, the so-called resonance cone direction exists, and as a result, propagation of quasi-electrostatic waves, or more commonly, electrostatic waves close to the resonance cone with large wave vectors, is possible. However, the investigation of electrostatic wave properties in HMMs is largely overlooked in most works on the subject, and the purpose of this monograph is to fill this gap. This book gives a thorough theoretical treatment of propagation, reflection, and refraction of electrostatic waves in HMMs of various dimensions and geometries. It will be of interest to students and researchers who work on electrical and optical properties of metamaterials.
