Design basis accident analysis methods for light water nuclear power plants
"This book captures the principles of safety evaluation as practiced in the regulated light-water reactor nuclear industry, as established and stabilized over the last 30 years. It is expected to serve both the current industry and those planning for the future. The work's coverage of the subject matter is the broadest to date, including not only the common topics of modeling and simulation, but also methods supporting the basis for the underlying assumptions, the extension to radiological safety, what to expect in a licensing review, historical perspectives and the implication for new designs. This text is an essential resource for practitioners and students, on the current best-practices in nuclear power plant safety and their basis. Contributors of this work are subject matter experts in their specialties, much of which was nurtured and inspired by Prof. Larry Hochreiter, a prominent nuclear safety pioneer"--
