Subpixel mapping for remote sensing images
"Subpixel mapping is a technology that generates a fine resolution land cover map from coarse resolution fractional images by predicting the spatial locations of different land cover classes at the subpixel scale. This book provides readers with a complete overview of subpixel image processing methods, basic principles, and different subpixel mapping techniques based on single or multi-shift remote sensing images. Step-by-step procedures, experimental contents, and result analyses are explained clearly at the end of each chapter. Real-life applications are a great resource for understanding how and where to use subpixel mapping when dealing with different remote sensing imaging data.
