This book explains the importance of the history of economic thought in the curriculum of economists, whereas most discussions of this kind are devoted only to explaining why such study is of value simply to the individual economist. Steven Kates reaches out past the individual to explain the crucial importance of the history of economic thought in the study of economics itself; without its history at the core of the curriculum, he contends, economics is a lesser subject, less penetrating, less interesting and of much less social value. The author argues that it is the orientation that historians of economic thought give to economics in general that may be one of HETs greatest virtues, with the mainstream continuously challenged because historians of economics keep bringing other, perhaps wrongly neglected, economic traditions into the conversation. This book clarifies not just why anyone who wishes to understand economic theory must understand the history of economics but also, and much more importantly, why the history of economic thought must be preserved as a core component within the economics curriculum if economic theory is to progress. This fascinating and thought-provoking book will prove invaluable reading for academics, researchers, lecturers and students across the expansive economics field
