Toward 6G : a new era of convergence
"The current deployment of 5G cellular systems is exposing the inherent limitations of the wireless communication system, compared to its original premise as an enabler for Internet of Everything (IoE) applications. IoE services will require an end-to-end design of communication, control, and computation functionalities, which to date has been largely overlooked. These 5G drawbacks are currently spurring worldwide activities focused on defining the next-generation 6G wireless system that can truly integrate far-reaching applications ranging from autonomous systems to XR and haptics. 6G will not be a mere exploration of more spectrum at high-frequency bands, but it will rather be a convergence of upcoming technological trends. While traditional applications will remain central to 6G, the key determinants of system performance will be the following four new applications domains: (i) multisensory XR applications, (ii) connected robotics and autonomous systems, (iii) wireless brain-computer interaction, and (iv) blockchain and distributed ledger technologies"--
