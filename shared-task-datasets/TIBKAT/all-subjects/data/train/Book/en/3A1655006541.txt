Mathematica as a Tool : An introduction with practical examples
The software program Mathematica combines symbolic and numerical calculations, plots, graphics programming, list calculations and structured documentation into a unified, interactive environment. It is therefore an ideal tool for engineers, scientists and applied mathematicians. This book gives an introduction into the program and shows with practical examples how even more complex problems can be solved with just a few commands. The first part gives an overview of the main commands of Mathematica. It is followed by a study of the detailed syntax and the evaluation process. This knowledge is the basis for programming in Mathematica, which constitutes the third part of the book
