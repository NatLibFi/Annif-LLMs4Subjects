The space of culture : towards a neo-kantian philosophy of culture ; Cohen, Natorp, and Cassirer
Sebastian Luft explores the philosophy of culture championed by the Marburg School of Neo-Kantianism. Following a historical trajectory from Hermann Cohen to Paul Natorp and through to Ernst Cassirer, he defends the attractiveness of a philosophical culture in the transcendental veinn, in the manner in which the Marburgers intended to broaden Kantâ€™s approach.
