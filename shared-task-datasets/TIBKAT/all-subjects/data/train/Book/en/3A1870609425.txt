"This is a comprehensive, overarching, interdisciplinary book, and a valuable contribution to a unified view of visualization, imaging, and mapping. It covers a variety of modern techniques, across an array of spatial scales, with examples of how to map, monitor and visualize the world in which we live. The authors give detailed explanations of the techniques used to map and monitor the built and natural environment and how that data, collected from a range of scales and cost options, is translated into an image or visual experience. It is written for technical, professional, and academic readers alike, such as geographers, architects, geologists, and planners"--
