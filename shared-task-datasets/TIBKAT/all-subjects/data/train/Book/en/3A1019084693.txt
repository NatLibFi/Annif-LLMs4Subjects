The global factory : networked multinational enterprises in the modern global economy
This book brings together the key works on the global factory - a unique approach to the modern global economy that focuses on the orchestrating role of key multinational firms that control an integrated international network of independent firms. This analysis is conducted at global system level, at the level of global value chains and for individual firms. These three levels represent consistent, nested approaches to the analysis of pressing issues of the modern international economy. The Global Factory examines the internalisation theory of the multinational enterprise as it applies to global interfirm networks, and pays particular attention to multinational firms from emerging countries. It examines the governance and performance of global factories, their internationalisation and knowledge management strategies and the potential for multinational firms to address societal failures. The role of technology, the use of tax havens by Chinese multinationals and the division of entrepreneurial labour between global factories and smaller local firms are all explored as fascinating aspects of the overarching theory. This is an essential point of reference on Buckley's work on the global factory for academics and students of business, as well as managers of multinational firms and public policy makers
