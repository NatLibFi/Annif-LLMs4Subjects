Graphene nanoelectronics : metrology, synthesis, properties and applications
Graphene is a perfectly two-dimensional single-atom thin membrane with zero bandgap. It has attracted huge attention due to its linear dispersion around the Dirac point, excellent transport properties, novel magnetic characteristics, and low spin-orbit coupling. Graphene and its nanostructures may have potential applications in spintronics, photonics, plasmonics and electronics. This book brings together a team of experts to provide an overview of the most advanced topics in theory, experiments, spectroscopy and applications of graphene and its nanostructures. It covers the state-of-the-art in tutorial-like and review-like manner to make the book useful not only to experts, but also newcomers and graduate students.
