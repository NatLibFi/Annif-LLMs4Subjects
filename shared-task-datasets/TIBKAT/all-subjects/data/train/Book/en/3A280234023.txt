Feminist visions of development : gender, analysis and policy
The UN Conference of Women, held in Beijing in 1995, provided a forum for the exploration of current feminist topics. This volume presents papers from that conference, discussing in detail issues in gender studies and development, from rural and urban poverty to population and family planning. Taken together, the papers aim to show how factors such as famine, sweat-shops, environmental degradation and religion influence the lives of women in different countries.
