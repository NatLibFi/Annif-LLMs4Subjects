Endoscopy for GSp(4) and the Cohomology of Siegel Modular Threefolds
The geometry of modular curves and the structure of their cohomology groups have been a rich source for various number-theoretical applications over the last decades. Similar applications may be expected from the arithmetic of higher dimensional modular varieties. For Siegel modular threefolds some basic results on their cohomology groups are derived in this book from considering topological trace formulas
