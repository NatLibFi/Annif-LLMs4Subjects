Advanced topics in biometrics
Biometrics is the study of methods for uniquely recognizing humans based on one or more intrinsic physical or behavioral traits. After decades of research activities, biometrics, as a recognized scientific discipline, has advanced considerably both in practical technology and theoretical discovery to meet the increasing need of biometric deployments. In this book, the editors provide both a concise and accessible introduction to the field as well as a detailed coverage on the unique research problems with their solutions in a wide spectrum of biometrics research ranging from voice, face, fingerprint, iris, handwriting, human behavior to multimodal biometrics. The contributions also present the pioneering efforts and state-of-the-art results, with special focus on practical issues concerning system development. This book is a valuable reference for established researchers and it also gives an excellent introduction for beginners to understand the challenges --
