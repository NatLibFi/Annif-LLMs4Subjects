Adobe Edge animate : using web standards to create interactive websites
"Interactive web animations have become the standard among websites. Whether the goal is to create a simple animated product presentation or a sophisticated, choreographed interactive animation, the requirements for authoring tools are becoming more and more complex.  Until now, Adobe Flash dominated the motion world of the web. But proprietary systems are out and open web standards are in - the current trend steadily moves toward HTML and CSS. This is where Adobe Edge Animate comes in. With Edge, Adobe has created a new tool that allows web designers to create interactive and animated HTML content designed to work with any standard browser.  This book shows users what is possible with Edge. It covers every step of the Edge workflow from creation to publication, including how results are implemented into websites and how they are expanded with JavaScript/jQuery. Author Simon Widjaja discusses the basics of working with the Adobe Edge Animate interface and tools, and reveals countless insider tips and tricks, including smart add-ons and extensions that go beyond the official functional range of the program, such as EdgeCommons with SoundJS, CMS, Parallax, and Logging.  With this book as your guide, you will learn how to expand the possibilities of Adobe Edge Animate"--
