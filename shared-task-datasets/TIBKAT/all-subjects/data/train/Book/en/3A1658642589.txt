Lâ€™ historiographie tardo-antique et la transmission des savoirs

In particular, the transmission of documents (civil and ecclesiastical, authentic and apocryphal) is studied, the impact of differences in genre, as well as how historical, anthropological, ethnographic, astronomical, and medical notions are reshaped in new cultural traditions
