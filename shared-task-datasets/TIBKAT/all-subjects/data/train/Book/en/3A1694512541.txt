Spectrum sharing : the next frontier in wireless networks
"The proposed book will provide a comprehensive treatment of the principles and architectures for spectrum sharing by expert authors from leading academia, industry and regulation authorities. The book starts with the historic form of cognitive radio, goes into current standardized forms of spectrum sharing, reviews all technical ingredients that may arise in spectrum sharing approaches, and finishes with policy and implementation aspects, and an outlook. Being the most recent book on the topic, it contains all the latest standardization trends, such as MulteFire, LTE-Unlicensed (LTE-U), LTE WLAN integration with Internet Protocol security tunnel (LWIP) and LTE/Wi-Fi aggregation (LWA)  Includes substantial trials and experimental results, as well as system-level performance evaluation results. Contains a dedicated chapter on spectrum policy reinforcement and one on the economics of spectrum sharing by renowned MIT Professor William Lehr"--
