IUTAM Symposium on Unsteady Separated Flows and their Control : Proceedings of the IUTAM Symposium “Unsteady Separated Flows and their Control“, Corfu, Greece, 18-22 June 2007
Unsteady separated flows are an important topic in theoretical and applied mechanics. The IUTAM Symposium held in Corfu in 2007 (and following on from a previous meeting in Toulouse in 2002) aimed at achieving a unified approach which will regroup the knowledge coming from theoretical, experimental, numerical simulation, modeling and flow-control aspects of separated unsteady flows with respect to incompressible and compressible flow regimes. Topics addressed include physical aspects of the dynamics related to unsteady separation in incompressible flows and flows under compressibility effects
