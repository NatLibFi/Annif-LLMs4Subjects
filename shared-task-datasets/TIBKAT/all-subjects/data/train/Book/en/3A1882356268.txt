Time use in economics
Beginning in 1965 Nobel Laureate Gary Becker realized that shadow prices, which reflect the value of one's time, may be at least as important as money prices. Implications of his resulting theory of time allocation were not tested until much later when governments began to collect extensive data on how individuals utilized their time. Time Use in Economics contains original research on new aspects of time use compiled by Daniel S. Hamermesh, a long-time path-breaking labor economist leader in analyzing time use data, and Solomon W. Polachek, a pioneer in gender-related labor market research. Topics include how time is used by type of household, how time is used in particular jobs, how time is used in high versus low growth geographic areas, how time is used after a job loss, how time use affects individual wellbeing, as well as how to interpret the blurred boundaries of time use between leisure and work, a growing issue as more individuals, especially mothers, work from home.
