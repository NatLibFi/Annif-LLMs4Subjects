Atlas of Sarcoidosis : Pathogenesis, Diagnosis, and Clinical Features
Sarcoidosis is a complex multisystem disease. Shortness of breath (dyspnea) and a cough that won't go away can be among the first symptoms of sarcoidosis, but sarcoidosis can also show up suddenly with the appearance of skin rashes and other dermatoses. An Atlas of Sarcoidosis: Pathogenesis, Diagnosis and Clinical Features combines illustrations and clinical images of the authors' extensive practices, so that readers have unparalleled access to a comprehensive collection of sarcoidosis images. The atlas is designed to complement and provide a visual supplement to already existing texts on sarcoidosis. Each organ involvement is dealt in a brief and easy to comprehend manner. Various radiographic and laboratory abnormalities are then linked to the clinical features in order to encourage a smooth and easy practical integration at the bedside and to help practising pulmonologists, dermatologists and other clinicians who require a comprehensive visual encyclopedia of sarcoidosis images.
