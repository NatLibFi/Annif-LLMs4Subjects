Air pollution governance in East Asia
"Focussing on Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and Mainland China, the contributors to this book analyse various cases of air pollution within East Asia. Air pollution in East Asia is a major health risk, which also has damaging impacts on the environment leading to impacts on society, economic growth and welfare. While existing laws and policies have made progress in alleviating air pollution in each country in the region, the protection of favourable environments and he resolution of transboundary air pollution problems have become major targets of regional cooperation. Combining perspectives from social sciences and science, technology, society studies, the contributors to this book examine both the technical and socio-economic-political aspects of these challenges, through a range of case studies from around the region. A valuable read for researchers and policy-makers looking at air pollution and transboundary governance challenges within and beyond East Asia"--
