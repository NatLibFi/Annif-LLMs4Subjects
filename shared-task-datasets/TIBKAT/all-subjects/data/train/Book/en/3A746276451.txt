Econophysics and physical economics
An understanding of the behaviour of financial assets and the evolution of economies has never been as important as today. This book looks at these complex systems from the perspective of the physicist. So called 'econophysics' and its application to finance has made great strides in recent years. This book offers a radically new approach to the fundementals of the subject that offers the potential for increased insight and understanding. It should be of interest to all serious students of the subject. -- Book jacket
