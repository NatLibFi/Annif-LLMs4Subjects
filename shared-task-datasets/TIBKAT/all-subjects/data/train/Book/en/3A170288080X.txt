For more than forty years Jan Gehl has helped to transform urban environments around the world based on his research into the ways people actually use--or could use--the spaces where they live and work. In this revolutionary book, Gehl presents his latest work creating (or recreating) cityscapes on a human scale. He clearly explains the methods and tools he uses to reconfigure unworkable cityscapes into the landscapes he believes they should be: cities for people. Taking into account changing demographics and changing lifestyles, Gehl explains how to develop cities that are lively, safe, sustainable, and healthy. The book is extensively illustrated with over 700 photos and drawings of examples from Gehl's work around the globe.
