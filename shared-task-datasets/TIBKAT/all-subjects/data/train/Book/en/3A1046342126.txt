Cellular biophysics and modeling : a primer on the computational biology of excitable cells
Compartmental modeling -- Phase diagrams -- Ligands, receptors & rate laws -- Function families & characteristic times -- Bifurcation diagrams of scalar ODEs -- The Nernst equilibrium potential -- The current balance equation -- GHK theory of membrane permeation -- Voltage-gated ionic currents -- Regenerative ionic currents and bistability -- Voltage-clamp recording -- Hodgkin-Huxley model of the action potential -- The Morris-Lecar model -- Phase plane analysis -- Linear stability analysis -- Type II excitability and oscillations (the Hopf bifurcation) -- Type I excitability and oscillations (SNIC & SHO bifurcations) -- The low-threshold calcium spike -- Synaptic currents
"It must also be supposed that the cell bodies and the dendrites are, in the same way as the axis cylinders, conductive devices, as they represent the intermediary links between afferent nerve fibres and the afore-mentioned axons"--
