Basic Principles of Structural Equation Modeling : An Introduction to LISREL and EQS
The last two decades have seen structural equation modeling (SEM) emerge as a powerful data analysis tool for research in the social sciences, education, and psychology. With the advent of SEM computer programs such as LISREL and EQS, SEM has become a well-established and respected methodology. This book provides an introduction to the subject suitable for beginning graduate students. Its focus is on the basic concepts and applications of SEM within the social and behavioral sciences. The author develops SEM techniques by presenting linear regression, path analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and then more general structural equation models. In doing so, he is able both to explain clearly the underlying statistical methodology in SEM whilst at the same time illustrate the use of SEM to analyse real data sets drawn from a number of different settings in the behavioral and social sciences
