The language of violent jihad
"How do violent jihadists use language to try to persuade  people to carry out violent acts? This book analyses over  two million words of texts produced by violent jihadists to  identify and examine the linguistic strategies employed.  Taking a mixed methods approach, the authors combine  quantitative methods from corpus linguistics, which allow  the identification of frequent words and phrases,  alongside close reading of texts via discourse analyses.  The analysis compares language use across three sets of  texts: those which advocate violence, those which take a  hostile but non-violent standpoint, and those which take a  moderate perspective, identifying the different uses of  language associated with different stages of  radicalization. The book also discusses how strategies  including use of Arabic, romanisation, formal English,  quotation, metaphor, dehumanisation and collectivisation  are used to create in and out groups and justify violence."--
