Jingdezhen Imperial Kiln Museum
Zhu Pei's Jingdezhen Imperial Kiln Museum recalls a time of glory of the once "Millenium Porcelain Capital" city, Jingdezhen, and extends these memories to the present. Inspired by the perception of Jingdezhen's specific regional culture (porcelain) and the survival wisdom of the locals, the museum is a symbol of the past and future. The contemporary architecture magnificently resonates the ages: the building form is reminiscent of ancient traditional brick kilns, and its landscape - with mirror pools, bamboo groves, kiln ruins, and courtyards - recreates an impression of Jingdezhen's vibrant porcelain past. As an "Architecture of Nature," that evokes both contemporaneity and ancient vibes, the museum subverts typical perceptions of modern-day museums. Coloured photos, drawings, essays, and interviews provide detailed insights on the conception of the museum - from design concept to environmental strategies, to construction techniques and construction materials - as well as the architect's personal perspectives on the overall concept and intention of the museum. The pages also feature commentaries on the museum by well-known architects, including Steven Holl, Kenneth Frampton, Mohsen Mostafavi, Rem Koolhaas, and Arata Isozaki
