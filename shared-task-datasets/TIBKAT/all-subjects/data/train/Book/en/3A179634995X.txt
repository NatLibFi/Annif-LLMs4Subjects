Reliability of organic compounds in microelectronics and optoelectronics : from physics-of-failure to physics-of-degradation
This book aims to provide a comprehensive reference into the critical subject of failure and degradation in organic materials, used in optoelectronics and microelectronics systems and devices. Readers in different industrial sectors, including microelectronics, automotive, lighting, oil/gas, and petrochemical will benefit from this book. Several case studies and examples are discussed, which readers will find useful to assess and mitigate similar failure cases. More importantly, this book presents methodologies and useful approaches in analyzing a failure and in relating a failure to the reliability of materials and systems. Presents methodologies for analysing the reliability, failure, and degradation of different organic materials, used in optoelectronics and microelectronics; Provides an overview of different failure mechanisms in different organic materials; Explains how to correlate product performance and reliability to materials degradation; Provides an overview of simulation techniques and methodologies to predict lifetime and reliability of engineering materials and components; Integrates several degradation causes in different materials (thermal, moisture, light radiation, mechanical damage, and more) into large-scale system solutions in several industrial domains (lighting, automotive, oil/gas, and transport and more); Includes case studies from different failure/degradation mechanisms in different industrial sectors.
