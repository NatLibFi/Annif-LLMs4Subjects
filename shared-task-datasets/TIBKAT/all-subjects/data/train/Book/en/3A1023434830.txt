The minimum wage revisited in the enlarged EU
This book provides in-depth and innovative analysis of the minimum wage in Europe. The authors explore its role and scope within the enlarged EU, and address the question of whether there should be harmonization between the individual member states or even a common EU minimum wage. They also examine the impact of the minimum wage at the national level, looking at trends and effects through case studies of specific policy issues and industrial sectors
