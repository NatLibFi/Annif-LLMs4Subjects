Evolution of solid phase microextraction technology
Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) is a flexible and convenient sampling and sample preparation technique that extracts different kinds of analytes, including both volatile and non-volatile, without the use of a solvent. The technique facilitates fast, simple and automated determination of target analytes in a range of matrices. As it offers a green methodology, it is growing in popularity as an alternative tool in analytical chemistry to traditional methods. This book follows on in spirit from the editors previous title, Applications of Solid Phase Microextraction and will introduce the reader to breakthrough methodologies and cutting edge applications. Although it assumes a good degree of SPME knowledge, an overview of the fundamentals is given before taking the reader through an update of the field. The reader will learn the basic principles and advantages of different SPME formats including the stir bar extraction techniques, thin film SPME, Bio-SPME, and new trends in different coatings. Applications in complex media, including food analysis, drug residues and bioanalysis are covered. Bringing together leading sample preparation academics from around the world, the editor has put together an informative new book, suitable for analytical chemists and practitioners utilising SPME tools in their research
