Catholic social teaching : an historical perspective
Annotation, "During the last years, many meetings, seminars, conferences, and books have been conducted and written to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of Pope Leo XIII's encyclical Rerum novarum (May 15, 1891). We hope in this book to give the reader an historical background to this celebration. No other historian in Catholic circles enjoys the reputation of Canon Roger Aubert. Thus, we are presenting ten of his articles that have to do with Catholic social teaching." "These articles give very measured descriptions of the struggles, defeats, and successes that mark the birth of Catholic social teaching. Their reading should produce great wonder and awe at the stance taken by the Church over the last hundred years. That they have not been adhered to and that they are called "our best kept secret" underlines the fact and the struggle that we all have to become truly Christian."--BOOK JACKET.
