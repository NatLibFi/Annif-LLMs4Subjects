The Optimal Design of Blocked and Split-Plot Experiments
This book provides a comprehensive treatment of the design of blocked and split-plot experiments, two types of experiments that are extremely popular in practice. The traget audience includes applied statisticians and academics. The optial design approach advocated in the book will help applied statisticians from industry, medicine, agriculture, chemistry, and many other fields of study in setting up tailor-made experiments. This is illustrated by a number of examples. The book also contains a theoretical background, a thorough review of the recent work in the area of blocked and split-plot experiments, and a number of interesting theoretical results
