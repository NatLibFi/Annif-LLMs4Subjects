Deformation and fracture of solid-state materials : field theoretical approach and engineering applications
This book introduces a comprehensive theory of deformation and fracture to engineers and applied scientists. The author explains the gist of local symmetry (gauge invariance) intuitively so that engineers and applied physicists can digest it easily, rather than describing physical or mathematical details of the principle. Applications of the theory to practical engineering are also described, such as nondestructive testing, in particular, with the use of an optical interferometric technique called ESPI (Electronic Speckle-Pattern Interferometry). The book provides information on how to apply physical concepts to engineering applications. This book also: · Describes a highly original way to reveal loading hysteresis of a given specimen · Presents a fundamentally new approach to deformation and fracture, which offers potential for new applications · Introduces the unique application of Electric Speckle-Pattern Interferometry?reading fringe patterns to connect them to the current deformation status · Details engineering applications of gauge theory · Visualizes otherwise abstract concepts of local symmetry and gauge field
