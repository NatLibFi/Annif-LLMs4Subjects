Analytical and computational methods in electromagnetics
Achieve optimal microwave system performance by mastering the principles and methods underlying today's powerful computational tools and commercial software in electromagnetics. This authoritative resource offers you clear and complete explanation of this essential electromagnetics knowledge, providing you with the analytical background you need to understand such key approaches as MoM (method of moments), FDTD (Finite Difference Time Domain) and FEM (Finite Element Method), and Green's functions. This comprehensive book includes all math necessary to master the material. Moreover, it features numerous solved problems that help ensure your understanding of key concepts throughout the book. To keep you from being bogged down with complex mathematical details (vector calculus) and coding, this comprehensive volume places emphasis on the analysis of the scalar wave equation in Cartesian coordinates. The book also includes multiple choice questions, appropriate for self study or courses, that help clarify concepts without any mathematical burden. Packed with over 1,300 equations, most of the problems presented in the book can be solved using nothing more than calculator. CD-ROM-Included! Includes time-saving Matlab(R) source code for the problems presented in the book which can be easily modified to help you solve similar problems in the field
