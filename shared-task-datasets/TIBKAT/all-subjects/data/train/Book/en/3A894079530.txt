Plant stress tolerance : methods and protocols
This second edition provides up-to-date and new chapters covering the most important widely-used techniques in plant stress tolerance, including cutting-edge strategies, in a manner that ensures effective results. Plant Stress Tolerance: Methods and Protocols, Second Edition guides readers through reviews on epigenetics, long noncoding RNAs, and the influence of microbiome on drought tolerance, the volume then continues with methods describing the identification of stress-responsive genes, proteins, posttranslational redox modifications, DNA methylation, histone modifications, measurement of glutathione, lipids, raffinose family oligosaccharides, polyamines, as well as quantification of abscisic acid, and the enzymes involved in ROS detoxification. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Authoritative and practical, Plant Stress Tolerance: Methods and Protocols, Second Edition aims to ensure successful results in the further study of this vital field.--
