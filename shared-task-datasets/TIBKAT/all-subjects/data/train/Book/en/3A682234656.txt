Digital terrain analysis in soil science and geology
Digital Terrain Analysis in Soil Science and Geology provides soil scientists and geologists with an integrated view of the principles and methods of digital terrain analysis. Its attention to first principles and focus on error analysis makes it a useful resource for scientists to uncover the method applications particular to their needs. Digital Terrain Analysis in Soil Science and Geology covers a wide range of applications in the context of multi-scale problems of soil science and geology. Presents a mathematical approach from a single author who is actively researching in the field and has published a number of fundamental papers. Outlines principles, methods, then follows with examples in a simple set-up that builds on content. Provides an integrated view of the principles and methods of digital terrain analysis
"This book is the first attempt to synthesize knowledge on theory, methods, and applications of digital terrain analysis in the context of multiscale problems of soil science and geology. The content of the book is based on long-standing, interdisciplinary research of the author. The book is addressed to geomorphometrists, soil scientists, geologists, geoscientists, geomorphologists, geographers, and GIS scientists (at scholar, lecturer, and postgraduate student levels, with mathematical skills). This book is also intended for the GIS professionals in industry and research laboratories focusing on geoscientific and soil research. The book is divided into three parts. Part I represents main concepts, principles, and methods of digital terrain modeling. Part II discusses various aspects of the use of digital terrain analysis in soil science. Part III looks at applications of digital terrain modeling in geology"--
