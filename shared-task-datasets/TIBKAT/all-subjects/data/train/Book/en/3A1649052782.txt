Chemical Vapour Deposition : An Integrated Engineering Design for Advanced Materials
Chemical Vapour Deposition: An Integrated Engineering Design for Advanced Materials focuses on the application of this technology to engineering coatings and, in particular, to the manufacture of high performance materials, such as fibre reinforced ceramic composite materials, for structural applications at high temperatures. This book aims to provide a thorough exploration of the design and applications of advanced materials, and their manufacture in engineering. From physical fundamentals and principles, to optimization of processing parameters and other current practices, this book is desig
