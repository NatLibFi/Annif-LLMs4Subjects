Biologics in General Medicine
This is the first book comprising all relevant aspects for the clinical application of biologics. All biologics currently approved for clinical use are described in a standardized way concentrating on practically relevant aspects such as contra-indications or monitoring needs. The `differential therapy` with biologics namely in the fields of dermatology, rheumatology, gastroenterology, and neurology is described in detail and summarized in treatment algorithms. Shorter sections on the biotechnology behind the biologics as well as safety, regulatory, and pharmaco-economic aspects complement the more clinically-oriented central chapters.
