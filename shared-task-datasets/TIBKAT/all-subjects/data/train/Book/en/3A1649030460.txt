Glissonean Pedicle Transection Method for Hepatic Resection
The Glissonean pedicle transection method for hepatic resection has been recognized and practiced as a safe, well-established technique for reliable anatomic and systematic hepatic resection for more than 20 years. This method has advantages not only in simplification of the techniques of hepatic resection but also in reduction of intraoperative hemorrhage. In this book, the author, who originally developed the technique, presents a concept of hepatic segmentation with respect to the Glissonean pedicle tree, and surgical procedures for segmentectomy and cone-unit resection are outlined. Detailed illustrations are included depicting every important action a surgeon must consider while performing these operations, and the accompanying DVD will further assist readers in understanding the most appropriate technique, special strategies, and potential pitfalls.
