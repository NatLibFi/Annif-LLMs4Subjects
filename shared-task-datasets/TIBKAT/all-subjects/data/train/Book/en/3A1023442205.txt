Handbook of accounting and development
This innovative and informative Handbook brings together leading international researchers on accounting and development to review empirical evidence, issues, policies and practices both past and present. The perspectives of the expert contributors reflect the strong growth of research on the topic, as accounting is increasingly recognised as an important factor in development. The book draws commentary and analyses together to inform future research, practice and policy and raises awareness of the actual and potential role of accounting in formulating and executing development policy. With theoretical and empirically focused chapters, this Handbook will appeal to academics and postgraduate students in accounting and development studies, practitioners, policymakers and development partners.
