Citizenship today : the contemporary relevance of T. H. Marshall
The contributors apply Marshall's dominant conception of citizenship to key areas of social scientific study such as power, income distribution, work and technology, family responsibilities, the environment and the underclass. The book is intended for undergraduate and postgraduate students on courses in sociological theory, social inequality, social policy and political theory.
