Matrix Operations for Engineers and Scientists : An Essential Guide in Linear Algebra
Engineers and scientists need to have an introduction to the basics of linear algebra in a context they understand. Computer algebra systems make the manipulation of matrices and the determination of their properties a simple matter, and in practical applications such software is often essential. However, using this tool when learning about matrices, without first gaining a proper understanding of the underlying theory, limits the ability to use matrices and to apply them to new problems. This book explains matrices in the detail required by engineering or science students, and it discusses linear systems of ordinary differential equations. These students require a straightforward introduction to linear algebra illustrated by applications to which they can relate. It caters of the needs of undergraduate engineers in all disciplines, and provides considerable detail where it is likely to be helpful.According to the author the best way to understand the theory of matrices is by working simple exercises designed to emphasize the theory, that at the same time avoid distractions caused by unnecessary numerical calculations. Hence, examples and exercises in this book have been constructed in such a way that wherever calculations are necessary they are straightforward. For example, when a characteristic equation occurs, its roots (the eigenvalues of a matrix) can be found by inspection.The author of this book is Alan Jeffrey, Emeritus Professor of mathematics at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. He has given courses on engineering mathematics at UK and US Universities.
