Obstetrics in Family Medicine : A Practical Guide
A seasoned inner-city family physician concisely surveys the normal obstetrics encountered in a busy medical practice to provide a practical guide to the evaluation and management of common prenatal, peripartum, and postpartum complications. For each stage, Dr. Lyons addresses the major issues and problems, spelling out in detail management protocols about why and what action is to be taken, when it is to be done, and how it is to be interpreted. The key points for each topic are summarized in tabular form for quick reference, and diagnostic flow charts illuminate all aspects of the decision-making process. Expert advice based on years of experience is also presented concerning physical and ultrasound examinations, laboratory tests, drug toxicities, and screening techniques. A special PDA version of Obstetrics in Family Medicine: A Practical Guide is also available.
