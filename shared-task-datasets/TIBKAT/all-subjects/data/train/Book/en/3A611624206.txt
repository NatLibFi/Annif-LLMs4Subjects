The Monfort plan : the new architecture of capitalism
"The Monfort Plan is a five-year, forward-looking plan to eradicate extreme poverty from the developing world, and details how microfinance has made a difference in developing countries. This book proposes a new institution, based in the developing world, with the potential to provide basic, free, and universal services in the areas of health care, education, water, and sanitation to the extreme poor worldwide. The provision of these services will be subject to a certain degree of conditionality depending upon factors ranging from problems with corruption to the country's legal environment and how these services are delivered to the extreme poor. The new institution will be established in an international territory based within a specific country in sub-Saharan Africa and will emerge in 2015." "In The Monfort Plan, author Jaime Pozuelo-Monfort explores a solution to lessen the burden of poverty. In order to do so, he relies on the social sciences to bring about innovation and forward-looking economic policies and financial instruments in the context of a paradigm shift. This guide presents a multidisciplinary approach to policymaking that combines a range of fields in the social sciences, while looking at the history behind the Marshall Plan, the formation of the European Union, and the Bretton Woods System, in order to identify the six components of the "Axis of Feeble" and to determine how a Marshall Plan for Africa - and the creation of new institutions in the developing world - could work." "We live in a moment of crisis-one in which creative policymaking might prove useful when proposing outcomes for a revitalized framework for capitalism to thrive and better serve the world." "Incorporating commentary from some of the top minds in the fields of microfinance and economic development, The Monfort Plan puts this proven method in perspective and reveals how it can make for a better world."--BOOK JACKET
