Women's life writing, 1700 - 1850 : gender, genre and authorship
This collection of new essays by international scholars discusses British and Irish life writings by women in the period 1700-1850. It argues for the importance of women's life writing, both within women's literary history and as an integral part of the culture and practice of eighteenth-century and Romantic auto/biography. The essays presented here reveal women's innovative and diverse experiments with life writing and highlight the complex relationships between conceptions of femininity, auto/biographical forms, and models of authorship in the period. They advance our understanding of canonical women writers while also recovering neglected authors, genres, and traditions to suggest the various ways in which female lives might be narrated in this period
