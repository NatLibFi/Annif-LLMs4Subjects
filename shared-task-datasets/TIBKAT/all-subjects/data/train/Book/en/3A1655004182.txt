The Andrews Festschrift : Seventeen Papers on Classical Number Theory and Combinatorics
This book contains seventeen contributions made to George Andrews on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday, ranging from classical number theory (the theory of partitions) to classical and algebraic combinatorics. Most of the papers were read at the 42nd session of the SÃ©minaire Lotharingien de Combinatoire that took place at Maratea, Basilicata, in August 1998. This volume contains a long memoir on Ramanujan's Unpublished Manuscript and the Tau functions studied with a contemporary eye, together with several papers dealing with the theory of partitions. There is also a description of a maple package to deal with general q-calculus. More subjects on algebraic combinatorics are developed, especially the theory of Kostka polynomials, the ice square model, the combinatorial theory of classical numbers, a new approach to determinant calculus
