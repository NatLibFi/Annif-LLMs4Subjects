Nonarchimedean Functional Analysis
The present book is a self-contained text which leads the reader through all the important aspects of the theory of locally convex vector spaces over nonarchimedean fields. One can observe an increasing interest in methods from nonarchimedean functional analysis, particularly in number theory and in the representation theory of p-adic reductive groups. The book gives a concise and clear account of this theory, it carefully lays the foundations and also develops the more advanced topics. Although the book will be a valuable reference work for experts in the field, it is mainly intended as a streamlined but detailed introduction for researchers and graduate students who wish to apply these methods in different areas
