Analysis in Euclidean space
"Based on notes written during the teacher's many years of teaching, Analysis in Euclidean Space mainly covers Differentiation and Integration theory in several real variables, but also an array of closely related areas including measure theory, differential geometry, classical theory of curves geometric measure theory, integral geometry, and others. With several original results, new approaches and an emphasis on concepts and rigorous proofs, the book is suitable for undergraduate students, particularly in mathematics and physics, who are interested in acquiring a solid grounding in analysis and expanding their background. There are many examples and exercises inserted in the text for the student to work independently. Analysis in Euclidian Space comprises twenty chapters, each with an introduction summarizing its contents, and an additional chapter containing miscellaneous exercises. Teachers may use the varied chapters of this book for different undergraduate courses in analysis. The only prerequisites are a basic course in linear algebra and a standard first-year calculus course in differentiation and integration. As the book progresses, the difficulty increases such that some of the later sections may be appropriate for graduate study"--
