Climate change is one of the most salient challenges expressed in the seventeen interconnected UN Sustainable Development Goals. A greater impetus has emerged in recent years for larger corporations to assume a pivotal role in framing the issues of climate change-focused policy, ensuring environmental sustainability across the value chain and in leading by example with best implementation practices. This collection of leading-edge research addresses the fast-evolving role of multinational enterprises as agents of change in standard development and as diffusers of innovation in solving sustainability problems. CSR and Climate Change Implications for Multinational Enterprises presents a unique lens to address generic issues and how they manifest and find resolution in various industry sectors, from the perspective of different disciplines ranging from logistics to finance to ethics. Contributors from the United States, Europe and emerging economies offer contrasting views on how corporate social governance best addresses the sustainability implications of climate change, seeking innovative ways to incorporate environmental stewardship in policy design and operational firm-level concerns. This is a critical resource for both researchers and practitioners, as well as policy makers who focus on sustainability in the corporate contexts. It serves as a fresh reference for graduate level students and academics concerned with global corporate governance in the evolving context of multinationality
