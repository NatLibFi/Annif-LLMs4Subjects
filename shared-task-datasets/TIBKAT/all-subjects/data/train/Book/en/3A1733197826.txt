When attitudes take form
Public interest in architecture and spatial issues has never been so high. The Flanders Architectural Review No.14 presents striking architecture from Flanders and Brussels. It assembles a broad range of recently completed architectural projects and situates them in the evolution of the socio-cultural domain in which they arose. The key concept for the selection of these projects is encapsulated in the title: When Attitudes Take Form. The editors chose architecture that demonstrates a convincing social commitment while also challenging and questioning its own discipline. These fifty projects display the multifaceted nature of the resulting architecture. Each of the twelve essays examines a current topic. The authors scrutinise the conditions for the production of contemporary architecture, such as the large-scale urban expansion project, the (post-) reconstruction landscape of the south-west corner of Flanders, and school building within the region. But they also explore the various positions adopted by architects: that of designer and also of researcher or committed citizen in the civil sector
