Quantum nano-plasmonics
"With examples and clear explanation throughout, this step-by-step approach makes the quantum theory of plasmons accessible to readers without a specialized training in theory. A fully analytical formulation offers an opportunity for further development of the research and applications. The theory is focused on the random phase approximation description of plasmons in metallic nanostructures, previously defined for the bulk metal only. Particular attention is paid to the large damping of plasmons in nanostructures, including electron scattering and Lorentz friction losses; a quantum description of the plasmon photovoltaic effect is presented and there is an in-depth analysis of plasmon-polariton kinetics in metallic nano-chains. Suitable for students in the fields of plasmonics, optoelectronics, and photonics and for researchers active in the fields of photovoltaics, optoelectronics, nanoplasmonics, and nano-photonics, the book should also be useful for researchers in soft plasmonics since it includes applications to electro-signalling in neurons"--
