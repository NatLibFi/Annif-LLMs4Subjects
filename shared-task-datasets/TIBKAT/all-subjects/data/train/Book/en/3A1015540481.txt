From ego to eco : mapping shifts from anthropocentrism to ecocentrism
"From Ego to Eco - Mapping Shifts from Anthropocentrism to Ecocentrism' investigates philosophical, political and aesthetic formations of ecocentrism. Representing a variety of disciplines and testing a broad scope of critical approaches, the contributors of this volume argue that anthropocentrism is not - as often claimed - a predominant world view but, rather, a widely contested concept. Within various historical and national contexts, the individual contributors of this book discuss the significance and relevance of ecocentism and offer new avenues to emerging discourses in the humanities."--Back cover
