Molecular mechanisms of photosynthesis
"The field of photosynthesis has changed dramatically since the 2nd edition of this book was published in 2014. One of the most important changes is the large number of new structures, both X-ray and Cryo-EM that have been determined for many of the key complexes that carry out photosynthesis. Important new information about the mechanism of oxygen production has recently become available. Substantial efforts to improve the efficiency of photosynthesis have been undertaken. New pigments and new organisms have been discovered that extend oxygenic photosynthesis deeper into the near infrared spectral region. There is important new information about the regulation of photosynthesis and about the critical process of photoprotection. These advances will be included within the existing chapters of the book. The basic organization of the book will not be changed, and the current chapter scope and number will be retained"--
