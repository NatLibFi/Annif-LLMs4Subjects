Numerical simulation of incompressible viscous flow : methods and applications
This book on finite element-based computational methods for solving incompressible viscous fluid flow problems shows readers how to apply operator splitting techniques to decouple complicated computational fluid dynamics problems into a sequence of relatively simpler sub-problems at each time step, such as hemispherical cavity flow, cavity flow of an Oldroyd-B viscoelastic flow, and particle interaction in an Oldroyd-B type viscoelastic fluid. Efficient and robust numerical methods for solving those resulting simpler sub-problems are introduced and discussed. Interesting computational results are presented to show the capability of methodologies addressed in the book
