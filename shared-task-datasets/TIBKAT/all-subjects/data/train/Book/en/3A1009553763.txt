Underwater acoustic modeling and simulation
The fifth edition discusses new applications including underwater acoustic networks and channel models, marine-hydrokinetic energy devices, and simulation of anthropogenic sound sources. New material has been added to all chapters, especially in mathematical propagation models and special applications and inverse techniques. It covers trends in applied modeling and new analytical tools for propagation, noise, reverberation, and sonar performance models. The content covering environmental-acoustic data in companion tables and core summary tables has been updated with the latest underwater acoustic propagation, noise, reverberation, and sonar performance models. --
