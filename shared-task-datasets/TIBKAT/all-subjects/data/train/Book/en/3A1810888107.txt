The city on display : architecture festivals and the urban commons
"Architecture Festivals in an Urban Age reflects on the biennials, triennials and other festivals of architecture and design over the last two decades as they expand and transform as a result of 'planetary urbanism'. Robinson examines the development of exhibitions as they encounter challenges such as urban regeneration, climate change and heritage preservation. Including illustrations and examples from festivals in Venice, Oslo, and Hong Kong, Robinson describes how they alter public spaces, either through gentrification or through reassertion of the commons and 'the right to the city'. This book attempts to thematise architecture festival's relationship with the city, and interrogate its potential as a forum for global debate about the emergencies of the urban condition. This book would be beneficial for students and academics of architecture and urban planning with a particular interest in city and urban planning surrounding festivals"--
