Sensory marketing : research on the sensuality of products
"What is sensory marketing and why is it interesting and also important? Krishna defines it as "marketing that engages the consumers senses and affects their behaviors." In this edited book, the authors discuss how sensory aspects of products, i.e., the touch , taste, smell, sound, and look of the products, affect our emotions, memories, perceptions, preferences, choices, and consumption of these products. We see how creating new sensations or merely emphasizing or bringing attention to existing sensations can increase a product s or service s appeal. The book provides an overview of sensory marketing research that has taken place thus far. It should facilitate sensory marketing by practitioners and also can be used for research or in academic classrooms."--BOOK JACKET
