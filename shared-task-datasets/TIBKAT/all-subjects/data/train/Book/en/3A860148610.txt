Organisational Memory as a Function : The Construction of Past, Present and Future in Organisations
This book is about the past as well as the future in organisations in general and about an organisationâ€™s temporal contextualisation in particular. The author analyses, how organisations are able to construct a present with respect to their past and future. The study is based on an empirical case study, in which an R&D department has been followed for a six month-period in order to analyse how an organisation orients itself with respect to its past, present and future from the perspective of communication-centred social systems theory.
