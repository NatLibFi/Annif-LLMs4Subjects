The dictionary of health economics
From Abscissa, through to the World Health Organization, this expansive Dictionary comprehensively covers the field of health economics and closely related fields including epidemiology, pharmacoeconomics, demography, medical sociology, medical statistics and bio-statistics, health policy, health administration and health service management, public health medicine and qualitative and quantitative research. Entries and definitions are provided for all key concepts listed with, in many cases, more extended entries on core or controversial ideas. Anthony Culyer has amassed a wealth of information and facts within these pages, and yet has not been reluctant to include comment on issues and ideas. This makes the Dictionary eminently readable and all the more interesting. This is a unique reference work and as such, The Dictionary of Health Economics will be a valuable reference tool for a wide audience encompassing not just health economists, but many specialists and researchers in other fields (social sciences and beyond) as well as policymakers
