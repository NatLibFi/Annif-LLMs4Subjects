The methods can also be used for silos, pipes or any circular shells subjected to arbitrary axially-symmetrical loading, and also deal with the more general problem of beam on elastic foundation. A new chapter is presented with guidance on the design of construction of circular tanks. Examples of satisfactory designs are presented; including post-tensioned concrete walls, footings, floors and roofs and liquid-tight connections between these components"--
