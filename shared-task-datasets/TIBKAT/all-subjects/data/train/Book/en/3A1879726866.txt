Mathematical modeling and intelligent control for combating pandemics
The contributions in this carefully curated volume, present cutting-edge research in applied mathematical modeling for combating COVID-19 and other potential pandemics. Mathematical modeling and intelligent control have emerged as powerful computational models and have shown significant success in combating any pandemic. These models can be used to understand how COVID-19 or other pandemics can spread, analyze data on the incidence of infectious diseases, and predict possible future scenarios concerning pandemics. This book also discusses new models, practical solutions, and technological advances related to detecting and analyzing COVID-19 and other pandemics based on intelligent control systems that assist decision-makers, managers, professionals, and researchers. Much of the book focuses on preparing the scientific community for the next pandemic, particularly the application of mathematical modeling and intelligent control for combating the Monkeypox virus and Langya Henipavirus.
