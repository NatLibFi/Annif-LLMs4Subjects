Uncertain Logics, Variables and Systems
Uncertainty is one of the main features of complex and intelligent decision-making systems. There exists a great variety of definitions and descriptions of uncertain systems. The ideas of uncertain variables based on uncertain logics have been introduced and developed for a wide class of uncertain systems. In this monograph basic concepts, definitions and results concerning uncertain variables are presented. Applications to analysis and decision problems in uncertain systems, described by traditional mathematical models and by knowledge representations, are demonstrated
