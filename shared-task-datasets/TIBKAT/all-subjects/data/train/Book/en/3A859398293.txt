The Hazaras and the Afghan state : rebellion, exclusion and the struggle for recognition
"The Hazaras of Afghanistan have borne the brunt of many of the destructive forces unleashed by the establishment of the Afghan monarchy in 1747. The history of their relationship with the Afghan state has been punctuated by frequent episodes of ethnic cleansing, mass dispossession, forced displacement, enslavement and social and economic exclusion ... This volume provides a fresh account of both the strategies and tactics of the Afghan state and how the Hazaras have responded to them."--
