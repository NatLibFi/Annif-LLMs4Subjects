Quantum dot optoelectronic devices
This book captures cutting-edge research in semiconductor quantum dot devices, discussing preparation methods and properties, and providing a comprehensive overview of their optoelectronic applications. Quantum dots (QDs), with particle sizes in the nanometer range, have unique electronic and optical properties. They have the potential to open an avenue for next-generation optoelectronic methods and devices, such as lasers, biomarker assays, field effect transistors, LEDs, photodetectors, and solar concentrators. By bringing together leaders in the various application areas, this book is both a comprehensive introduction to different kinds of QDs with unique physical properties as well as their preparation routes, and a platform for knowledge sharing and dissemination of the latest advances in a novel area of nanotechnology. .
