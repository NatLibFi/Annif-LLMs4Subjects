Ecological restoration and environmental change : renewing damaged ecosystems
"Ecological Restoration and Environmental Change presents an introduction to the practice of renewing and restoring degraded, damaged, or destroyed ecosystems and habitats in the environment. The book addresses and challenges key issues which question the core values of the science and practice of restoration ecology. The author explains that the process of restoration has actually always been defined by human choices and examines the development of restoration practice, to describe different models of restoration with respect to balancing ecological benefit and cultural value. He develops ways to balance more actively these differing areas of concern while planning restorations. This new edition has been fully revised and updated to reflect changes in the field and the new challenges posed to restoration ecology in the face of the rapid pace of climate change. With strong coverage of North and South American, Europe and Australia, this new edition has been expanded to also address indigenous perspectives and restoration projects in Africa, the Pacific Islands, and Asia. It places special emphasis on the need for restorationists to appreciate and understand the intricacies of planning and managing restorations in novel ecosystems. Lastly, it provides a critique of the new restoration standards published by the Society for Ecological Restoration in 2019. This book is essential reading for students on restoration ecology and conservation courses, as well as professionals and practitioners working on restoration projects"--
