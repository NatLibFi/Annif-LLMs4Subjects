The Blockchain Alternative : Rethinking Macroeconomic Policy and Economic Theory
This book shows how distributed ledger technologies, especially the blockchain, are transforming the finance sector in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008. It surveys the measures, tools, and theories being developed to create a new framework of monetary economics and capitalism. Kariappa Bheemaiah, a technology strategy consultant, analyzes and compares the traditional and emergent paradigms of finance and monetary economics. Blockchain: Rethinking Macroeconomic Policy and Economic Theory reviews the workings and failings of the current dominant system of fractional-reserve banking and examines the emerging technologies that are convergently challenging the status quo by defragmenting the financial sector. Readers learn how the new tools and models of econophysics and complexity economics can be applied to cashless systems to control excessive debt, systemic risk, and economic pollution
