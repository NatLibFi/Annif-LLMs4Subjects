Mathematics for engineers
Mathematics for Engineers introduces Engineering students to Maths, building up right from the basics. Examples and questions throughout help students to learn through practice and applications sections labelled by engineering stream encourage an applied and fuller understanding. Understanding key mathematical concepts and applying them successfully to solve problems are vital skills that all engineering students must acquire. Mathematics for Engineers teaches, develops and nurtures those skills. Practical, informal and accessible, it begins with the foundations and gradually builds upon this knowledge as it introduces more complex concepts to cover all requirements for a first year engineering maths course, together with introductory material for even more advanced topics.
