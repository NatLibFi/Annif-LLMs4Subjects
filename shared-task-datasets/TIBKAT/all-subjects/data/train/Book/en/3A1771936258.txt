Bioenergy Research / Manish Srivastava, Neha Srivastava, Rajeev Singh editors ; 3rd part: Commercial opportunities & challenges
This volume is third part of the five-part set on bioenergy research. This book provides insights into commercial advantages of commonly running bioenergy options. It explores various opportunities present at technical scale to produce biofuels. Moreover, the additional practical feasibility of the commercialization of existing biofuels including existing challenges and sustainable solutions to overcome from these technical hurdles. This Volume also focuses on the durability and long run sustainability on the new arrival of biofuels options which can be a suitable and easy replacement of currently available biofuels at pilot scale. Other four volumes of this set explore basic concepts, latest progress, bio-waste to energy conversion and integrated solution for bioenergy concerns. .
