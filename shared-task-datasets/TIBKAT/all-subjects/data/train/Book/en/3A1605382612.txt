Einstein on politics : his private thoughts and public stands on nationalism, Zionism, war, peace, and the bomb
"In Einstein on Politics, leading Einstein scholars David Rowe and Robert Schulmann gather Einstein's most important public and private political writings and put them into historical context. The book reveals a little-known Einstein - not the ineffectual and naive idealist of popular imagination, but a principled, shrewd pragmatist whose stands on political issues reflected the depth of his humanity."--BOOK JACKET
