Recent Trends in Combinatorics
This volume presents some of the research topics discussed at the 2014-2015 Annual Thematic Program Discrete Structures: Analysis and Applications at the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications during Fall 2014, when combinatorics was the focus. Leading experts have written surveys of research problems, making state of the art results more conveniently and widely available. The three-part structure of the volume reflects the three workshops held during Fall 2014. In the first part, topics on extremal and probabilistic combinatorics are presented; part two focuses on additive and analytic combinatorics; and part three presents topics in geometric and enumerative combinatorics. This book will be of use to those who research combinatorics directly or apply combinatorial methods to other fields.
