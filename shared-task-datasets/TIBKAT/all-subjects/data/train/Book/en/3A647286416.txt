Face geometry and appearance modeling : concepts and applications
"Human faces are familiar to our visual systems. We easily recognize a person's face in arbitrary lighting conditions and in a variety of poses; detect small appearance changes; and notice subtle expression details. Can computer vision systems process face images as well as human vision systems can? Face image processing has potential applications in surveillance, image and video search, social networking, and other domains. A comprehensive guide to this fascinating topic, this book provides a systematic description of modeling face geometry and appearance from images, including information on mathematical tools, physical concepts, image processing and computer vision techniques, and concrete prototype systems. The book will be an excellent reference for researchers and graduate students in computer vision, computer graphics, and multimedia as well as application developers who would like to gain a better understanding of the state of the art"--Provided by publisher
