Handbuch Literatur & Philosophie
"This volume provides a systematic overview of the relationship between literature and philosophy. Philosophical, literary, and literary studies approaches each have an equal say, the handbook's entries sounding out the significance of literature and presenting genre-theoretical reflections on literary forms of philosophy. The volume closes with a number of studies on philosophizing literature and philosophical reflections on literature."--Publisher's website
