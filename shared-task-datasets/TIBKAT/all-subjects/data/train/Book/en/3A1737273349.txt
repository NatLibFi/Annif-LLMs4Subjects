Functionalized polymers : synthesis, characterization and applications
"Functionalized polymers include various kinds of functional polymers including conjugated polymers, biometric, stimuli-responsive polymers, supramolecular metallopolymers, maleimides and acrylates based copolymers, phenolic resins, PLA, PLGA and PEG based designed polymers, photo functionalized polymers, functionalized coordinating polymers, covalent attachment of functional protein to polymer surfaces, epoxy based modification, amphiphilic hyperbranched polymers, shape memory and honeycomb polymers and grafted biodegradable polymers. Synthetic procedure and various characterization techniques of functionalized polymers are also included in this book"--
