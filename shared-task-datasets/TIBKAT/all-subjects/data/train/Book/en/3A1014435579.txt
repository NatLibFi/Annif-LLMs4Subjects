Our hearts fell to the ground : Plains Indian views of how the West was lost
This revised edition of Colin Calloway's Our Hearts Fell to the Ground continues to offer a look into the Native American views of the changing West in the nineteenth century through a selection of primary accounts, speeches, and writings. With a revised introduction and a number of new documents, this second edition now includes new coverage of the Northern Cheyennes' bid for freedom in 1878; a testimony by a Ponca chief who won a landmark court case; an Indian teacher's thoughts on Indian schools; and an old woman's memory of her experience as a teenage girl at the Wounded Knee massacre. The epilogue has been expanded and the bibliography updated
