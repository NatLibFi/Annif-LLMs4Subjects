Investor decision-making and the role of the financial advisor : a behavioural finance approach
This book looks at financial advisory from a behavioural perspective, and focuses on how the nature of the relationship between advisors and clients may affect the ability of the advisor to perform its functions. Broken into three key parts, the book looks at the client, the advisor, and the relationship between the two. Chapters review relevant theories of decision-making under risk to understand the nature of clients' decisions. The literature on advisors' functions and the normative landscape regulating financial advisory are also addressed. Finally, this book reviews how behavioural finance has traditionally addressed portfolio selection and explains how trust can be seen as a viable avenue to maximize advisors' effectiveness and pursue clients' needs. This book will be of interest to both behavioural finance scholars and practitioners interested in understanding what the future of financial advisory may have in stock.
