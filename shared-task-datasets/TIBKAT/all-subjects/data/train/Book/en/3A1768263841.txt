Grains : engineering fundamentals of drying and storage
"Grains: Engineering Fundamentals of Drying and Storage describes physical and thermal properties of grain kernels and bulks; water in biomaterials and relationship with its environment; fundamental principles of aeration, drying, and rewetting; moisture status and migration in bins; and mathematical modeling of water in grain kernels and bulks during storage and drying. This book contains state-of -art knowledge on these aspects and demonstrates the most advanced theoretical solutions and practical approaches to drying and storage. This unique text explains the fundamental principles of these topics by considering the reationship between water status of grain and the properties of the grain"--
