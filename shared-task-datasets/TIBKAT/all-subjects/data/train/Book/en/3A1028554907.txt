News from Germany : the competition to control world communications, 1900-1945
News from Germany traces why Germans became interested in international communications around 1900 and how they sought to control it for the next 45 years. They used new communications technologies, like wireless and radio, and they used the central businesses of news supply - news agencies. An astonishing array of German politicians, industrialists, military generals, and journalists became obsessed with news. At home, a news agency helped to start the Weimar Republic; competition over news agencies helped to usher in the Weimar Republic's demise. Abroad, news from Germany reached around the world and was surprisingly successful in places as far-flung as China and Chile. Although news is often seen as part of soft power, Germans used it to achieve hard power aims. Communications infrastructure and information became crucial parts of power politics. The Nazis seemed to be the master propagandists, but their efforts built on decades of German obsessions with news.--
