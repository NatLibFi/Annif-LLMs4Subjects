Testing cloud services : how to test SaaS, PaaS & IaaS
"Everybody is confronted with cloud computing. Whether you are a user, designer, programmer, project manager, or tester, sooner or later the cloud affects your work. If you are involved in selecting or implementing services from the cloud, or in keeping them up and running, this book will prove to be an invaluable resource.  Testing Cloud Services covers an extensive list of risks that arise when implementing cloud computing, including some traditional risks and some completely new ones, and provides strategies for avoiding these risks and solving problems. Every risk is connected to existing, updated, and new test measures. It is necessary to start testing during the selection of cloud services, and continue end-to-end testing even after going live, as continuity risks arise all the time.  With this book in hand, you will save a lot of time and discover an effective approach to testing that can be applied in practice immediately!"--
