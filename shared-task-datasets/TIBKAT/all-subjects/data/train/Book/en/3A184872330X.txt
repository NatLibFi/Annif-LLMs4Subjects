Global climate change and plant stress management
"Climate change studies predicted many adverse effects on plant metabolism, known as plant stress conditions. Both climate and plant stress are not new terminologies but in recent times they have been studied together due to the emerging need of sustaining ecological balance and human needs under changing climate regimes. Under changing climate conditions plant growth is affected in various ways including, increased photosynthesis due to increasing CO2 levels, increased water requirements by plants under high temperature and CO2 levels, and plants become longer with extensive leaves"--
