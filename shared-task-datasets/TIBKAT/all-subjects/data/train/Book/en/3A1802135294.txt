Flow noise : theory
This book highlights the importance of sound produced by fluid flow or flow-induced noise. Noise created by unsteady flow creates high levels of environmental noise pollution, a known public health problem, and can compromise the acoustic qualities of marine vessels. There is a seemingly ever-growing list of modern technology that created flow-induced noise which includes aircraft, wind turbines, submarines, drones, high-speed rail, and cooling fans. More scientists and engineers are required to incorporate the effects of flow-induced noise in their work. This book also provides a comprehensive introduction to the theory underpinning the understanding of flow-induced noise.
