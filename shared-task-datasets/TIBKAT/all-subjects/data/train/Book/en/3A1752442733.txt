Protein phosphorylation and meat quality
The book focuses on the current research of the relation between protein phosphorylation and meat quality, reviews the influence mechanism of protein phosphorylation on meat quality, and summarizes the improvement of meat quality by regulating protein phosphorylation. It could help to clarify some dilemmas and encourage further research in this field, aiming for effective application of protein phosphorylation in meat quality in the near future. The book is written for researchers and graduate students in the field of meat science, food chemistry and molecular biology etc.
