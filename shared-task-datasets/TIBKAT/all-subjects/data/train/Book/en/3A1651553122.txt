Multibody systems approach to vehicle dynamics
Preface; Nomenclature; Introduction ; Kinematics and Dynamics of Rigid Bodies; Multibody Systems Simulation Software; Modelling and Analysis of Suspension Systems; Tyre Characteristics and Modelling; Modelling and the Assembly of the Full Vehicle; Simulation Output and Interpretation; Active Systems; References; Appendix A-C
This is the first book to comprehensively bridge the gap between classical vehicle dynamics and the widely-used, computer-based technique of Multibody Systems analysis (MBS). MBS is firmly established as a key part of all modern vehicle design and development processes; any engineer working on problems involving vehicle ride or handling will use MBS to simulate vehicle motion. Suitable for use both as a teaching text and a professional reference volume, this book is an essential addition to the resources available to anyone working in vehicle design and development. Written by a leading academic in the field (who himself has considerable practical experience) and the chief dynamics engineer of Prodrive, the pre-eminent rally, race and road technology organization, the book has a unique blend of theory and practice that will be of immense value in this applications based field. * Full of practical examples and applications * Uses industry standard ADAMS software based applications * Accompanied by downloadable ADAMS models and data sets available from the companion website that enable readers to explore the material in the book * Guides readers from modelling suspension movement through to full vehicle models able to perform handling manoeuvres
