A concise introduction to thermodynamics for physicists
"This concise and compact introductory textbook on thermodynamics is designed for undergraduate students in physics, physics engineering, biophysics and biomedical engineering who are being exposed to the ideas and concepts of thermal physics for the first time. While this is a self-contained text on thermodynamics (i.e. focused on macroscopic physics), emphasis is placed on the microscopic underlying model in order to facilitate the understanding of thermodynamics concepts and properties, and motivate a future course on statistical physics. This book will equip the readers with an understanding of the scope and applicability of this discipline and will be able to apply it to study any physical system. Readers are continuously challenged with conceptual questions that prompt reflection and facilitate the understanding of particularly difficult ideas. Each chapter ends by presenting one (or more) problems to facilitate and motivate self-study, in addition to a series of exercises with different level of difficulty with suggestions for further reading. The language and notation adopted throughout the book is consistently rigorous, which is essential in a first encounter with thermodynamics and often missed in introductory textbooks"--
