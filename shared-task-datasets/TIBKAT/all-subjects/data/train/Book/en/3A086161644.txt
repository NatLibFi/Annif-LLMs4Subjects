Mechanics of composite structures
Introduction -- Displacements, strains, stresses -- Laminated composites -- Thin plates -- Sandwich plates -- Beams -- Beams with shear deformation -- Shells -- Finite element analysis -- Failure criteria -- Micromechanics -- Appendix A Cross-sectional properties of thin-walled composite beams -- Appendix B Buckling loads and natural frequencies of orthotropic beams with shear deformation -- Appendix C Typical material properties
An increase in the use of composite materials has led to a greater demand for engineers versed in the design of structures made from such materials. This book demonstrates advanced concepts and emphasizes structures. More than 300 illustrations, 50 fully worked problems, and material properties data sets are included
