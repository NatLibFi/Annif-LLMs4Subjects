Interference Avoidance Methods for Wireless Systems
Interference Avoidance Algorithms -- Fixed Points, Convergence and Optimality -- Interference Avoidance Algorithms for Non-ideal Channels -- Generalization: Interference Avoidance for Multiaccess Vector Channels -- Applications -- Empirical Studies -- Conclusions.
Interference Avoidance Methods for Wireless Systems is an introduction to wireless techniques useful for uncoordinated unlicensed band systems, which use adaptive transmitters and receivers. The book provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis of interference avoidance algorithms in a general signal space framework that applies to a wide range of wireless communication scenarios with multiple users accessing the same communication resources. This book will be of interest to researchers, graduate students, and engineers working in the area of wireless communications as well as to technology policy makers working on radio frequency spectrum allocation. The book can also be used as a supplement text to advanced topics graduate courses in the area of wireless communication systems.
