A classic collection of time-proven physical techniques for the examination of the nervous system, written by one of North America's most respected neurologists. With simple prose and numerous helpful illustrations, the author describes in detail reliable bedside examination techniques that will pinpoint the location of a lesion in the nervous system and lead to a resolution of the problem. The techniques cover a wide variety of problem areas, including the visual pathways, the sensory system, upper motor neurons, cranial nerves, the cerebellar system, upper and lower limbs, reflexes, the corticospinal system, disorders of speech, and problems of stance, gait, and balance.
