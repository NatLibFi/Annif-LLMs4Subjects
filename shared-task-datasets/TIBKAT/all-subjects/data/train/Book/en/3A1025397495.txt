Kengo Kuma : complete works
The quintessential Japanese architect of today, Kengo Kuma has forged a modern design language that artfully combines the country's traditional building crafts with sophisticated technologies and materials. From his iconic Glass House (1995) to Dundee's V&A (2018), this is the complete record of Kuma's built work, comprising thirty projects to date. Kenneth Frampton's revised and updated essay frames Kuma's work in the context of post-war Japan's flourishing architecture scene and influential figures, and recounts the international acclaim that Kuma's ideas and buildings have received. The heart of the book consists of projects presented in detail, accompanied by descriptive text and detailed drawings, and organized by the material themes that have come to define the architect's output. This new edition includes five new projects: Komatsu Seiren Fabric Laboratory fa-bo, Under One Roof project for the EPFL ArtLab, Japan House Sao Paulo, China Academy of Art's Folk Art Museum, and the V&A Dundee
