The environment, sustainable development, and public policies : building sustainability in Brazil
This book presents an interdisciplinary perspective on the possibility of creating a sustainable path of economic development which would not harm the natural environment. It presents concepts, theories, methods and policy advice on sustainability and debates the difficulty in establishing a general notion of sustainability. The authors draw on a number of different disciplines to address the formulation of public policy for sustainable development in Brazil. They analyse the basic principles and motivations for sustainability, provide practical advice on how to coordinate public policies and indicate possible courses of action to reach a sustainable society. The authors conclude that there is a need to recognize the biophysical limits imposed on economics by ecosystems, the levels of participatory decision-making processes and the use of environmental services as a strategy for sustainable development. This book will be welcomed by academics and students working in the areas of ecological and environmental economics, sustainable development, development studies and Latin American studies as well as by policymakers and practitioners
