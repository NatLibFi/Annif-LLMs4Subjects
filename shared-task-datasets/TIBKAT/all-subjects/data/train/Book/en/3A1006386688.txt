How to build a quantum computer
Quantum computer technology is progressing rapidly with dozens of qubits and hundreds of quantum logic gates now possible. Although current quantum computer technology is distant from being able to solve computational problems beyond the reach of non-quantum computers, experiments have progressed well beyond simply demonstrating the requisite components. We can now operate small quantum logic processors with connected networks of qubits and quantum logic gates, which is a great stride towards functioning quantum computers. This book aims to be accessible to a broad audience with basic knowledge of computers, electronics and physics. The goal is to convey key notions relevant to building quantum computers and to present state-of-the-art quantum-computer research in various media such as trapped ions, superconducting circuits, photonics and beyond.
