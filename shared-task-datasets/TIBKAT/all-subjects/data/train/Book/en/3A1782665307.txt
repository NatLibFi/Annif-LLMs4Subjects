Symmetries and Applications of Differential Equations : In Memory of Nail H. Ibragimov (1939–2018)
Approximate symmetry in nonlinear physics problems -- One-dimensional ﬂows of a polytropic gas: Lie group classiﬁcation, conservation laws, invariant and conservative difference schemes -- Hamiltonian structure and conservation laws of three-dimensional linear elasticity theory -- Complex methods for Lie symmetry analysis -- Symmetry analysis and conservation laws of a family of Boussinesq equations -- Group Analysis of the Guéant and Pu Model of Option Pricing and Hedging -- On Involutive Systems of Partial Differential Equations -- Group analysis of some Camassa-Holm type equations.
This book is about Lie group analysis of differential equations for physical and engineering problems. The topics include: -- Approximate symmetry in nonlinear physical problems -- Complex methods for Lie symmetry analysis -- Lie group classiﬁcation, Symmetry analysis, and conservation laws -- Conservative difference schemes -- Hamiltonian structure and conservation laws of three-dimensional linear elasticity -- Involutive systems of partial differential equations This collection of works is written in memory of Professor Nail H. Ibragimov (1939–2018). It could be used as a reference book in differential equations in mathematics, mechanical, and electrical engineering.
