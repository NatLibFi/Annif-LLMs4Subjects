Tracer technology : modeling the flow of fluids
The tracer method was first introduced to measure the actual flow of fluid in a vessel, and then to develop a suitable model to represent this flow. Such models are used to follow the flow of fluid in chemical reactors and other process units, in rivers and streams, and through soils and porous structures. Also, in medicine they are used to study the flow of chemicals, harmful or not, in the blood streams of animals and man. Tracer Technology, written by Octave Levenspiel, shows how we use tracers to follow the flow of fluids and then we develop a variety of models to represent these flows. Th
