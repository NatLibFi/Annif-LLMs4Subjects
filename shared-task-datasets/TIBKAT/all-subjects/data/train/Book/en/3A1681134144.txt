The disabled detective : sleuthing disability in contemporary crime fiction
"The first book of its kind, The Disabled Detective explores representations of disability in crime fiction, from the earliest days of the genre to contemporary television drama. Susannah B. Mintz examines detective heroes with such conditions as blindness, deafness, paralysis, Asperger's, obsessive compulsive disorder, addiction, war trauma and many other impairments. Examining a wide range of texts, from Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories and the works of Agatha Christie to contemporary crime writers such as Jeffrey Deaver and Michael Collins and television dramas such as Monk, this book highlights how often characters with disabilities have been the heroes of crime fiction and how rarely this has been discussed in contemporary criticism"--Bloomsbury Collections
