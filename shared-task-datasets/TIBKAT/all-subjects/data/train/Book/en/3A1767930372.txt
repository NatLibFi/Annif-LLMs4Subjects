Nanoagronomy
In this age of population explosion and depleting natural resources, this book offers new techniques to produce more from agricultural crops at a lower cost. The field of agronomy addresses this issue and interacts with the fields of agriculture, botany, and economics. Nanotechnology and nanoparticles play a role in agronomy. This book joins techniques from both fields into once comprehensive volume. Students of agriculture, physics, nanotechnology, and plant sciences will benefit equally from this work.
