Fabulous : the rise of the beautiful eccentric
An exploration of what it means to be fabulous--and why eccentric style, fashion, and creativity are more crucial than ever. Prince once told us not to hate him because he's fabulous. But what does it mean to be fabulous? Is being fabulous only about labels, narcissism, and selfies? Or can acts of fabulousness be political gestures, too? Madison Moore answers these questions in a timely and fascinating book that explores how queer, black, and other marginalized outsiders use style and creativity in everyday life. Moving from catwalks and nightclubs to the street, Moore dialogues with a range of fabulous and creative powerhouses, including DJ Vjuan Allure, voguing superstar Lasseindra Ninja, fashion designer Patricia Field, performance artist Alok Vaid-Menon, and a wide range of other aesthetic renegades from the worlds of art, fashion, and nightlife. In a riveting synthesis of autobiography, cultural analysis, and ethnography, Moore positions fabulousness as a form of cultural criticism that allows those who perform it to thrive in a world where they are not supposed to exist
