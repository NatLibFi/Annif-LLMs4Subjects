Advanced Graph Theory
The present book is based on the curriculum of undergraduate and postgraduate courses of universities in India and abroad. Every effort is made to present the various topics in the theory of graphs in a logical manner with adequate historical background and include suitable figures to illustrate concepts and results ideally. The formidable exercises, neither easy nor straightforward, are bold faced and highlighted. The theory portion of each chapter is studied thoroughly as it helps solve many of the problems with comparative ease. Selected material from this book is used for a semester course on graph theory, while the entire book serves for a whole session course.
Introduction -- Trees -- Planar Graphs -- Directed Graphs -- Matching and Covering -- Colouring of Graphs -- Enumeration and Pölya’s Theorem -- Spectral Properties of Graph -- Emerging Trends in Graph Theory.
