Panel data : theory and applications : with 108 tables
The present book is a collection of panel data papers, both theoretical and applied. Theoretical topics include methodology papers on panel data probit models, treatment models, error component models with an ARMA process on the time specific effects, asymptotic tests for poolability and their bootstrapped versions. Applications include the impact of uncertainty on UK investment, a Tobin-q investment model using US firm data, technical change in the Japanese chemical industry, cost efficiency of Spanish banks, the problem of immigrant integration in Canada, an analysis of the dynamics of individual health in the UK, the relationship between inflation and growth among OECD and APEC countries, and modeling corner solutions in the industrial energy demand in the pulp and paper sector in France. This book , solicited from the 10th International conference on panel data, which was held at the Academy of Sciences in Berlin in July of 2002, is dedicated to the memory of G. S. Maddala and Zvi Griliches who contributed extensively to this topic and whose presence at panel data conferences will be sorely missed
