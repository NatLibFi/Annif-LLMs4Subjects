"Reconstruction explores the impact of the First World War on the built environment - examining the immediate and longer term aftermath of the Great War on the architecture of Britain and the British Empire during the interwar years.

This volume reveals how the architectural developments of this period not only provided important foundations for what happened after 1945 - they are also of real significance in their own right. Sixteen essays written by leading and emerging scholars bring together new and diverse approaches to the period - a period of reconstruction, fraught with the challenges of modernity and democratisation. The collection considers the complex effects of reconstruction on design, discourse, practice, and professionalism, and deals with the full spectrum of architectural styles and approaches, privileging neither Modernism nor traditional styles like the neo-Georgian.
