A research agenda for urban tourism
"Elgar Research Agendas outline the future of research in a given area. Leading scholars are given the space to explore their subject in provocative ways, and map out the potential directions of travel. They are relevant but also visionary. This timely Research Agenda explores and proposes critical lines of research to support understanding of the conditions under which urban tourism contributes to the development of urban systems, and what can be done to create and conserve these conditions. Chapters highlight conceptual discussions, concrete case studies and policy reviews to address the issues surrounding the economic, environmental and social impacts of tourism on cities. Analysing the trends that have characterized urban tourism in the past, the Research Agenda looks ahead to those that may influence it in the future, including the impact of Covid-19. Chapters further offer a thorough conceptualization and innovative definitions of the phenomenon of urban tourism. The critical issue of the sustainability of tourism development in cities is also discussed in depth. The Research Agenda provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the urban tourism debate, making it a critical read for urban studies and tourism scholars. The detailed case studies from across four continents will also be beneficial to policymakers and urban planners dealing with tourism development"--
