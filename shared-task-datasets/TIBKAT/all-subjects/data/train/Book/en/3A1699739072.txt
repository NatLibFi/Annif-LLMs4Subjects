"Utilising a cross-disciplinary approach that spans the fields of qualitative inquiry and educational research, this book offers, for the first time, a methodological text that focuses on poetry and educational research. It provides both analysis and examples of how poetry can be employed in a range of different ways, for different purposes, throughout the research process. This book is an essential resource for students and researchers' in education programmes, and those who teach in graduate research methods courses"--
