Neglected diseases and drug discovery
There are about 8 million deaths each year from neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in the underdeveloped world, whilst drug discovery focus and practice is only recently taking on greater urgency and embracing the latest technologies. This unique book is a state of the art review of drug discovery in respect of NTDs and highlights best practice to guide the ongoing drug discovery effort and also to raise debate and awareness in areas that remain highly neglected.All the major diseases such as malaria, trypanosomatids and TB are covered, with a review of each disease and established compounds, new mechanistic classes and new horizons. Each chapter highlights the key science that has led to breakthroughs, with detailed assessment of the key medicinal chemistry involved, and critical appraisal of new emerging approaches. Later chapters highlight under publicized disease areas where the medical needs are neglected and research is very limited, to raise awareness. The editors, acknowledged experts in the field, have a wealth of experience in successful drug discovery practice and tropical diseases
