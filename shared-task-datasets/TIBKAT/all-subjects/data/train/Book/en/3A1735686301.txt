International business
"We have continued to evolve the structure and content of this textbook in step with the rapidly changing world of international business. This includes completely revising several key chapters, including Chapter 6, on International Trade. This is entirely updated and includes new case studies covering both the trade-war between the US and China and the complex Brexit process. These and other real-world developments have made a wide range of stakeholders much more aware of the significance of global trade interdependencies than in the past. Chapter 16 on the European Union is also entirely updated to take account of Brexit and a range of new socio-political and economic events in Europe. Chapter 11 ('MNEs as Responsible Stakeholders') has been removed, making this edition more consolidated,with 20 rather than 21 chapters. In place of Chapter 11 we have inserted new sections, frameworks and case studies on responsible business throughout the book as a fundamental dimension of international businesstheory and practice across all the other chapters. New case studies, such as 'Businesses and NGOs working together on climate change' in Chapter 4, provideadditional material on this topic. Chapter 14, on 'Political risk and negotiation strategy' also features new case studies on the 'US-Venezuela oil dispute' and 'Huaweiaccused of spying'"--
