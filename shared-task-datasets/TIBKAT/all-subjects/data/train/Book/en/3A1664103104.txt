The Cambridge handbooks in construction robotics / Thomas Bock (Technische Universit채t M체nchen), Thomas Linner (Technische Universit채t M체nchen) ; volume 5: Ambient integrated robotics : automation and robotic technologies for maintenance, assistance, and service
"The new research field of Ambient/Active Assisted Living (AAL) is quickly evolving. Ambient Integrated Robotics provides an easy-to-understand medical perspective to architects, designers, and engineers, bridging the different disciplines and showing how they fuse together to create the future of AAL technology. Using robotics as an example, the book illustrates how embedding its subsystems results in unique ambient technology that can be used to help people, particularly in adapting to the needs of the unwell and elderly populations. You will be provided with the knowledge and tools to contribute to the future of AAL.  The Cambridge Handbooks on Construction Robotics series gives professionals, researchers, lecturers, and students basic conceptual and technical skills and strategies to manage, research, or teach the implementation of advanced automation, and robot-technology-based processes and technologies in construction. Books discuss progress in robot systems theory and demonstrates their integration using real  applications and projections"--
