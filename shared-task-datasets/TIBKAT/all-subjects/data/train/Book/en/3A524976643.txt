CMOS Logic Circuit Design is an up-to-date treatment of the analysis and design of CMOS integrated digital logic circuits. It is a self- contained treatment that covers all of the important digital circuit design styles found in modern CMOS chips. Introductory chapters on MOSFET physics and CMOS fabrication provide the background needed for a solid understanding of the circuit design techniques in the remainder of the book. Static CMOS logic design is given an in-depth treatment which covers both the analysis and design of these types of circuits. Emphasis is on analyzing circuits to understand the relationship between the design and performance in an integrated environment. Analytic models and their application are presented to provide a uniform base for the design philosophy developed in the study. Dynamic circuit concepts such as charge sharing and charge leakage are presented in detail and then applied to dynamic logic families such as domino cascades, self-resetting logic, and dynamic single-phase designs. Differential logic families are given an entire chapter that discusses CVSL, CPL, and related design styles. Chip issues such as interconnect modeling, crosstalk, and input/output circuits round out the coverage. CMOS Logic Circuit Design provides the reader with an opportunity to see the field in a unified manner that emphasizes solving design problems using the various logic styles available in CMOS. CMOS Logic Circuit Design is designed to be used as both a textbook (either in the classroom or for self-study) and as a reference for the VLSI chip designer.
