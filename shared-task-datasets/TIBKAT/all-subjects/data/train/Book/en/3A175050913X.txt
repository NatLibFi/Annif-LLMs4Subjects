Algorithms in bioinformatics : theory and implementation
"This book describes the main algorithms that are used to elucidate biological functions and relationships. All main areas of bioinformatics are covered including sequence alignment, molecular phylogenetics, gene and promoter prediction, structural bioinformatics, genomics, and proteomics. Graphical illustrations are used for technical details of computational algorithms to aid an in-depth understanding. This balanced, yet easily accessible book also shows how these algorithms can be implemented and used with 10 different programming languages. The author also provides 500 open source implementations and 25 ready-to-use course presentations. This book is ideal for upper-undergraduate bioinformatics courses, researchers, doctoral students, and sociologists or engineers charged with big data analysis"--
