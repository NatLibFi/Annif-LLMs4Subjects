"We cannot continue on a business-as-usual, carbon fuel dependent mode of operation, because the consequences of doing so are catching up with us. So, what must we do to ensure there is a tomorrow? In this book, experts from around the world come together to shed light on what we can do to preserve and expand resources key to the survival of human civilization - from the state-of-the-art of innovative engineering; to the latest status on energy, energy mix, and advancements in renewable energy - including the complementary energy storage using hydrogen; or innovative architecture for more sustainable buildings, including retrofitting of aging tall buildings; innovative ways to improve our air, water and coastline with nearshore biodiversity reclamation; to the subject of sustainable development through the water-energy-food nexus. This volume is recommended for research and graduate courses on energy and sustainability, and policymakers interested in the subjects."
