The refugee in the world : displacement and integration
From the forword: This book gives a contemporary picture of the global character of the refugee problem. It should help to allay the false optimism which has hindered an adequate approach to the problem in recent times, despite the World Refugee Year 1959/60 and the new funds for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
