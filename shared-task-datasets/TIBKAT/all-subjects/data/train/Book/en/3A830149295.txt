Highly accurate chemical speciation is of great importance in environmental, clinical, and food sciences, as well as in archaeometry. Trace analysis via atomic spectrometry, mass spectroscopy, gas chromatography, electron microprobing, or X-ray absorption spectroscopy provides detailed information on surface and sub-surface domain of samples. The book comprehensively presents modern techniques, timely application, and data modeli
