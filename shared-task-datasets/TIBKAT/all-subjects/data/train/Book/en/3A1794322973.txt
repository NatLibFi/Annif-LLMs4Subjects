Genomic selection in plants : a guide for breeders
"Genomic selection (GS) is a promising tool in the field of breeding especially in the era where genomic data is becoming cheaper. But its potential has been understated due to the limited adaptation in various crops. Marker assisted selection (MAS) has been the method of choice for plant breeders while using the genomic information in breeding pipeline. MAS, however, fails to capture vital minor gene effects while focussing only on the major genes. Ignoring majority of the genes involved in a trait, especially quantitative trait such as yield, is not ideal for breeding advancement. The main aim of statistical methodologies coming under the umbrella of GS on using the whole genome information is to predict potential candidates for breeding advancement while optimizing the use of resources such as land, manpower, and most importantly time. Lack of proper understanding of the methods and its applications is one of the reasons why breeders shy away from this tool. The book aims biologists especially breeders and thus provides a comprehensive idea on the statistical methodologies used in GS, guidance on the choice of GS models and the design of datasets. The book also encourages the readers to adopt GS by demonstrating the current scenarios of these models in some of the important crops in the genera of oilseeds, vegetables, legumes, tuber crops, and cereals. Having an understanding about the GS models and going through the success stories are not enough, however, to implement those by a breeder. Therefore, the book also provides hands-on scripts on GS data design and modelling in a popular and free statistical program for the breeders to use. Additionally, prospective in GS model development and thereby enhancement in crop improvement programs is discussed"--
