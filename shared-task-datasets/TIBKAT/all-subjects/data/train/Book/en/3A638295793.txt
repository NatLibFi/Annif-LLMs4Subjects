Introduction to computational proteomics
"This book tackles the steps and problems involved with protein analysis, classification, and meta-organization. It starts with the analysis of individual entities and proceeds to the analysis of more complex entities, from protein families to interactions, cellular pathways, and gene networks. The first part of the book presents methods for identifying the building blocks of the protein space, algorithms for assessing similarity between proteins, and mathematical models for representing protein families and classifying new instances. The second part covers methods that investigate higher order structure in the protein space through the application of unsupervised learning algorithms"--Provided by publisher
