Making and breaking symmetry in chemistry : syntheses, mechanisms and molecular rearrangements
"This book emphasises the crucial role played by symmetry in modern synthetic chemistry, from famous classical experiments to advances brought about by the introduction of new techniques. The first part presents the breaking of molecular symmetry to resolve mechanistic problems, while the second part discusses the making of molecular symmetry, i.e., preparation of highly symmetrical molecules"--
