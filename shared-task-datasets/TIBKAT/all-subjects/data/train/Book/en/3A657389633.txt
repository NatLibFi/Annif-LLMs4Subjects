What's become of cultural studies?
"... Exploration of cultural studies in the twenty-first century.  It offers a level-headed account of where cultural studies has come from, the methodological and theoretical dilemmas that it faces today, and an agenda for its future development. In an age in which the relevance of cultural studies has been called into question, this book seeks to generate debate. Focusing upon the actual practice of cultural studies within higher education today, it asks whether or not cultural studies has really managed to maintain a connection with its original political and ethical mission and comments on the strategies needed to regain the initiative.  ... Each chapter supports and guides the reader by introducing the key issues, reviewing the relevant commentary, and offering a critical conclusion of how each theme fits into a bigger picture.  This timely and provocative consideration of cultural studies as a global discipline will be essential reading for academics and students working in the field for years to come."--
