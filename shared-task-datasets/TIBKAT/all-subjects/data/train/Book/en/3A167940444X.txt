Banking on change : the development and future of financial services : a collection of essays commissioned by the London Institute of Banking & Finance
"This book is being published to mark the 140th anniversary of The London Institute of Banking & Finance. Our aim was to produce a publication that is of lasting value to both students and professionals - in line with the founding principles of the 'Institute of Bankers in England' in 1879. Financial services is going through a period of profound change, so we approached experts from across the industry to tackle some of the most exciting and contentious topics. What, for example, will the future of retail banking look like as fintech competition hots up? Will credit provision change? How should the financial services professionals of the future be selected and trained? We also have some more personal pieces, including a look-back at the changes seen during a long career in banking, and a call for more appreciation of the value that financial services bring to society. In the Introduction, Navigating The Centuries, Ouida Taaffe examines how the work of The London Institute of Banking & Finance has not only informed the development of financial services over the past 140 years, but has also helped to shape the wider culture and economy."
