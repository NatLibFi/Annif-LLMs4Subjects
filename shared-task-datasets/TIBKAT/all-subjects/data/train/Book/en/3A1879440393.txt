Organizing in the face of risk and threat
Barbara Czarniawska is a distinguished scholar and author in the field of organization. Drawing on her extensive knowledge she has gathered together other leading experts to apply organization theory to yet another relevant field of practice - risk management. There are no prescriptions for organizing in the face of risk and threat, but the accumulating experience shows that a well-rehearsed improvisation brings much better results than planning and construction of formal organizations. This timely book contains cases of risk and threat where the former strategy succeeds and the latter fails. The wealth of cases presented includes the Marburg virus outbreak in Angola, bird flu, health insurance after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and the Tj√∂rn bridge catastrophe in Sweden. Graduate and postgraduate students in business and management schools, as well as academics teaching courses in risk management across disciplines should not be without this book. Risk management specialists will also find this book invaluable
