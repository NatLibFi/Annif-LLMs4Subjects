Transformer engineering : design, technology, and diagnostics
"One of the most important and critical constituents of power systems, transformers require deep practical knowledge about their design and operating practices. Blending theory and practice, this second edition of a bestselling text reinforces previous knowledge and offers significant updates and additional information. New topics include short-circuit stresses and withstand, advanced electromagnetic field computations, insulation design, and diagnostic techniques. Using modern computational techniques to solve intricate problems, this edition also presents a completely new chapter on modeling of transformers for power system studies and elaborates on a sample design of a typical power transformer"--
