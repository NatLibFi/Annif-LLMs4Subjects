Tree houses : escape to the canopy
Treehouses have come a long way since our collective childhoods. The very definition of a treehouse has broadened to now include anything from a hotel room where star gazing is must to exceptional viewing platforms and, of course, not forgetting a treehouse for kids such as exists only in their dreams. This carefully compiled list provides an overview of striking treehouse design across the globe, with designs that are truly beautiful. An inspiring collection, the reader will wonder in amazement at the exquisite and whimsical constructions dreamed up by modern architects. This beautiful edition is lavishly illustrated with evocative full-colour images of arboreal architecture, with a focus on the verdant treetop canopies. This book will not only appeal to your inner child, but provide a welcome respite from the stress of modern living on a pleasurable visit to the green world of treehouses
