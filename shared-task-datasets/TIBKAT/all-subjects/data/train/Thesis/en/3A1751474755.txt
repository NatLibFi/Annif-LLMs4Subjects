Catalytic applications towards sustainability
The application of catalytic technologies towards the development of sustainable processes and products are showcased. In Part One, safe polymerization catalysts for silicones are presented, together with novel base-metal systems for the production of biodegradable polymers. In Part Two, novel copper-based catalytic systems for the synthesis of enynes and heterocycles are presented, refraining from the use of pre-functionalized substrates. In Part Three, metal-free catalyst for aerobic oxidation reactions are presented, including heterogeneous carbocatalysts and persistent radical cations.<eng>
