Anisotropic filtering of non-linear surface features
A new method for noise removal of arbitrary surfaces meshes is presented which focuses on the preservation and sharpening of non-linear geometric features such as curved surface regions and feature lines. Our method uses a prescribed mean curvature flow (PMC) for simplicial surfaces which is based on three new contributions: 1. the definition and efficient calculation of a discrete shape operator and principal curvature properties on simplicial surfaces that is fully consistent with the well-known discrete mean curvature formula, 2. an anisotropic discrete mean curvature vector that combines the advantages of the mean curvature normal with the special anisotropic behaviour along feature lines of a surface, and 3. an anisotropic prescribed mean curvature flow which converges to surfaces with an estimated mean curvature distribution and with preserved non-linear features. Additionally, the PMC flow prevents boundary shrinkage at constrained and free boundary segments.
