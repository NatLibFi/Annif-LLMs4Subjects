Non-radiative recombination losses in perovskite solar cells : from fundamental understanding to high efficiency devices
In the last decade the photovoltaic research has been preponderantly overturned by the arrival of metal halide perovskites. The introduction of this class of materials in the academic research for renewable energy literally shifted the focus of a large number of research groups and institutions. The attractiveness of halide perovskites lays particularly on their skyrocketing efficiencies and relatively simple and cheap fabrication methods. Specifically, the latter allowed for a quick development of this research in many universities and institutes around the world at the same time.  The outcome has been a fast and beneficial increase in knowledge with a consequent terrific improvement of this new technology. On the other side, the enormous amount of research promoted an immense outgrowth of scientific literature, perpetually published. Halide perovskite solar cells are now effectively competing with other established photovoltaic technologies in terms of power conversion efficiencies and production costs. Despite the tremendous ...
