Sprachwelten und Sprachwissen : Theorie und Praxis einer kognitiven Laienlinguistik
"This volume uses a socio-cognitive concept of knowledge and looks at everyday realms of experience to develop a comprehensive model of folk-linguistic knowledge, which is verified using empirical data. It is the first to comprehensively model lay people. The result is a theoretically based picture of the practitioners of folk linguistics as well as an extensive analysis of data on how linguistic concepts are used in everyday life."--Publisher's website
