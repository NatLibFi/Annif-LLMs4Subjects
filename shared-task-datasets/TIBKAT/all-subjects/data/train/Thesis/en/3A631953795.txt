Zum postnatalen Wachstum der Nasenhöhle des Schimpansen (Pan troglodytes) : eine biometrische Studie
In the Literature exist Gaps in the Knowledge about the Morphology and the Growth of the nasal Cavity of Primates, in particular from Pan troglodytes. In this Work became on the Basis of 46 chimpanzee Skulls both of sex in three different geriatric Degrees the postnatal Growth and the Morphology of the nasal Cavity of Pan troglodytes, examined taking into Account the sexual Dimorphism. In Addition, the postnatal nasal cavity Growth of the Chimpanzees was compared to the other Primate. To the Representation of the nasal cavity Morphology computed tomographic Images were made by all Skulls. To take into Account the rhomboiden nasal cavity Form, became, based on the single coronary Layer series, with the help of the Winsurf® - Software, 3D-Reconstructions of the nasal Cavities made and their Volumes calculated...
