Iron oxidation state in (Mg,Fe)O : calibration of the Flank method on synthetic samples and applications on natural inclusions from lower mantle diamonds
O ferropericlase is the most common mineral found in diamonds originating in the lower mantle (more than 50% of occurrences). It is well known that the Fe3+ concentration in (Mg,Fe)O is sensitive to oxygen fugacity, even at high pressures. Therefore, the determination of Fe3+/Fetot in such inclusions provides a direct method for investigating lower mantle redox conditions during diamond formation. The goal of the present research is to calibrate the flank method ∫ by electron microprobe using synthetic (Mg,Fe)O, and then apply the method to determine in situ Fe3+/Fetot in ferropericlase inclusions from lower mantle diamonds. Up to now a calibration of the flank method is available only for garnets. Initially, the flank method was calibrated for garnets to test the reproducibility of the method on the Jeol XA-8200 electron microprobe in use at Bayerisches Geoinstitut. Results showed that for garnets a new calibration curve needs to be established at each working session. Then the flank method was calibrated for the Jeol XA-8200 electron microprobe in use at Bayerisches Geoinstitut for a homogeneous set of (Mg,Fe)O ferropericlase crystals over a wide range of composition (xFe = 2 to 60 at.%) and Fe3+/Fetot (1 to 15%). Samples were obtained by performing high pressure high temperature experiments in a multi anvil apparatus. In order to avoid compositional effects on flank method measurements, the high sample homogeneity was essential. Moreover, the determination of the Fe3+/Fetot ratio needed to be extremely accurate...
