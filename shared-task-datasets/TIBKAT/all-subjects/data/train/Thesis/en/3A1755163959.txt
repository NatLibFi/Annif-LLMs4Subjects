Impact of climate change effects on diversity and function of pelagic heterotrophic bacteria studied in large-scale mesocosm facilities
The unprecedented increase in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHG) by anthropogenic activities since the Industrial Revolution impacts on various earth system processes, commonly referred to as `climate changeÂ´ (CC). CC faces aquatic ecosystems with extreme abiotic perturbations that potentially alter the interrelations between functional autotrophic and heterotrophic plankton groups. These relations, however, modulate biogeochemical cycling and mediate the functioning of aquatic ecosystems as C sources or sinks to the atmosphere. The aim of this thesis was therefore to investigate how different aspects of CC influence community composition and functioning of pelagic heterotrophic bacteria. These organisms constitute a major component of biogeochemical cycling and largely determine the balance between autotrophic and heterotrophic processes ...
