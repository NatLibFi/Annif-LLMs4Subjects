Azimuthal asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic hadron muoproduction on longitudinally polarized protons
Zusammenfassung: In recent years, measuring azimuthal asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) off polarized targets emerged as a powerful tool to investigate the nucleon spin structure, one of the main objectives of the COMPASS physics program. The two-stage COMPASS spectrometer at the CERN SPS is characterized by a large acceptance and a broad kinematic coverage. It makes use of a tertiary longitudinally polarized high-energetic Î¼+ beam, impinging on a transversely or longitudinally polarized ammonia target.This thesis is dedicated to the analysis of both leading and subleading longitudinal target spin dependent asymmetries arising in the SIDIS cross section of one hadron and hadron pair production. The results provide new insights to the longitudinal spin structure of the nucleon, addressing the role of spin-orbit couplings and quark-gluon correlations in the framework of collinear or transverse momentum dependent factorization
