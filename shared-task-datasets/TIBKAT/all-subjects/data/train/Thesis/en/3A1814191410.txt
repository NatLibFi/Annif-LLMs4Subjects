Spatial and temporal variability in the Northeast Atlantic Subtropical gyre and implications for the biogeochemistry of the region
Ocean circulation distributes heat, salt, and nutrients through the different basins. Thus, changes in circulation will ultimately impact the biogeochemistry of the ocean. In this work, the variability of currents and water column properties were studied in the Northeast Subtropical Atlantic, together with changes in the biogeochemistry in the upper 300 m over the North Atlantic Subtropical gyre. It was found that ocean circulation and biogeochemistry in the North Atlantic underwent drastic changes since the 1960s, leading to a reduction in the CO2 uptake by the oceans in the last 100 years.<eng>
