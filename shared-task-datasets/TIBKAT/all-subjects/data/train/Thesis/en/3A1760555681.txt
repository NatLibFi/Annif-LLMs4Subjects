Proteasomal protein turnover during defense priming in Arabidopsis
The ubiquitin-proteasome-system (UPS) is a cellular cascade involving three enzymatic steps for protein ubiquitination to target them to the 26S proteasome for proteolytic degradation. Several components of the UPS have been shown to be central for regulation of defense responses during infections with phytopathogenic bacteria. Upon recognition of the pathogen, local defense is induced which also primes the plant to acquire systemic resistance (SAR) for enhanced immune responses upon challenging infections. Here, ubiquitinated proteins were shown to accumulate locally and systemically during infections with Psm and after treatment with the SAR-inducing metabolites salicylic acid (SA) and pipecolic acid (Pip). The role of the 26S proteasome in local defense has been described in several studies, but the potential role during SAR remains elusive and was therefore investigated in this project by characterizing the Arabidopsis proteasome mutants rpt2a-2 and rpn12a-1 during priming and infections with Pseudomonas.
