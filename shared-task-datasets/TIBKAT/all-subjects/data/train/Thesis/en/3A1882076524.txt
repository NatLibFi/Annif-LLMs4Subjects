Photosynthesis in fluctuating light : pgr5 suppressor mutant screen : low NPQ mutant identification and characterization
Light is the essential energy source for plants to drive photosynthesis. In nature, light availability is highly variable and often fluctuates on very short time scales. As a result, plants developed mechanisms to cope with these fluctuations. Understanding how to improve light use efficiency in natural fluctuating light (FL) conditions is a major target for agronomy. In the first project, we identified an Arabidopsis thaliana plant that showed reduced levels of rapidly inducible non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). This plant was devoid of any T-DNA insertion. Using a mapping-by-sequencing approach, we successfully located the causal genomic region near the end of chromosome 4. Through variant investigations in that region, we identified a deletion of about 20 kb encompassing 9 genes. By complementation analysis, we confirmed that one of the deleted genes, VTC2, is the causal gene responsible for the low NPQ. Loss of VTC2 decreased NPQ particularly in old leaves, with young leaves being only slightly affected. [...]
