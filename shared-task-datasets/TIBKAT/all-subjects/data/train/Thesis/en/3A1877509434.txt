Continuous curvature measures on convex bodies
The purpose of this thesis is to introduce the concept of continuous translation-invariant curvature measures which generalizes the notion of smooth translation-invariant curvature measures due to Bernig and Fu. Many of the classical theorems for the space Val of continuous translation-invariant valuations translate to Curv. In particular, it is known that Curv admits a grading analogous to the McMullen decomposition of Val. Moreover, we equip Curv with a Banach space topology and we prove that Curv admits counterparts to the characterization theorems of Hadwiger, McMullen and Klain–Schneider. Since Curv is naturally an infinite dimensional representation of the general linear group GL(n,R), we introduce the linear subspace of GL(n,R)-smooth vectors and conjecture that this space coincides with the space of smooth translation-invariant curvature measures. This conjecture is verified in certain degrees of homogeneity and in low dimensions. Inspired by Alesker's irreducibility theorem for Val, we also study Jordan–Hölder series in the representation Curv. Our results lead us to conjecture that their length does not exceed two for a given degree and parity.
