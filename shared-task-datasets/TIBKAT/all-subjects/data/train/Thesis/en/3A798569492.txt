Skaz und Unreliable Narration : Entwurf einer neuen Typologie des Erz√§hlers
"For decades, experts in Slavic studies and English and American studies have engaged in separate discussions on the narratological concepts of skaz and unreliable narration, generally unbeknownst to each other. This study challenges earlier attempts to define these terms and uses close textual analysis to integrate these stylistic and semantic phenomena for the first time into a new and synthetic typology of the narrator." --
