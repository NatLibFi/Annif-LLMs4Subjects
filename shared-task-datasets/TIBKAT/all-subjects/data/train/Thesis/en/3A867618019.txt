Motherhood and self-realization in the four waves of American feminism and Joyce Carol Oates's recent fiction
"The author examines motherhood and female self-realization in feminist discourse and Joyce Carol Oates's recent fiction. While the first and second wave of feminism repudiated motherhood, the third wave claimed the right to enjoy it. The present fourth wave is now reviving the reservations about motherhood of the first two waves. This book demonstrates how Oates's writing reflects these shifts and how Oates takes up and transforms feminist standpoints in her work without writing conventional feminist literature. Literary criticism has only marginally dealt with Oates's mother figures. Drawing on Gender Studies and, in particular, on the transnational relation between French and American feminism, this book fills this gap."--
