Redox signalling in plants
Once proteins are synthesized, they can additionally be modified by post-translational modifications (PTMs). Proteins containing reactive cysteine thiols, stabilized in their deprotonated form due to their local environment as thiolates (RS-), serve as redox sensors by undergoing a multitude of oxidative PTMs (Ox-PTMs). Ox-PTMs such as S-nitrosylation or formation of inter- or intra-disulfide bridges induce functional changes in these proteins. Proteins containing cysteines, whose thiol oxidation state regulates their functions, belong to the so-called redoxome. Such Ox-PTMs are controlled by site-specific cellular events that play a crucial role in protein regulation, affecting enzyme catalytic sites, ligand binding affinity, protein-protein interactions or protein stability. Reversible protein thiol oxidation is an essential regulatory mechanism of photosynthesis, metabolism, and gene expression in all photosynthetic organisms. Therefore, studying PTMs will remain crucial for understanding plant adaptation to external stimuli like ...
