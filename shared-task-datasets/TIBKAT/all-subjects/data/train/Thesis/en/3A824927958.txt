The missionaray legacy in Pearl Buck and her fiction
Nobel Prize winner Pearl S. Buck's engagment with (neo- ) missionary cultures in the United States and China was unique. Against the backdrop of her missionary upbringing, Buck developed a fictional project which both revised and reaffirmed American foreign missionary activity in the Pacific Rim durinjg the 20th century. Vanessa KÃ¼nnemann accurately traces this project from America's number one expert on China - as Buck came to be known - from a variety of disciplinary angles, placing her work squarely in Middlebrow Studies and New American Studies. -- from back cover
