This thesis focuses on the establishment of biocatalytic cascade reactions for the production and detection of industrially relevant flavor and fragrance compounds for food and cosmetic products. To meet the consumerâ€™s demand for those products to be natural, environmentally friendly biocatalytic manufacturing processes that operate GMO-free must be established. Thus, this thesis presents such pathways for the production of an industrially relevant long-chain hydroxy fatty acid and the important flavor and aroma compound raspberry ketone. Furthermore, a biosensor for aldehyde detection was implemented to facilitate screening for suitable biocatalysts that produce industrially relevant aldehydes that are widely applied in the flavor and fragrance industry.
