Multi-instrument study of the hourly pulsations in Saturnâ€™s magnetosphere
The in-situ exploration of the magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn has revealed various pulsed phenomena, some of them being periodic. In Saturn's magnetosphere, several studies have reported pulsations with a periodicity of around one hour in the measurements of charged particle fluxes, plasma wave emissions, magnetic field strength and auroral emission brightness. This thesis reports the first multi-instrument study of these hourly pulsations using data sets of several instruments on board the Cassini spacecraft orbiting around Saturn since 2004. A 10-year survey of the quasi-periodic ho...
