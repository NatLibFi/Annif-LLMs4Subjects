Existence and stability of stellardynamic models
We examine existence and stability of stationary solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson system. This system is used in stellardynmaics to describe the evolution of galaxies where collissions are neglected and the evolution is determined by the self-consistent gravitational field which is created by the particles, e.g. the stars.In the first part we examine steady states which decsribe static shells under the influence of a fixed point mass. These solutions can be used as a model for a galaxy with a massive black hole in its center. For the Vlasov-Poisson system under the influence of such a point mass, we prove a global existence result. In the second part, we construct axially symmetric solutions depending on Jacobis integral. The presented results are in accordance with the numerical examinations of the P. O. Vandervoort.
