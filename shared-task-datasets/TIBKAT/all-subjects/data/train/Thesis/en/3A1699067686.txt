Barrier corona (BC) arrangements are employed in different plasma-based applications such as material surface and exhaust gas treatments. However, a comprehensive study about the discharge behavior and properties in such strongly asymmetric arrangements is still missing. This dissertation is devoted to the detailed investigation of single microdischarges (MDs) in a sinusoidally driven BC discharge in air at atmospheric pressure. The discharge arrangement consist of a sharp metal pin and a dielectric-covered hemispherical electrode. It is the first study of volume BC discharges, in which phasially-resolved spatio-temporal development of the MDs are recorded using a multi-dimensional time-correlated single photon counting (TC-SPC) technique. The morphology of the MDs is recorded using an ICCD camera. A voltage probe and a current probe are employed to measure the applied voltage and current pulses. Furthermore, phase-resolved current measurements and statistical studies of current pulse amplitudes are realized using an oscilloscope. Due to the asymmetric geometry and material of the electrodes, discharge behavior in the two polarities of the applied sinusoidal voltage is significantly different. For the voltage amplitude being applied, mostly two MDs appear in the anodic pin half-cycles. It is observed that the breakdown mechanism in both MDs is a positive streamer starting near the anode, similar to the single MDs in symmetric dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs). However, the ...
