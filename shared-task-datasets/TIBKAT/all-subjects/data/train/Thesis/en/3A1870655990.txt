Observing conflict escalation in world society : Ukraine's Maidan and Mali's breakup
How do conflicts escalate? This is one of the major questions in conflict research. To offer further answers, Richard Bösch follows a tripartite agenda: First, he develops a constructivist methodology for the study of conflict escalation embedded in a Luhmannian systems theoretical world society perspective. Bösch argues that conflicts can be observed as social systems and he looks at the process of conflict escalation by analysing communication. Second, this analysis offers two cases studies: the Maidan protests in Ukraine 2013-2014 and Mali's crisis 2010-2012. Third, it gives impulses on how systems theoretical research can further on be beneficial for Peace and Conflict Studies.
