Preparation and characterization of planar hybrid Josephson junctions based on Ba-122 pnictide single crystals
In this work, it has been realized to fabricate and investigate of the Josephson junctions based on iron pnictide Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 single crystals (Co:Ba-122) using established thin-film process. The designed layout was achieved for the first time worldwide which is a planar hybrid Josephson junctions. The c-axis planar junctions were achieved, in which were tested different barriers such as the intrinsic barrier, or metal barrier (gold) then were further developed to use the insulating barrier (titanium oxide, aluminum oxide).
