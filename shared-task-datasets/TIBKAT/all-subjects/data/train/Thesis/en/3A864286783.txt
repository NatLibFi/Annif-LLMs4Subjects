Ant colony optimization based inverse folding of mono- and bistable RNA macromolecules
Zusammenfassung: Since the discovery of structural conformations of DNA in the middle of the 20th century not only technologies that can elucidate structures of biologically relevant molecules have become more sophisticated, but the understanding of biological processes on the molecular level in general has grown tremendously in the last 60 years of research. In this same time, the early and dogmatic statement, according to which proteins are the only entities in molecular biological perception that can perform and provide necessary biological, e.g. enzymatic, functions within organisms, has undergone major revision. Of course, proteins do still perform the functions, which have been annotated, but in addition to the level of control of the proteins, specific RNA molecules, namely the non-coding RNAs, have been accounted to the executing functional level so far exclusive to proteins. As in the case of the proteins, a functional RNA receives its specific function from a biologically active structure conformation, which strongly correlates with the respective RNA sequence
