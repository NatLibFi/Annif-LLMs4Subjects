The quality of divided democracies : minority inclusion, exclusion, and representation in the new Europe
"The Quality of Divided Democracies is about how democracy works, or fails to work, in ethno-culturally divided societies. It advances a new theoretical approach to assessing quality of democracy in divided societies, and puts it into practice with the focused comparison of two divided democracies - Estonia and Latvia.
