Hidden topographies : traces of urban reality in dystopian fiction
This book examines dystopian fiction’s recent paradigm shift towards urban dystopias. It links the dystopian tradition with the literary history of the novel, spatial turn concepts, and systems-theory. The result is a detailed overview of how dystopian fiction constantly adapts to – and reflects on – the actual world. The book is intended for all researchers who are interested in the dystopian tradition and in science fiction in general.
