Lower cretaceous geothermal reservoirs in the North German basin
This thesis contributes to the strategic effort to make Germanyâ€™s energy supply more sustainable. The primary focus of this study was to enhance and update the geological knowledge of the Mesozoic deep geothermal sandstone aquifer complexes. The economically important Mesozoic deposits have been studied for decades, for example, the Buntsandstein, the Keuper, the Jurassic and the Lower and Upper Cretaceous. A comprehensive data base is provided by the data resulting from intensive hydrocarbon exploration since the last century. However, previous detailed work on Lower Cretaceous deposits ha...
