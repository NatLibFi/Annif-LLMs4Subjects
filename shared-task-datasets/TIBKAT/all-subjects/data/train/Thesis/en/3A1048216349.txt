Thermochemical utilization of algae with focus on hydrothermal processes
The utilization of hydrothermal treatment was tested on four different microalgae species (Scenedesmus rubescens, Chlorella vulgaris, Nannochloropsis oculata, Arthrospira platensis). The experiments showed that these species have different product characteristics and yields under the same hydrothermal processing conditions. In comparison to other standard disintegration and lipid extraction methods HT gave better results.<eng>
