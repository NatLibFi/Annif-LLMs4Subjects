Erdbeben-Mikrozonierung von Lörrach und Weil am Rhein, südlicher Oberrheingraben
The densely populated border triangle Germany-France-Switzerland is situated at the south-eastern Upper Rhine Graben. This area is one prominent region of earthquake hazard in central Europe. Accordingly, on the German side an earthquake zonation map is used. However, in case of an earthquake the local ground motion might show significant variations even at short distances, due to several factors including the local geology and tectonics, the so called site effects. Earthquake microzonation maps were developed to describe such site effects.  A qualitative earthquake microzonation map of greater Lörrach, an urban area in Germany, was developed during this study, to describe relative attenuation (deamplification) and amplification of near-surface seismic waves in the investigation area. This study focused on developing a microzonation approach. The approach presented in this study is based primarily on the three columns; geological information, ambient vibration measurements and earthquake recordings...
