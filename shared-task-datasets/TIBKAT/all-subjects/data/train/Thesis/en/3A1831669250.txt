Paradigm uniformity in inflectional stems : durational differences in production and perception
What happens phonetically in the production of stems in words such as days and daze? Do inflectional stems differ phonetically from monomorphemic words? Can these differences be perceived? This volume aims to answer these questions in a replication project by investigating data from two corpora and a production experiment, as well as by extending this research with two perception experiments. It investigates what happens phonetically in the stems of words that end in homophonous suffixes, and whether listeners can perceive these subtle phonetic differences. Two potential effects were termed; categorical paradigm uniformity, in which stems of words ending in [s, z] are expected to have longer durations if these words are morphologically complex (e.g. days is longer than daze), as well as gradient paradigm uniformity, in which the frequency of related words is expected to have an influence on paradigm members (e.g. day influences days). Findings from these studies contribute to a growing body of research in the field of morphophonetics
