Enzymatische Charakterisierung des Intermediär- und Fermentationsstoffwechsels von Staphylococcus aureus COL und Bacillus subtilis 168
Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is one of the most feared pathogens, responsible for a variety of nosocomial infections and a range of diseases. S. aureus is able to respond to changes in environmental conditions with adaptation on gene expression level resulting in different protein patterns and therefore changes in metabolite composition and metabolic activity. Furthermore the ability to develop resistances against present antibiotics makes S. aureus dangerous and difficult to handle for man. For a complete understanding of proteome, transcriptome and metabolome, the investigation of enzyme activities is a crucial step. In the presented study catalytic properties and specific enzyme activities from enzymes of the intermediary and fermentative metabolism were investigated. In cells growing exponentially, transiently, stationary or under anaerobic conditions the enzymes pH optima, maximum speed of activity (vmax) and the substrate concentration to produce 50 % of vmax (Km) were determined. In S. aureus COL the glucose mainly metabolised via glycolysis under aerobic conditions. Glucose 6-phosphate metabolizes to pyruvate, which either will be converted to acetylphosphate by the pyruvate oxidase or to acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Acetyl-CoA is turned into acetylphosphate by the phosphate acetyltransferase, whereas the transformation of acetyl-CoA in the citric acid cycle is not probable. By the acetate kinase, acetylphosphate will be used ...
