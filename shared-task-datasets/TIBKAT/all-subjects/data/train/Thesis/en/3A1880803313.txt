Modeling of the ship grounding effects with the use of multiphase hydrostatics
Englische Zusammenfassung: The objective of this thesis is to describe the implementation of the extension of the hydrostatics computation within a Ship Design Environment, in order to compute the stability of a floating object in a two-phase incompressible fluid mixture. Furthermore, the possible extent of modeling the seabed with a very dense incompressible fluid is researched and presented. Moreover, it is presented at what extent computational tools conceived for the early ship design stage, extended with multiphase hydrostatics capabilities, can be used for analyzing the ship stability and plan the refloating of a casualty. The practical use of the calculation model is demonstrated by analyzing the grounding incidents of the bulk carrier “Glory Amsterdam” and the container ship “Indian Ocean”, and part of the salvage operations for the ferries “Herald of free Enterprise” and “Sewol”.
