Networked nation : mapping German cities in Sebastian M端nster's 'Cosmographia'
Klappentext: In 'Networked Nation: Mapping German Cities in Sebastian M端nster's 'Cosmographia', Jasper van Putten examines the groundbreaking woodcut city views in the German humanist Sebastian M端nster's 'Cosmographia'. This description of the world, published in Basel from 1544 to 1628, glorified the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation and engendered the city book genre. Van Putten argues that M端nster's network of city view makers and contributors - from German princes and artists to Swiss woodcutters, draftsmen, and printers - expressed their local and national cultural identities in the views. The 'Cosmographia', and the city books it inspired, offer insights into the development of German and Swiss identity from 1550 to Switzerland's independence from the empire in 1648.
