Twisted K-theory with coefficients in a C*-algebra and obstructions against positive scalar curvature metrics
We introduce the notion of twisted Hilbert A-module bundles to construct a geometric realization of twisted K-theory with coefficients in a C*-algebra A. Like ordinary bundles of Hilbert A-modules provide a generalization of vector bundles, twisted Hilbert A-module bundles extend the concept of modules over bundle gerbes. Their corresponding Grothendieck group is isomorphic to K_0(C(M,S)), where S denotes a bundle of C*-algebras, such that its structure group reduces to PU(A) = U(A)/U(1). In case S is a bundle of matrix algebras the above description boils down to ordinary twisted K-theory, therefore K_0(C(M,S)) can be understood as twisted K-theory with coefficients in A ...
