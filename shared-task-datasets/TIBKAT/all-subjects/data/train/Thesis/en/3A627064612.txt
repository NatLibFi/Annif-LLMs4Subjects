Classical and hybrid modeling of gene regulatory networks
We present classical and hybrid modeling approaches for genetic regulatory networks focusing on promoter analysis for negatively and positively autoregulated networks. The main aim of this thesis is to introduce an alternative mathematical approach to model gene regulatory networks based on piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMP). During somitogenesis, a process describing the early segmentation in vertebrates, molecular oscillators play a crucial role as part of a segmentation clock. In mice, these oscillators are called Hes1 and Hes7 and are commonly modeled by a system of two delay differential equations including a Hill function, which describes gene repression by their own gene products. The Hill coefficient, which is a measure of nonlinearity of the binding processes in the promoter, is assumed to be equal to two, based on the fact that Hes1 and Hes7 form dimers...
