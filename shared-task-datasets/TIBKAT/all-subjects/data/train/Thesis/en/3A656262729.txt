Cooperative communications with partial channel state information in mobile radio systems
Future 4G mobile radio cellular networks are considered OFDM-MIMO systems. Cooperative communication based on coordinated base stations is a very promising concept to perform inter-cell interference management. This thesis deals with the concept of cooperative communication from its information-theoretic background to its practical system design. The main focus is a practical design of the joint detection scheme in the uplink and the joint transmission scheme in the downlink with partial channel-state information (CSI), i.e., significant CSI and imperfect CSI.
