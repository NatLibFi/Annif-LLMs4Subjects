Intra- and interspecific variation of functional traits, growth performance and belowground competition in [Populus] species
Short-rotation forestry (SRF) systems provide sustaining resource supply that is needed to meet the rapidly increasing demand in wood products and renewable energy. Poplar species (Populus spp.) are frequently used for such plantations as they maintain high yield along wide environmental ranges. Specifically aspen (Populus tremula and P. tremuloides) reach considerable productivity even on poor soils and exhibit relatively high drought tolerance when compared to other taxa of the genus. However, the use of aspen in SRF systems is not well established. The aim of this st...
