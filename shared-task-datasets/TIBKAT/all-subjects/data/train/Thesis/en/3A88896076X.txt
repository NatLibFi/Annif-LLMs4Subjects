During the 19th and 20th century massive aesthetization processes can be observed by which the aesthetic assumes an important dimension of social interaction. Aesthetization affects not only the designed objects and environments but also the individual ways of perceiving and a knowinga . The aesthetic becomes increasingly involved in the production of meaning and in the development of subjective worldviews. Concerning this relevance of the aesthetic which is not anymore restrictable to the arts, it seems appropriate to ask for the aesthetic dimensions and potentials of the social practise and to explore the development of suitable competences. This investigationa s perspective aims to take the social relevance of the aesthetic as a medium of mediation into account and asks for the varied interrelations which exist between different reflecting forms (cognitive, emotional, aesthetic). It aims towards a power of judgement and a power to respond in everyday life.
