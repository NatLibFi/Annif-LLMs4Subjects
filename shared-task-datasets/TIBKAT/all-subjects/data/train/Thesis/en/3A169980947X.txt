Bayesian changepoint analysis
In this thesis, we elaborate upon Bayesian changepoint analysis, whereby our focus is on three big topics: approximate sampling via MCMC, exact inference and uncertainty quantification. Besides, modeling matters are discussed in an ongoing fashion. Our findings are underpinned through several changepoint examples with a focus on a well-log drilling data.
