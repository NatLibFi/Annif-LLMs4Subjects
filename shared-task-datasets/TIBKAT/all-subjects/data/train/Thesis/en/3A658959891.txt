System for automated cell culture
Scope of this dissertation is the development of an automated cell culture system for adherent growing cells including fields of automation engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, software development as well as nature sciences like cell biology. As result of this approach a working prototype of a flexible automated cell culture system is present that functions as an integrated system. As the result of cell culture experiments it can be stated, that cells grow with satisfying results in the automated cell culture system by using automated methods.
