Not-So-Simple Stellar Populations in Star Clusters
This book focuses on understanding the stellar populations of massive star clusters, which aims to investigate the origin, evolution and properties of binary systems, their collision products, as well as the general characteristics (e.g. ages, metal content) of stellar population(s) in star clusters. It introduces the basic background knowledge of various stellar populations in star clusters as well as their formation, interaction and evolution, offering high impact observational results on our understanding of the formation and evolution mode of star clusters. Based on these discoveries, this book proposes a series of future projects that will shed light on these topics. The works that introduced in this book will have the unique potential to reveal the key features of star clusters formation and by extension how all stars formed in our universe.
