Graphite as co-intercalation host for sodium ion batteries
This cumulative Ph.D. thesis summarizes the research progress obtained during the last years on the role of graphite (and related anode materials) in SIBs. The study focus is on better understanding the co-intercalation reaction and to further improve the performance by changing electrochemical parameters, test environment, solvent and salt. This Ph.D. thesis is divided into two major parts. In the first part, a brief literature overview on the current state of research and the aim of this thesis are presented. In the second part, the summary of the scientific results that have been achieved and published in 3 articles and one submitted manuscript, is stated. ...
