Fungi for the production of new types of biomaterials
Wood-decaying saprotrophic fungi of the phylum Basidiomycota occur almost ubiquitously. Due to their ability to degrade lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose, especially white-rot fungi are among the most important destroyer of lignocellulosic biomass such as deadwood in nature. For this purpose, they secrete enzymes at their hyphal tips during growth to catalyze the decomposition of the lignocellulosic substrates. During the decomposition processes, fungi from the class Agaricomycetes form a dense and stable mycelial matrix directly on the substrate surfaces and in the interstices of the sub...
