Semantisches Priming bei Kindern und Jugendlichen mit einer Lese-Rechtschreibstörung
Individual literacy acquisition is described as a process that is influenced by social and environmental factors. A lack of reading skills can thus have farreaching consequences for children, adolescents and adults. A reading and spelling disorder is a circumscribed learning disorder that particularly affects reading and writing, often begins in early language development, and can last for several years. During the reading process, neurofunctional processes in the brain are activated, which persons with dyslexia have difficulty accessing (cf. Hoeft et al. 2007). The semantic system plays a central role in these cognitive processes. The term "semantic priming" refers to the fact that the processing of one word influences the processing of a second subsequent word, provided that there is a semantic relationship between the two words (cf. Ortells et al. 2006). Input during priming activates and compares linguistic skills stored in the brain and words and rules can be used to decode meanings (cf. Hüttner 2014). Depending on the input or output given to linguistic processing, the four basic skills of speaking, understanding, reading, and writing arise (cf. Sucharowski/Siegmüller/Prange 2009; Hüttner 2014). The present work is composed of three substudies. First, in the baseline study, semantic features are assessed in children, adolescents, and adults (N=167) in the unimpaired speech system. Building on these results, sub-study I examines the influence of semantic priming, on ...
