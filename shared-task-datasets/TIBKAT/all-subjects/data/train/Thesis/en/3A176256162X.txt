Interfacially tuned spin transport towards molecular spintronics
Organic molecules are the carbon-based complex of several atoms, is an innovative and essential element to create nano-structural platforms, as a building block in the field of organic electronics and organic spintronics. Because of its variety and functionality via widely studied synthetic methods, molecules have played an important role in electronics as not only a transport channel in bulk form but also a tuning layer at the interface of hetero structures. The potential of molecular layers has also stood out in spintronics, owing to its mass-low composition producing long spin life time. Organic materials can be employed in spintronics applications, benefiting from their low cost, ease of processing, and chemical tunability. Beyond this advantage, the configuration of molecules on a metal film displays unique phenomena as it can control the molecular spins and interfacial coupling between them, resulting in the emergence of molecular spinterface. This thesis work focuses on identifying the interfacial properties between the ferromagnet and the Phenalenyl (PLY) based metal complexes. The growth morphology study of the copper-phenalenyl Cu-PLY based molecules influence the electronic coupling between the molecular layer and the ferromagnet. Zinc- Phenalenyl (ZMP) molecule already have been studied [1] by demonstrate the formation of a spinterface, resulting interface magneto resistance (IMR) close to room temperature. The spinterface formation leads to the unique property, ...
