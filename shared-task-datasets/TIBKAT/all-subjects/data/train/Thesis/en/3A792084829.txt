Global players - local struggles : spatial dynamics of industrialisation and social change in peri-urban Chennai, India
Empirical research on the societal and spatial impacts of global change has concentrated either on rural or urban contexts, especially on megacities. The peri?urban spaces in between are largely left unnoticed, although experiencing the most profound and dynamic transformations. This book presents the first comprehensive study on spatial dynamics of industrial development and social change in this context, taking peri-urban Chennai, the thriving industrial hub in southern India, as an example.
