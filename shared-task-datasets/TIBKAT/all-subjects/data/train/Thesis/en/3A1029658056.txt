Die geomorphologische Entwicklung des Alfbachtals im quartären Vulkangebiet der Westeifel seit dem Denekamp-Interstadial : Vulkanismus als Ursache für die Entstehung glazigener Depotzentren
Volcanic elevations and depressions pervade the landscape of the Quaternary Westeifel Volcanic Field and characterize the regional surface. Among other aspects they influence the morphology of the typically narrow and deeply-cut valleys as well as the course of the river systems. Nowadays the progress of erosion by rivers and the processes of embossing during the Weichselian Pleniglacial until the beginning of the Holocene are difficult to understand. However, in the Alf Valley near Gillenfeld and Strohn, these processes are readily traceable by a unique arrangement of young volcanoes and the distribution of their ejected products. The Wartgesberg- Volcano- Complex, formed around 33 ka ago, severely impacted the Alf Valley. Due to its position and promoted agglutinates, it led to the impoundment of the river and the leveling of the valley. This study presents a method which allows to reconstruct the paleo-valley surface in the area around the Wartgesberg-Volcano-Complex using the applications of ArcGIS, and to retrace the processes that have taken place in the Alf Valley during the last major glaciation. Step-by-step modeling provides an insight into the temporal development of the valley. The basis for the processing is delivered by a high-resolution digital elevation model, geomorphological mapping, drill holes and geophysical investigations. Using this technique, the paleo-valley surface is reconstructed. The result constitutes a detailed description of the area around the Alf Valley before the start of the volcanic activity that profoundly reshaped the regional landscape.
