Energy band gap tuning of halide perovskite materials from first principles
Solar cells based on hybrid perovskites materials have become significantly important among the third generation photovoltaics over the last few years. The first solid state solar cell was reported in 2012. Over the years, the power conversion efficiencies of these devices have increased at a tremendous pace and this has made the perovskite solar cell devices a serious competitor in the well-established market of thin-film and wafer technologies. Over time, a large number of articles on this topic has been published in peer-reviewed journals. The presence of lead in the most efficient hybrid perovskite materials have raised questions about the possible toxicity of these devices and the extent of their environmental impact. Therefore, a lot of research has been devoted to finding alternative perovskite materials with similar or even better opto-electronic properties. An alternative strategy to improve the efficiency of thin film solar cells is to build efficient tandem cells by combining two or more perovskite materials with specifically tailored band gaps.
