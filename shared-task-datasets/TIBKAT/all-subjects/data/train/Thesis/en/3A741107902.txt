Orbital motion of substellar companions
With the availability of adaptive optics systems at 8 m-class telescopes, the direct detection of low-mass companions such as brown dwarfs and giant Jupiter-like planetary-mass objects, in up to 200 pc from the Sun, is possible. Since this detection method is especially sensitive for wide companions, it is a very good complement to radial velocity and transit search programs. The two common problems with these type discoveries are to ascertain if the candidate companion is orbiting the primary star, and to determine its mass to decide whether or not it is a substellar or even a planetary mass companion. Companionship is usually investigated by comparing the proper motion of the candidate companion to that of the primary star. If both objects are co-moving it is very likely that they are gravitationally bound. However, there is always the small chance of a coincidental alignment of the two objects, even more so if the primary star is a member of a young moving group or association (where almost all members have very similar proper motions). Only the detection of curvature of the orbit, meaning acceleration or deceleration in differential proper motion, can doubtlessly confirm that two objects are orbiting each other. Furthermore, the luminosity-age-mass models which are used to estimate the companionâ€™s mass are uncertain at very young ages <10 Myr). Direct imaging surveys on the other hand target especially young associations, due to the more favoreable contrast ratio between primary star and low-mass companions.
