In three different sub-analyses, insights were gained into the effectiveness of intervention measures against the occurrence and spread of ESBL/AmpC-resistant E. coli in chicken fattening farms. Literature data and practical laboratory results, some of which were self-obtained, were incorporated into a mathematical model to predictively calculate the effects of husbandry parameters and specific intervention measures. The summarized results show an influence of the measures “competitive exclusion”, “cleaning and disinfection” as well as the husbandry parameters "breed", “low stocking density” and "increased amount of litter" on some of the tested bacterial strains. In addition to the individual measures, several combinations were tested in the model, using two different scenarios, either the pen or the day-old chicks were positive before the start of fattening period. These different combinations resulted in a reduction of resistant E. coli in the infected animals, in their excreta, and in the litter. In this context, data from experimental animal studies on combined measures would be interesting. Further scientific results could contribute to an improved model to better reflect real conditions. For example, further refinement could be achieved by a dedicated mathematical calculation of the growth of resistant E. coli in the different parts of the chicken gastrointestinal tract and in the litter, taking into account pH and temperature. Regardless, the present version of the ...
