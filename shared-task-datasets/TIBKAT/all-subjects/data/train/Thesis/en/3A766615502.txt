Molecular response of nicotiana attenuata to herbivory and solar UVB : laboratory and fieldwork
Plants have coexisted with insects for approximately 400 million years. During this time, the interactions between flora and fauna have driven coevolutionary and reciprocal changes, resulting in a complex mosaic of plant defenses and insect counter-defenses. In addition, abiotic stress such as UVB radiation dramatically affects plant performance; therefore, mechanisms to recognize environmental stresses, mounting of properly scaled responses and fitness optimization are three essential features for plant survival in nature. This work describes novel regulatory mechanisms and interactions mediating plant defense against herbivores, and the effect of solar UVB light on plant defense in Nicotiana attenuata. ...
