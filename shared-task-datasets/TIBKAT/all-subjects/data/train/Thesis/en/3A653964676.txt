Synthesis of functionalized anthraquinones, phthalates and quinolines by site-selective Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions
Based on the methodology of Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions, a wide range of substituted anthraquinones are now readily available including a few examples of phthalates and quinolines. The method provides new possibilities in carbon-carbon bond formation for the preparation of new materials. The chemistry of the bis(triflates) of anthraquinones, phthalates and 5,7-dibromo-8-(trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy)quinoline has been investigated in this thesis. The results for the synthesis and characterization of diarylanthraquinones, diarylphthalates and diarylquinolines are presented in this thesis.
