Groundwater recharge in tropical wet regions via GIS-based methods and cosmic-ray neutron sensing
Studies on the unsustainable use of groundwater resources are still considered incipient since it is frequently a poorly understood and managed, devalued and inadequately protected natural resource. Groundwater Recharge (GWR) is one of the most challenging elements to estimate since it can rarely be measured directly and cannot easily be derived from existing data. To overcome these limitations, many hydro(geo)logists have combined different approaches to estimate large-scale GWR, namely: remote sensing products, such as IMERG product; Water Budget Equation, also in combination with hydrological models, and; Geographic Information System (GIS), using estimation formulas. For intermediary-scale GWR estimation, there exist: Non-invasive Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensing (CRNS); wireless networks from local soil probes; and soil hydrological models, such as HYDRUS. Accordingly, this PhD thesis aims, on the one hand, to demonstrate a GIS-based model coupling for estimating the GWR distribution on a large scale in tropical wet basins. On the ...
