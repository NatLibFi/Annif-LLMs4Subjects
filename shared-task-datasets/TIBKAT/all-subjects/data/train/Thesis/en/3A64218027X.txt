Enantioselective biocatalysis for the preparation of optically pure tertiary alcohols
Tertiary alcohols have become interesting targets for organic synthesis themselves or as building blocks for valuable pharmaceutical compounds. However, the synthesis of optically pure tertiary alcohols is still a challenge both chemical and enzymatic means. Enzymes containing the GGG(A)X motif in the active site region have been known to show activity towards these sterically demanding substrates. Several tertiary alcohols have been resolved with high enantioselectivity by using this biocatalytic synthetic route. This thesis aims at providing a better understanding of enantiorecognition of GGG(A)X motif hydrolases in the enzymatic synthesis of enantiomerically enriched tertiary alcohols. Kinetic resolution of a wide range of tertiary alcohols using hydrolases provided insights on factors that can influence enantioselectivity of GGG(A)X motif enzymes. Additionally, a newly proposed chemoenzymatic method to synthesize protected alpha,alpha-dialkyl-alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acids has broadened the application of these enzymes to synthesize optically pure tertiary alcohols. Newly found biocatalysts through functional screening, database mining and rational protein design approaches provided a better enzyme platform for optically pure tertiary alcohol resolution.
