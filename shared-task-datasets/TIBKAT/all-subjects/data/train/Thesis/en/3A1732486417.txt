Enzymatic remodelling of the exopolysaccharide stewartan network : implications for the diffusion of nano-sized objects
In nature, bacteria are found to reside in multicellular communities encased in self-produced extracellular matrices. Indeed, biofilms are the default lifestyle of the bacteria which cause persistent infections in humans. The biofilm assembly protects bacterial cells from desiccation and limits the effectiveness of antimicrobial treatments. A myriad of biomolecules in the extracellular matrix, including proteins, exopolysaccharides, lipids, extracellular DNA and other, form a dense and viscoelastic three dimensional network. Many studies emphasized that a destabilization of the mechanical integrity of biofilm architectures potentially eliminates the protective shield and renders bacteria more susceptible to the immune system and antibiotics. Pantoea stewartii is a plant pathogen which infects monocotyledons such as maize and sweet corn. These bacteria produce dense biofilms in the xylem of infected plants which cause wilting of plants and crops. Stewartan is an exopolysaccharide which is produced by Pantoea stewartii and secreted as ...
