Untersuchungen zum Effekt von Dichte auf mechanische und hygrische Eigenschaften von Spanplatten und Massivholz am Beispiel von Paulownia
The scope of this study was to investigate the effect of density on mechanical and hygrical properties of particleboards varying particle mixtures and utilizing raw materials of different densities in surface and core layers. The objective was to gain application- and fundamentals-oriented knowledge. Furthermore, a characterization of kiri wood (Paulownia elongata x fortunei) was conducted, including physical and mechanical properties, as well as mycological examinations to determine its durability classes. Against the background of material shortage of wood assortments for the wood-based p...
