Analysis of starch metabolism in source and sink tissue of plants
Starch is an essential biopolymer produced by plants. Starch can be made inside source tissue (such as leaves) and sink tissue (such as fruits and tubers). Nevertheless, understanding how starch metabolism is regulated in source and sink tissues is fundamental for improving crop production. Despite recent advances in the understanding of starch and its metabolism, there is still a knowledge gap in the source and sink metabolism. Therefore, this study aimed to summarize the state of the art regarding starch structure and metabolism inside plants. In addition, this study aimed to elucidate the regulation of starch metabolism in the source tissue using the leaves of a model organism, Arabidopsis thaliana, and the sink tissue of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) fruit as a commercial crop. The research regarding the source tissue will focus on the effect of the blockage of starch degradation on the starch parameter in leaves, especially in those of A. thaliana, which lack both disproportionating enzyme 2 (DPE2) and plastidial glucan phosphorylase 1 (PHS1) (dpe2/phs1).
