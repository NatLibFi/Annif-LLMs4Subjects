Sampling nested Archimedean copulas with applications to CDO pricing
The goal of this dissertation is to explore nested Archimedean copulas. In particular, efficient sampling algorithms, especially suited for large dimensions, are presented. As an application, a pricing model for collateralized debt obligations (CDOsʺ) is developed. Copulas are distribution functions with standard uniform univariate margins. It is often criticized that most of the copula theory is developed for two dimensions, although from the practitioners̉ point of view the studied random vectors usually live in higher dimensions. One particular parametric class of copulas which extends to any multivariate case is the class of elliptical copulas. However, elliptical copulas are radially symmetric which is considered as a drawback, e.g., for modeling some of the observed effects underlying financial data ...
