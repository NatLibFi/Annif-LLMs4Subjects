Literatur im Kontext ph√§nomenologischer Wahrnehmungstheorie : M. Blechers Poetik des Empfindens
"This study examines the prose works of the Romanian writer M. Blecher in the context of modern philosophies of perception, from Bergson and Husserl through Merleau-Ponty and Deleuze. It shows that Blecher's poetics of remembrance was a literary-phenomenological quest for authentic or alternative access points to the world between reality and unreality. Its focus is on figurations of experience in crisis and situations of physical marginality."--
