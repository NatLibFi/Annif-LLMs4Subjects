Die doppelten Perfektbildungen im Deutschen : eine diachrone Untersuchung
"This book is devoted to double forms of the perfect tense in the German language. The study is based on an extensive corpus of double formations of the perfect tense as they have been used over the past eight centuries. This compilation takes into account both written language (the dimension of distance) and spoken language (the dimension of proximity). On the basis of the collected empirical data, the study addresses specific questions about the structure, diachronic use, and diachronic meaning of double-perfect tense formations."--Publisher description
