On dualities of random graphs and branching processes with disasters to Piecewise deterministic Markov processes
Abstract: This thesis is based on the interconnection between three classes of stochastic processes:<br>As links between branching processes and random graphs frequently appear in the literature, we add to that a connection between birth-death processes with disasters and duplication-based random graphs with edge deletion. For the third class of processes, i.e. a class of piecewise deterministic Markov processes we call p-jump processes, duality relations to a general class of branching processes with disasters as well as to duplication-based random graphs will be shown. Precise limit results we obtain for p-jump processes will be transferred to the other classes. Several possible generalisations of these dualities will be discussed.<br>Furthermore, limit results for degrees, cliques and star-like sub-graphs of the duplication graph model will be derived using martingale methods. Lastly, we outline an approach for the analysis of the sub-graph of non-isolated vertices via p-jump processes
