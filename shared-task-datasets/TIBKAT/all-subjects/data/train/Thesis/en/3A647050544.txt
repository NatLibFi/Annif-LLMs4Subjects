Synthesis of hydroxybenzodioates, aminophenols and diaryl selenides by [3+3] cyclizations of 1,3-bis(silyloxy)-1,3-butadienes with 3-silyloxy- and 3-alkoxy-2-en-1-ones
The regioselective cyclocondensation of 1,3-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)-1,3-butadienes with different substituted 3-silyloxy- and 3-alkoxy-2-en-1-ones afforded 4-hydroxyisophthalates, 3-hydroxyphthalates, 2-hydroxyterephthalates, 4-nitrophenols and diaryl selenides.
