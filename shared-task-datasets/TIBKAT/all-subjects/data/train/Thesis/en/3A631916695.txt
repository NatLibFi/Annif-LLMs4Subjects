Cacao agroforestry under ambient and reduced throughfall : three water use characteristics and stand water budgeting
The world&rsquo;s tropical regions have faced dramatic losses in forest cover during recent decades. Although high rates of rainforest conversion continue today, reforestation is becoming more common. A variety of reforestation types exists, including reforestations with native trees, mixed reforestations with exotic trees, commercial monocultures or agroforests, which are combinations of trees and shrubs with crops and/or livestock. The reasons for reforestation are manifold: tree plantations and agroforestry provide means of income for farmers and thus ensure food security for the local population. Reforestation can also restore degraded land. Reforested areas often function as connectors between protected areas and areas under human occupation, and they have the capacity to capture and store carbon dioxide, helping mitigate climate change. Additionally, reforestation can aid in controlling erosion, help protect soil and water resources and may also facilitate the conservation of biodiversity ...
