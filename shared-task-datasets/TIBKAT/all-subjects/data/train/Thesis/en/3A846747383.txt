Zur Topographie und Morphologie der Harder-Drüse von Tupaia belangeri unter Berücksichtigung des Geschlechtsdimorphismus : eine quantitative Studie auf der Grundlage von MRT-Untersuchungen
In the present study the topography of the Harderian gland was examined regarding to a sexual dimorphism based on 20 adult heads of Tupaia belangeri. Therefore from all Tupaia heads MRI scans were made in a 7 Tesla ClinScan tomograph. By using the software WinSurf® 4.0 the volumes of the Harderian glands and bulbi oculi could be calculated and 3D reconstructions could be made. In addition, various orbital and skull measurements were determined. By using correlation analyzes potential relationships between the different sizes and the size of the Harderian gland and the bulbus oculi were examined. The Harderian gland of Tupaia belangeri is located medial and posterior of the eyeball and is embedded in the retrobulbar tissue of the orbit. In addition, it is surrounded by fatty tissue or an orbital sinus venosus. The convex side of the Harderian gland is located on the medial orbital wall and the concave side covers the bulbus oculi. The Harderian glands of male Tupaia belangeri are twice as large as that of females. The Harderian gland of male animals extends behind the eyeball until the optic nerve. In the females there is no relationship to the optic nerve shown. The rectus ventralis muscle, one of the extraocular muscles, leaves at the bottom of the Harderian gland of Tupaia belangeri an Impression. In females, this impression is less pronounced. Underneath the rectus ventralis muscle the Harderian gland takes almost complete the posterior part of the orbit. Here it has its ...
