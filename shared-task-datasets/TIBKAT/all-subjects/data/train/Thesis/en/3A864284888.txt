Design principles of plant photosensory networks : quantitative analysis and modelling of phytochrome dimer dynamics in Arabidopsis thaliana
Zusammenfassung: For plants as sessile organisms the acclimatisation to environmental fluctuations is the most essential, critical and at the same time challenging process to evolve plasticity (Smith, 1982, 2000). Such acclimatisation processes require refined sensitive mechanisms, including a variety of different light sensing photoreceptors (Smith, 1982; Montgomery and Lagarias, 2002). Phytochromes are the most important photoreceptors in plants regulating several essential developmental changes like seed germination and de-etiolation as well as stem elongation (Figure 1.1). However, the two major phytochromes phyA and phyB exhibit dramatic differences in their action spectra for physiological responses, with phyB being most active in red light and phyA in far red light (Casal et al., 1998). These differences cannot be explained by the photo-physical properties of the phytochromes, because these are virtually identical for all phytochromes (Eichenberg et al., 2000)
