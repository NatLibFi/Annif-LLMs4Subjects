Analysis Design & Applications of Cryptographic Building Blocks
This thesis deals with the basic design and rigorous analysis of cryptographic schemes and primitives, especially of authenticated encryption schemes, hash functions, and password-hashing schemes. In the last decade, security issues such as the PS3 jailbreak demonstrate that common security notions are rather restrictive, and it seems that they do not model the real world adequately. As a result, in the first part of this work, we introduce a less restrictive security model that is closer to reality. In this model it turned out that existing (on-line) authenticated encryption schemes cannot longer beconsidered secure, i.e. they can guarantee neither data privacy nor data integrity. Therefore, we present two novel authenticated encryption scheme, namely COFFE and McOE, which are not only secure in the standard model but also reasonably secure in our generalized security model, i.e. both preserve full data inegrity. In addition, McOE preserves a resonable level of data privacy. The second part of this thesis starts with proposing the hash function Twister-Pi, a revised version of the accepted SHA-3 candidate Twister. We not only fixed all known security issues of Twister, but also increased the overall soundness of our hash-function design. Furthermore, we present some fundamental groundwork in the area of password-hashing schemes. This research was mainly inspired by the medial omnipresence of password-leakage incidences. We show that the password-hashing scheme scrypt is vulnerable against cache-timing attacks due to the existence of a password-dependent memory-access pattern. Finally, we introduce Catena the first password-hashing scheme that is both memory-consuming and resistant against cache-timing attacks.
