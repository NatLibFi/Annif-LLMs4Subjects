The maximum principle and controlled diffusion
The objective of this master thesis is to solve a controlled diffusion problem via Pontryagin's maximum principle. To that end, we review in the first part basic notions that are relevant for the course of this thesis. In the second part, we study a controlled diffusion problem, in which one completely determines the diffusion of the process, but has no direct influence on the drift coefficient. We apply the maximum principle and solve the adjoint forward-backward stochastic differential equation with the help of the method of decoupling fields. The last part presents a connection between the value function and the decoupling fields of our control problem. In particular, we show that the weak derivative of the value function is equal to the decoupling field.
