Phytodiversity in short rotation coppice plantations
Woody biomass plantations are considered the most crucial source of biomass used for energy production. An increasing demand for wood from Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) plantations is predicted for the nearer future and could result in major land-use changes. As agriculture plays a major role in the global loss of biodiversity, it is of great importance to analyse possible impacts of SRC plantations on the environment. Analyses on phytodiversity of 15 willow (Salix spp.) and poplar (Populus spp.) SRC plantations in Central Sweden and Northern Germany were conducted on field level (chap. 3), local landscape-scale (chap. 4) and higher landscape-scale (chap. 5). The main objectives were (i) to identify factors influencing phytodiversity within willow and poplar SRC plantations and (ii) to investigate the contribution of SRC plantations to phytodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Chap. 2 gives an overview of the current state of knowledge on phytodiversity in SRC plantations and presents derived management recommendations. Although SRC plantations can have clear benefits for biodiversity, negative effects are also possible. The location of SRC establishment should be considered carefully. Areas with nature conservation status should be avoided whereas areas dominated by agriculture are suitable. A proper management, e.g. creating structural diversity by planting several smaller instead of a large SRC plantation, planting different crops at one site and harvest in different rotation regimes are beneficial for phytodiversity ...
