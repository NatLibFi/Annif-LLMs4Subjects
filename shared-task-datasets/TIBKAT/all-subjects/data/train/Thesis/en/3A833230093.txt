Tunable hyperchromatic lenses
Zusammenfassung: Optical full-field imaging, as microscopy, delivers three-dimensional information of the topology of surfaces. To extend the information from the sample under test, hyperspectral imaging additionally delivers the spectral answer of the sample. This additional feature can be conceived as a means for food control or as a diagnostic approach in dermatology.This thesis presents the design, fabrication, and characterization of a tunable hyperchromatic lens for confocal hyperspectral imaging systems. The hyperchromatic lens has a compact structure consisting of a diffractive lens, a tunable refractive membrane lens, and a pinhole in front of a detector for spectral filtering by spatially separating the wavelengths of a focused beam. The method makes use of an extended longitudinal chromatic aberration. Thereby, the refractive lens is continuously hydraulically tuned by an integrated magnetic actuator, allowing a fast scan over the entire spectrum of the incident light.Three different prototypes of the hyperchromatic lens system have been realized: (i) a hybrid hyperchromatic lens with separated diffractive and refractive lens, (ii) a system with diffractive structures imprinted onto the lens membrane, and (iii) a hyperchromatic micro-lens array.The spectral resolution, achieved with the realized hyperchromatic systems, is in the order of 15nm for both types of single lenses. Due to smaller lens diameters in case of the arrays, the spectral resolution is somewhat reduced. The systems have been designed for a broad spectral range, and the functionality could successfully be verified for wavelengths between 450 and 900 nm
