Growth, differentiation and survival of cells are regulated by a network of receptors and signaling pathways. If this network is out of balance, the cells can transform to tumor cells. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a driving force in this network and therefore a target of numerous anticancer agents. Due to extensive development of resistance, identification of responsible structures is important to synergistic degenerate aberrant signal cascades. After activation of EGFR, a signal-specific response is initiated by recruiting specific adapter proteins to the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The altered composition of the signaling proteins could reveal targets for new therapeutic approaches. To decipher the underlying mechanism, several proteomic studies have been applied to whole cell lysates. Despite the sensitivity of modern equipment, however, the identification of low abundant components in the proteome of a cell remains a challenge. The identification of differential protein patterns of the EGFR interactome as a function of resistance and receptor variant was the objective of this work. The EGFR with its interacting partners was precipitated from cell lysates. Subsequently, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed with LC-MS/MS. From lysates of A431 cells, 183 proteins were detected in four bio replicates, including 15 direct interaction partners, such as GRB2, SHC1, SOS1/2, STAT1/3, AP2 and P85B. The calculation of the normalized ...
