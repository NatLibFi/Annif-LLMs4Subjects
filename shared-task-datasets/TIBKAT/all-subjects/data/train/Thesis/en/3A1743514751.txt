The transcriptomic and genomic architecture of acrididae grasshoppers
Genetic polymorphism is described as the variation in DNA sequence between distinct individuals of a given species or population. This polymorphism is reflected from individuals to entire populations, and from single nucleotides to the entire genome spanning billions of base pairs. A fundamental aim of functional genomics is to establish links between genetic polymorphism and phenotypic variation, to explain this observed variation. Recent developments in high throughput sequencing have made it possible to adequately explore this link. My dissertation explores genetic and genomic polymorphism in Gomphocerine grasshoppers, an insect group with unusually large and complex genomes using novel and contemporary transcriptomic and genomic methods.
