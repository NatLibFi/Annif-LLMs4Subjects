Vergleichende Untersuchung zum Temperaturverlauf in Abhängigkeit von unterschiedlichen Keramiköfen und unterschiedlichen Sinterprogrammen
In the new dentistry are more of porcelains crowns and bridges for the aesthetical restorations. In the last view years is the quality of dental porcelains are better. Those dental porcelains are very sensitive for the maximum of the sintering temperature. The manufacturers of the sintering furnace had to constructs a very sensibility control system for the sintering systems. The optimur for Sintering can be finding in the level of 1-2 cm over chamotte carrier in tangential position. The technical temperature gradient can be used for a good affect of the sintering objects. Massiness sintering objects displace the homogeneous temperature gradient. The user had to control and calibrating the sintering system. In the next time we hope that the manufactures produce a better working control system for sintering furnaces.
