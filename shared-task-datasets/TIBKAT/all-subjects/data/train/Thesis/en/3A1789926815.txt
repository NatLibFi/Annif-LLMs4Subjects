Development of 3d metal catalysts for redox reactions
Herein is reported the application of non-noble metal-based catalytic systems for the homogeneous oxidation of organic substrates using air, specifically in amines and N-heterocycles. Simple 3d metal salts have been used, in combination with N-ligands, to facilitate the oxidative cleavage of C(sp3)â€“C(sp3) bonds. These reactions have been studied, using spectroscopic methods, to propose plausible mechanistic pathways. We believe such deconstructive strategies can enable late-stage functionalisation of pharmaceuticals and the synthesis of drug metabolites.<eng>
