From the Contents: Brief introduction to cuprates and Fe-based high Tc superconductors -- The discovery of high Tc superconductors -- Cuprates -- Fe-based superconductors -- Introduction to angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) -- Energy resolution -- Momentum resolution (three-step model) -- The physical processes in photoemission.
This book mainly focuses on the study of the high-temperature superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+Î´ (Bi2212) and single-layer FeSe film grown on SrTiO3 (STO) substrate by means of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). It provides the first electronic evidence for the origin of the anomalous high-temperature superconductivity in single-layer FeSe grown on SrTiO3 substrate. Two coexisted sharp-mode couplings have been identified in superconducting Bi2212. The first ARPES study on single-layer FeSe/STO films has provided key insights into the electronic origin of superconductivity in this system. A phase diagram and electronic indication of high Tc and insulator to superconductor crossover have been established in the single-layer FeSe/STO films. Readers will find essential information on the techniques used and interesting physical phenomena observed by ARPES.
