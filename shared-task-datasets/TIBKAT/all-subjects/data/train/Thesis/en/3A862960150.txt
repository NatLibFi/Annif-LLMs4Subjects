Dynamics of mantle plumes : linking scales and coupling physics
Mantle plumes are a link between different scales in the Earth’s mantle: They are an important part of large-scale mantle convection, transporting material and heat from the core-mantle boundary to the surface, but also affect processes on a smaller scale, such as melt generation and transport and surface magmatism. When they reach the base of the lithosphere, they cause massive magmatism associated with the generation of large igneous provinces, and they can be related to mass extinction events (Wignall, 2001) and continental breakup (White and McKenzie, 1989). Thus, mantle plumes have been the subject of many previous numerical modelling studies (e.g. Farnetani and Richards, 1995; d’Acremont et al., 2003; Lin and van Keken, 2005; Sobolev et al., 2011; Ballmer et al., 2013). However, complex mechanisms, such as the development and implications of chemical heterogeneities in plumes, their interaction with mid-ocean ridges and global mantle flow, and melt ascent from the source region to the surface are still not very well understood;…
