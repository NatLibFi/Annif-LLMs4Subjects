Cooperation in organizations : the effects of observation, feedback and leadership
Most organizational theories argue that formal organizational tructures determine or at least influence individual behavior and herewith are crucial for the performance and survival capability of the organization. This thesis contributes to the research on cooperation in organizations by investigating the effects of basic elements of organizational structure within controlled laboratory experiments. It provides insight into the underlying processes that determine the team membersâ€™ responses to feedback information and to formal structures of the decision environment. The organizational dilemma that arises from team production - as a conflict between individual and collective interests - provides the framework for the experiments presented in this thesis. The results show that unconfined information that is available to every member of a team might have detrimental effects on cooperation over time while retained or exaggerated information can foster and stabilize cooperation.
