Marriage migration of Dominican women to Germany via (web-based) matchmaking agencies
This thesis gives an insight into German-Dominican matchmaking. Qualitative interviews with three agency owners and two German-Dominican couples provide the necessary data display the German-Dominican matchmaking business and describe the incentives of women and men to register at such an agency to find a foreign partner. The study firstly clarifies the development of and reasons for female Dominican migration, including the weakening of men as main financial provider within the families and the matrifocal family structure with a high number of female-headed households due to unstable relationships and new financial responsibilities of Dominican women. Migration is seen by Dominican women as broadening life and work opportunities and although most Dominican women migrate for labour, some decide to register at an international matchmaking agency which mediates relationships between Dominican women and German men. Such marriage migration via matchmaking agencies is a migratory pathway, which is almost exclusive to women and the images of feminity, used by the agencies to run their business will be presented. Furthermore, it will be discussed, if a marriage is seen as migration alternative or as a strategy by Dominican women.
