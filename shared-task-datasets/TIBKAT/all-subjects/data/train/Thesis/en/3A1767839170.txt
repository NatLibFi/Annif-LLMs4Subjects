Functionalized two-dimensional black phosphorus and polymer nanocomposites as flame retardant : preparation and properties
This thesis details the novel preparation methods and the improved properties of two-dimentional (2D) black phosphorene (BP) and the polymer nanocomposites. Various surface treatment methods are used, and through these designs, better mechanical, thermal and flame retardant properties are achieved for these functionalized materials, thus reducing the fire risk of the polymer composite system.
