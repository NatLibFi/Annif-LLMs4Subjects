DiverCity - global cities as a literary phenomenon : Toronto, New York, and Los Angeles in a globalizing age
Based on the structured analysis of selected North American novels, this work examines global cities as a literary phenomenon (?DiverCity±). By analyzing Dionne Brand's Toronto, ?What We All Long For± (2005), Chang-rae Lee's New York, ?Native Speaker± (1995), and Karen Tei Yamashita's Los Angeles, ?Tropic of Orange± (1997), Melanie U. Pooch provides the connecting link for exploring the triad of globalization and its effects, global cities as cultural nodal points, and cultural diversity in a globalizing age as a literary phenomenon. Thus, she contributes to a global, interdisciplinary, and multi-perspectival understanding of literature, culture, and society
