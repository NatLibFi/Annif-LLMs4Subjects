Functional nanocomposite hydrogels based on cellulose nanocrystals
Hydrogels are ubiquitous in nature, which are three-dimensionally (3D) crosslinked polymer networks with amounts of water inside. Naturally, they can be regarded as semi/solid showing intermediate properties of solid and liquid. Hydrogels have attracted growing interest in diverse applications, due to their excellent biocompatibility, permeability, and 3D network. With the development of polymer synthesis, great progress in tough hydrogels, and continuous emerging of advanced fabrication methods, hydrogels become promising functional materials. To further broaden their practical usages, gre...
