Approaches to metaphor and analogy in the language of linguistics as a language for special purposes (LSP)
This study explores the occurrence of conceptual metaphor - broken down by category as well as by frequency of occurrence - in the language of linguistics as a language for special purposes (LSP). It highlights the amazing similarity in distribution between metaphor in ordinary-language discourse and in LSP discourse, compared to the pattern of metaphor distribution in linguistic terminology. Moreover the study delves into a peculiarity of linguistic terminology, namely the host of linguistics-specific coinages and borrowings (LSC), which may outweigh metaphor, depending on the sub-branch of linguistics. As an alternative to conceptual metaphor theory, the study applies the structure-mapping model developed by Gentner and colleagues to the terminology of two select sub-branches. Compared to conceptual metaphor theory, this model is assumed to be more apt to elucidate the network of interrelated linguistic terms and the way in which one base domain is exploited for more than one target domain. The study is complemented by a discussion of metaphor-related topics such as the classification of metaphors, degrees of metaphoricity, the borderline between literal and non-literal, figurative language and language use as well as the production and reception of metaphors from a psycholinguistic point of view. It also includes a critical assessment of the metaphor theory developed by Lakoff and Johnson (1980), which is assumed to be inadequate in certain respects.
