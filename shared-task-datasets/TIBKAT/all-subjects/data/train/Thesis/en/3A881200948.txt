Emotions, remembering and feeling better : dealing with the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement in Canada
As the largest class action suit in Canadian history, the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (2007-2015) had a great impact on the lives of Aboriginal survivors across Canada. In a rare account exploring survivor perspectives, Anne-Marie Reynaud considers the settlement's reconciliatory aspiration in conjunction with the local reality for the Mitchikanibikok Inik First Nations in Quebec. Drawing from anthropological fieldwork, this carefully crafted book weaves survivor experiences of the financial compensations and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission together with current theorizing on emotions, memory, trauma and transitional justice
