Active Multiplexing of Spectrally Engineered Heralded Single Photons in an Integrated Fibre Architecture
This clearly written thesis discusses the development of a highly innovative single-photon source that uses active optical switching, known as multiplexing, to increase the probability of delivering photons into a single mode. Improving single-photon sources is critical in advancing the state of the art in photonic quantum technologies for information processing and communications.
