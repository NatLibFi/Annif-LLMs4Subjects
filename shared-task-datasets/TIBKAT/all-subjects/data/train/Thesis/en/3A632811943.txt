Redox behavior of glasses doped with copper and arsenic, antimony or tin
Soda-lime-silicate glasses (16Na2O-10CaO-74SiO2, in mol %) doped with copper and arsenic were studied by high temperature UV-vis spectroscopy. The base glass is a model for sheet glasses. Arsenic was one of the classical fining agents and is still used as an oxidizing additive in heavy metal oxide glasses. During heating, the Cu2+ absorptivity slightly decreased up to a temperature of 470 平C. At further increasing temperatures, the absorptivity decreased more notably and after reaching a minimum at temperatures >600 平C strongly increased again. At smaller heating rates, the minimum was more pronounced and was shifted to lower temperatures. This was explained by the redox reaction: 2Cu2+ + As3+ ? 2Cu+ + As5+. This reaction is shifted to the left during heating. At temperatures < 470 平C, this reaction is kinetically frozen and at temperatures > 600 平C, it is in equilibrium. In-between, the kinetics play an important part. Rate constants of the redox reaction were determined from relaxation times. The rate constants showed Arrhenius behavior and were inserted into a kinetic differential equation. Numerical solutions of this differential equation were in good agreement with the results from high temperature spectroscopy. The activation energy is 210 kJ?mol-1. This value is much smaller than the activation energy of viscous flow and hence the rate determining step is assumed to be the diffusion of Cu2+.
