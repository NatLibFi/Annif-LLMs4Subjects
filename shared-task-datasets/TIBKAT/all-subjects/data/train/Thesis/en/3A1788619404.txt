Falling in between the lines : the experience of individuals with multiple identities
The current dissertation aims to shed light on in-between groups. The term “in-between groups” is used in the present thesis to denote a particular social category that can emerge in contexts where individuals straddle membership in two (or more) social groups simultaneously (e.g., immigrant communities, dual-gender identifiers). In three chapters, I aimed to understand how in-between group members navigate their relations with relevant others (i.e., members of the groups they belong to) and how relevant others perceive them. All chapters drew theoretical arguments and predictions based on the social identity approach, that is, social identity theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) and self-categorization theory (Turner et al., 1987).
