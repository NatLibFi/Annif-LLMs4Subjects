The underrepresentation of male youth with a migration background in higher education in Germany : "Voices of Society" vs. "Voices of Youth"
Why are male youth with a migration background underrepresented in higher education in Germany? The answer is not simple and there are certain limitations when developing possible solutions for this problem. This book tries to provide an answer to this question by interviewing male migrant youth and focusing on the already practiced strategies, beliefs and tendencies of those youth who have been successful. The premise is that actual proof is more useful than theoretical proof, is easier to apply and might provide inspiration for other youth. In a way this book is a comparison of qualitative and quantitative research. <engl.>
