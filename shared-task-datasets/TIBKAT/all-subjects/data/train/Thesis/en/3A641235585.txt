Multiple objective optimization and implications for single objective optimization
Taking the right decisions is one of the main aspects in everyday life. If a decision has to be made with respect to only a single criterion, it is often quite simple to find a satisfactory solution for the problem. However, only in rare cases important decisions are influenced by a single criterion. Often several independent and conflicting aspects have to be taken into account. Based on these different criteria, one is faced with the problem to find the "best" alternative among many possible decisions. This idea leads to the concept of multiple objective optimization, where optimality a of feasible solution is defined based on the Pareto-concept. In more detail, a solution of such a problem is called efficient, when there does not exist any other solution that is as good as the given one in all considered criteria and strictly better in at least one criterion ...
