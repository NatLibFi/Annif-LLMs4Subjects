Determination of the methane budget of the Amazon region utilizing airborne methane observations in combination with atmospheric transport and vegetation modeling
The Amazon basin is an important player in the global methane cycle. Objectives of this work are to establish a forward and inverse modelling framework on regional scale and to determine the methane budget in the Amazon region. Within the BARCA project (Balanço Atmosférico Regional de Carbono na Amazônia) to airborne measurement campaigns were conducted, one in November 2008 and one in May 2009. The analysis of the methane observations confirms that the Amazon basin is a strong source of methane. The majority of the emissions is found to have biogenic origin, i.e. from wetlands. A comparison of five global methane inversions shows the advantage of using satellite observations in inversion systems. The WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) Greenhouse Gas model was developed to perform high-resolution simulations of the atmospheric methane distribution in the Amazon region. The newly written code is available within the official WRF-Chem version 3.4 release. Simulations for the two months of the BARCA campaigns with two different wetland models and three different wetland maps were conducted with the WRF Greenhouse Gas model. The comparison to observations indicates that the choice of the wetland map is more important than the choice of the wetland model for a comparison to aircraft observations. Flights with a good representation of the atmospheric transport in the model show a higher correlation between observations and simulations. The two-step regional inversion scheme TM3-STILT was applied to the Amazon region for the year 2009 using observations from the 35 m high TT34 tower. The inversion shows improvements in the representation of the seasonal cycle of the methane emissions in the Amazon basin. However, the determination of the methane budget in the Amazon basin is still highly uncertain.
