Design study of high-speed continuous-time delta-sigma modulator
Zusammenfassung: Continuous-time delta-sigma modulators are key components in numerous applications, e.g., communication, sensor readout and medical applications. Compared to discrete-time delta-sigma modulators, they are proven to possess inherent antialiasing functionality and have become popular for high-speed applications with bandwidth exceeding tens of MHz due to their better power efficiency. This thesis focuses on the design of continuous-time low-power low-pass delta-sigma modulators with sampling frequency over hundreds of MHz.The thesis starts with an analysis of single-stage architecture, followed by a discussion of the implementation methods of each circuit block. Based on the applicationspecific design, numerous schemes for operational amplifiers are introduced in order to reduce the power dissipation of the loop filter.Furthermore, the non-linearity of multi-bit digital-to-analog converters in deltasigma modulators is discussed. In this thesis, two approaches to mitigating the impact of this non-linearity are proposed
