Charge dynamics in organic semiconductors : from chemical structures to devices
"In the field of organic semiconductors researchers and manufacturers are faced with a wide range of potential molecules. This work presents concepts for simulation-based predictions of material characteristics starting from chemical stuctures. The focus lies on charge transport - be it in microscopic models of amorphous morphologies, lattice models or large-scale device models. An extensive introductory review, which also includes experimental techniques, makes this work interesting for a broad readership"--
