Success factors and obstacles for conservation measures in intensively used agricultural regions
Intensive agricultural areas have severe nature conservation problems; agri-environmental measures are seldom implemented. This doctoral thesis investigated the success factors and obstacles for conservation measures in these areas. 865 answering farmers were surveyed by written questionnaires, 14 nature conservation experts were interviewed and subsidy levels were calculated. Recommendations are given regarding the optimal design and subsidy level of flowering strips as agri-environmental measures as well as regarding their practicability within the context of the German Impact Regulation.
