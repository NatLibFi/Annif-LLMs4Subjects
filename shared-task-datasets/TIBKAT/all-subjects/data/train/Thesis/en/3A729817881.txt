Landscape dynamics and sustainable land management in Southern Ethiopia
Landscapes have undergone unprecedented changes in Chencha and Arbaminch areas, Southern Ethiopia, during the last century. Yet there exist well-established land-use systems and a wealth of local experience in maintaining and managing landscapes. The major objective of the study is to explore the dynamics of landscapes in a chronological and spatial order to identify trends, driving forces and impacts of land use systems, land cover and landscape structures during the last century in Chencha and Arbaminch areas. The methods used in the study include detailed field and lab investigations including C14 dating, satellite image interpretation, interviews and group discussions.
