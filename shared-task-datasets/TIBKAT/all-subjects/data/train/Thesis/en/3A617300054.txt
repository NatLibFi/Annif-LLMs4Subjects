Abundance, niche breadth and stress in the centre and at the border of the distribution range : a macroecological study on abundant and rare tree species
Macroecology investigates abundance and distribution patterns over large geographical scales. Some patterns, like the positive relationship between range size and abundance or niche breadth and the decrease of abundance and niche breadth from the distribution centre to the range margin, have been observed among different organism groups and in different habitat types. Despite their obvious universality, these patterns have rarely been investigated for tree species and the methods used are mainly based on theoretical interpretation of large and already existing data sets, whereas physiological parameters are often neglected. This study combines statistical pattern detection and ecophysiological studies to achieve a comprehensive assessment of macroecological patterns and the stress-exposure of Central European trees within their distribution range, with a focus on the eastern distribution margin in South-east Poland and Slovakia ...
