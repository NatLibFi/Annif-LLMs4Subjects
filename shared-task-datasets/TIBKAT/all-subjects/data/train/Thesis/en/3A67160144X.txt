Mass spectrometry has been developed as method of choice for comprehensive relative and absolute proteome analysis. Because the established quantification methods are limited in the number of samples for analysis and cannot be combined in each case with a pre fractionation, there is specific need for the development of new methods for mass spectrometry based proteome analysis. These methods should be established for Gram-positive bacteria as proof of principle. This thesis aimed at the expansion of the range of methods for demonstrative examples for physiological proteome analysis of Gram positive bacteria compiling the extension of label based relative protein quantification, the establishment of a global label free quantification approach, the development of a comprehensive absolute quantification method and furthermore the determination of the stoichiometry of a protein complex. The combination of 14N/15N metabolic labeling and GeLC-MS allows robust relative protein quantification on a global scale. The application of an internal 15N labeled reference extract enables never before achieved time resolved protein quantification (ten time points) within a nutritional shifts between the two preferred carbon sources (glucose and malate). Therefore Bacillus subtilis was selected as Gram positive model organism...
