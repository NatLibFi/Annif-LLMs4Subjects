Analysis of supramolecular assemblies of NE81, the first lamin protein in a non-metazoan organism
Nuclear lamins are nucleus-specific intermediate filaments forming a network located at the inner nuclear membrane of the nuclear envelope. They form the nuclear lamina together with proteins of the inner nuclear membrane regulating nuclear shape and gene expression, among others. The amoebozoan Dictyostelium NE81 protein is a suitable candidate for an evolutionary conserved lamin protein in this non-metazoan organism. It shares the domain organization of metazoan lamins and is fulfilling major lamin functions in Dictyostelium. Moreover, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (feSEM) images of NE81 expressed on Xenopus oocytes nuclei revealed filamentous structures with an overall appearance highly reminiscent to that of metazoan Xenopus lamin B2. For the classification as a lamin-like or a bona fide lamin protein, a better understanding of the supramolecular NE81 structure was necessary. Yet, NE81 carrying a large N-terminal GFP-tag turned out as unsuitable source for protein isolation and characterization; GFP-NE81 expressed in Dictyostelium NE81 knock-out cells exhibited an abnormal distribution, which is an indicator for an inaccurate assembly of GFP-tagged NE81.
