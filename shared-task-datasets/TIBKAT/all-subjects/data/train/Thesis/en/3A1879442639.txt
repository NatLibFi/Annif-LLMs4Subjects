The dynamics of innovation in Eastern Europe : lessons from Estonia
Building strong and dynamic systems of innovation constitutes a key challenge for the post-socialist economies of Central and Eastern Europe. This book develops a strong conceptual and empirical foundation for understanding how such dynamic systems may emerge. The Dynamics of Innovation in Eastern Europe explains, in particular, how this has been possible in the case of the Estonian system of innovation in telecommunications. The book shows that the socialist historical heritage, and in particular inherited competencies, may be used in highly creative ways for generating dynamic innovation in the post-socialist context. It also uncovers the complex and multifaceted ways in which the geographical and cultural proximity to Western Europe can be creatively used as a powerful resource in the pursuit of building systems of innovation in the East. Moreover, the book demonstrates that it is possible for East European systems of innovation to develop highly creative domestic dynamics without necessarily imitating Western systems or styles of innovation. Providing a unique empirical analysis of how systems of innovation undergo far-reaching transformation and change, this book will be of interest to economists and scholars involved in issues relating to innovation, technology, economic development and East-West integration. Policymakers in the EU and in Central and East European countries and practitioners involved in innovation-related activities will also find it of great appeal
