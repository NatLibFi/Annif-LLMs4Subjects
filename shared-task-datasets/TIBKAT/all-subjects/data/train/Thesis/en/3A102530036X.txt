Non-noble metal-catalysed carbonylative transformations
The dissertation is mainly concerned with non-noble metal-catalyzed carbonylative reactions. More specifically, copper, iron and manganese catalysed carbonylation reactions are presented.  In all the above mentioned areas systematic catalyst optimization studies were performed and the scope and limitations of the respective protocol were presented.<eng>
