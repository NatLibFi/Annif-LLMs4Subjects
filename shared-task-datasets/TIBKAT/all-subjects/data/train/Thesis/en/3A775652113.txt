Glioblastoma are amongst the most aggressive brain tumors. Despite intensive research for new therapeutical options the mean survival time is still between 12 to 15 months. Like in other solid tumors, changes in the intercellular (pHi) and extracellular (pHe) pH compared to non-malignant tissue can also be observed in glioblastoma. In tumors the pHi is in the alkaline range while the pHe is more acidic. These differences in pH facilitate the development and progression of tumors and increase uncontrolled proliferation and evolution of resistances as well as infiltration of surrounding tissue. PH-regulatory transporters like the sodium-proton exchanger (NHE), the monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) and sodium-dependent chloride-bicarbonate exchanger (NDCBE) are responsible for the maintenance of the pHi. These transporters are important regulators of the pHi in both healthy and malignant cells and show higher expression and activity in tumors. Aim of this doctoral thesis is the analysis of the expression of the transporters NHE1, NHE5, MCT1, MCT4, MCT5 and NDCBE in human glioblastoma samples. Furthermore the influence of anti-tumoral compounds (cytostatics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs - NSAIDs) on the regulation of these transporters in human glioblastoma cell lines LN18 and U87MG is to be researched. On mRNA-level an increased expression of NHE1, MCT1, MCT4 and MCT5 in human glioblastoma tissue compared to non-malignant tissue could be observed. Moreover MCT4 ...
