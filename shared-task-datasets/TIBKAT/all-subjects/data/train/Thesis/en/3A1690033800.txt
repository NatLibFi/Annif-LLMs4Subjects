Synthesis of 1D microgel strands and their motion analysis in solution
The fabrication of 1D nanostrands composed of stimuli responsive microgels has been shown in this work. Microgels are well known materials able to respond to various stimuli from outer environment. Since these microgels respond via a volume change to an external stimulus, a targeted mechanical response can be achieved. Through carefully choosing the right composition of the polymer matrix, microgels can be designed to react precisely to the targeted stimuli (e.g. drug delivery via pH and temperature changes, or selective contractions through changes in electrical current125). In this work, it was aimed to create flexible nano-filaments which are capable of fast anisotropic contractions similar to muscle filaments. For the fabrication of such filaments or strands, nanostructured templates (PDMS wrinkles) were chosen due to a facile and low-cost fabrication and versatile tunability of their dimensions. Additionally, wrinkling is a well-known lithography-free method which enables the fabrication of nanostructures in a reproducible manner and with a high long-range periodicity. [...]
