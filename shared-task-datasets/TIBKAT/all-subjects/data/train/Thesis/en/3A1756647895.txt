Simulating the impact of herbicide drift exposure on non-target terrestrial plant communities
In Europe, almost half of the terrestrial landscape is used for agriculture. Thus, semi-natural habitats such as field margins are substantial for maintaining diversity in intensively managed farmlands. However, plants located at field margins are threatened by agricultural practices such as the application of pesticides within the fields. Pesticides are chemicals developed to control for undesired species within agricultural fields to enhance yields. The use of pesticides implies, however, effects on non-target organisms within and outside of the agricultural fields. Non-target organisms are organisms not intended to be sprayed or controlled for. For example, plants occurring in field margins are not intended to be sprayed, however, can be impaired due to herbicide drift exposure. The authorization of plant protection products such as herbicides requires risk assessments to ensure that the application of the product has no unacceptable effects on the environment. For non-target terrestrial plants (NTTPs), the risk assessment is based ...
