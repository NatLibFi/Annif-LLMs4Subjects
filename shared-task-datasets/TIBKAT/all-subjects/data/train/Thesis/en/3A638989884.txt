Agricultural land use and associated nutrient flows in peri-urban production systems
Urban and peri-urban agriculture could play a pivotal role as a recipient of organic waste. But recycling and reuse of solid and liquid organic waste in peri-urban agriculture requires planning tools flexible enough to capture the diversity of farming systems and to assess their nutrient status over spatial and temporal scales. This work aims at developing a methodology to determine nutrient flows and budgets at farm, village and communal level of peri-urban agricultural systems of Hanoi, Vietnam, by taking into account spatial and temporal variability of crop and nutrient manageme.
