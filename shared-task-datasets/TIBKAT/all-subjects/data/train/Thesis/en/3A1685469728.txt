Extraction of bioactive primary and secondary metabolites from microalgae by atmospheric pressure plasmas and pulsed discharges in water
Microalgae are aquatic, unicellular, eukaryotic organisms, which perform photosynthesis. They have gained interest within the last decades not only for biofuel production due to their high amount of lipids, but also for pharmaceutical and for nutraceutical purposes. Interesting compounds are proteins, carbohydrates, or pigments, such as carotenoids. However, microalgae possess strong and rigid cell walls, which hinder a sufficient and yet, gentle extraction of those valuable compounds. Although standard extraction techniques are available, several shortcomings occur, e.g. high energy demand, use of environmentally harmful solvents or alteration of compounds due to heat or chemicals. Therefore, an alternative method is needed, which is able to address these disadvantages. Physical plasmas were thus studied to answer the question whether they are able to disintegrate the cell walls of microalgae effectively and yet, without degradation of the extractives. First step of the thesis was to find a suitable plasma source that has an effect on the cell walls because plasma effects, such as electric fields, shockwaves, UV light emission, and the generation of reactive species can be tailored with the respective setup. It was found that spark discharges are most effective for the extraction of Chlorella vulgaris, which was chosen as model organism. All extraction yields were compared to reference methods, whereat microwave radiation was found to be the most effective reference method ...
