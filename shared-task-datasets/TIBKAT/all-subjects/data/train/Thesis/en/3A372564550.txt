Rational matrix equations in stochastic control
This book is the first comprehensive treatment of rational matrix equations in stochastic systems, including various aspects of the field,previously unpublished results and explicit examples.Topicsinclude modelling with stochastic differential equations, stochastic stability, reformulation of stochastic control problems, analysis of the rational matrix equation and numerical solutions.Primarily a survey in character, this monographis intendedfor researchers, graduate students and engineers in control theory and applied linear algebra. TOC:Introduction.- Aspects of Stochastic Control Theory.- Optimal Stabilization of linear stochastic systems.- Linear mappings on ordered vector spaces.- Newtons method.- Solution of the Riccati equation
