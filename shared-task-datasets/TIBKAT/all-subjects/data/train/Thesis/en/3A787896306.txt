Studierte Dichter : zum Spannungsverh√§ltnis von Dichtung und philologisch-historischen Wissenschaften im 19. Jahrhundert
"As the modern philological sciences were just emerging, poets were well educated-most of them had studied philology, and thus understood its claims to knowledge and its methods. The fertile and intensive interaction between literature and science that took place in this era is the subject of this book. It explores the interface between literary history and the history of the modern philological sciences." --
