Thermo-Mechanical Behavior of Honeycomb, Porous, Microcracked Ceramics : Characterization and analysis of thermally induced stresses with specific consideration of synthetic, porous cordierite honeycomb substrates
The underlying goal of this work is to reduce the uncertainty related to thermally induced stress prediction.  This is accomplished by considering use of non-linear material behavior, notably path dependent thermal hysteresis behavior in the elastic properties. Primary novel factors of this work center on two aspects. 1. Broad material characterization and mechanistic material understanding, giving insight into why this class of material behaves in characteristic manners. 2. Development and implementation of a thermal hysteresis material model and its use to determine impact on overall macroscopic stress predictions. Results highlight microcracking evolution and behavior as the dominant mechanism for material property complexity in this class of materials. Additionally, it was found that for the cases studied, thermal hysteresis behavior impacts relevant peak stress predictions of a heavy-duty diesel particulate filter undergoing a drop-to-idle regeneration by less than ~15% for all conditions tested. It is also found that path independent heating curves may be utilized for a linear solution assumption to simplify analysis. This work brings forth a newly conceived concept of a 3 state, 4 path, thermally induced microcrack evolution process; demonstrates experimental behavior that is consistent with the proposed mechanisms, develops a mathematical framework that describes the process and quantifies the impact in a real world application space.
