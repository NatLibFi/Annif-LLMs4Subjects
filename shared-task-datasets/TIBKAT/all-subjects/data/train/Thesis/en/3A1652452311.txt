Alterskorrelierte Einschr채nkungen der Fahrf채higkeit von 70-j채hrigen und 채lteren Autofahrern
The fact is the entire worlds population is ageing. The demographic ageing of society with an increase of old and very old people in Germany, greater Europe and throughout the world, we can safely anticipate until 2050 a greater percentage of drivers 60 years and older. The objective of this investigation consists of the analysis of ones driving ability in old age. This research project tried to compare in a cross-sectional-analysis the driving abilities of a sample of N=101 at the age of 70-90 years and a sample of N=104 at the age of 18-25 years. A clear connection between driving ability and age could be found. The driving competency of the older group reached a quarter to a third of the competency of the younger group. Research activities should concentrate in future on developing diagnostic instruments for measuring minimal cognitive impairment, the change process of cognitive abilities needed for driving a car by longitudinal studies and the further development of adequate theories.
