Pore water expulsion at submarine cold seeps : geochemical evidence for short-cuts between crust, sediments and ocean
Active pore water expulsion from marine sediments has been observed on continental margins worldwide and is therefore considered a potentially important link in global geochemical cycles. Understanding element recycling through submarine fluid discharge on a global scale requires a profound knowledge of the fluids&rsquo; origin and the geochemical processes affecting their composition. The present thesis investigates the chemical and isotopic (delta7Li, 87Sr/86Sr, 129I/I) composition of cold seep fluids as a function of the tectonic context, the lithology and thickness of ambient sediments and other relevant geological factors
