Extended performance evaluation based on DEA : a multidimensional point of view
This study introduces new methodological developments of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) that satisfy the demands of business practice and provide a multidimensional point of view on the evaluation of organizational performance. The author extends the focus of performance evaluation based on DEA, which is originally placed on efficiency, to effectiveness and balance. Such a multidimensional point of view provides different insights into organizational performance, which by complementing each other have several implications for managerial decision making. --
