Herbivore induced changes in the plantsÌ• proteome and the role of atypical herbivore-responsive proteins in Nicotiana attenuata
Since plants are largely immobile, they have evolved a large degree of physiological plasticity to cope with fluctuating environments. Plastic responses to herbivore attack involve transcriptional reorganizations and increases in hormone concentrations, enzyme activities, and secondary metabolite levels. Plants respond polygenetically to herbivores with different feeding habits by large transcriptomic reorganization upon herbivory. A comparative proteomic analysis examined whether the large-scale changes in transcriptome also translated into large-scale changes in the proteome.
