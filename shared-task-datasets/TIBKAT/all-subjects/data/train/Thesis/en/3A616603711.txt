Tectonically-controlled emplacement mechanisms in the upper crust under specific stress regimes : case studies
With regards to emplacement controlled by tectonic activity, sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous materials share many similarities. This is not only because that most of the features are associated with pre-existing structures (e.g. joints, bedding planes, faults), but also the physical occurrence of intrusions in the upper crust, regardless of which material (i.e. salt, shale, clastic deposits, magma), show similar shapes, distribution and emplacement mechanisms, which are mainly controlled by regional tectonics. Four field studies deal with the conditions of opening of tectonic fractures in the upper crust, their propagation, interaction and final emplacement. The following examples aim to better understand (1) the influence of pre-existing tectonic features on emplacement mechanisms in the upper crust; (2) tectonic effect on magma movement and location of eruption sites; (3) the feedback between faulting and magmatism; and (4) conditions and mechanisms of dyke emplacement ...
