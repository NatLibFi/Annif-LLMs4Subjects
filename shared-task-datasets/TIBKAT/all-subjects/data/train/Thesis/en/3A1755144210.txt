Antagonistic activities of Vegfr3/Flt4 and Notch1b fine-tune mechanosensitive signaling during zebrafish cardiac valvulogenesis
Cardiac valves are essential for the continuous and unidirectional flow of blood throughout the body. During embryonic development, their formation is strictly connected to the mechanical forces exerted by blood flow. The endocardium that lines the interior of the heart is a specialized endothelial tissue and is highly sensitive to fluid shear stress. Endocardial cells harbor a signal transduction machinery required for the translation of these forces into biochemical signaling, which strongly impacts cardiac morphogenesis and physiology. To date, we lack a solid understanding on the mechanisms by which endocardial cells sense the dynamic mechanical stimuli and how they trigger different cellular responses. In the zebrafish embryo, endocardial cells at the atrioventricular canal respond to blood flow by rearranging from a monolayer to a double-layer, composed of a luminal cell population subjected to blood flow and an abluminal one that is not exposed to it. These early morphological changes lead to the formation of an immature valve ...
