Quantitative sub cellular characterization of Hantavirus structural proteins
Hantaviruses (HVs) are a group of zoonotic viruses that infect human beings primarily through aerosol transmission of rodent excreta and urine samplings. HVs are classified geographically into: Old World HVs (OWHVs) that are found in Europe and Asia, and New World HVs (NWHVs) that are observed in the Americas. These different strains can cause severe hantavirus diseases with pronounced renal syndrome or severe cardiopulmonary system distress. HVs can be extremely lethal, with NWHV infections reaching up to 40 % mortality rate. HVs are known to generate epidemic outbreaks in many parts of the world including Germany, which has seen periodic HV infections over the past decade. HV has a trisegmented genome. The small segment (S) encodes the nucleocapsid protein (NP), the middle segment (M) encodes the glycoproteins (GPs) Gn and Gc which forms up to tetramers and primarily monomers \& dimers upon independent expression respectively and large segment (L) encodes RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Interactions between these viral proteins ...
