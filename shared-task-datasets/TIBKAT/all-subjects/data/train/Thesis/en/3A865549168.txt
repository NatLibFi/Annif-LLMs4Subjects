Electrochemical deposition as a fabrication method for micro thermoelectric generators
Zusammenfassung: This work presents a comprehensive framework for the fabrication and further optimization of microscale thermoelectric generators, with electrochemical deposition applied as the primary synthesis method for the constituent materials. The pulsed galvanostatic deposition of n-type Bi2Te3 and p-type Sb2Te3 from nitric acid based electrolytes is investigated and optimized with respect to the composition, morphology and thermoelectric properties of the resulting films. The optimized plating protocols can be used for the deposition of near-stoichiometric materials with excellent morphology and a thickness of at least 50 µm for Bi2Te3 and 10 µm for Sb2Te3. For the measurement of the thermoelectric material properties, specialized, non-destructive characterization procedures are developed and evaluated, which allow the determination of the layer properties in the presence of an optimized seed layer
