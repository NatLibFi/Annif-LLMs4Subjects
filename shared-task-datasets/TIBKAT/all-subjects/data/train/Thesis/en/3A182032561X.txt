Consequences of enriching European beech forests with non-native Douglas fir for generalist arthropod predator diversity, abundance and pest control
As anthropogenic climate induced stress leads to biodiversity loss and an increase in the frequency and severity of pest outbreaks, forest management in Central Europe is looking for ways to balance demands of biodiversity conservation and economic utility. To fulfil these demands Central European forestry is shifting from monoculture plantations to mixtures with phylogenetically distant deciduous and coniferous tree species which have been show to promote biodiversity and top-down control. Furthermore, the utilization of non-native Douglas fir, which combines climate change adaptability an...
