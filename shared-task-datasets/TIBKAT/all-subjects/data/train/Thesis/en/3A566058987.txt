Trafficking materials and gendered experimental practices : radium research in early 20th century Vienna
"Maria Rentetzi surveys the experimental practices of radioactivity research in earlytwentiethcentury Vienna, focusing on radioactive materials, instruments, women's work in physics, and gendered skills. She shows how experimental cultures in radioactivity-scientific practices employed by gendered subjects who shared a certain material and episternic style of researchwere constructed and reshaped by socialist politics in Vienna at that time. She also explores the different ways experimental practices affected men and women in laboratory sciences."--BOOK JACKET
