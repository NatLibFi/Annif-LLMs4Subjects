Detecting and understanding extragalactic Lyman [alpha] emission using 3D spectroscopy
n this thesis we use integral-field spectroscopy to detect and understand of Lyman α (Lyα) emission from high-redshift galaxies. Intrinsically the Lyα emission at λ = 1216 Å is the strongest recombination line from galaxies.  It arises from the 2p → 1s transition in hydrogen.  In star-forming galaxies the line is powered by ionisation of the interstellar gas by hot O- and B- stars.  Galaxies with star-formation rates of 1 - 10 Msol/year are expected to have Lyα luminosities of 42 dex - 43 dex (erg/s), corresponding to fluxes ~ -17 dex - -18 dex (erg/s/cm²) at redshifts z~3, where Lyα is easily accessible with ground-based telescopes.  However, star-forming galaxies do not show these expected Lyα fluxes.  Primarily this is a consequence of the high-absorption cross-section of neutral hydrogen for Lyα photons σ ~ -14 dex (cm²).  Therefore, in typical interstellar environments Lyα photons have to undergo a complex radiative transfer.  The exact conditions under which Lyα photons can escape a galaxy are poorly understood. ...
