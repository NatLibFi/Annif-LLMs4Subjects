Genetic and molecular analysis of heat stress induced transcriptional memory
Heat stress (HS) is one of the most common abiotic stresses, frequently affecting plant growth and crop production. With its fluctuating nature, HS episodes are frequently interspersed by stress-free intervals. Plants can be primed by HS, allowing them to survive better a recurrent stress episode. A memory of this priming can be maintained during stress-free intervals and this memory is closely correlated with transcriptional memory at several HS-inducible loci. This transcriptional memory is evident from hyper-induction of a locus upon a recurrent HS. ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 2 (APX2) shows such hyper-induction upon recurring HS, however, the molecular basis of this transcriptional memory is not understood. Previous research showed that the HSinduced transcriptional memory at APX2 can last for up to seven days, and that it is controlled by cis-regulatory elements within the APX2 promoter. To identify regulators involved in HS transcriptional memory, an unbiased forward genetic screening using EMS mutated seeds of pAPX2::LUC was performed from this screen. [...]
