The influence of temperature fluctuations on dust formation in dust driven winds of asymptotic giant branch stars
Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars show strong stellar pulsations, which originate in their extended convective envelopes. These pulsations elevate the stellar atmosphere, and generate thermodynamic conditions favourable for the condensation of dust grains out of the gas phase. The radiation pressure on the newly formed dust leads to a dust driven wind, which in turn leads to a substantial mass loss. In order to investigate the influence of temperature fluctuations on the dust formation in these objects, the dust formation was formulated as a stochastic process. This formulation leads to a set of coupled Fokker-Planck equations for the conditional expectation values of the moments of the grain size distribution function. This set of Fokker-Planck equations has been evaluated in gas box calculations. The results are compared to Monte-Carlo simulations of the same stochastic process. The gas box calculations were used to determine the values for the rms temperature deviaton s, for which the temperature fluctuations show a remarkable influence on the dust formation, and the values for the correlation time ?, for which the dust formation can be described in the micro- or macroturbulent limit case...
