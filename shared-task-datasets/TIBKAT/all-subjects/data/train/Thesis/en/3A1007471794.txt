Production of wax esters in (Camelina sativa)
Wax esters are the esters of primary long-chain fatty alcohols and long-chain fatty acids in various combinations, including different chain length and a variety of desaturation degrees. Wax esters cover a wide range of chemical and physical properties, therefore are interesting for many industrial applications. 18:1/18:1 is the most favorable wax ester species for the lubrication purpose. To establish a heterologous pathway for wax ester biosynthesis in plants, only two enzymes are necessary, a FAR and a WS. In previous studies, the introduction of FARs and WSs form different organisms int...
