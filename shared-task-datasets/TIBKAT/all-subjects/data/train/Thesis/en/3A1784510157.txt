Kinetic studies in GeO2/Ge system : a retrospective from 2021
"This title investigates reaction kinetics in GeO2/Ge systems, aiming to demonstrate the fundamentals of the GeO2/Ge interface and to give insight into the distinctive features and performance of Ge (germanium) applied to advanced complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices. The book first reviews the development of MOS technology and discusses the potentials of emerging Ge and the challenges facing it, as a contentious channel material once promising to replace Si (silicon) for advanced nodes. The study systematically analyses the following aspects of GeO2/Ge stacks that will shed light on the characteristics and reaction principles of the system: GeO2/Ge degradation, Ge passivation techniques, desorption kinetics of GeO from GeO2/Ge, the relationship between GeO2 crystallization and GeO2/Ge interface reaction, and the oxidation kinetics of Ge. Based on findings from the intrinsic properties of GeO2/Ge, the author also compares it with prevalent SiO2/Si systems and demonstrates the essential differences between the two, contributing to quality control, process optimization, and technology advancements of GeO2/Ge. The book will be a useful reference for researchers, professionals, and students interested in electronic materials, condenser matter physics, microelectronic engineering, and semiconductors"--
