Influence of amyloid aggregates on the trafficking and signaling of GPCRs
The prevalence of diseases associated with misfolded proteins increases with age. When cellular defense mechanisms become limited, misfolded proteins form aggregates and may also develop more stable cross-β structures ultimately forming amyloid aggregates. Amyloid aggregates are associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Huntington’s disease. The formation of amyloid deposits, their toxicity and cellular defense mechanisms have been intensively studied. However, surprisingly little is known about the effects of protein aggregates on cellular signal transduction. It is also not understood whether the presence of aggregation-prone, but still soluble proteins affect signal transduction. In this study, the still soluble aggregation-prone HttExon1Q74 and its amyloid aggregates were used to analyze the effect of amyloid aggregates on internalization and receptor activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest protein family of mammalian cell surface receptors involved in signal transduction. ...
