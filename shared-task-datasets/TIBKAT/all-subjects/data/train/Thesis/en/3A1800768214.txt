This volume examines transnational educational transfer between China and the League of Nations during the interwar period. By analysing the educational activities of the League of Nations with China, he book enriches the study of the history of the League of Nations by turning the focus to affairs that exceed the scope of traditional international relation and focusing on ways in which international organizations engaged in international educational endeavors. Adopting a transnational perspective, the book moves beyond conventional national-centered historiography, thus contributing to the understanding of how educational ideas, media, and policies circulate between different nations.
