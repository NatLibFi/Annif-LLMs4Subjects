Managing know-who based companies : a multinetworked approach to knowledge and innovation management
In this fully revised and updated second edition of the widely acclaimed first volume, Sigvald Harryson provides powerful evidence as to how the most successful innovators are distinguished by their ability to synergistically link external and internal knowledge networks. Based on extensive research with leading global innovators along with ten years of experience in management of knowledge and technology for accelerated innovation, Managing Know-Who Based Companies provides practical guidance regarding how to manage these networks. Important theoretical arguments that advance our thinking about managing knowledge for innovation are also presented. The author studies how individuals and teams who possess the required active empathy and relationship-building skills to function as human knowledge bridges across various centres of excellence, functions and teams - the 'know-who' - are central to successful innovation in the global value networks of today's business environment. This book is recommended reading for CEOs of multinational companies who wish to make better use of the value networks in which they live and do business. It will also be of significant value to CTOs, CKOs and Human Resource Managers interested in new ways to turning both hard technologies and soft human brainpower within and beyond the corporate borders into faster and more powerful innovation
