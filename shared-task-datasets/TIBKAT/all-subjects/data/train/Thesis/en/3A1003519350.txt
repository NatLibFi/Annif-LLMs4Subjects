Inertial modes, turbulence and magnetic effects in a differentially rotating spherical shell
The study of a fluid trapped inside a spherical shell is of fundamental interest in fluid mechanics, having given rise to numerous theoretical and experimental studies. This is also a geometric feature shared by geo- and astrophysical objects such as the interior and atmosphere of the Earth, the interiors of stars, gas giants, exoplanets and so on. Driven by these motivations, the present work builds over past studies of the spherical Couette system - two concentric differentially rotating spheres with the space in between filled with a fluid. Despite the numerous theoretical and experiment...
