Die Literatur der Roma Frankreichs
Literary works by Romani authors offer rare and intimate insights into the lifeworld of Europe's largest minority. Until now, literary scholarship has largely ignored such internal perspectives on Romani life. This book attempts to close the research gap and provides a comprehensive analysis of the works of Romani authors in France, seen from the perspective of how collective memory develops in a diaspora society. --
