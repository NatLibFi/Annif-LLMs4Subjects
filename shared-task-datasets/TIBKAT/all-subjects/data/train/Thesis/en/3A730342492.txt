Wave optical simulations of x-ray nano-focusing optics
Curved x-ray multilayer mirrors focus synchrotron beams down to tens of nano metres. A wave-optical theory describing propagation of two waves in an elliptically curved focusing multilayer mirror is developed in this thesis. Using numerical integration, the layer shapes can be optimised for reflectivity and aberrations. Within this framework, performance of both existing and currently upgraded synchrotron beamlines is simulated. Using a more theoretical model case, limits of the theory are studied. A significant part of this work is dedicated to partial spatial coherence, modelled using the method of stochastic superpositions. Coherence propagation and filtering by x-ray waveguides is shown analytically and numerically. This comprehensive model is put forward that shall help in development and testing of new algorithms for a variety of imaging techniques using coherent x-ray beams. Advanced simulations accounting for real structure effects are compared to experimental data obtained at the GINIX instrument at the coherence beamline P10 at PETRA III, DESY. This thesis presents results of a collaboration between the Georg-August-Universität Göttingen and the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) Grenoble.
