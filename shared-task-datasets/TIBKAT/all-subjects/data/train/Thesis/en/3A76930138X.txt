Transport phenomena in thermoelectric and ferromagnetic nanostructures
This thesis deals with transport phenomena in nanoscale systems: The Seebeck effect is explored in Bi2Te2 nanowires, the anisotropic magnetothermal resistance effect in Ni nanowires, and the giant magnetothermal resistance effect in Co/Cu multilayers. Research on transport phenomena in a variety of materials has played a decisive role in the development of solid-state physics and has led to important applications of functional materials, e.g. for the conversion and storage of energy or in the field of storage and processing of data.
