Dynamics of the rise of magnetic flux tubes in stellar interiors : a numerical study of compressible non-axisymmetric flux tubes
Solar-like stars maintain their magnetic fields thanks to a dynamo mechanism. The Babcock-Leighton dynamo is one possible dynamo that has the particularity to require magnetic flux tubes. Magnetic flux tubes are assumed to form at the bottom of the convective zone and rise buoyantly to the surface. A delayed dynamo model has been suggested, where the delay accounts for the rise time of the magnetic flux tubes; a time, that has been ignored by former studies. The present thesis aims to study the applicability of the flux tube/Babcock-Leighton dynamo to other stars. To do so, we attempt to constrain the rise time of magnetic flux tubes thanks to the first fully compressible MHD simulations of rising magnetic flux tubes in stratified rotating spherical shells. Such simulations are limited to an unrealistic parameter space, therefore, a scaling relation is required to scale the results to realistic physical regimes. We extended earlier works on 2D scaling relations and derived a general scaling law valid for both 2D and 3D. We thenâ€¦
