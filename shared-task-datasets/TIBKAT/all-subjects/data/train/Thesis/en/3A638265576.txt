Artisanal fisheries of Kenya's South Coast : a transdisciplinary case study of a socio-ecological system transition
Kenya South coast, artisanal fisheries, fishing gear, socio-economy, traditional management, marine protected areas, fishing policy. - The study addresses the biological and the socio-cultural dimensions of the artisanal fisheries along a 50 km long stretch of the South coast of Kenya. Nine fish landing sites were monitored over two years. Lines, gill nets, traps, and spears were common to all the sites. Beach seine, set nets, cha-cha and ring nets were recently introduced to certain places. Gear selection was not necessarily determined by the efficiency of the gear an indication that artisanal fishery was a social undertaking largely controlled by habit and attitude. The annual catch per unit area was estimated as 14t/km of coastline. The socio-cultural studies in the fishing villages showed strong family bonds. 75% of the fishers were illiterate. Fishing generated one third of total household income in addition to fish used for household consumption. Leadership of the fishing villages was largely in the hands of the elders employing complex effort restrictions based on customs and religious taboos. The study might contribute to an preemptive policy to reconcile the longterm needs and the immediate demands of the local population relying on sustainable fishery resources.
