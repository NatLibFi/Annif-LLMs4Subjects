Tree and oil palm water use : scaling, spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics (Sumatra, Indonesia)
Transpiration is a central flux in the terrestrial water cycle and is considered an important ecosystem service for atmosphere and hydrosphere regulation. Transpiration is strongly affected by land cover and land-use changes, which are currently very pronounced in tropical regions. It is thus important to better understand transpiration in near-natural and in human-modified ecosystems. This includes aspects of spatio-temporal variation and scaling. The main objectives of this study were (1) to test scaling approaches from individual plants to stand transpiration by using crown metrics, (2) ...
