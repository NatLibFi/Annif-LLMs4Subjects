Drought tolerance prediction of potato by automatic phenotyping of morphological and physiological traits
Potato is the 4th most important food crop in the world. Especially in tropical and sub-tropical potato production, drought is a yield limiting factor. Potato is sensitive to water stress. Potato yield loss under water stress could be reduced by using tolerant varieties and adjusted agronomic practices. Direct selection for yield under water-stressed conditions requires long selection cycles. Thus, identification of markers for marker-assisted selection may speed up breeding. The objective of this thesis is to identify morphological markers for drought tolerance by continuously monitoring plant growth and canopy temperature with an automatic phenotyping system. The phenotyping was performed in drought-stress experiments that were conducted in population A with 64 genotypes and population B with 21 genotypes in the screenhouse in 2015 and 2016 (population A) and in 2017 and 2018 (population B). Drought tolerance was quantified as deviation of the relative tuber starch yield from the experimental median (DRYM) and parent median ...
