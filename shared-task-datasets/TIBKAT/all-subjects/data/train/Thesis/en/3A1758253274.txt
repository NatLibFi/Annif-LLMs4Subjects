Diversity effects on ecosystem functions of tritrophic food webs
There is a general consensus that diverse ecological communities are better equipped to adapt to changes in their environment, but our understanding of the mechanisms by which they do so remains incomplete. Accurately predicting how the global biodiversity crisis affects the functioning of ecosystems, and the services they provide, requires extensive knowledge about these mechanisms. Mathematical models of food webs have been successful in uncovering many aspects of the link between diversity and ecosystem functioning in small food web modules, containing at most two adaptive trophic levels. Meaningful extrapolation of this understanding to the functioning of natural food webs remains difficult, due to the presence of complex interactions that are not always accurately captured by bitrophic descriptions of food webs. In this dissertation, we expand this approach to tritrophic food web models by including the third trophic level. Using a functional trait approach, coexistence of all species is ensured using fitness-balancing ...
