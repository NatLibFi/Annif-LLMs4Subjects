Ecological information of ring width, stable carbon isotope composition and wood anatomical variables in tropical tree rings : A contribution to dendrochronology in the tropics
Trees are long living organisms and record ecologically relevant information in their growth rings. Studying tree growth on the base of tree rings can help to fill some of the major research gaps concerning the age and life history of trees as well as their response to changing environmental conditions. Forest ecosystems in tropical regions show high species diversity and a large variability of climatic zones, resulting in a multitude of possible wood anatomical ring structures and resultant relations to ecological and environmental parameters. To ensure the successful application of dendrochronological studies a detailed knowledge of wood-anatomical structures and the variability of tree rings is required. Chapter 2 of the dissertation describes macroscopically apparent growth structures and explains the anatomical background of the visibility of tree ring structures. Traditional methods of age determination like direct radiocarbon measurements of the oldest parts of a tree, calculations from repeated diameter measurements as well as the prediction of longevity from mortality rates are discussed and the advantages of tree ring analysis to study age and growth rates in tropical trees are given. In Chapter 3 the dendro-climatic potential of two dominant species from dry forests in Northern Namibia is examined ...
