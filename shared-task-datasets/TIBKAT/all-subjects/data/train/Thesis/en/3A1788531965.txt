Claiming Home traces transnational configurations of sexualities through biographical narratives of queer migrant women. Situated between victimizing heteronormative and racialized stereotypes of migrant women on the one hand, and the implicitly white figure of the lesbian on the other, queer migrant women are rendered impossible subjects. Claiming Home maps how these women navigate diverging and often contradictory perspectives on sexuality, conflicting loyalties, and the multiple mechanisms of exclusion they are exposed to - on account of their gender, sexuality, and immigrant status.
