New inverse opal hydrogels as platform for detecting macromolecules
In this thesis, a route to temperature-, pH-, solvent-, 1,2-diol-, and protein-responsive sensors made of biocompatible and low-fouling materials is established. These sensor devices are based on the sensitivemodulation of the visual band gap of a photonic crystal (PhC), which is induced by the selective binding of analytes, triggering a volume phase transition.The PhCs introduced by this work show a high sensitivity not only for small biomolecules, but also for large analytes, such as glycopolymers or proteins. This enables the PhC to act as a sensor that detects analytes without the need of complex equipment. Due to their periodical dielectric structure, PhCs prevent the propagation of specific wavelengths. A change of the periodicity parameters is thus indicated by a change in the reflected wavelengths. In the case explored, the PhC sensors are implemented as periodically structured responsive hydrogels in formof an inverse opal. The stimuli-sensitive inverse opal hydrogels (IOHs) were prepared using a sacrificial opal ...
