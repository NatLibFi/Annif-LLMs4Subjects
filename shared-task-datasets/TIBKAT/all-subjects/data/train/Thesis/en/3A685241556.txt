Motion and gravitational wave emission of spinning compact binaries
The thesis treats the subject of compact binary systems with spin in the general theory of relativity. We discuss important configurations as, in the first part of the thesis, parallel or antiparallel spins and orbital angular momentum. In the second part we treat compact binaries with spin whose individual masses differ slightly from each other. Finally, in the third part, we compute analytical time Fourier domain wave forms for nonspinning compact binaries. In all our computations we employ the framework of the post-Newtonian approximation.
