Computational cardiology : modeling of anatomy, electrophysiology, and mechanics
This book is devoted to computer-based modeling in cardiology,by takingan educational point of view, andby summarizing knowledge from several, commonlyconsidereddelimited areas of cardiac research in a consistent way. First, the foundations and numerical techniques from mathematics are provided, with a particular focus on the finite element and finite differences methods. Then, the theory of electric fields and continuum mechanics is introducedwith respect tonumerical calculations in anisotropic biological media.In additionto the presentation of digital image processing techniques, the following chapters deal with particular aspects of cardiac modeling: cardiac anatomy cardiac electro physiology cardiac mechanics modeling of cardiac electro mechanics This book was written for researchers in modeling and cardiology, for clinical cardiologists,and for advanced students
