The role of microbial CO2 fixation for belowground carbon cycling and its influence on carbon isotopic signatures
Overall this thesis shows that microbial CO2 fixation is a ubiquitous process that contributes to carbon cycling within the subsurface and influences carbon isotopic signatures of organic matter.
