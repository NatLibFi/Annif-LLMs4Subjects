Revealing manduca sexta´s nicotine metabolism and its ecological consequences using plant mediated RNAi based reverse genetics
Insects have developed a myriad of adaptations to live and evolve. Manduca sexta, a specialist lepidopteran herbivore of Nicotiana attenuata, has developed a remarkable adaptation to tolerate a toxic alkaloid ‘nicotine’ that it ingests from its host plant Nicotiana attenuata. The mechanism of nicotine tolerance in M. sexta larvae is not completely known. In this work I used a reverse genetics based approach to silence M. sexta’s genes involved nicotine tolerance to understand their role and ecological consequences of nicotine adaptation by this insect. Nicotine induced midgut-based M. sexta CYP6B46 was silenced by plant-mediated RNAi. Survivorship of CYP6B46-silenced M. sexta larvae was found to be lowered, similar to that of low-nicotine-foliage feeding larvae in the field (Great Basin desert, Utah). While investigating the reasons for the reduced survivorship, I identified a native wolf-spider that preferred to prey on nicotine-free and CYP6B46-silenced larvae, compared to control larvae. ...
