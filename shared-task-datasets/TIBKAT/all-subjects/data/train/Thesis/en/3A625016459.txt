Rezente Äquivalente pleistozäner kaltzeitlicher Gastropoden-Faunen des mitteleuropäischen Raumes in Zentralasien sowie ihre Bedeutung für paläozoogeographische und paläoökologische Aussagen
The study is based mainly on the assumption that analogies with the ecosystems of the glacial period in central Europe will not be found in the far north of Europe or in Northern Asia but are to be expected much further south in the cooler continental regions of central Asia. The molluscs of the glacial period in central Europe differ considerably from present-day, sub-polar mollusc findings due to the occurrence of a series of steppe varieties. These also include the xerothermous type Pupilla triplicata which has been found from recent times in central Asia as well. In this context, it is also significant that glacial period index species of molluscs, e.g. Vallonia tenuilabris, Vertigo pseudosubstriata or Pisidium stewarti, which were first described from the Quaternary in central Europe, have surprisingly been discovered decades later in central Asia. Other living fossilsʺ, such as recent evidence of Pupilla loessica, were therefore also to be expected. Corresponding comparative investigations of Pleistocene central European and recent central Asian faunas have not previously been available...
