New aspects of the Middle-Late Triassic terrestrial impact cratering record : 40Ar/39Ar dating of the Rochechouart (France), Manicouagan (Canada), and Paasselkä (Finland) impact structures, paleoenvironmental considerations, and a critical look at the Late Triassic multiple impact theory
This thesis critically addresses the question whether Earth experienced a giant multiple cosmic strike in the Late Triassic ~214 million years (Ma) ago, as postulated by Spray et al. in 1998. According to this theory, the large ~100 km Manicouagan impact structure (Québec, Canada), the ~40 km Lake St. Martin impact structure (Manitoba, Canada), the ~25 km Rochechouart impact structure (France), the ~20 km Obolon impact structure (Ukraine), and the ~9 km Red Wing Creek impact structure (North Dakota, USA) are potential members of a ~4,500 km long impact crater chain, compatible with coeval impact ages available in 1998. However, no geologic evidence for the multiple Late Triassic impact scenario has been presented since that time. In this study, I present new 40Ar/39Ar data for the Rochechouart and Manicouagan impact structures, along with new constraints for the timing of the Obolon impact structure based on paleoenvironmental considerations...
