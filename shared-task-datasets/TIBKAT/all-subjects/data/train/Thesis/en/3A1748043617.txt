Sprachpflegediskurse in Deutschland und Frankreich : Ã–ffentlichkeit - Geschichte - Ideologie
"This contrastive discourse linguistic study examines language planning in Germany and France as a public, historical and ideological discourse system. Using critical theories and broad empirical documentation, it demonstrates the complexity of language planning discourses in transnationally connected knowledge societies and illuminates them against the backdrop of the language behaviour of the actors involved."--Publisher's website
