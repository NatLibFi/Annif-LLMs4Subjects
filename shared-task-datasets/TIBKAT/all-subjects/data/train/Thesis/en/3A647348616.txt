Actions of lignocellulolytic enzymes on Abies grandis (grand fir) wood for application in biofuel production
Abies grandis is a fast growing coniferous tree with a high potential for sustainable wood production and applications in the wood product industry. However, for the possible applications knowledge on behaviour of the wood with wood-decaying fungi was required. In wood block decay tests following norm EN 113 (1996), A. grandis wood as well as wood composites from A. grandis wood were easily degraded by brown-rot fungi but the wood showed a comparably good resistance against white-rot species. Earlywood and latewood in A. grandis wood was shown to different degrees to be affected by decay of different species over the incubation time. The brown-rot fungus Corniophora puteana caused higher mass loss for samples of earlywood+latewood than for samples of earlywood alone, as analyzed after 19 weeks of incubation. In contrast, the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor caused a 2x higher mass loss of earlywood samples than of earlywood+latewood samples. Teatment of the wood with urea formaldehyde or ammonium sulphate however enhanced the resistance against white rot fungi. In contrast, wood extracted with water and with water+acetone lost resistance. Moreover, broken wood was easily degraded by fungi; likely, broken cells allow fungi an easy entry into wood cells ...
