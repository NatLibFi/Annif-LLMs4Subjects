Shock-Cloud Interaction in RX J1713.7−3946 : Evidence for Cosmic-Ray Acceleration in the Young VHE γ-ray Supernova Remnant
Introduction -- Non-Thermal X-ray Enhancement around Dense Gas Clumps -- Evidence for the Acceleration of Cosmic Ray Protons -- Evidence for Efficient Acceleration of Cosmic Rays -- Summary and Future Prospects.
This book presents a study of the young supernova remnant RX J1713.7-3946 in order to reveal the origin of cosmic rays in our galaxy. The study focuses on the X-ray and gamma radiation from the cosmic ray electrons and protons in the supernova remnant as well as the emission from the surrounding interstellar gas measured by the NANTEN2 4-m radio telescope at Nagoya University. The gamma rays show a good spatial correspondence with the interstellar gas, which for the first time provides strong evidence of the acceleration of cosmic ray protons. Additionally, the author determines that an interaction between the supernova shockwaves and interstellar gas, referred to as “shock-cloud interaction,” promotes the efficient acceleration of cosmic ray electrons in the supernova remnant. The book reveals that the interstellar gas plays an essential role in producing the high-energy radiation and cosmic rays, offering vital new insights into the origin and behavior of galactic cosmic rays.
