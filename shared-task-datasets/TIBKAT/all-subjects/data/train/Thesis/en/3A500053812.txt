Acceleration and spatial diffusion of galactic cosmic rays
In the present work analytical solutions of the transport equation for hadronic cosmic rays are calculated. With these, it is possible for the first time to fit the energy spectra of the cosmic protons measured at the position of the earth. A focus lies on the investigation of the spatial diffusion of the galactic cosmic ray nuclei and their stochastic reacceleration by plasma waves superimposed on the interstellar medium. A realistic spatial distribution of supernova remnants as primary sources of the galactic cosmic rays and, as an additional process, the solar modulation are taken into account. Different fit parameters are obtained. Additionally, analytical approximations of the momentum solution for a power law injection spectrum for small and large momenta are calculated for the case without and for the case with spallation losses.
