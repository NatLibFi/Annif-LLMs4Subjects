The effect of iron on the stability, water content and compressibility of mantle silicates : implications for a hydrous Martian interior
This thesis addresses three different effects of Fe on the properties of nominally anhydrous transition minerals and dense hydrous Mg-silicates. Furthermore, the potential presence of dense hydrous Mg-Fe silicates (DHMS) in the Martian interior and the water storage potential of a hydrous Martian mantle are evaluated. 1. The effect of iron on the water content of ringwoodite. The results show that the water contents of Fe-rich ringwoodites of about 0.4-0.7 wt% H2O are considerably reduced compared to pure Mg-ringwoodite. Thus, the ringwoodite samples show an inverse correlation of Fe- and water content. The Mg-site octahedra represent the favored protonation site in ferroan ringwoodites corresponding to the Mg2+=2H+ water substitution mechanism. In addition, Fe3+ diminishes the water content of ringwoodites due to the reduction of potential protonation sites. This is caused by the creation of Mg-site vacancies by the oxidation of Fe and the occupation of octahedral sites by Fe-atoms, which are probably not involved in water substitution mechanism. These results indicate that less water can be stored in nominally anhydrous mantle silicates of Fe-rich planetary mantles ...
