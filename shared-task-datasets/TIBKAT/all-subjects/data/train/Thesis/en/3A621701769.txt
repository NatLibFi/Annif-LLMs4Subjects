This work proposes and experimentally evaluates a new method and the first prototypic design of an apparatus for the objective assessment of peripheral dynamic stereovision. Peripheral dynamic stereovision is understood as the ability to perceive, recognize and observe moving objects in the visual periphery without sacrificing foveal fixation, i.e. shifting the line of sight (e.g. moving the eyes or the head) and loosing attention to the scene of interest. The presence of stereopsis on top further enhances the perceptive quality by adding the third dimension with judgment of depth and estimation of relative spatial positions as central clues for orientation, coordinative interaction and navigation in space...
