Mechanistische Untersuchungen zur Natur von CH-aktivierten Zykloaminierungs- und Zyklohydroaminierungsreaktionen, katalysiert durch Übergangs- und s-Block-Metallkomplexe
A novel CN-cyclization, dealkylating CH-activated cycloamination (CDZA reaction) was investigated. Mechanistic studies were done by iterative changes of reaction conditions as well as on substrates and the catalyst. A new proposal of the catalytic cycle was achieved based on experimentally found data. Related Palladium complexes which show either κ1C- or k1N-coordinated triazenide ligands were synthesized and characterized. The synthesis of such complexes provides important evidence for the Hartwig-Buchwald amination derived CDZA reaction of triazenes and amidines. The reaction was found to be slow according to obtained TON and TOF numbers. Additionally, a variety of new NH- and N-methylated triazenes and amidines were provided. A deeper insight into the properties of both substrate classes was achieved (e.g., degradation focused on thermal degradation, pkA values and equilibrium of constitutional and configurational isomers) that allows accurate assessment of analytical data of the CDZA reaction. Since calcium and calciate complexes also catalyze amination reactions further objectives of this work were also the expansion to novel calcium amidinates which are functionalized with heteroatomic groups showing attractive additional coordination site for the A- and Ae-metal. Plenty of those complexes were synthesized and characterized within these studies.
