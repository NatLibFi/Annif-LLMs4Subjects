Characterization of caspases from Lepidoptera and their role in apoptosis
Multicellular organisms need a tightly controlled regulation of cell proliferation and of cell specialization together with a controlled cell death to maintain their integrity. A family of evolutionarily conserved proteases, called caspases, plays a central role in regulating apoptosis in animals. The discovery of p35, a baculovirus caspase inhibitor, has led to the characterization of the first lepidopteran caspase, Sf-Caspase-1, from Spodoptera frugiperda. Studies on the Sf-Caspase-1 mode of activation suggested that apoptosis in Lepidoptera also requires a cascade of caspase activation, as demonstrated in many other species. We identified 66 sequences encoding putative caspases, distributed among 27 species. Phylogenetic analyses showed that Lepidoptera possess at least 5 caspases, for which we propose a unified nomenclature. According to their homology to their Drosophila counterparts and their primary structure, we proposed that Lep-Caspase-1, -2 and -3 are effector caspases, whereas Lep-Caspase-5 and -6 are putative initiators. The likely function of Lep-Caspase-4 remains unclear. We found that Caspase-1 and -2 have complementary expression profiles during larval development, suggesting a differential regulation. Caspase-3 and -6 are upregulated upon immune challenge, suggesting a role in the imd pathway. Caspase-5 is upregulated during pupation and upon induction with 20-hydroxyecdysone, supporting the hypothesis of Caspase-5 playing a similar role as Dronc in developmental apoptosis in Drosophila.
