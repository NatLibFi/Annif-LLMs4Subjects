Measurements of tropical bamboo water use
Bamboos are grasses (Poaceae) that are widespread in tropical and subtropical regions. As monocots, woody bamboos have thin-wall hollow culms with abundant parenchyma and the culms are connected by rhizomes. These properties may imply that bamboos have specifc water use characteristics. For example, the abundant parenchyma in culms provides a water reservoir for internal water storage, which may inï¬‚uence the response of water use to environmental factors; the connected rhizome provides passages for water transfer between bamboo culms. However, only a few water-use related studies have been ...
