Construction of MV-polytopes via LS-galleries
The result of this thesis is a connection between the LS-galleries model for finite dimensional representations of a complex, simply-connected, semi-simple, algebraic group G, as introduced by Gaussent and Littelmann and MV-polytopes (short for Mirkovic and Vilonen), via retractions in the affine building. MV-polytopes were studied by Anderson and Kamnitzer, they are the images of MV-cycles under the moment map. It is well-known, that both, the LS-gallery model as well as the MV-polytopes give a combinatorial realisation of finite dimensional representations of G. In this thesis, we give a combinatorial method to relate these two models. This is done by constructing, starting from a given LS-gallery, a set of combinatorial galleries whose endpoints span the corresponding MV-polytope. We show that these galleries are exactly the images of the associated Bialynicki-Birula cell under suitable retractions of the affine building.
