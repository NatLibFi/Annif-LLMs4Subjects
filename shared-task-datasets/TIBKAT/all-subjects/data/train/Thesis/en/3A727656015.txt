Menschliche Reaktionen in Naturkatastrophen und technologischen Krisensituationen : Ergebnisse der explorativen Befragung von Überlebenden zur konzeptuellen Entwicklung eines standardisierten Instruments für das retrospektive Assessment
Disasters have a massive impact on survivors on a psychological level. The study is one of the first explorative approaches assessing emotional, cognitive and behavioural responses of different types of disasters, such as terror attacks, collapses of buildings, fires, floods and earthquakes with the same set of psychological instruments. Also a comprehensive description of human reactions in disasters was given, taking the influence of posttraumatic stress and time passed since the event into account. Individual and situational characteristics were set into relation to peritraumatic emotional stress, risk perception and posttraumatic stress.
