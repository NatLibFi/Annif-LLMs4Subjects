Laser-driven electron and spin-state quantum dynamics in transition metal complexes
Recent advances in attosecond spectroscopy open the door to the understanding correlated motion of valence and core electrons in molecular systems. In this thesis, the density matrix-based TD-RASCI method is used to study the electron and spin-flip dynamics. The dephasing effect of nuclear vibrations is incorporated implicitly making use of an electronic system/vibrational bath partitioning. We theoretically addressed the ultrafast spin-flip dynamics in a transition metal complex which is triggered by isolated sub-fs soft-X-ray pulses as well as X-ray pulse trains.<eng>
