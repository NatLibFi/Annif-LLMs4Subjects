Functionalization of porous carbon materials with heteroatoms and application as supports in industrial heterogeneous catalysis
Due to a challenging population growth and environmental changes, a need for new routes to provide required chemicals for human necessities arises. An effective solution discussed in this thesis is industrial heterogeneous catalysis. The development of an advanced industrial heterogeneous catalyst is investigated herein by considering porous carbon nano-material as supports and modifying their surface chemistry structure with heteroatoms. Such modifications showed a significant influence on the performance of the catalyst and provided a deeper insight regarding the interaction between the surface structure of the catalyst and the surrounding phase. This thesis contributes to the few present studies about heteroatoms effect on the catalyst performance and emphasizes on the importance of understanding surface structure functionalization in a catalyst in different phases (liquid and gaseous) and for different reactions (hydrogenolysis, oxidation, and hydrogenation/ polymerization). Herein, the heteroatoms utilized for the modifications ...
