Change detection in combination with spatial models and its effectiveness on underwater scenarios
This thesis proposes a novel change detection approach for underwater scenarios and combines it with different especially developed spatial models, this allows accurate and spatially coherent detection of any moving objects with a static camera in arbitrary environments. To deal with the special problems of underwater imaging pre-segmentations based on the optical flow and other special adaptions were added to the change detection algorithm so that it can better handle typical underwater scenarios like a scene crowded by a whole fish swarm.<eng>
