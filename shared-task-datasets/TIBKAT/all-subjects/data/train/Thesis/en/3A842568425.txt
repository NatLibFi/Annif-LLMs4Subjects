Moisture availability in the Tangra Yumco region during the Late Quaternary and the implications for the precipitation regime on the southern Tibetan Plateau
It is generally accepted that the Asian summer monsoon systems as well as the westerlies affect the precipitation regime on the Tibetan Plateau. The spatial and temporal variability of the monsoon has, however, been under strong discussion in recent years. The question arose whether the spatial and temporal monsoonal dynamics show a generally homogenous or heterogeneous pattern. To investigate the temporal and spatial variability of the monsoonal pattern three lakes along an east-west-transect on the southern Tibetan Plateau including Nam Co, Tangra Yumco, and Taro Co were targeted within the framework of the DFG priority program 1372 “TiP – Tibetan Plateau: Formation–Climate–Ecosystems”. This thesis comprises three independent studies, examining the central lake Tangra Yumco and its catchment revealing that the monsoonal dynamics on the southern Tibetan Plateau show a generally homogenous pattern.
