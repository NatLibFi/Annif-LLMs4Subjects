Synthesis of functionalized triarylmethanes and pyranones based on cyclization reactions of free and masked dianions and regioselective palladium(0)-catalyzed reactions of functionalized sulfones, benzophenones, pyrazoles, indenones, and furans
Functionalized triarylmethanes were prepared with [3+3] cyclization. 2,3-dihydro fluorinated and non fluorinated pyranones were prepared in one step strategy. The Regioselective Suzuki-Miyaura and Sonogashira reaction of the bis(triflates) of 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone and ,2,4-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone and 2,3-Dibromoindenone with arylboronic acids gave 2,4-diarylbenzophenones and 2,3-dibromoindenone were also studied. Furthermore, The Suzuki-Miyaura reactions of N-protected 3,4,5-tribromopyrazole, 2,3,4,5-tetrabromofuran.
