Laute und Lautenspiel in der ersten HÃ¤lfte des 16. Jahrhunderts : Beobachtungen zur Bauweise und Spieltechnik
Lute playing flourished between 1500 and 1550. Both lute construction and lute playing had already attained a standard that was still vaunted 200 years later. One of the main objectives of the study is to trace to before 1550 those tendencies in lute practice that became clearly evident after 1600.
