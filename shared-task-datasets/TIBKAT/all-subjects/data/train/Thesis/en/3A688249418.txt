Diversity and abundance of medicinal plants among different forest-use types of the Pakistani Himalaya
Medicinal plants collected in the Himalayan forests are receiving increasing attention at the international level for a number of reasons and they play an important role in securing rural livelihoods. However, these forests have been heavily transformed over the years by logging, grazing and agriculture. This thesis examines the extent to which the diversity and abundance of medicinal plants are affected between forest-use types as a result of such transformations. In northwestern Pakistan we studied old-growth forest, degraded forests (forests degraded by logging, derived woodland, agroforest and degraded sites) and restored forests (re-growth forests and reforestation sites). An approximate map was initially established covering an area of 90 km2 of the studied forest-use types and fifteen and five plots were allocated to five and two forest-use types respectively at altitudes ranging from 2,200 m to 2,400 m asl. The abundance and diversity of medicinal plants were then assessed therein ...
