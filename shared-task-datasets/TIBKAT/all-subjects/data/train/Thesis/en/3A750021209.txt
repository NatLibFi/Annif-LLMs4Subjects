Montagepositioner : en nyt√¶nkning af industrialiseret arkitektur
Montage Positions. A rethinking of industrialised architecture. The intensive industrialisation of residential architecture of the 1960s, with its repetitive montage of pre-fabricated elements, led to aesthetically impoverished living environments. Technical solutions prevailed over architectural vision.But the repetition principle contains an architectural potential that architects | then as now | challenge far too rarely. This despite the fact that today|s sophisticated production apparatus, based on IT and high-tech manufacturing processes, does have a potential for more user-focused and individualised architecture. The book articulates and discusses new perceptions of montage architecture and suggests what it will take to realise the architectural potential of neo-industrialisation.0
