A benefit-oriented framework for the decision-making process on the application of KMS in SME
The result of the presented PhD project is an artifact providing the SME practitioner with the KinS conceptual framework including method support. Therefore concepts from KM and KMS are newly combined and validated applying the perceived benefit approach of the KMS Success Model. The KinS framework uses the demand for support as the starting point for the perceived benefit and analyzes it with regard to the support opportunities by knowledge services. With the help of the framework, the gap in the knowledge base can be addressed and benefit-orientation in the KMS support can be provided.<eng>
