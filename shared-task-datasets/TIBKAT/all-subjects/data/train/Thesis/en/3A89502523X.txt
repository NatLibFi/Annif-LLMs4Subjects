"Piecing together unpublished archival documents, this pioneering study reveals the intriguing story of one of the most important, yet least studied, designs in modern architecture, the Hurva Synagogue in Jerusalem by Louis Kahn. Professor Sakr analyzes Kahn's design against the backdrop of the search of National Jewish Style since the 19th Century, and the subsequent architectural and archeological construction of the Jewish Quarter in Jerusalem. Though never built, Kahn's alternative Temple built a whole nation after its own fractured image." -- from page 4 of cover
