Development of a time-resolved quantitative surface-temperature measurement technique and its application in short-duration wind tunnel testing
In this cumulative thesis, a time-resolved quantitative temperature-sensitive paint (TSP) measurement technique was developed and used to measure temperatures at subsonic and up to hypersonic flow velocities in two different short duration wind tunnels. Based on this measurement technique it was possible to calculate the heat transfer into a wedge model in the High Enthalpy Shock Tunnel GÃ¶ttingen (HEG). Furthermore, the measurement technique was developed further to determine the location of laminar-turbulent transition on the two-dimensional wind tunnel model PaLASTra, which offers a quasi
