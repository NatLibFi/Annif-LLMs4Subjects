The afterglows of swift-era short and long gamma-ray bursts
The phenomenon of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) has been a great mystery since their discovery four decades ago. Even today, over a decade into the "afterglow age", many questions are still unanswered. The canonical picture which satisfies most of the data is that GRBs are produced when a massive celestial body (either a post-main sequence star or merging compact objects) at cosmological distances collapses to a rapidly rotating compact object (a black hole, for example) which launches ultra-relativistic polar jets. The internal dissipation of energy within the jets leads to collimated non-thermal high-energy emission (the actual GRB), whereas shocks created from the interactions of the jets with the interstellar medium create a long-lasting fading afterglow. ...
