Microbial communities in submarine permafrost and their response to permafrost degradation and warming
The Arctic region is especially impacted by global warming as temperatures in high latitude regions have increased and are predicted to further rise at levels above the global average. This is crucial to Arctic soils and the shallow shelves of the Arctic Ocean as they are underlain by permafrost. Perennially frozen ground is a habitat for a large number and great diversity of viable microorganisms, which can remain active even under freezing conditions. Warming and thawing of permafrost makes trapped soil organic carbon more accessible to microorganisms. They can transform it to the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. On the other hand, it is assumed that thawing of the frozen ground stimulates microbial activity and carbon turnover. This can lead to a positive feedback loop of warming and greenhouse gas release. Submarine permafrost covers most areas of the Siberian Arctic Shelf and contains a large though unquantified carbon pool. However, submarine permafrost is not only affected by changes in the thermal ...
