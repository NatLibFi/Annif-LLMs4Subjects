Changes in eco-hydrological functioning after tropical rainforest transformation to rubber and oil palm plantations
This work presents findings from eco-hydrological research carried out in Jambi, Sumatra, Indonesia in the framework of the CRC990 (Sub-Project A02). Our results point to substantial changes in central ecosystem water fluxes after tropical rainforest transformation to monoculture plantations, which affects the availability of water at the landscape scale and thus impacts on the well-being of rural communities. Rainforest transformation to agricultural systems is generally expected to alter ecosystem water cycles at local and regional scales. Transpiration, i.e. water use by plants, is centr...
