Untersuchungen zum Einfluss von Redoxpotential und alternativen Elektronenakzeptoren als Umweltfaktoren auf die reduktive Dehalogenierung von Tetrachlorethen in Sulfurospirillum multivorans
Tetrachloroethene (PCE) is among the most ubiquitous contaminats in aquifers and is degradable to less chlorinated ethenes by microorganisms under reductive conditions. The anaerobic bacterium Sulfurospirillum multivorans can couple the reductive dechlorination of PCE to energy conversion via chemiosmotic mechanism (organohalid respiration). In this study the influence of different alternative electron acceptors and the redox potentials on the reductive dechlorination of PCE by S. multivorans was investigated. During the growth of S. multivorans the redox potential of the cultivation media changed and was, depending on the used substrates, adjusted to values between -250 mV and -50 mV. The redox potential of the medium was adjusted by the usage of redox active compounds and by potentiostat-controlled graphite electrodes. There was only a little impact on the dechlorination of PCE when the redox potential of the media was adjusted between +400 mV and -600 mV.
