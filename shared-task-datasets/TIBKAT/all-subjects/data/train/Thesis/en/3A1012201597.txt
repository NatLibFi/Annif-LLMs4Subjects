Das MÃ¶nchtum in der Religionspolitik Kaiser Justinians I. : Die Engel des Himmels und der Stellvertreter Gottes auf Erden
With his religious politics and his self-representation as the vicar of God on Earth, Justinian I (527-565) had an enduring impact on Late Antiquity. What part did monks, believed to be heavenly angels, play in promoting this notion? This book offers the first exhaustive investigation of Justinian's personal relations to monkhood and the role of monks in religious and legislative politics.
