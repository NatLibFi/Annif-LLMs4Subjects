Insubordination in Germanic : a typology of complement and conditional constructions
This book studies insubordination using Germanic data. On a descriptive level, it distinguishes a wide number of (previously undescribed) types of complement and conditional insubordination in English, German, Dutch, Swedish, Danish and Icelandic. On a theoretical level, these data are used to investigate the boundaries of insubordination, and the degree to which insubordination is a constructionally and semantically unified phenomenon
