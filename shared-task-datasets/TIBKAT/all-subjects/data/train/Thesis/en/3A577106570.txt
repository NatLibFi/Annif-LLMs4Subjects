Thermal transport for applications in micro/nanomachining
With the recent advances in nanosciences, micro/nanoscale engineering applications are bound to be more common, complex and challenging. Further understanding of thermal transport down to nanometer scales will be crucial for the design and operation of new devices, which is possible only with the use of better theoretical and numerical models of energy transfer mechanisms involving photons, electrons, and phonons. The focus of this monograph is on thermal transport modeling at time and length scales ranging from micro- to nanoscale levels. It is not designed as a comprehensive text, but is int
