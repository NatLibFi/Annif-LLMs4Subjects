Single-family homes in Campau/Banglatown : values of placemaking, homemaking and placekeeping in a neighborhood of artists and immigrants in 21st century Detroit
Detroit’s shrinking size has resulted in an overabundance of single-family homes in this single-family home metropolis. On the one hand, the abandoned houses have led to Detroit being declared bankrupt, while on the other hand, it has paved the way for other ways of working and living with and using houses and vacant lots that may not make an immediate profit on the real estate market and may be considered “unreal” estate (Herscher, 2012), but that keep people together as a neighborhood and community. This thesis looks at the circumstances in which residents become homeowners and how as homeowners, artists and immigrants ascribe value to single-family homes and how they make place with their homes in a neighborhood context. The focus is on homeowners’ everyday practices that determine the value of single-family homes when the latter is not considered use value or economic value in a real estate market, but recognized as a social and cultural value.
