Coiled coils as molecular force sensors for the extracellular matrix
Force plays a fundamental role in the regulation of biological processes. Cells can sense the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by applying forces and transmitting mechanical signals. They further use mechanical information for regulating a wide range of cellular functions, including adhesion, migration, proliferation, as well as differentiation and apoptosis. Even though it is well understood that mechanical signals play a crucial role in directing cell fate, surprisingly little is known about the range of forces that define cell-ECM interactions at the molecular level. ...
