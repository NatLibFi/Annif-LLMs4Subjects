In this work, the kinetics of charged and neutral species in nonisothermal, molecular low-pressure discharge plasmas has been investigated. Oxygen has been choosen as work gas because there are a lot of fundamental questions to answer and oxygen is of intrest for numerous technological applications. To describe the electron subsystem adequately, the stationary, spatially inhomogeneous kinetic equation of the electrons was solved to determine the electron velocity distribution function (EVDF). On demand of realistic potential courves between the electrodes and a plasma composition in a pressure range of 1 to ~100 Pa, the EVDF can be determined by means of the developed strict multiterm description which bases on a Legendre polynomial expansion. The essential influcence of the dissipative collision terms on the spatial relaxtion of the EVDF could be shown for oxygen for the first time. In the range of small pressures, a behavior was found which is typical for beam electrons ...
