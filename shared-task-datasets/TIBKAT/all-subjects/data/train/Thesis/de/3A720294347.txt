Grounded in the literary and cultural studies, the dissertation Za Hranetsiuʺ  Beyond the Borderʺ: Constructions of Identities in Ukrainian-Canadian Literature answers the question how identities of different Ukrainian immigrants and their offspring have been constructed, continuously developed and transformed in contemporary Canadian literature. The study simultaneously presents a discussion of postmodern identities, a concise historical survey of Ukrainian immigration to Canada in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and an overall picture of the exceptionally substantial body of Ukrainian-Canadian literature. Detailed literary analyses focus on seven Ukrainian-Canadian works: Sons of the Soil (1939-45/1959) by Illia Kiriak, Yellow Boots (1954) by Vera Lysenko, A Letter to My Son (1981) by George Ryga, The Green Library (1996) by Janice Kulyk Keefer, The Doomed Bridegroom: A Memoir (1998) by Myrna Kostash, Kalyna&rsquo;s Song (2003) by Lisa Grekul, and The Ladies&rsquo; Lending Library (2007) by Janice Kulyk Keefer.
