Sterile supply through reprocessing of medical devices is often outside the focus of hospital managers as a process remote from the patient, even though this area is both medically and economically essential to the quality of the treatment process. The use of different survey techniques, such as document analysis and time measurement, can contribute to a comprehensive overall view and thus support a decision. This paper investigates the different packaging options of sterile supplies in six hospitals in Germany. With the help of an extensive time measurement study, the time differences in both packaging-related processes and infrastructural processes are first clarified. Furthermore, all relevant cost items are determined, resulting in costs for each packaging option. A distribution adjustment is carried out for both the times and the costs and then a Monte Carlo simulation is performed on this basis. In order to test the stability of the results obtained, a detailed scenario analysis is carried out in which a wide variety of input parameters, such as personnel and material costs, but also handling frequencies, are changed to show under which circumstances the advantageousness of an individual packaging option is given. If, for example, a change in packaging options results in free personnel capacities, these can be used to expand the range of services both in-house and for third parties. The work shows that the choice of packaging option is not the only decisive factor, but ...
