Due to the structural-semantic modelling method, developed by V. M. Mokienko, it has become possible to clarify the etymologies of many phraseological units in the various Slavonic and non-Slavonic languages, which are then to be verified on the basis of ethnographic facts. This method has been already proved for a long time in the study of Slavonic phraseology and was used by V. M. Mokienko and H. Walter for their study of German materials in the "Historical-etymological dictionary of the German phraseology". The method is based on considering the lexical variability of phraseological units in their temporal and spatial development. The structural-semantic modelling method helps to clarify the influence of the foreign language, which is very important for inidentifying the source language. Therefore, I use the method in my study for analysing phraseological units with ethno-cultural elements - concepts "Fire", "Earth", "Air" and "Water", in the basic concepts of the Ukrainian culture such as "Nature", "Destiny", "Soul", "Birth" and "Death". The goal of my study is to clarify the similarities and differences in the phraseological systems of Ukrainian, Czech, German and Russian languages. This includes identifying and then historically reconstructing cultural layers, which contributed to the formation of phraseological units, describing their origin and demonstrating their nationally specific or internationally common features in the related languages.
