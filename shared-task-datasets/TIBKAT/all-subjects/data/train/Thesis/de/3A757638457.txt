Dementia is a challenge for many societies, especially in the light of demographic transition processes. This fact requires innovative care strategies. There are some public and academic proposals for dementia interventions, but a health economic study on costs and benefits has been missing, yet. This research paper investigates the economic impact of different intervention scenarios. For this purpose a markov modelling study was conducted that analyses different costs and benefits of interventions taking account of several perspectives (statutory health insurance, statutory care insurance, patients and caregivers) and care settings (home, group living, nursing home). The analyses show that some interventions could be efficient from societal perspective. However, certain interventions lead on to financial transfers between involved payers. The implementation of efficient interventions makes several structural changes in health care financing necessary.
