While psychiatric and psychological research has focused on and appreciated the histories of political prisoners in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), systematic studies of victims of other forms of political persecution are scarce. However, these “mild” forms of repression have been increasingly important since the 1970ies. Taking these considerations into account, we extensively studied 74 individuals subjected to non-criminal repressions in the GDR. By means of psychometric self-reports we assessed their current quality of life, their sense of co-herence, their perceived social Support, their Temperament and character and their interpersonal Problems.
