Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125 (PhTAC125) is a cold-adapted ?-proteobacterium isolated from Antarctic sea ice. It is characterised by remarkably high growth rates at low temperatures and is one of the model organisms for cold-adapted bacteria and enzymes. In addition P. haloplanktis has been suggested as an alternative host for the soluble overproduction of heterologous proteins which tend to form inclusion bodies in established expression hosts. Until now only partial aspects of its physiology and metabolism have been investigated. For this reason one focus of this dissertation was the detailed analysis of proteomic signatures under exponential growth and nutrient starvation conditions. Despite the progress in establishing P. haloplanktis as an alternative expression host, the cell densities obtained with this organism are still low. Therefore the second focus of this work was the development of fed-batch cultivation strategies for this auspicious alternative expression host to reach high biomass concentrations. The analysis of PhTAC125s physiology and metabolism of the exponential growth phase was based on the investigation of the exponential growth on a soy-peptone supplemented artificial seawater medium at 16Ê¿C ...
