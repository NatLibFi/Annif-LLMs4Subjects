Foundations of Automation: Sensorics, Control, Control ¤ Automation is a key concept for the design of industrial processes. Based on an exemplary project installation and its further development, questions of control, regulation, and measurement and drive technology are gradually discussed. With the preceding basics on production processes, a comprehensive and practice-oriented introduction to automation technology is created. This largely dispenses with higher mathematics. It addresses students in vocational training and at universities with an engineering-oriented orientation. In order to also cover university studies, further literature with a stronger formalized approach is required (e.g. Lothar Litz: ID-G 14/13). While great care was taken with the glossary (German/English), tasks, and section-wise directories of abbreviations, individual of the approximately 300 illustrations fall short in quality. Overall, the authors' integrative approach is convincing, making the title a suitable universal introduction for a broad audience, especially if little literature on the subject is offered.

Bought Time : The Postponed Crisis of Democratic Capitalism ¤ The crisis is holding our breath and at the same time creating a diffuse feeling of helplessness. Following the almost insurmountable problem situations are measures that, like emergency operations on the open heart of the Western world, are performed without knowledge of the patient's history. As serious as the situation is, so little do we seem to understand what exactly is happening. And how it came to be. Wolfgang Streeck presents in his Frankfurt Adorno lecture the roots of the current financial, fiscal, and economic crisis by describing it as a moment of the long neoliberal transformation of post-war capitalism, which began in the 1970s. Following the crisis theories of the time, he analyzes how the tension between democracy and capitalism has unfolded over four decades and what conflicts have resulted from this between states, governments, voters, and capital interests. Finally, he illuminates the transformation of the European state system from the tax to the debt to the consolidation state and asks about the prospects for restoring social and economic stability. Bought Time shows that there is something underlying the current situation that should deeply concern us: the transformation of the relationship between democracy and capitalism. Nominated for the shortlist of the Leipzig Book Prize 2013 in the non-fiction category. “For almost five years, the crisis has been sitting at the dinner table: one family has almost nothing to eat, the other has had to severely restrict itself, and only a few people still see the crisis from the TV. We have become accustomed to unimaginable sums with which private individuals are indebted, state budgets are in the red, and banks must be rescued. The crisis is everyday life. How it came to this, about this the sociologist Wolfgang Streeck, born in 1946, has written a furious book. Emerging from three lectures, which the director of the Cologne Max Planck Institute for Social Policy held in Frankfurt in 2012 under the title	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029577-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200586-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011413-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033203-2>
Life in Metaphors : Construction and Use of Language Images ¤ Metaphors are an integral part of our everyday language, not just practical or rhetorical means.

Knowledge Projects : Collaborative Learning from a Didactic, Software-Technical, and Organizational Perspective ¤ In this book, 22 authors from various disciplines describe theoretical and methodological approaches as well as their practical experiences with collaborative learning in networked contexts. The contributions are framed by their intensive collaboration in the WissPro research project - Knowledge Project "Information Systems in Context". They summarize the didactic, software-technical, and organizational design of university studies as a knowledge project. In knowledge projects, it is about the collaborative construction and transmission of knowledge on a specific topic. In this context, the content-based collaboration is constituted by the different experiences, concerns, and perspectives of the participating individuals and shaped by their continuous engagement with relevant technical systems and organizational structures. Against this conceptual background, the book contributions exemplarily discuss different teaching and learning forms in the computer science study at the universities of Hamburg, Lübeck, and Tübingen and address the content-related subfield that deals with the integration of information systems into development or application contexts in particular. A central role is played by the software products from WissPro: the nationwide used cooperation platform CommSy as well as the Lübeck developments KOIN, CI, and Audis. Three content-related focal points structure the book: "Teaching and Learning in Knowledge Projects" deals with the design of cooperative, project-oriented teaching and learning forms with software support. "Software Design for Knowledge Projects" discusses the development of user-friendly platforms for cooperation support and the construction of knowledge archives in project-oriented teaching and learning forms. "Organization of Knowledge Projects" describes the approach to establishing knowledge projects in university teaching as integrated organizational and software development.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025226-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116523-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165245-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026896-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116522-6>
Vom Umgang mit Carl Schmitt : the research dynamics of the last epoch in the review mirror ¤ Carl Schmitt (1888–1985), the pre-eminent jurist on the presidential system in the Weimar Republic and on National Socialism, is today regarded as a global player and master thinker, in the same way as Hegel, Weber or Foucault are, and is therefore the subject of intensive debate all over the world. Moreover, since his death and the cataloguing of his estate, which opened up access to a multitude of primary sources, his image has also changed considerably.Reinhard Mehring has written several books on Schmitt and critically observed the development of the debate surrounding him for thirty years. In this book, Mehring provides profound insight into the rapid dynamism, change and historicity of research on Schmitt using selected reviews, articles and the transcripts of meetings. In doing so, he identifies a trend in research which stretches from the dogmatic analysis of Schmitt’s writings to the editorial indexing of private sources, such as letters and diaries, and finally the recording of this political player’s historical biography.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048821-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076226-9>

The Cartesian Diver : Three Meditations ¤ Behind a grand-scale work with the even larger title "Le Monde", hides the most ambitious project of philosopher René Descartes: In this work, all separate threads of knowledge should converge and form a fabric, so intricately woven, that everything under the sun would be explained. What draws poet Durs Grünbein to this Cartesian universe is not the triumph of sober rationality. The dreamlike quality of this dream project captivates him, the fantastical behind abstract concepts, the speculative flight that Descartes allows himself above his scientific hypotheses, the trail of the experimenter through the thicket of the most sacred mysteries - in short: the image-making, fantasizing with and beyond all method.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053309-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054438-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147364-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045791-6>
Guide to Energy-Efficient Building : to the point: neutral expert information for more energy efficiency ¤ When building new homes or renovating buildings, energy-saving possibilities and the health of the occupants should be the top priority. A variety of similar-sounding terms such as "Natural Building", "Ecological Building", "Healthy Building", "Energy-Efficient Building", "Eco-House", "Low-Energy House" tend to lead to confusion among homeowners. Here, the author (civil engineer, energy consultant) provides clarity in the established series (lastly BA 2/03) with a guide that formulates in a way that is understandable for laypeople, summarizing in an overview how energy-efficient building achieves quality improvement, preservation of value, and comfort. Topics include, among others, physical building foundations, the most important building and insulation materials, where to insulate sensibly what and how much, heat bridges, the myth of the "breathing walls", the different building insulation standards, heating, hot water preparation, thermal solar systems, ventilation and energy saving, the new energy-saving ordinance. With numerous illustrations, graphics, tables, and some example calculations. Relevant for every home buyer or homeowner. (1)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113437-0>
Maya 2008 : 3D Graphics and 3D Animation ; [Modeling, Rendering, Animating ; Textures, Materials, Lighting Effects ; Practice Examples on the CD] ¤ From the house of Autodesk comes the professional 3D visualization and animation software Maya, which is used very strongly in the film and television industry as well as in the creation of graphics for computer games. For the currently current version Maya 2008, the author has rewritten his introductions to the earlier versions Maya 7 (ID 5/06, can expire) and Maya 8/8.5 (ID 22/07, still usable). While the structure of the book is completely the same as that of the predecessor, some changes can be found in the content. The improved integration with Mental Ray's image calculation functions has the strongest impact. The only major new section deals with the use of cameras in Mental Ray. In addition, there are additions in individual chapters. A previously available Personal Learning Edition on CD is only available online (for version 8.5). Example tasks and numerous black-and-white illustrations, whose quality does not always convince, supplement the presentation. Currently the only German-language introduction. In addition to titles on 3ds max and Cinema 4D.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7610951-3>
Baustelle Deutschland : Politics without Party Affiliation ¤ The most renowned party researcher currently presents a comprehensive situation analysis of the German party system in every respect. Based on social science research, he shows how the increasing segmentation of society affects the party landscape. The two people's parties can no longer respond to the differentiations and fraying. Their traditional milieus are breaking away. The parties' bond with citizens is weakening. The drive to the 'middle' prevents new impulses, modern themes, and meaning-making. Parties on the periphery are gaining more popularity, making a multi-party system with new coalition formations likely. This allows for a response to divergences in society. The book offers, in addition to the analysis of all currently relevant parties, a wealth of pithy formulated insights and outlooks. As a political book of special quality: (1)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175047-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075906-4>
Alexander von Humboldt and Globalization : the Mobile of Knowledge ¤ The author, professor of Romance literature studies in Potsdam, is a renowned Humboldt researcher. With this book, he presents the world-renowned naturalist Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859) as a thinking world citizen who connects, as a scientist who combines mobility and science in his work in a genius way and thus has already internalized the idea of globalization in his self-understanding as a researcher. For this image, Ette draws a context in which he shows that one can understand globalization not only as a unique phenomenon of our modern time, but as a longer-lasting process with various "acceleration phases". As further characteristics of Humboldt's thinking and scientific work, the author presents his "intellectual honesty" as well as Humboldt's consideration of errors or failed projects as a productive source of knowledge. A demanding work primarily oriented towards the thinker Humboldt without visual material. Well imaginable alongside Humboldt biographies such as that by T. Richter (BA 7/09).

Market Growth Scenarios for Electric Vehicles: A Look Back and Outlook until 2030 ¤ The dissemination of electric vehicles plays an important role in achieving climate goals in the transport sector and can also contribute to greater energy supply independence. The exploration of their dissemination is therefore still of great relevance. In the framework of a study for the National Platform Electromobility (NPE), market growth scenarios for electric vehicles were developed until 2020 in 2013. Almost ten years later, this working paper compares the former methodology and results with real developments. In addition, methodological innovations are explained and a look at model results for the year 2030 is ventured to examine the new politically set target achievement of 15 million pure electric vehicles and the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets. It shows that many developments were well estimated and that due to low fuel prices, no significant market penetration of electric vehicles could be seen for a long time. With numerous political support measures and EU regulation on fleet limits, Germany was at the end of 2020, however, in the middle of the 2013-established result range. For 2030, target achievement is also largely dependent on the level of fleet limits and ambitious intermediate steps in GHG emission reduction. Only then can 15 million pure electric vehicles be reached in 2030.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037630-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151795-7>
Fire Alarm Systems : Planning, Installation, Operation ¤ Fire protection is an important topic and yet there is little (practical) literature on the subject. The author - an expert in this field (employee in VDE working groups, expert etc.) - summarizes here the most important information: the difficult to overview regulations, standards, regulations etc., guidelines for planning and project planning as well as for the selection of the right devices etc. There were many innovations; a new edition was therefore necessary. It should - as far as possible (since relatively expensive) - be acquired (previous editions may be exchanged), as it not only addresses professionals in planning and project planning (handymen, engineers and those in training) but can also serve the layman who wants to inform himself about the optimal devices for his private house. (2) (LK/W: Weinheimer-Hartmann) The author is a fire protection expert and summarizes here the most important information: regulations, standards, regulations, guidelines for planning and project planning as well as for the selection of the right devices etc. Interesting for both professionals in planning and project planning as well as for laymen.

Nuclear Power – No Thanks! ¤ Documenting and analyzing, the action researcher and grassroots politician W. Sternheim, partly as a participant, deals with the contents, practices, and strategies of the anti-nuclear movement. (Helga Lüdtke) Without the decades-long, persistent anti-nuclear movement, the political nuclear energy exit in 2011, even including the nuclear accidents in Harrisburg, Chernobyl, and Fukushima, is not conceivable - so the action researcher and grassroots politician W. Sternstein. Documenting and analyzing, he deals, partly as a participant, with the contents, practices, and strategies of the activists. Residents of the Kaiserstuhl region can prevent the KKW Wyhl in the mid-1970s through their resistance, the Öko-Institut and the Federation of Environmental Protection Initiatives are founded, the fight continues relentlessly in the north (Brokdorf, Asse II, Gorleben, Wackersdorf).

The Carousel - Deception, Exchange, and Deception: Scenes of a Media Philosophy ¤ The Carousel is a machine in which the exchange parameters of sense and sensibility are tested in the scenic arrangement. From the 19th century, the extraction of scientific-media deception machines from the laboratories of psychophysics becomes part of a psychological festival culture that separates itself from the physically oriented fairground world. Ralf Bohn reads media scenes of the carousel in literature, film, architecture, photography, and painting as illustrations of physical deception, economic exchange, and medial deception. With this, he shows how, through legitimate sites of transgression, the exchange economy is tested beyond morality and on this side of pathological abysses.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4211353-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4712994-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033422-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4433627-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053994-5>
Beautiful New Working World ¤ The dream of full employment is over. In the new reality, the bad news of the labor market are the victory announcements of the stock exchange. Billions in profits are no obstacle to mass layoffs. These facts have fundamental consequences for the state and society. The McKinsey capitalism of Deutsche Bank, Allianz and BenQ-Siemens plunges the economy and society into a crisis of credibility. Even Porsche CEO Wendelin Wiedeking warns: 'This can lead to our entire society becoming unstable.' Anyone who thinks about unemployment today should not get caught up in the old catchphrases of the 'second labor market', 'reducing labor costs' or 'state share'. Even a turbo-growth will not revive the old full employment society. Ulrich Beck asks the pressing questions: How will a meaningful life be possible if one cannot find a job? So: How will democracy be possible beyond the full employment society?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4557997-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041331-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055896-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002805-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058136-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011413-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4425794-6>

Peak Associations of the Voluntary Welfare Sector: An Introduction to Organizational Structures and Fields of Action of German Welfare Associations ¤ Social work in Germany is decisively shaped by the distribution of tasks between public and voluntary welfare. In the course of development, the voluntary welfare sector has enjoyed a conditional precedence in many areas over public (state) welfare and private commercial providers. Triggered by competitive framework conditions and associated regulations at the national and European level, not only the corporatist relationship between associations and the state and the relationships between associations are changing, but also the organizational internal and legal structures of the providers themselves. In this new edition of the introduction, information is provided on the existing and currently changing organizational structures and fields of action of the peak associations of the voluntary welfare sector. Their still existing importance as providers of social services and as employers in an expanding social market are presented equally as the precarious and hardly transparent financing conditions of the voluntary welfare sector. The treatment of lobbyist structures, limited to competition and cooperation relationships, does not only cover current circumstances, but also makes the 'red thread' in the historical development of German welfare clear.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079366-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155290-8>
Transitionen : Fostering children's ability in daycare institutions to cope with changes successfully ¤ Children grow up today in a society that is subject to constant changes. They must adapt to a life that requires a high level of self-confidence, self-assurance, decision-making joy, and flexibility from the individual, and in which it is necessary to successfully cope with many transitions. This applies in particular to the transitions from family to kindergarten and from kindergarten to elementary school. They represent a pedagogical challenge and a previously little satisfying task in the educational process. In this companion book to the Bavarian Education and Training Plan, previous approaches to designing such transitions are critically examined. In addition, it points out on the basis of a new concept ways in which parents, educators, and elementary school teachers can actively design such transitions taking into account the needs of children.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070704-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022349-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4681060-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077587-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030581-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031081-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130244-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030638-0>
Thinking Beyond Borders: An Ethics of Migration ¤ Over two billion people live worldwide in bitter poverty, suffering under hopelessness, hunger, oppression, and war. More than 65 million of them were alone on the run last year, and many people worldwide hope for a better life in Europe or North America. Help is urgently needed – but are open borders the right answer to the suffering in the world? This view has many supporters, but philosopher Julian Nida-Rümelin is convinced: Open borders would not significantly alleviate the suffering, but would even weaken the regions of origin and exacerbate social conflicts in the receiving countries. They are not a solution to the shameful humanitarian scandals of our time. In his new book, Nida-Rümelin develops his own ethics of migration, which bridges the gap between philosophy and politics. His book makes it clear: Political action must be based on the values and norms of humanity. Only then can responsible and future-oriented decisions be made. Just because such decisions in migration policy are complex and dilemmas are unavoidable, we need the sovereignty of states: The political design spaces they offer are indispensable. Whether we succeed in effectively combating global poverty and hopelessness in the source regions will be a test of our humanity. "You don't have to agree with Nida-Rümelin everywhere, you don't have to fight through his philosophical derivations: Some of his theses should make those who preach an unrestricted welcome culture think, regardless of why a person moves from A to B. "Ethische Unrecht" calls it the author, if one only cares about the reception of the refugees, but not about a reform of the world economy. There lies a key to combating injustices and thus the causes of flight... It would be obvious to care for the arrivals. But that would be unfair, because this would mainly help the strong, because only they create migration; the weak in the emigrant countries remain further neglected in need and suffering. The principle of equal treatment demands that the arrivals be treated like the stayers - that is, hardly cared for. But that would mean creating a huge inequality between the natives and the migrants, which is also not in order. Whatever one does, one violates the principle of equal treatment“ (SZ)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4236475-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4198721-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017604-6>
Applied Microbiology : with 69 Tables ¤ This textbook of "Applied Microbiology" by G. Antranikian, Professor of Microbiology at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg and recipient of the German Environmental Prize 2004, compiled for the first time, reveals to us this interdisciplinary and innovative cross-sectional science. Biologists, chemists, engineers, and bioinformaticians inform about their respective research focuses within applied microbiology. The annual growth rate of microbial products, such as chemicals, vitamins, biopolymers, and fuels, is between 10 and 20 percent. Applied microbiology is thus one of the most promising research areas of the 21st century. Highly recommended.

Ernst Neufert - Peter Neufert ¤ Ernst Neufert (1900-1986) and his son Peter Neufert (1925-1999) determined the building in Germany in the 20th century through their numerous designs, which included residential buildings as well as industrial and commercial buildings. In particular, Ernst Neufert's long-term teaching activity at TU Darmstadt and his still valid standard publication Bauentwurfslehre were formative. - Father and son stand with their buildings for modernity and the reconstruction after the Second World War. Ernst Neufert, for example, developed the strictly functionalist Quelle distribution center in Nuremberg. The new technical possibilities of prestressed concrete enabled Peter Neufert to carry out bold form experiments, which clearly distinguish his buildings from those of his father, which emerged in the late 1960s. The book documents the current state of six selected projects of the two architects using large-format photos and highlights the quality and importance of their designs.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>
Speed of migrating bedforms on the sea floor : a review ¤ This report summarizes the results of a literature study on the migration rate of dunes on the sea floor. It shows that especially older studies without fixed markers on the sea floor suffer from positional inaccuracies and are of no significance for further theoretical calculations. In general, the migration speed decreases significantly with height. Sand dunes over 1 m high are largely fixed in place and migrate very slowly (less than 10 cm/day) for questions of sedimentation of small objects. For megaripples up to about 50 cm in height, the assessment can be made that they normally migrate at a rate of up to 50 cm/day, but under certain circumstances they can also move much faster. Notably, there is a clear temporal and spatial variability in the speed of individual megaripples. This question is to be further investigated for models. (AUT)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129066-5>

Based on a broad literature research, organizational theoretical approaches are presented that provide both practitioners and theoretically interested individuals from change management, organizational and personnel development with action-guiding development approaches for organizational work. Starting from the constant change as a stimulus for corporate development, the classical organizational development is then critically discussed as a limited approach to dealing with change. It is not surprising that this is continued with the foundations of the systems-theoretical approach, as this is already a well-established framework for the consulting and intervention work of change processes. For its own corporate development, a strategy of corporate development is presented with the organizational learning approaches. The author has succeeded in giving those who deal with organizational development work and personnel development in organizations with fundamental theoretical foundations, thinking and action approaches. Consultants receive established approaches and models for their own training and further education, management trainers can further develop their material on this basis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125011-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4198012-8>
The World Line : Albert Einstein and Modern Physics ¤ The book is a loosely written and almost formula-free representation of 20th-century physics, with special consideration of Albert Einstein's achievements (1879-1955), where the findings of Einstein's predecessors are also taken into account in this 3rd novel (lastly: "Dragon's Gate", BA 6/07) from the "Dragon and Elf Dust" and finds to an astonishing degree of refreshing and meaningful complexity. The novel ranges between fantasy and a thriller with Victorian charm. Even thanks to the attractive cover, the numerous fans of the author should be easily reached.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4711780-1>
Southern Germany from the Earth's Middle Ages to the Present ¤ Southern Germany belongs to the most diverse landscapes on earth. Hardly any other region offers on such a small area a comparable variety of natural environments: mountain and plateaus landscapes, the massive fault zone of the Upper Rhine Graben and alpine high mountain regions are just as found as landscapes shaped by volcanism, glaciers and meteorite impacts. Southern Germany experienced in the last 140 million years tropical, subtropical and arctic climate phases, whose traces are still recognizable in parts of the landscape today. The authors present the landscape history of southern Germany in a way that is generally understandable for a broad readership. They design a virtual image of southern Germany for each individual time phase. Comparisons - and four-color photos - with modern landscapes outside Europe enable the reader to develop a better understanding of the former appearance of southern Germany. In excursions, interesting regional information is conveyed and also methods on how one arrives at the presented findings. In the present 2nd edition, a detailed look at the future of the southern German landscape is thrown. The elaborately designed non-fiction book, with numerous four-color graphics, detailed block images and illustrative photos, wants to contribute to a better understanding of our current living and economic space. The ecological and economic potential of southern Germany cannot be explained without considering the landscape history.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038793-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034343-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020216-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034348-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020227-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025104-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075273-2>
Design Concept ¤ Foundational series for first-year architecture and civil engineering students, externally reminiscent of study scripts and offering a clear introduction to the subject (most recently in BA 8/07: J. Krebs: CAD; L. Steiger: Wood construction; A. Meistermann: Structural systems). The present title describes the entry point into the creative process of design: the search for an idea at the beginning of a design. Fundamentals of design in the landscape, urban planning, and social context are conveyed, as well as design and building function, shape finding, engagement with material and construction, and general creativity techniques. Typically equipped with small-format black-and-white photos, numerous practical tips, and further literature references. Recommended as an introductory reading for the target group before the standard work by E. Neufert: "Design Theory" (most recently ID 52/05) and the specialist book by C. Gänshirt: "Tools for Ideas" (ID 32/07). A ekz-Folienbindung is recommended. (2) END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004744-1>
Tutorial Analysis 1 and Linear Algebra 1: Mathematics explained and commented by students for students ¤ Each section begins with the definitions of the most important terms, followed by a collection of relevant theorems with proofs. Subsequent explanations with occasional original examples clarify and illuminate the whole. In this way, the text guides the reader through the usual material of a 1st semester in the field of mathematics. After introducing general foundations, proof techniques, and structures, a presentation of analysis follows up to the core statements of differential and integral calculus. The last part on linear algebra begins with the concrete problem of equation systems and leads over the theory of vector spaces to matrices, determinants, and eigenvalues. The authors, familiar with the difficulties of first-semester students in this field, successfully strive for clarity. Occasional somewhat vague formulations, such as the introduction of the indefinite integral as a function, are pardonable. The very helpful book for beginners is largely also suitable for students in a SII performance course. (3 S)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001865-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035811-2>
Mathematics for Natural Scientists: Methods, Applications, Program Codes ¤ Compact mathematics book for students of natural sciences, except physics, which requires a more demanding mathematical instrumentarium. Examples of scientific applications ensure a link to practice. The exercise tasks are also partially oriented towards the application-oriented testing of the learned - occasionally with a pinch of entertainment mathematics, for example, when the shooting chance of a midfielder is to be calculated (solutions are available on a university website of the University of Munich). Numerous calculation examples are accompanied by program codes for the computer algebra system Maple or the free statistics program R (cf. A. Behr: "Introduction to Statistics with R", ID 31/05). The book with the same title by W. Pavel (BA 9/07) deals with analysis and linear algebra in more detail, omits probability calculation and statistics, which are each given a chapter in the present title. Overall, a recommendable, stimulating textbook for active acquisition of the material. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037944-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155620-3>
Grundwissen Beneficial Organisms : Helpers in Modern Plant Protection ¤ In plant protection literature, pests and damage patterns are usually shown. Beneficial organisms are often not recognized as such. In this book, the most important beneficial organisms in the garden are depicted in color illustrations and drawings, their effect on pests and their application possibilities in the framework of biological and integrated plant protection measures are described. The range of illustrations extends from spiders and insects to amphibians, reptiles, birds, and insect-eating mammals. The slim volume is rather unobtrusive in its external appearance. In addition to and after the more attractive and significantly more comprehensive handbook "The Great Kosmos Book of Beneficial Organisms" (s. M. Fortmann, BA 8/00), it can still be recommended for libraries with corresponding demand. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042756-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045586-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041070-5>

Blödmaschines : the Manufacture of Stupidity ¤ Publisher's text: If a society reacts to the widespread discomfort with 'general stupidity' by using cultural pessimistic slogans and conspiracy theories instead of concrete countermeasures, it becomes clear how much it has already established itself in its stupidity, even elevating it to a system. Markus Metz and Georg Seesslen analyze the mechanisms by which stupidity is produced today, as well as the fatal strategies with which most individuals 'cope' with it and thereby strengthen it. Those who do not want to surrender to the dynamics of the 'Blöd-Machines' blind or even more sightlessly, must understand their structures. Only then does the chance arise to shatter them.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165981-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020588-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125858-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136152-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037877-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169187-8>

Handbook of Sociology ¤ What interpretive offers does sociology make for the analysis of societal subject areas? To address this question, the "Handbook of Sociology" provides a unique overview of the most intensively discussed fields of sociology in German, Anglo-American, and French journals: Age - Work - Ethnicity - Family - Gender - Globalization - Individualization - Institution - Class - Communication - Body - Culture - Power - Market - Migration - Nation - Organization - (Post)Modernity - Process - Space - Religion - Sexuality - Technology - Knowledge - Welfare State. For each of these fields, it is explained which theoretical concepts are currently being researched or have been worked on in the past. The authors present competing approaches as well as existing international differences. The "Handbook of Sociology" aims to provide a better understanding of theory through concrete examples. In the compilation of the articles, the systematicity, fruitfulness, and limits of theoretical approaches to various subject areas are made comparable for a broad scientific community, as well as the specifics of sociologically theoretical perspectives are made publicly known in an appropriate language.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077624-4>

Romaniae pontes : Contributions to Language in Gallo- and Iberoromania ¤ The collection includes (language-)scientific contributions of Romance studies from the fields of lexicology and -graphy; philology; semantics, pragmatics and grammar; etymology and loanwords. In these thematic complexes, Jutta Langenbacher-Liebgott has established herself through her research and work at the University of Paderborn in the international Romance community. Furthermore, researchers from other fields, such as law and politics, work in an interdisciplinary section to highlight the connection to language. This festschrift was published on the occasion of Professor Dr. Jutta Langenbacher-Liebgott's retirement and in honor of her by her long-time scientific colleagues, Anna-Susan Franke and Dr. Vicente Álvarez Vives, as a sign of gratitude and respect.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115788-6>
Communication, Leadership and Collaboration in Companies: True Situations and Practical Solutions ¤ Through engaging stories from the corporate daily life, you learn something about communication, leadership and collaboration: Georg Schwinning, experienced manager and coach, uses storytelling to solve communication problems at work with expertise and humor. Many problems with colleagues and superiors can be solved through communication. The author explains with a pinch of humor how you can motivate employees, defuse conflicts and master difficult conversations. He tells pointed stories that remain in memory through storytelling and show how successful communication, leadership and collaboration work. Lighthearted stories from the job daily life provide you with tips for leadership practice.(Publisher's text)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061963-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027061-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018776-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031883-7>
The Myth of the Spoiled Child : Exposing Parenting Lies ¤ The well-known American parenting expert attempts to tackle traditional, reactionary parenting methods, such as "Helicopter Parenting" or "The Praise of Discipline". In a previous title, he also advocated for a parenting approach without rewards and punishments (cf. A. Kohn: "Love and Independence", ID-A 7/11). The often referred to as "Parenting Rebel" author accuses his guidebook colleagues of a distorted and unscientific representation of corresponding research results. Using many quotes from scientific contributions and literature references, he takes so-called parenting myths to task and presents a "Parenting for Gentle Rebellion" in the final chapter.

Human-Computer Interaction : Basic Knowledge for Developers and Designers ¤ The book reminds one of a computer science lecture, as exciting as one expects from such a thing: not very entertaining. The topic is very correctly represented in its entirety, including consideration of relevant DIN standards. It's about: software ergonomics, human information processing, hardware, dialogue design, human-centered system development, etc. Designers and developers get a very solid - theoretical - foundation, how a website, a program must be designed so that it does not cause irritation in communication with humans. Important topic, relevant for many, comprehensive correct representation, catchy appearance - but stylistically unfortunately a bit dry.

The Woman of My Father: Memories of Ulrike ¤ The life story of the daughter (born 1955) of the Konkret publisher Röhl from his first marriage. It describes a cold childhood and, quite differently, the acceptance by Ulrike Meinhof, the new wife of the father. This memory defines the personal image of the author of Ulrike Meinhof. (Harald Pilzer) The narrative attitude suggests distance. Anja Röhl (born 1955), daughter of the Konkret publisher K.-R. Röhl (BA 324,59, ID 42/94, BA 3/09) from his first marriage, consistently describes herself in the third person as a child, girl, and young woman. It is a cold childhood in the stagnation of the 1950s and 1960s, marked by intrusions and family violence. At some point, then the 'Papitag', always new partners of the separated parents, and at some point in the early 1960s, the pregnant Ulrike Meinhof as the new wife of the father, whose twins and thus the longed-for (half-)siblings for Anja. She comes to life, feels accepted by Ulrike. 1968 again the divorce and from then on only distant contacts with the radicalizing Ulrike Meinhof. The book is, in a certain sense, a political issue, as the half-sisters (B. Röhl: BA 6/06) have insisted on their non-mention. The text passages now appear censored. A very personal representation alongside the biographies of M. Krebs (BA 8/88), A. Prinz (BA 6/03), A. Ditfurth (BA 2/08) and S. Hakemi (BA 4/10).

Methods of Form Finding ¤ Foundational series for first-year architecture and civil engineering students, which externally resembles study scripts and provides a clear introduction to the topic (most recently in BA 8/07: J. Krebs: CAD; L. Steiger: Timber Construction; A. Meistermann: Structural Systems). Building on "Basics Design Idea" (B. Bielefeld in this issue), the present volume presents architectural design methods and well-known concepts using exemplary buildings, such as biomorphic architecture, mathematical procedures, rational approaches, computer algorithms, regionalism, etc. Typically equipped with small-format black-and-white photos, drawings, and further literature references. Together with "Basics Design Idea", J. Krebs: "Basics Designing and Living" (BA 4/07) and M. Hegger "Basics Materiality" (BA 4/07), a generally understandable first introduction to the complex of topics "Building, Architecture, and Designing". A ekz-Folio binding is recommended.

Women in the GDR ¤ How did women live in the GDR? In retrospect, they often appear like 'seven-armed goddesses' who apparently managed to bring work, motherhood, and emancipation under one hat and go through life happily. Many paths were open to them, so the official interpretation, the state provided exemplary care for 'its women'. Women in the GDR were, however, simultaneously torn between all their roles - like the heroines in the stories of Brigitte Reimann or Maxie Wander, who rebelled against the boundaries set for them and often failed. Anna Kaminsky takes a comprehensive look at the situation of women in the GDR, including political, professional, and private life. Photographs by Barbara Köppe, Uwe Gerig, Klaus Mehner, and Harald Schmitt, as well as biographical portraits, shed light on the diversity of female life plans. 'As a conclusion, it can be noted that women in the GDR can serve as an introductory reading for interested laypeople, but do not provide the necessary critical reflection for scientific or more in-depth engagement. One can only hope that Kaminsky at least succeeds in making open questions in the history of women in the GDR known, so that they can be dealt with more thoroughly in the future' (literaturkritik.de). 'The equal rights of men and women in the GDR are no more than a myth. This conclusion is reached by Berlin publisher Anna Kaminsky in her book	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077575-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018202-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071776-8>
Conversations with His Students ¤ The conversations of Shri Ramakrishna contain the fundamental ideas of Neo-Hinduism, to which millions of believers confess far beyond the Asian region. Ramakrishna conveys his convictions in a non-doctrinal and unpretentious way. Serenity and cheerfulness radiate from the conversations, in which the students and friends are led to self-being. In his last decade of life, he conveyed to his closer circle of students in daily spiritual conversations a transcending love of God (bhakti) that transcends the boundaries of the caste system, social classes, and religious communities. Ramakrishna's conversational style is simple, sometimes rough, yet of great imagery and immediacy; he taught in stories and parables. With his concise and clear language, Ramakrishna interprets the wisdom of Hinduism for the modern man anew and also gives the Western reader the opportunity to participate directly in the life experiences of an enlightened, modern Hinduism.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4024955-4>
Foundations of Electrical Engineering : the tried and tested textbook for students of electrical engineering and other technical courses from semester 1 ; with 4 tables, tasks and solutions ¤ Publisher's text: The present book introduces the student to the most important foundations of electrical engineering. The areas of direct current technology, electrical and magnetic fields, and alternating current technology are presented in a connected and clear manner in one volume. The explanations begin with the treatment of direct current circuits and lead to the methods of network calculation. This is followed by the description of the electrical and magnetic field. In the second part, the various areas of alternating current technology are treated	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113415-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014390-9>
Better coding ¤ The author deals with the creation of program code and gives advice in a humorous way, supported by many examples and anecdotes, on how an effective and modern program code can be created. This topic is also treated by V. Vernon and U. Probst, among others, in a very objective form and for readers with significant prior knowledge. The chapter headings, such as "Prevent the Apocalypse" or the word choice "Trash Software", already reveal the presentation style of the book. However, the book should be taken seriously. 12 chapters with code examples in Java and C also make it clear to the beginner programmer what is important for a good effective program code, and that cooperation and experience exchange in the team are very important. Emphasis is placed, among other things, on testing, OOP paradigms, design patterns, system security, and the renewal of completely outdated software. Furthermore, the quiz questions in the appendix (with solutions) are also continued.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4616843-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4401313-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116522-6>
GEW Handbook Promoting with Perspective: A Guide by and for Doctoral Candidates ¤ The guide published by GEW for doctoral candidates provides information around the promotion. Planning, financing and legal framework conditions, the promotion process, key qualifications, internationalization, publication of the dissertation as well as career prospects are the topics dealt with. In addition to practical and theoretical assistance, university political developments are also addressed, which can influence the promotion possibilities. The authors want to motivate students to a promotion with their comprehensive handbook, provide them with practical assistance and support them in their universities to use improved conditions for doctoral candidates. From a universal approach as, for example: Helga Knigge-Illner: "The Way to a Doctor's Title" (BA 7/02), Barbara Messing and Klaus-Peter Huber: "The Doctoral Thesis: From Start to Goal" (BA 2/03) or Randi Gunzenhäuser and Erika Haas: "Promoting with Plan" (BA 6/00).

Cryptography for Dummies ¤ Cryptography plays an important role in the communication of today's IoT world for the security of data traffic. The didactically well-structured book is aimed at a readership where no greater prior knowledge is assumed, but is interested in the transmission of messages that can only be read by the authorized addressee. It is a good supplement to the comprehensive handbook by K. Schmeh or to Th. St. Denis, who addresses IT specialists with significant prior knowledge in the areas of data security and data protection. Mathematical foundations are conveyed only to the extent necessary using examples. The chapters begin with a brief summary of the content and end with exercise tasks (with solutions in the appendix). A focus lies on randomness and the need to apply it in cryptography. Various attack methods and defense procedures are also well considered. Many illustrations and a helpful directory of further literature.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033329-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011144-1>

Leisure-Oriented Spatial Planning in Practice : Contributions from Hesse, Rhineland-Palatinate, and Saarland ¤ Tourism and leisure represent a complex field of responsibilities, spatial delimitations, conceptual approaches, and programs in planning practice. The working group "Leisure" of the Landesarbeitsgemeinschaft Hessen / Rhineland-Palatinate / Saarland of the ARL has illuminated for the three countries as representative as possible questions and important intersections of "non-specialized planning" leisure and spatial planning. In this process, the structure of leisure planning is presented and fundamental problems and deficits in the planning coordination are addressed.

Time for Change : How I Explain the Economy to My Daughter ¤ Refreshing contrarian - or the undertaker of the Euro? Yanis Varoufakis, former Finance Minister of Greece, represents theses that are as controversially discussed as his outfit. In casual appearances, he explains the world, speaks clearly, where others only produce buzzwords. Many people are touched sympathetically, others see him as the embodiment. Who is he really, what drives him? Varoufakis is a master at connecting economic questions with the history of colonization, with the Matrix films and current references. His book wants to spark interest in economics and passionately takes a position for humanity and against an economy of oppression. (Publisher's text)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1>
Renovation with Existing Stock: Sustainable Adaptation Strategies for Buildings, Spaces, and Structures ¤ The adaptation of existing structures has gained significant importance in recent years compared to new construction and expansion of floor space.

The effects of demographic, economic, social and societal change, ecological challenges from climate protection to resource management, and finally the civic anchoring of concepts and projects are particularly significant here.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4700381-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>
The Question of God: Philosophical Considerations ¤ The emeritus Professor of Philosophical Anthropology at the Gesamthochschule Essen (last ID 47/90) presents here his considerations on philosophical theology. The philosophical question of God, which runs through the whole history of thought, still offers, according to Scherer, a valid answer to the existential question of the origin and meaning of life today. A post-metaphysical era cannot exist, because man is naturally endowed with a metaphysical germ within himself, necessarily relying on meaning (God) in his thinking and acting, and as a finite being "open to the whole of reality". Notes and Name Register. These considerations on a fundamental and still current question of humanity can be submitted as a subjective contribution to discussion in addition to an objective history of philosophical theology, such as that of W. Weischedel ("The God of the Philosophers", ID 41/79). (3) (Dieter Altmeyer)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131943-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045791-6>
The Berlin S-Bahn : 1924 to today ; History, Technology, Backgrounds ¤ With a brief historical overview, a photo series with images of various locomotives and a press review of the beginning of the S-Bahn era, the author starts his book about the means of transportation that is inextricably linked to the history of the city. He proves this in 8 chapters, each covering a decade. So the beginnings of the S-Bahn era can be just as well understood as its heyday in the 30s. Kiebert describes the destruction of vehicles and infrastructure in the 2nd World War, the situation in the so-called 'Cold War', the cuts during the construction of the wall, the development of the separated networks, the boycott of West-Berlin, the railway workers' strike, the changes in ownership as well as expansion and modernization after reunification. Each chapter ends with a summary of the most important events. Track diagrams, network plans, historical documents, tables, many photos and drawings as well as an overview of the vehicles complement the book, which should not only be offered in Berlin and Brandenburg.

The author (here last BA 2/10) of the present volume is already familiar to us through his successful books on everyday chemistry, in which he describes experiments with supermarket products, in castles, museums or the home kitchen. To understand this book, basic knowledge of chemistry is sufficient. If even these are somewhat forgotten, there is an introduction to the basics in the 1st part. The emphasis here is on the substances and their properties that are familiar to us from everyday life. Similar to the shelves of supermarkets, the following parts are organized: food, cosmetics and household. Numerous historical illustrations from more than 150 years of product advertising loosen up the excellently executed, very informative book optically as well. Highly recommended for students, teachers and interested laypeople. (1 S) (Beate Hörning) Popular scientific introduction to everyday chemistry for students, teachers and interested laypeople.

The Box of Pandora : History of the First World War ¤ Jörn Leonhard's synthesis shows how the world went into the war and how it came out of it as a completely different one. It not only looks at the states and nations, but also the empires in Europe and far beyond. It describes the dynamic change of the action spaces, the rapid military developments, and the ever faster changes of the war societies. And it brings the experiences of completely different contemporaries to life again: from military personnel, politicians, and writers, men and women, soldiers, and workers. But the experiences of violence of the world war did not end with the peace treaties of 1918, but continued in Europe and the whole world in the name of new order conceptions and radical ideologies - as if the box of Pandora had been opened at that time. "Is the book an overburden? Does it simply offer too much? No! Only towards the end does a feeling creep in - punctually - that it might have gone a bit tighter. But overall, 'The Box of Pandora' is a precious main gain - provided one remains concentrated" (deutschlandradiokultur.de)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079163-4>

The influence of large offshore wind farms on the North Sea and Baltic Sea - a comprehensive literature review ¤ This literature review summarizes research on the environmental impacts of offshore wind farms, identifies gaps in current knowledge related to offshore wind energy, and makes recommendations for future research. The offshore wind energy industry in Europe is expected to grow rapidly: in the European Union, 69 wind farms in 11 countries have a combined capacity greater than 6.5 gigawatts (GW), and some projections predict a capacity of 40 GW by the year 2020. Despite expectations for the construction of large-scale offshore wind farms, little research has studied the effects of offshore wind farms on oceanography. Most research has focused on biotic effects including noise, bird collisions, mammalian avoidance, and the artificial reef effect. The following review will hypothesize the largest potential wind farm-induced impacts to oceanography and consequences that could result from changes to oceanography. Oceanographic processes that could be affected by offshore wind farms are downstream turbulence, surface wave energy, local scour, inflowing currents, and surface upwelling. Existing research predicts that most wind farm-induced changes will be within the wind farm footprint or within natural variations. Some studies hypothesize that “extreme” scenarios could cause irreversible changes to shoreline deposition, upwelling patterns, or bottom oxygen levels, but this review found no research that quantified these changes with confidence. Potential connections exist between offshore wind farms, the alteration of oceanographic processes and changes to local sediment, nutrient, or phytoplankton regimes, but these connections have not been studied and are only speculative. Current numerical modeling research does little to predict the effects of large-scale construction, potential cumulative effects of multiple farms, or far-field effects at the coast. This review therefore recommends that future numerical models focus on wind farms with hundreds of turbines, the interactions of multiple wind farms, and downstream changes due to wind farms. Observational studies are also necessary to validate the models, and extensive site-specific data collection is necessary to compare any changes to the natural ocean state. The conclusions and recommendations from this review will be used to inform research related to the Coastal Observation System for Northern and Arctic Seas (COSYNA) at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht, which uses data from a marine observation network in the North Sea to validate and improve coastal modeling results. One core question that COSYNA seeks to address is how the offshore wind farms will locally and remotely affect the physical dynamics, sediment transport, and biological processes in the North Sea. The gaps in research and potentially relevant offshore wind farm impacts as identified by this review will guide future COSYNA projects including data collection, model development, and research cruise campaigns.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124348-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4543294-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125537-9>
Primary School is Evolving ¤ The school reforms implemented in many federal states also affect primary schools, which are subject to two visible changes in the process. On the one hand, primary schools are becoming increasingly common as full-day schools, which is intended to reduce social disparities in the first school years. On the other hand, there is a flexibilization of the school start phase, which is intended to allow children individual learning times. However, it is not yet sufficiently known which processes are triggered within the schools by these measures and which effects result from the changes in the structures. While studies such as PISA and IGLU describe the state of the education system at a certain point in time, they are not able to describe the change processes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022349-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115716-3>

Glossary of industrial organisation economics and competition law ¤ The OECD created a department in 1990 to strengthen cooperation between the OECD and Eastern European countries. Its main task is to implement a programme of consultation, technical assistance and training within the framework of economic reforms. In the course of implementing cooperation, it has been found that there are often conceptual and linguistic barriers that hinder mutual understanding. The OECD therefore presents a commented dictionary of important terms from the economic specialist language, which is intended to facilitate cooperation linguistically and professionally.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133311-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7>

10 Things You Want to Know About Gravitational Waves: From Weakest Signals to Strongest Events ¤ 1915, A. Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves within the general theory of relativity. They were eventually discovered exactly 100 years later. In 10 chapters, the author explains the cosmic sources, effects, and detection methods of gravitational waves in an easily understandable way. The detection was made possible by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). The associated laser interferometers have a length of 4 kilometers and are far apart. Because gravity is the weakest of all natural forces, it takes events where extremely large amounts of energy are released, such as the collision of 2 black holes, to detect gravitational waves. The text includes interviews with experts who provide insight into their current research. Enhanced by a glossary, literature references, and a subject index, the recommended work is already understandable for students.

Amazon : the book as prey ¤ Although the online retailer Amazon has not even existed for 20 years, it has already revolutionized the shopping habits of people. Customers appreciate its affordable and almost complete product range, independent product reviews from other buyers, and uncomplicated return options. And since the company usually promises delivery by the next working day, many prefer the convenient mouse click to the stressful shopping experience. However, the appearance of the beautiful new world of goods deceives. Behind the facade of Amazon's online shop, a world of precarious working conditions is hidden. The low price for comfortable online shopping is paid by those who are responsible for logistics and shipping of goods. A lot has been published about Amazon in recent times. The present paperback is a good, perhaps necessary supplement to B. Stone: "All Sellers" (ID-A 48/13), R. Brandt: "A Click" (ID-B 31/13), C. Knop: "Amazon knows you already" (ID-B 31/13). Leisegang is editor of the renowned "Blätter für deutsche und internationale Politik", his book appears in a small, left-wing publishing house. The author demands clearly: "Amazon must be stopped and limited in its scope", so that books and book trade can survive. Critically, he comments in small chapters on the precarious working conditions of employees, Amazon's data collection frenzy, the misuse of subsidies, and the exploitation of tax loopholes. Leisegang thoroughly documents his sources. A timeline, graphics, and tables round off the volume.

The First 100 Years of Christianity 30-130 AD: The Emergence of a World Religion ¤ Chronologically progressing depiction of the historical development of early Christianity, which begins as an inner-Jewish renewal movement after the death of Jesus in the year 30 and ends 100 years later with the establishment as an independent religion with fixed structures. After introductory chapters on the sources, the demarcation of the era, and the contexts, the New Testament scholar Schnelle, who teaches at the University of Halle, sketches this development from the Easter events onwards through the missionary efforts and the apostolic council to the formation of communities and the appointment of bishops and presbyters. In gray highlighted boxes, the topics dealt with in each section are briefly indicated, and at the end of each chapter, their content is summarized again.

Psychoanalysis after Freud: A Practical Orientation ¤ A particularly clear introduction to the fundamentals of Freud's psychoanalysis. After a historical overview of how Breuer and Freud sought a causal-explanatory treatment that attacked the causes of neurosis itself and learned from their mistakes, Schmidbauer describes the functioning of central concepts (free association technique, resistance, transference, evenly suspended attention, abstinence rule, interpretation), omitting, for example, the particularly controversial Oedipus complex. Using concise cases from practice, he explains how these ambiguous and misunderstood rules developed from Freud's work and what role they play in today's therapy. An illustrative analysis that takes Freud's side and only mentions the criticism of other schools on the periphery. Recommended as a fundamental introduction to the essentials for aspiring therapists, students, and interested parties.

The Ancient World and the Sea ¤ Ancient culture was a coastal culture and has always been shaped by the struggle with the sea. Maritime trade enabled the spread of urban civilization. War at sea helped the Athenian democracy to break through. The conquest of the sea was a prerequisite for the emergence of the Roman Empire, enabled the unification of Greek-Roman civilization and the spread of Christianity. The search for fame and wealth eventually motivated Mediterranean sailors to venture into the oceans and consider a journey to India over 1000 years before Columbus. Raimund Schulz describes the driving forces that drove the Greeks and Romans to the sea again and again, and dispels numerous legends and prejudices such as that of the alleged sea hostility of the Romans. He describes the essential stages of the 'conquest' of the sea and takes into account the world of adventurers, mercenaries, and outsiders who were at home on the sea. For the first time, the effects of maritime expansion on the mentality, culture, philosophy, and economy of Greek and Roman civilization are thoroughly analyzed. Only then does the ancient world become understandable as a crucial and still effective part of the European-Atlantic world.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054184-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068754-5>

Shadows of Play - Technology Shapes Everyday Life ¤ The use of technology was until the widespread dissemination of information and communication technologies associated with the idea of a purposeful use of means. This has changed with the use of computer technology. More often, personal, social, aesthetic, and playful dimensions come to the forefront. The use of modern gadgets (smartphone, PC-tablet & Co.) with their versatile possibilities is of a playful nature and conceals efforts and time expenditure. Modern technology use appears to be self-determined. In increasing numbers, members of society make temporal, financial, and social expenditures to be constantly reachable and ready for action.

Jormakka, H. Klein et al. most recently). The present title deals with the constructive and stylistic design of windows as central openings in facade design. The various requirements (protection function, air and light permeability, interface in energy-saving planning), construction basics, as well as the different components, types, materials, and the constructive connection to the wall surfaces are conveyed. Typically equipped with small-format black-and-white photos, numerous construction drawings, practical tips, hints, and further literature references. For the target group, a recommended supplement to the more expensive example collection by U. Baus: "Openings" (ID 41/06). (3)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016740-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061159-0>
Philosophers : the Great Thinkers from Antiquity to the Present ¤ This licensed edition brings an unaltered reprint of the last volume in the Gerstenberg series '50 Classics' on the history of Western philosophy (cf. BA 5/10). D. Altmeyer noted for the first edition (BA 2/02): '[...] a volume with portraits of outstanding thinkers in the history of philosophy from the beginnings to the present day. In chronological order, the philosophers from Thales of Milet to Jürgen Habermas are presented with their central thoughts on 5-6 pages in a generally understandable and entertaining way. [...] An informative and extremely appealing philosophy history [...]'. In terms of level, it is clearly below that of O. Höffe's edited 'Classics of Philosophy' (last 2008). A qualitatively competitive rival would also be 'The Philosophy Book' (ID-A 41/11). With slightly reduced equipment, the licensed exploitation convinces with good paper and print, above all with unbeatable price, which invites to replace the still widely used volume here in Neumünster.

The Tractor Technology History: Glühkopf, All-Wheel Drive and Electronic Brain ¤ No historically oriented type study, but an overview of the technical development of the tractor from precursor models (locomobiles, etc.) to automatic driving systems. The author, known through several relevant publications (cf. A. Mößmer: ID 50/06, ID 26/08, BA 2/09), offers entertaining and understandable text descriptions that are relieved by numerous photos, instructive detail drawings, and interspersed technical data. It includes economic and type-related aspects. It places the content focus on technical development. Unfortunately, it lacks a subject index. It is less thorough than "Aschendorff's Tractor Book" (BA 9/01), but more up-to-date and affordable in price. Despite minor weaknesses, it is widely usable.

Founded Belief : Thoughts for Skeptics and Believers ¤ Teacher Lange, sets out to argue with critical questions about the Christian faith: Are there rational reasons for God, what do we know about the life and death of Jesus, is resurrection possible, why does God allow suffering? Lange, who likely comes from the evangelical corner, argues in a factual and theologically conservative manner, addresses critical questions in an argumentative way, without being obsequious, so that skeptics can find themselves again. Of course, he harmonizes some theological statements that are disputed in theology, but he has a clear line and one does not have to follow all the problems of modern theology. The affordable paperback is understandable, concise, and informative for skeptics and believers written from an evangelical perspective.

PHP 7 and MySQL : the comprehensive handbook ¤ The well-known author duo has updated and revised their comprehensive handbook on designing dynamic websites with PHP and MySQL. At the beginning are the necessary installation steps, followed by a detailed presentation of the language basics. Numerous code examples complement the explanations. Practical application examples follow in the 3rd step. The inserted black-and-white images come mainly from Windows platforms, but the content can also be used for Linux and Mac systems. This output deals with the thoroughly modernized main version 7, which brings along 64-bit support as well as some new features. For this, chapters have been expanded, e.g. on JavaScript (consideration of WebSockets) and on MySQL (supplemented with advanced features such as BLOBs). Completely new is the chapter on using the package and dependency manager Composer. Statements on the PHP extension library PEAR have fallen away.

The Return of the State? : After the Financial Crisis ¤ State interventions and programs have gained new significance through the economic and financial crisis. But does the state only play the rescuer of the crisis perpetrators or does a real historical chance for social progress open up? "The financial market, the corresponding dominant capital fraction and their interests did not arise as a result of too much state or deregulation, but were promoted by a variety of state decisions, deregulations and regulations. The financial crisis is the result of a long-term dynamics in the antagonistic relationship of social classes." (Alex Demirovic) With the financial crisis, the erosion of a market-driven capitalism, which has shaped international politics over the past two decades, was perhaps prematurely predicted. But does a Renaissance of the state as a political and economic actor actually follow the commonly neoliberal sketched period of capitalism? Or is the current crisis rather an expression of an intra-capitalist structural break, in which we do not experience the 'return of the state', but a reorganization of the relationships between politics, state, and economy? The contributions in this volume analyze the dimensions of the current transformation processes of stateness from an economic and social science perspective and direct their gaze at a possible role of the state after the financial crisis. But it is also asked, what emancipatory requirements should be set for state action, if it is about creating a community based on fundamental democratic and social rights.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7635855-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056618-3>

Dichterbilder : from Walther von der Vogelweide to Elfriede Jelinek ¤ Note International Hölderlin Bibliography: p. 52f.: Clauss, Elke-Maria: Friedrich Hölderlin : Rudolf Lohbauer and Johann Georg Schreiner The 90 poet portraits compiled here are not conceived as an author lexicon, like the excellent "Metzler Authors Lexicon" (2nd ed.: BA 10/94), but as a lavish image-text volume that casts a very unusual, but also very vivid, glance into German literary history. The authors are mostly presented through a striking painting, increasingly also through photographs in the 20th century. The images are accompanied by these elucidating image interpretations, connected with brief, lively, and very pointed information about the authors portrayed. The beautifully made and engagingly readable volume can be offered in smaller libraries with good budget allocation.

In Love, Engaged, Married: A History of Marriage Since Romanticism ¤ The catchy title suggests something entertaining about the precarious state of marriage today, but the subtitle tempers this perspective with a more instructive tone. Historian Wienfort follows a factually and source-historically profound history and transformations of marriage as a legal institution and form of existence since the emergence of love marriage in the late 18th century to the present. Starting from the thesis that marriage has developed here "in a process of individualization into a pure love question" has, "where it is about the dichotomy of freedom gain and dependence", the change is documented in a multifaceted way: in addition to legal regulations, also in terms of its everyday forms of appearance - from the search for a partner to widowhood, from the marriage proposal over the wedding party to the mother-in-law, from the white wedding dress to the honeymoon. To "throw butter to the fish", 5 famous example couples from Caroline and Wilhelm von Humboldt to Katia and Thomas Mann stand pars pro toto. - After H. Schenk (BA 3/88) and alongside J.

Germany in the Middle Ages: Economy - Society - Environment ¤ Bernd Fuhrmann's comprehensive representation of Germany in the Middle Ages and Early Modern Period systematically combines economic and social history with environmental history, which is more important than ever today. Their impact on the economy and social development is of great importance. The influence of the climate, for example, on grain harvests and wine harvests affected the nutrition situation of parts of the population. The corresponding impact was found in the decline of nearby forests. The burdens of mining were also known at least by the 15th century. Developments in the agricultural sector, trade, crafts, urban development, and social structures are addressed in the chronologically structured main chapters. They can be compared for the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055898-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1>

Rathbone was also responsible for numerous predecessor versions (most recently Windows 8.1, ID-A 13/14; Windows 8, ID-A 4/13). The design and content preparation offer the familiar picture. The 21 chapters contain all the knowledge for the beginner or switcher. Apart from the bracketed installation questions, traditional topics (Desktop, window techniques) are treated equally, as well as the handling of apps and the use of social contacts. The topic of security falls rather briefly, on the other hand, multimedia (music, photos, films) receives sufficient attention. This also applies to the treatment of problems and error messages. Overall, a more text-oriented representation with some colored screenshots and hint pictograms. In addition to the aforementioned issues, it is well suited. I. Baumeister (ID-A 39/15) and I.

A future-proof, sustainable land management must take account of these developments. It must reorient itself and design its goals and measures in such a way that it can respond flexibly to changing framework conditions. In the joint project „NaLaMa-nT“, the conditions were analyzed for the Northern Lowlands in the model regions of Diepholz, Uelzen, Fläming and Oder-Spree, and model-based developments were assessed, adaptation needs in agriculture, forestry and water management were shown, and transsectoral criteria and indicators of sustainable land management were identified. The results provide decision-making aids to balance potential conflicts of interest and initiate adaptation measures and a transsectoral sustainability monitoring. They create reliable bases for spatial planning and decisions in companies, administrations, and politics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064821-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4007394-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4259046-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048590-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017966-7>
Constructive learning : Projects and scenarios for experiential seminars and workshops ¤ It's about learning that involves all senses, that 'transmits immediate and direct concrete experiences, that touches, puts people and things in motion.' Doesn't quite fit into the recession phase of German companies... Or just the opposite? A book against the trend. An interesting book. Education letter "A very recommendable methods textbook with high practical value for all who conduct seminars and workshops themselves. (...) So the present book becomes a treasure chest for every trainer. The book is distinguished not only by its practicality, but also by its clear concept." Environmental Education Network "The book is designed as a methods textbook, so it is very carefully and extensively built up. (...) In a cookbook, the recipes are also very precisely described, the result is then - hopefully - somewhat predictable. In this book, the precise project instructions lead to a fascinating, creative openness. Even if one already has good cookbooks at home, another one can certainly be inspiring. So this book can also sensibly expand the repertoire of a consulting person." Martin Fulda, BSO Bulletin "A useful book for trainers, teachers, and further education professionals." Süddeutsche Zeitung 2000 "It's about learning that involves all senses, that 'transmits immediate and direct concrete experiences, that touches, puts people and things in motion.' Doesn't quite fit into the recession phase of German companies... Or just the opposite? A book against the trend. An interesting book.(...)

How Our Brain Creates the World ¤ Our brain constructs a world in the head based on often incomplete information and sensory impressions, which does not always provide a true picture of the world. The world is often merely a fanciful construct of our brain, claims Frith. His thesis is proven by the British scientist with international reputation with numerous experimental results from cognitive research and neuroscience. He strives for simple explanations and numerous graphics also help well with understanding, yet the book is by no means easy to read. For an academic audience with a keen interest in the subject; in addition to the very well understandable introductions to the findings of neuroscience by Michael Madeja (BA 5/10), Hans Günter Gassen (BA 6/08) and Matthew MacDonald (BA 2/09).

Computer Science Exam Trainer : 500 Questions and Answers for the Bachelor's Degree ¤ Exam trainers from the Spektrum publishing house have often been discussed (e.g. R. Busam: ID 14/08 - Analysis; C. Turtur: ID 8/08 and ID 23/03 - Mathematics). The present book addresses students of computer science at universities of applied sciences and universities who want to prepare specifically for the bachelor's examination. It is assumed that (acquired in the course of study) basic knowledge is available. Facts are worked out that are important for the examination according to experience. In the foreground are questions on applications, but also the basic understanding of important concepts is not neglected. The facts are conveyed in the question-answer style. The very detailed answers often bring short examples and references to further literature. The book is divided into 3 large sections: theoretical computer science, practical computer science, and technical computer science. Emphasis is placed on formal languages and automata theory, algorithms, and circuits/circuit works. Recommended especially for university libraries. Replaces no textbook, but can also support self-study well. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4721473-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047609-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058216-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026894-9>
The Sketchnote Handbook : the illustrated guide to creating visual notes ¤ Sketchnotes, composed of the two words "sketch" (English: sketch) and "note" (English: note) are notes that consist of images, texts, and structures. In particular, when it comes to images, it's not about creating refined drawings, but rather sketch-like representations that resemble a draft. With sketchnotes, you can visualize matters, develop thoughts and concepts, and unlock themes. They can also be used in addition to protocol management during lectures and courses. Sketchnotes can be created conventionally with pen and paper, but also digitally using corresponding apps. In digital form, they are often communicated and shared via social media channels. American designer and "Sketchnote Guru" Mike Rohde describes what sketchnotes are, what they can be used for, and above all, how to create them. In addition, he presents various types, as well as skills and techniques for creating sketchnotes.

Upgrade : new living space through extension and renovation ¤ Extension, renovation, demolition. Upgrade breathes new life into old houses, barns, or mountain huts. Upgrade explores how architects and designers skillfully transform our living spaces from small changes to complete renovation processes. Whether it's a converted attic floor, an old factory building that is converted into a modern office and cozy home for a family, or new wooden facades that stand in surprising contrast to old brick walls; Upgrade tells impressive projects and invites you to consider old building substance from a new perspective. A dilapidated barn, a run-down city house, a half-destroyed historical building facade - all this can be the foundation for extraordinary and inspiring architecture. This compendium shows how an old shed becomes a new children's room, how a garage becomes a guest house or an Alpine hut becomes a modern holiday home. And even with a smaller budget, you can create new and desirable things from old walls. The projects in this book demonstrate how existing buildings and materials can be completely reinvented with a little creativity and how modern can be connected with old. Architects report on the challenges that await homeowners and what unsuspected potential lies in old buildings. Before-and-after photos demonstrate the impressive transformations. Upgrade serves as inspiration for all who prefer to preserve rather than destroy	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156127-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4564812-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061577-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042840-0>
Career Goal: Translation and Interpreting: Fundamentals, Education, and Fields of Work ¤ A book for students and those interested in studying the field and profession of translation. In theoretical treatises by several authors, the various fields of translation, such as literary translation or simultaneous interpreting, are addressed. In further progress, the book then devotes itself to the possible fields of work in translation. Both classical working areas, as well as new areas for translation are mentioned. Unfortunately, the approach of the editors is somewhat unclear, as the target group is likely to be addressed only partially by the work; only of interest for public libraries with many student customers	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012679-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061414-1>

Emotions-Focused Methods : with E-Book-inside and Work Material ¤ Emotions-Focused Methods are an important instrument in behavioral therapy. They are used to dissolve the dysfunctional regulation of emotions in patients and to help them deal constructively with problematic feelings such as fear, shame, guilt, sadness, and loneliness. Lammers explains the individual methods and their fields of application and provides suggestions for interventions that target critical points in the patient's emotional misregulation. The presented repertoire, however, includes not only techniques that are exclusively emotions-focused, but the author also shows how, for example, chair dialogues can be used emotions-focused. He goes into the basics of the techniques, shows indication and contraindication, and explains what to consider when preparing for treatment. Beginners find access quickly due to the didactically inviting presentation. But also experienced practitioners can, for example, refresh their knowledge easily through the additional online offered teaching videos and expand their therapeutic spectrum. Techniques of Behavioral Therapy (ed. by Peter Neudeck) The series conveys step by step important basic techniques. Through the clear structure, questions for checking knowledge and convincing examples, the transfer to everyday practice is successful. In short online teaching videos, the respective technique, tips, and pitfalls are demonstrated. Examination questions enable the checking of one's own knowledge - the answers are available online.

Monuments of Post-War Modernity: Climatic Upgrading and Sustainable Restoration ¤ Monuments protection and climate protection - in recent years, the pressure to reduce energy consumption from buildings has grown strongly, especially in existing buildings. In particular, in the monument area, this poses great problems for planners and users. - - In addition to energy saving, thermal comfort for the user and safety from structural damage are the main goals of climatic upgrading. These requirements meet the individual values of the monument and are often only difficult to integrate into a sustainable monument conservation restoration concept. The danger exists that some monuments could lose their original character and their historical statement value under layers of composite insulation systems. The principle of sustainability is inherent to monument conservation, as many individual reused monuments are fundamentally ecologically sustainable because they have a long service life and are repairable. - - In discussions and site determinations in monument and climate protection, the worlds of ecology and economy, arithmetic and physics, politics and sociology, culture and architecture collide. Monument conservation operates in the coordinate system between monument value, owner interests, monument protection authorities, quality of planners, and the indispensable questions of financial means and funding possibilities. This book describes these discussions based on the climatic upgrading of the former Bavarian state representation by Sep Ruf in Bonn	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130981-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004973-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113437-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011455-7>

System Construction : Principles of Construction ¤ For several years, system construction, the use of prefabricated elements in architecture, has been actively discussed again. Long considered monotonous, today's building elements in fact have a high degree of differentiation, which can sustainably support and enhance the creativity of architects. Numerous buildings work with such prefabricated elements - in the area of single-family homes, this is now the case for 98 percent, and aesthetically demanding modular systems are available. This book presents the various systems and their applications, particularly in residential, office, and industrial construction, in a clear manner. The processes and components in system construction are explained, and the behavior of the different materials in this construction method is elucidated. The authors present strategies for planning and design with prefabricated systems, so that they can be used by architects in a useful manner. Numerous drawings explain the principles of system construction; built examples provide a bridge to construction practice.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165102-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4397525-2>

Wind Energy Installations and Spatial Planning Areas ¤ Wind energy has the greatest importance among all renewable energy sources in the context of the energy transition. For stable growth, a sufficient supply of plan lawfully secured areas must be available. The contribution focuses on the stock of spatial planning areas for wind power use in regional plans, the density of development and the installed capacity. The basis of the investigation are the spatial planning plan monitor maintained by the BBSR, which contains vector data of spatial planning areas in binding regional plans, as well as a wind turbine database built by the BBSR with site-specific data. This makes it possible for the first time to perform a nationwide geo-statistical overlap of spatial planning areas and installation locations (Source: Publisher).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079329-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034013-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049040-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128839-7>

Quiring analyzes how the Kremlin tries to split Europe and uses means of hybrid warfare, including covert cyber attacks. In doing so, he incorporates the judgments of German and international Russia experts. (Publisher's text)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131701-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046514-7>
Fascination Construction — Profession and Field of Activity in Flux: Recommendations for the Training of Qualified Skilled Workers in Germany ¤ Project -- Introduction -- Seven theses on the training of construction engineers and the profession of construction engineers -- 3 recommendations. Innovation power and high-tech products make Germany one of the leading industrial nations. The development of new and improved products will also play a prominent role in the future, as product development and design contribute to prosperity, economic growth, and international competitiveness in Germany. Behind each new or customer-adapted product is a masterful achievement: technical challenges and needs must be recognized. Suitable technical solutions must be found, which are then further developed into a functioning and industrially producible product. No development project is like the other and with each, new territory is entered. These diverse, yet constantly changing and responsible tasks are taken over by construction engineers in the mechanical engineering and electrical engineering industries. The training of construction engineers is thus faced with great challenges: it must meet the changing fields of activity and requirements with adapted training concepts, prepare for the handling of continuous development, and at the same time be attractive to potential construction engineer recruits. Based on seven theses, this acatech POSITION sketches the current university training of construction engineers and the profession of construction engineers. Building on this, acatech provides recommendations for improving the profession's image and for a modern, forward-looking university training and further education of construction engineers that meets the expectations of industry.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069340-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005871-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165096-7>
Think new! : 22 Success Strategies in Digital Business ¤ In a good mix of professional depth and popular, well-written presentation, 22 success principles for successful digital business and e-commerce are presented and explained with numerous case studies. (Roland Roth-Steiner) Why do some companies successfully make the leap into digital business? Why do brands like Twitter or Uber succeed, although they do not generate profits? What do Google, Apple, and Co. do differently? This is the question that the inspiring guide by the two authors (business consultant and university professor) addresses, and they find the right mix of professional depth and popular, well-written presentation. 22 principles are presented in each chapter (an introductory chapter provides basics), explained with case studies, and rounded off at the end with a summary and literature references. Examples would be the "Glocal" principle (offering local, location-based services with global platforms) or the "Predictive" principle (making predictions about user behavior and preferences with big data analysis). Clearly: the 22 principles are nothing really new, but all trends that make successful digital business are found here - and at least all the associated buzzwords and fashion words. Suitable for all libraries of medium size and above.

China's Belly : Why the West Needs to Think Less to Understand the East Better ¤ Herbig chooses an original approach to describe the current Chinese society. Starting from the realization that the emotional world significantly determines consciousness, he focuses on seven emotional dimensions: joy, anger, grief, fear, love, hate, and desire. Review: Herbig chooses an original approach to describe the current Chinese society. Inspired by Yu Hua ("China in Ten Words", 2012) and starting from the realization that the emotional world significantly determines consciousness, he focuses on 7 emotional dimensions: joy, anger, grief, fear, love, hate, and desire. He took this from a Confucian classic, the "Book of Rites". Herbig, who has lived mainly in China since the early 1990s, draws from a large fund of conversations and observations (see also: Felix Lee: "Power and Modernity", 2014; F. Sieren: "Fear of China", 2002; B. Lüthi: "Live from China", 2014; C. Vospernik: "China live", 2008). He can thus describe the social change in the People's Republic in a comprehensible way, for example by exemplifying that the Chinese have largely lost the ability to grieve. The inherited behavioral repertoires are partly disintegrating under the onslaught of turbo-capitalism, but some emotional states have endured for centuries.

The Life of Wishes : Novel ¤ What happens when a person, like in a fairy tale, suddenly has 3 wishes open? Jonas experiences this quite randomly at a mysterious encounter during lunch break on a bench in the park. He continues to live his usual life as an advertising copywriter and family father with infidelities, but strange coincidences are gradually piling up. The novel escalates from the description of everyday realism more and more into the surrealist until an imaginary - or imagined? - end of the world. One is reminded of novels like "The Other Side" by Alfred Kubin, as far as the conclusion is concerned, of American disaster movies. Glavinic (most recently "That's Me", BA10/07) proves to be an author who, as was read in the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, leads the reader "into the fantastic depths of everyday life".

The Writing Time Plan: Time Management for Writers ¤ Many students and other scientifically writing individuals lack concentration, patience, discipline, and especially a stringent time planning when writing. To alleviate this, Wymann recommends his writing time plan. He briefly explains what this idea is all about and then presents the 10 steps to a writing plan in sequence. He refrains from theories, models, and research results. It's all about practical tools that are meant to help become aware of one's writing situation, change negative habits, and build efficient writing routines. Examples from writers illustrate the individual steps of the writing time plan.

In addition, a range of different theoretical approaches are presented and discussed in terms of their significance for planning and developing participatory support processes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001413-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128300-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055676-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028892-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044789-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005275-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4807038-5>
Thermoplastic, Roll-Formed Profiles in Hybrid Construction 2 - TroPHy2 : Research Reports from the Research Campus Open Hybrid LabFactory ¤ The book presents the final report of the TroPHy2 consortium project. In the project, a hybrid roll-forming machine was developed, with which hybrid components made of metal profiles and carbon fibers with a thermoplastic matrix can be produced. This machine was set up in the Open Hybrid LabFactory's workshop in Wolfsburg. The partners investigated and validated the necessary manufacturing processes. The goal was to develop a structurally optimized, hybrid automotive component that represents the weight-saving potential of hybrid materials. A weight saving of up to 44.9% was calculated, significantly exceeding the 25% weight saving target set at the beginning of the project. The lightweight potential of the hybrid material was thus clearly demonstrated. The editor, Prof. Dr.-Ing. Martin Wiedemann, studied aerospace engineering at the Technical University of Berlin. He then researched in various institutes of the university in the field of aerospace and graduated in 1991. Subsequently, he was active in various leading positions at EADS Airbus GmbH. Between 2005 and 2007, he was responsible as chief engineer in the A400M program for the fuselage and control surfaces. Since 2007, he has been directing the DLR Institute for Fiber-Reinforced Lightweight Construction and Adaptronics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133452-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175096-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056863-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4279743-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165100-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4205895-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4340650-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4159653-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136513-6>

Migration in History : a Workbook for Teaching ¤ Migration has been part of human history since the early times; however, it has significantly increased in the 20th and 21st centuries. Buntz outlines the importance of the topic for teaching history and then deals with individual topics on forms and causes of migration in history. Each section contains brief factual information, didactic hints, as well as materials (maps, text and image sources, statistics) with tasks for students. The bibliography lists publications on the topic of treatment in teaching, as well as youth books on the topic of migration; there are also hints at reliable internet links. For history teachers, but also for teachers who teach geography or politics in secondary stages I and II. (2 pages)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020533-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0>
Manufacturing Technology ¤ A teaching and reference work with compressed information on materials, working procedures, and construction principles of manufacturing technology. Compared to the 7th edition (BA 5/06), it has been expanded by about 20 pages and revised in several sections (casting, welding procedures, etc.), and updated in the guidelines. It is still an important basic work for students and practitioners. The old edition can be consumed, but it should be supplemented by this new edition if possible - if the budget allows.

Sounddesign : Sound, Perception, Emotion ¤ The author describes the emotional effect of sounds, tones, and music and explains the interactions that can occur through the combination of (moving-)image and sound. Review: With the term 'Sounddesign', the author refers to the use of auditory elements in media with the goal of generating specific emotions, e.g. in film dialogues, sounds, ambient sounds, and music, which all have a communicative content and allow emotions to arise. In order to be able to show and analyze the interactions, the physical fundamentals of sound perception are first described, then the meanings of different sounds and sound patterns are explained and made clear through the examination of individual film scenes. The explanations are detailed and well understandable, but also partly quite complex. The grayscale illustrations are used well dosed and always targeted. Good: The author frequently inserts small practical exercises into the text, through which a discussed phenomenon can be made audible in concrete terms. Target group of the title are media designers, sound technicians, musicians, and directors as well as students of corresponding fields of study. Conclusion: Good comprehensive representation of the emotional effect of sound and of the combination of sound and image	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140882-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7693207-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064317-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030933-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4823394-8>
The Drupal 6 Beginner Seminar ¤ Drupal is an open-source content management system (CMS) that has roughly the same scope of functions as Mambo and Joomla! The program is gradually becoming more well-known and is gaining more followers outside of the narrower community of tinkerers. A significantly higher attention that Drupal is receiving can be recognized, among other things, by the fact that the series "bhv-Beginner Seminar" is now also taking up the topic. The author describes the handling of the simpler functions of the CMS quite smoothly, which may be due to the fact that he comes from a journalistic rather than a technical background. So the - rather practical - approach to the topic will certainly please those readers who do not deal with technical details, but want to create a functioning system quickly. Those who want a more comprehensive approach should rather refer to T. Zahreddin (in this issue), who also deals more intensively with the technology. The layout of the Beginner Seminar series looks a bit rough and inelegant, which also affects readability. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7614080-5>

Strategic Autonomy and the Defense of Europe: On the Way to a European Army? ¤ The Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) has been one of the most neglected policy fields of European integration in recent years. While member states have continued to cut their defence spending largely uncoordinated, the euro crisis has taken up almost all of the EU's political energy. Only the radical changes in the global and regional environment, accompanied by hybrid threats and increasingly fluid borders between internal and external security, have made the CSDP a major political focus of the European Union again. With the new Global Strategy (2016) and its implementation package, EU institutions have opened the way for a European defence union and the long-term goal of a European army in an impressively effective way. Now, member states must decide how to achieve the desired strategic autonomy and at the same time ensure that the European Union preserves its identity as a soft power. The present volume provides insights into the political, scientific, and public debates on the defence of Europe and a more robust CSDP. It offers current data and trends for defence spending, modernization projects, and multilateral cooperation for each member state of the European Union and identifies the key drivers for shaping national and European security and defence policy. The volume provides an overview of what has been achieved so far and offers concrete recommendations for the next steps towards European strategic autonomy.

Elementary Number Theory ¤ ... the authors begin with the prime factorization and the greatest common divisor - two concepts that are well known from school education, but lose much of their self-evidence with closer examination. Similarly, they discuss the theoretical background of the decimal system familiar from everyday life, congruence calculations, primitive roots, and the reciprocity law for quadratic residues. Their book (2nd edition: ID 44/95, ed. Red.) is aimed at lecturers and students of mathematics, teachers at real schools and gyms, as well as all those interested in a branch of mathematics that is over three thousand years old. It assumes no knowledge beyond elementary school material. Due to its thoroughness, it can be used both as a lecture accompaniment and for self-study. Exercises at the end of each paragraph help to practice and deepen the treated material. (3)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4294368-1>
How Does the City Find Free Space? : Facts, Positions, Examples ¤ In the public space, cities see their identity represented. Whether as a space of social appropriation and intercultural encounters, as an urban place of residence or as a sequence of streets, alleys, and squares that structures the city, whether as a place of environmental education and nature mediation or as a place for urban landscape art, the urban free space is an actor space and action space. The book presents the tasks and requirements for these free spaces, shows successful examples, and provides action recommendations	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182741-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4700381-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018319-1>

Multilingualism and Education in Kindergartens and Schools ¤ The two researchers have already published academic literature on bilingualism. E. Montanari also has guides with practical exercises for the kindergarten and elementary school sector available (cf. ID-A 35/00 and ID-A 22/06). This volume deals with multilingualism, translingualism, and multiliteracy, when script and texts are included. In addition to clarifying basic concepts and presenting the current state of scientific knowledge, practical hints on methods of observation and documentation of children's language biographies are also presented. Numerous examples from various studies illustrate the whole thing: multilingualism is considered an opportunity and should be integrated into the daily routine of kindergartens and schools in a different and stronger way than before. After each chapter, two questions are found that can be discussed in order to deal more intensively with this approach. Primarily intended for lecturers and students of pedagogical professions, but also suitable for the further education of voluntary language promoters, as B. Busch (ID-G 22/13) has shown.

The Politics of the Federal States: State Activity in Comparison ¤ This volume provides a comprehensive overview of politics in the federal states. It describes the differences in state activity and institutional policy that exist between the federal states, and theoretically analyzes the explanatory factors of this variation. In addition, it addresses the changes that have resulted from the federal reform. Given the great importance of state politics in many policy fields and the previously sporadic and mainly descriptive treatment of it by political science, the volume closes a significant research gap.

Hitler's Helpers: German Women in the Holocaust ¤ Since 1992, after the opening of the Eastern borders, the American scholar researched at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in archives in Ukraine, in Belarus, Poland, and in the Baltic states. Here she describes what opened up for her. The imperial feeling of the "Ostrausch" also affected women who followed men into areas occupied by the Nazis. As secretaries who administered the genocide, they were accomplices, as nurses who implemented the euthanasia program, perpetrators, as teachers who were bystanders, as wives (often residing in a position of authority) spectators. All profited, saw the sites of mass murder as an opportunity, enriched themselves unimaginably at the confiscated goods of the victims. "In areas like Ukraine, less than 2% of the Jewish population survived the war" - most of Hitler's helpers went unpunished, remained silent, denied, or stylized themselves as victims. Despite the many works on women in the NS state, Lowers book should also be available in libraries, alongside the excellent one by Kathrin Kompisch ("Perpetrators", BA 2/09).

Introduction to CATIA V5: Object-Oriented Design in Exercises and Examples ¤ The basic book for beginners to CATIA V5 appears already in the 5th edition (last displayed BA 1/04). It is aimed at students and engineers in practice and leads through clear examples and colorful illustrations thoroughly and practically into the subject. Independent of functions and procedures, the present 5th edition has been adapted to the currently used version R 19 in industry and expanded on the topic "Complex Assemblies"; all exercise examples can be found on the accompanying CD-ROM. The preface suggests that in the newer version options and possibilities have been expanded, but older versions can still be used. A shorter introduction is offered by S. Hartmann (BA 3/09, no new edition displayed yet), somewhat more specialized is R. List (ID-G 23/09). The standard work should be available in large libraries alongside the introduction by S.

Colombia: A Country Portrait ¤ Description of a country with many facets - socially, historically, and in nature. Review: Introduced series (most recently e.g. "Central Asia", 2018). During research for his drug reportage ("Narco wars", 2016) Specht got to know Colombia with its many facets and contradictions, both in terms of the "Beautiful and the Terrible", i.e. the social conditions with the civil war and its consequences, as well as the landscape diversity and the many figures of nature that the country knows. Specht starts his travelogue from the violent times, before he names and describes the historically and socially constitutive riches of the country - gold, bananas, coffee, and cocaine. His descriptions of the country live from encounters with people, former FARC rebels, artists, (coca-)farmers, fellow travelers. Even the landscapes of Colombia from the Amazon lowlands over the Andes to the Pacific and Caribbean coast are brought to life through reportages about people. - The book conveys the essence of the country best and is therefore a good addition to the travel guides that have been appearing regularly in recent years.

Future Market Bioplastics : Case Study Commissioned by the Federal Environment Agency within the Research Project Innovative Environmental Policy in Key Areas of Action (Project Number 206 14 132/05 + 206 14 132/04) ¤ Bioplastics are based on renewable raw materials, such as starch, cellulose or lactic acid. Their use is seen as a contribution to the avoidance of negative environmental impacts of conventional plastics, to the reduction of oil consumption, and to the increase of the use of agricultural raw materials. Some of the newly developed materials, in particular the biotechnologically produced polylactides, possess properties such as water vapor permeability, good printability, and antistatic behavior, which are advantageous over conventional plastics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4634464-0>
Presenting in School, Studies and Profession ¤ In the 6 years since the first edition of this comprehensive introduction to professional presentation techniques appeared in 2007, there have been numerous changes and developments in the practice of presenting, which the new edition now addresses. This includes changes in the media landscape - such as the increased use of visualizers and whiteboards compared to the declining importance of slide or overhead projectors -, the much more frequent incorporation of multimedia effects, which is addressed in a new chapter, author and usage rights, where basic knowledge is now essential, or the further developed software in the latest versions. The 3-part book structure in Basics, Media and Software has been retained, as well as the main consideration of free "Open-Source" programs. It is also pleasing that the now larger and therefore more readable font has been maintained	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188417-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188737-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135231-2>
Plants for Industry and Energy ¤ Renewable resources are actually nothing new. For centuries, they have been used as fuels for heating, as building materials or for producing and dyeing textiles. Decreasing fossil resources, noticeable climate change and increased environmental awareness are leading to a reorientation towards energy and industrial plants. New cultivation systems, modern varieties and new technologies are opening up new opportunities for renewable resources today. Their cultivation expands the often limited crop rotations in agriculture and brings diversity and color to the fields. To make renewable resources understandable through examples and illustrations and to quickly get an overview of the diversity, the Agency for Renewable Resources e.V. (FNR) has published the brochure	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4473008-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045998-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4516957-3>
Mathematical Logic ¤ Publisher's text: This book provides an introduction to the various aspects of mathematical logic that every mathematician and computer scientist should know. After predicate calculus and its applications to the beginnings of artificial intelligence, set theory is presented axiomatically. In the third and fourth parts, the necessary basic concepts of computability theory and the hierarchy of definable subsets of natural numbers are introduced in order to finally prove the Gödel incompleteness theorems. Through its clear style and the included exercise problems, this book is a concise introduction to these foundations of the entire mathematics	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046974-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005581-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033447-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037951-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4021417-5>
Verdun 1916: The Battle That Shook the Century ¤ So horrific it cannot even be the hell, a witness was shocked. Never again did more soldiers die in such a confined space as in Verdun 1916. Olaf Jessen draws a new picture of the key battle of World War I based on forgotten documents. Vividly told and to the point: for all who want to learn about the Great War from the perspective of frontline soldiers and commanders of both sides. Why Verdun? To explain the strategic sense of the 'blood mill', historians usually refer to Erich von Falkenhayn. The French army, so the General Staff chief claimed, should 'bleed to death' at Verdun. However, forgotten sources prove: 'Operation Court' aimed at the breakthrough and the return to mobile warfare. „Militärhistorie zu erzählen, ohne in die Falle der Kriegsspielbegeisterung zu tappen - das gelingt Olaf Jessen in seiner Verdun-Erzählung nicht. Seine Schilderungen sind kenntnisreich, aber er distanziert sich zu wenig von seinen Quellen“ (deutschlandradiokultur.de) Verdun 1916, one of the great battles that shaped the 20th century, and the free historian (lastly ID-G 45/10) unfolds its story here, as if it were a film. After the 'Directory of Main Characters' the breathtaking drama of the events unfolds, scene by scene. Day, place, time, then it goes to the command centers of the German or French army or directly to the front, and everything is presented in a reportage-like presence, with direct speech, witness testimony, and colorful background. With the best film technology, the author makes dry material from German and French archives come alive, bringing together the two levels: the power and strategic struggles of the military decision-makers and the death struggles of those who had to endure the decisions in the mud of the front. This is unmatched and bestseller-worthy and will find many readers (the long critical interpretations, especially of General Staff Chief von Falkenhayn, will be skipped over). Illustrations and maps.

Introduction to Anti-Philosophy ¤ Philosophy seeks the truth - and has so far only found a multitude of competing truths. In the 19th century, thinkers like Marx, Nietzsche, and Kierkegaard risked a radical break: they set their own truths like a command in the world. This was the birth of that anti-philosophy that, for Boris Groys, embodies the understanding of truth in the present. His portraits of great anti-philosophers present this thinking for the first time in a context: from Kierkegaard to Heidegger to Derrida. A philosophy history of a special kind - but also a guide for thinking at the height of the time.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045791-6>
Bridges : daring constructions over rivers, valleys, seas ¤ Affordable, well-illustrated, and understandable titles on the topic of bridge construction for non-experts are scarce on the market. Therefore, financially weak libraries can access this: the revised and updated new edition is over 50% cheaper than the first edition (BA 3/95 - can be used up) and is no longer printed on high-gloss paper. Chronologically ordered from antiquity to the 21st century, over 100 exemplary bridges from around the world are presented in texts, drawings, and historical and current photos. Newly included are realized and planned projects from 1999, such as the bridge over the Great Belt, the Millau Viaduct in France, the bridge at the Gulf of Corinth, bridges in Asia. "30 Bridges" (ID 43/02) is aimed at architects and engineers, "Fascination Bridges" (ID 8/99), "Bridge Construction in the 20th Century" costs 56.00 EUR (BA 2/05).

Regional Garden Culture : On the Identity of Landscapes ¤ The German Society for Garden Art and Landscape Culture e.V. (DGGL) presents its first annual book. - Cities discover their surroundings. Historical gardens and parks, but also the landscape that has developed over many decades are in the focus of concepts and strategies for the region. The Regional Park RheinMain, the Garden-Landscape Ostwestfalen-Lippe and the Garden Dreams of Saxony-Anhalt are some examples that the German Society for Garden Art and Landscape Culture takes up in its annual book. While some regions can fall back on a rich heritage of known and lesser-known parks, others, such as the Saar region or Lusatia, face great challenges in the face of decades-long exploitation of the landscape for coal mining. The book shows how the identity of these landscapes is worked out and strengthened with which strategies and provides a comprehensive overview of current concepts for cultural landscape in Germany.

Investment guide for Uzbekistan ¤ This investment guide for Uzbekistan attempts to provide a realistic assessment of the current economic and legal framework conditions for foreign direct investments. Uzbekistan, like many CIS countries, has introduced a clear policy that favors foreign direct investments. A new law on foreign direct investments has been enacted and a special program has been introduced, which aims to create investment priorities for individual sectors that have competitive advantages. Investors are flexible in their choice of investment form. The most preferred form of foreign direct investment is the joint venture. As of October 1, 1994, there were 1,329 companies with foreign capital participation in Uzbekistan, including 1,234 joint ventures. Investors should not expect a quick return on their investments. Investments in long-term projects are likely to yield better results. To attract foreign investments for export-oriented production, the government has created many tax incentives for export-oriented industries.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070496-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1>

Living with the Enemy: Everyday Life in World War I ¤ Based on memories, archive sources, and a variety of interviews with veterans of World War I, the British TV journalist and historian tells the story of the difficult coexistence of Britons and Germans in the war everyday life beyond the front. Review: Unlike S.F. Kellerhoff and T. Flemming (both 2014) in their nationally limited "Home Front" books, the well-known British TV journalist and historian deals here with a special aspect of everyday life in World War I: What happens when people, here: Germans and Britons, live together, whose nations are hostile to each other? What happened to German women who were married to Englishmen, how Englishmen fared who found work in Germany, how the war pulled people out of their familiar environment, how hysteria and violence broke into relationships, but also how bridges of humanity were built over the trenches (cf. M. Jürgs 2013), this book tells the story in an engaging way for a broad circle of interested readers, written with many quote inserts, reading excitingly. The book is based on memories, British and German archive sources, and a variety of interviews that the author conducted with war veterans. With (possibly printed) black and white images, bibliography, but without index.

Focal Areas for Species Protection in Wind Energy Planning: Methodological Approaches to the Planning-Based Allocation of Areas for Wind Energy Use ¤ Climate protection and the preservation of biodiversity are challenges to which the Federal Republic has largely committed itself in international agreements. To avoid conflicts between wind energy use and species protection, the selection of the site for wind turbines is a significant factor. The site selection is carried out at the planning level, where areas with the lowest conflict potential are designated. In accordance with the provisions of the federal legislator, two percent of the state area must be designated for wind energy use by the planners by 2032. Against this background, species protection should already be given sufficient consideration at the strategic planning level to minimize conflicts on subsequent levels. In several federal states, the approach of taking into account species protection at the planning level by means of density centers/focal areas has been used. In this context, the approaches to delimiting the areas and their effect on the planning and approval levels differ. The approach is particularly suitable for species that are widespread, have a high breeding site variability, and are therefore difficult to handle in planning. This report presents a method for delimiting focal areas/density centers for wind-sensitive species using habitat modeling. This methodological approach is particularly suitable for species whose distribution has a high habitat dependence. This should be recorded as far as possible with easily accessible data, so that the method can be used in spatial planning. For the identification of habitat variables, data from the European Copernicus Earth Observation Program were therefore used. The basis for practical application is, in addition, a good knowledge of breeding sites in partial areas of the planning area. The model was developed using data from the federal states of Baden-Württemberg and Brandenburg. The focus is on the species red kite, black kite and osprey. In addition, statements are made about the sea eagle and the peregrine falcon (as cliff breeders). For all calculations, satisfactory to very good model results are shown, even with a reduced data set. Different natural equipment in the federal states should be noted. For example, smaller woodland areas in Brandenburg play a greater role for the red kite than in Baden-Württemberg. The level of the federal states is considered a suitable reference area for the professional delimitation of focal areas. This appears to be a suitable compromise to present regional differences and at the same time to avoid designating local but regionally insignificant occurrences. With the habitat modeling method, it is also possible to identify areas that, in terms of habitat equipment, have a development potential for a target species. On these areas, targeted measures can then be taken, for example in the context of species conservation programs, to contribute to a positive development of the population. To determine whether there is still sufficient area available for the allocation of focal areas to achieve the two percent target, a multi-criteria scenario analysis was carried out at two examples. In comparison with other planning concerns, the focal areas show a low influence on the area competition. On the other hand, other areas that have been previously kept free for wind energy use may have to be opened up at least in part, depending on the circumstances in the planning areas, in order to achieve the area targets. The multi-criteria scenario analysis can serve as a decision-making aid and supports the transparent presentation of area competition.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048590-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079329-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188697-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170297-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178524-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4510429-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4239536-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4275389-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189060-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180617-7>
Siegfried Lichtenstaedter (1865-1942) : Prophet of Destruction : on Folk Spirit and Anti-Semitism ¤ Siegfried Lichtenstaedter was a Bavarian-Jewish civil servant who wrote biting satires and, among other things, predicted the Holocaust.

Rebels, Prophets, and Rebels: Political Breakthroughs and Disappointments in the 20th and 21st Centuries ¤ Franz Walter looks back in critical analyses on the long history of social movements, political ideologies, parliamentary parties, and their charismatic leaders. In his almost 100-year review of German politics, he deals with the different varieties of rebellious youth movements as well as radical democratic concepts, the great political ideas and currents of liberalism, conservatism, and socialism, and personalities of contemporary history such as Herbert Marcuse, Willy Brandt, and Heinrich Brüning from Konrad Adenauer to Angela Merkel. Walter asks about the programmatic taboos of the left and the political understanding of the conservatives and sketches the rise, but also the internal contradictions and crises of social democracy from its beginnings to Agenda 2010. The political history as a history of permanent change between breakthrough and disappointment leads the author to a conclusion of turning points, which he understands as both the 1970s and 1990s and the phase after the economic crises of the present. "Reading Franz Walter's essays means looking forward to the next unexpected turn, the next reversal of a familiar thesis or a circulating assumption - and being infected with the tragedy that the upright fighters for more freedom, more equality, and more solidarity have had only such small and short chances to make politics in the last 150 years" ( deutschlandfunk.de)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4229761-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055707-8>

Google Data Studio : Create Professional Reports and Dashboards ¤ Google Data Studio is a cloud-based analysis and reporting tool, with which complex data can be brought together, analyzed, presented, and shared in a simple way. The program was released in 2016 and is still relatively unknown. The user numbers and thus the target group are correspondingly (still) small. The book is so far the only monograph on the subject. After an introduction, the integration of various data sources is first described; this is followed by the preparation of the data through own dimensions and values and finally the planning and data visualization. In further chapters - the content architecture appears inhomogeneous from here on - aspects of administration, possibilities of publication, permissions, and two case studies follow. Overall, the topic is introduced in a clear and tutorial-like manner, where the language will not win a prize for elegance. Many illustrations, especially screenshots (partly poorly legible).

Police and Order Law ¤ The textbook conveys to the reader the structures of general police and order law. It thereby enables him to also find his way in the matters of special police and order law. Emphasis is placed on the central problems for legal education and the two legal exams. An important concern of the book is, in addition, to show the multiple connections of police and order law with general administrative law and administrative procedural law, but also with constitutional law. This not only clarifies the embedding of police and order law in our legal system, but also takes account of the fact that police law exams are typically linked to problems from these areas of law	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115458-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115591-9>

But how can one approach this book critically? It is sealed against any conceivable objection by anticipating and depriving it of wind in the sails. Whoever wanted to hold Kermani accountable for the fact that this is not a novel at all, but only a monstrous testimony of applied poetology, is explained by good reasons: The novelist of today is the poetologist. Even the question of who this book is actually written for is rejected. One cannot always think of the reader. Every life needs a kind of mirror. But who transforms it so obsessively into writing, suffocates it. The result is to be seen here: Under the colossus of this life and death book, Navid Kermani is buried alive (zeit.de). Longlist Deutscher Buchpreis 2011. Kleist Prize 2012 The first-person narrator, a writer named Navid Kermani, begins his new book, this novel, on June 8, 2006. It develops into a work about everything that is to be known about his life and life in general: the presence and past of his family, the memory of deceased friends, and the captivating reading of Jean Paul and Hölderlin. The story of his grandfather, who went from the Middle East to Germany, becomes the heart of the novel. And again and again it's about the process of writing. Kermani, a great, clever, and versatile writer and language master, has taken a lot of time for this book (most recently "Kurzmitteilung", BA 6/07), and a complex, entangled novel emerged that rewards enduring readers. Highly praised by literary critics and widely noticed in the media. (Elisabeth Mair-Gummermann)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053309-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003939-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184945-0>
Images of Mathematics ¤ A very attractive, comprehensive contribution to the visualization of mathematics. This is achieved through the representation of functions, special topological surfaces, curves, polyhedra, and other bodies, but also through clear graphical evidence for the proof of mathematical theorems. Through many quite large images and lively color choice, this has been achieved. Parquet flooring, reflections, and images of fractals offer particularly impressive views. It can, however, be the case that the stimulating band only a few readers will further educate and remain a "coffee table book", as the text takes a step back compared to the image and often requires mathematical knowledge. Those who do not know what disjunct means, what a circle or a symmetry axis is, will not learn it. Colorful drawings are now probably offered by all schoolbooks; already in 1965, the "Small Encyclopedia of Mathematics" (often reprinted) had many, albeit small four-color images, but very comprehensive text that explained what is considered known in the Spectrum book. - Nevertheless: a beautiful treasure trove for mathematically interested people.

Environmental Impact Assessment for Regional Plans ¤ The Directive 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2001 on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, which entered into force on 21 July 2001 (OJ L 197/30) and is to be transposed into national law within three years, will have significant importance not least for spatial planning in the Federal Republic of Germany. The aim of Directive 2001/42/EC, as stated in Article 1, is to "ensure a high level of environmental protection in the light of the principle of sustainable development and contribute to the integration of environmental considerations into the preparation and adoption of plans and programmes, by ensuring that certain plans and programmes which are likely to have significant environmental effects are subject to environmental assessment in accordance with this Directive." The study deals with various aspects, such as the scope and procedure of environmental assessment, the scoping, the determination of the scope of the study, the environmental report, the monitoring of environmental impacts and the implementation of the Directive into German spatial planning law. Recommendations are given for various areas.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125275-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049040-3>

My Car Repairs Itself : [and Other Technologies of Tomorrow] ¤ The author is a chemist, works as a freelance science and business journalist, and has also (together with his wife) written the book "Lust and Love - all just chemistry?" (BA 9/04) in the same publishing house. Here, he deals with the (possible) future, describes current innovative developments, and provides visions for technical progress in areas such as computers, energy, environment, automobiles, etc. When it comes to automobiles, he sketches out the possibilities that could be offered by the use of fuel cells, for example; in the field of global nutrition, he relies on the potential of genetic technology, and in the field of medicine, he reports, for example, on the possibilities of pharmacogenetics or the "diabetes tablet". In the flowing text, there are "excursions" in which professional backgrounds (e.g. the functioning of the direct-methanol fuel cell) are made clearer or nearby topics (e.g. the situation of research and the scientific young talent in Germany) are addressed. A popular science-oriented "panoramic view" of the "innovation landscape".

Collective Agreement Act and Labor Dispute Law : Compact Commentary ¤ Collective labor law is constantly in motion due to legislative changes and the development in case law. Since July 2015, the new Collective Agreement Act has been in force. With this, the disputed principle of 'one contract for one company' is applicable. Small trade unions have less influence, the implementation of strikes is made more difficult. The question is whether this is compatible with the fundamental right to freedom of association. The commentary on the Collective Agreement Act and Labor Dispute Law comments on the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court and takes up the current opinion from science, judiciary, and trade unions. It explains the entire Collective Agreement Act and its effects on labor dispute law in a practical manner. The focal points of the new edition: Current case law on the Collective Agreement Act Contents of collective agreements Effects of the Collective Agreement Act Collective agreements in the work of works councils and personnel councils Reference to collective agreements in employment contracts Enterprise and association collective agreements Tariff flight, outsourcing, OT membership, temporary work Benefit regulations for trade union members. - (Publisher's advertising)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120921-7>
Hydrogen & Fuel Cells: The Technology of Tomorrow! ¤ Geitmann wants to clarify the possibilities with the present book, which hydrogen can bring as a fuel of the future. He pays special attention to the use of liquid hydrogen in fuel cells, but also to its combustion in conventional engines. Challenging, but still understandable, newer research projects, for example, on the storage of hydrogen are described. Further chapters deal with the production of hydrogen, transportation, refueling process, as well as economic aspects. A comprehensive appendix with numerous literature references, tables, and the like rounds off the work. Comparable to M. Pehnt (BA 1/03), where this topic is still a bit more popular and less scientifically oriented. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121905-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008195-3>
Balance Sheet Analysis and Key Figures: Case-Oriented Balance Optimization ¤ Ob it is accounted for according to HGB, IFRS or US-GAAP: Much in the income statement and balance sheet is actually obvious, but not immediately recognizable. On an international level, the total cost method loses importance, but for the German middle class, the total cost method is clearly the better closing, as here both for the controller and the tax consultant strengths and weaknesses and legal intervention possibilities in the balance sheet can be quickly recognized. The work presents the legal situation before and after the BilMoG.(Publisher's text)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069453-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114166-0>
Wahlkampagne 2.0 : political communication in Web 2.0 - more democracy through more communication? ¤ Two election campaigns from the year 2007 serve as case studies for Marco Bosch's communication science study on the use of Web 2.0 and social software elements in internet campaigning. The focus is on the French presidential election campaign and the primaries for the Democratic presidential nomination in the USA. The book provides insight into whether Web 2.0 can exploit its interactive potential in politics, or for the time being remains only another tool in the campaign planners' toolbox.(Source: Publisher's cover / Publisher).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308416-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134262-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7548364-6>
Electromobility in Municipalities - a Mood Picture: Results of the Difu City Survey 2014 ¤ Although the federal government's goal of seeing a million electric vehicles on Germany's roads in five years is still far from being achieved - 78 percent of the surveyed German municipalities are dealing with the topic of electromobility. This is a result of the Difu city survey 'Electromobility in Municipalities'. The municipalities differ both in terms of the type and scope of activities as well as their motives for dealing with this topic. For some municipalities, electromobility is part of environmentally friendly mobility, which is one of the core goals of a strategic city and transportation development for them. Others consider the topic more from the perspective of economic promotion or promise themselves a gain in image and positive effects on their urban location through this.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019956-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1042006857>
Education and Qualification as a Basis for Germany's Technological Performance: Report of the Consortium 'Education Indicators and Technological Performance' ¤ The adequate availability of highly qualified professionals is increasingly becoming a key factor for competitiveness and innovation - both at the level of companies and at the level of the overall economy. The present study therefore deals with qualifications - particularly at the academic or scientific level, but also with qualifications acquired through vocational education and training - as a basis for Germany's technological performance. The relevant indicators are reported in the time series and, where possible, in an internationally comparative perspective. The study first examines the qualification structures present in the total population and among the employed. It shows that knowledge intensification in the employment system has also progressed during the economic and financial crisis from 2008 to 2010 and that the demand for highly qualified employees continues to increase. Despite the increase in the proportion of academics among all employed persons, their proportion in Germany is still very low in international comparison (ISCED 5A+6). The analyses also conclude that the absolute number of academics in working age, regardless of their employment status, has already begun to decline in Germany. This can be interpreted as an indication of the first effects of demographic change.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059252-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125835-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006650-2>

Foundations of Electrical Engineering : the tried and tested textbook for students of electrical engineering and other technical courses from semester 1 : with 225 illustrations, 4 tables, tasks and solutions ¤ In this tried and tested textbook, which is now already in its 17th edition, the fields of direct current technology, electrical and magnetic fields, and alternating current technology are presented in a connected and clear manner. It begins with the treatment of direct current circuits, followed by the methods of network calculations; then comes the description of the electrical and magnetic field. In the second part of the book, the various areas of alternating current technology are treated. In order to achieve optimal understanding of the material, the reader is led step by step from simple matters to more complex problem situations. Furthermore, tasks with detailed solution paths are assigned to each section, which are of particular importance for the clarity of the matters. Through colored illustrations, the laws are made clearer.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014390-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113415-1>
Blood Brothers: A Berlin Gang Novel ¤ In the early 1930s, thousands of young people lived on the streets in Berlin and other major German cities due to the precarious economic conditions. They worked as day laborers and errand boys, but often their path led them into crime or prostitution. They found refuge and a little security and social warmth in self-organized gangs. They offered not only protection, but also expressed a proletarian youth subculture. In abandoned factory barracks, they met, drank, danced, and maintained a lifestyle shaped by hatred for the bourgeois society and the world of adults. In this now forgotten but well-documented environment, this novel written by Ernst Haffner and banned by the Nazis and publicly destroyed in the book burnings is set. At the center are two young people who have fled from educational institutions and the Blutsbrüder gang, to which they join after their arrival in Berlin. „Ernst Haffner's re-published novel	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042870-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028859-6>

The Downfall of the Habsburg Monarchy ¤ Not through a chronologically continuous presentation but a grouping by thematic fields, the author allows for a "glimpse into the depth" of the complex relationships. He "brushes history against the grain" and opens up new perspectives on facts that are already known. Review: The Austrian historian has established himself as an expert on the subject in numerous publications (e.g. "The First World War", 2011; "Habsburg's dirty war"; 2014). He "brushes history against the grain". In doing so, he does not proceed in a chronologically developing manner, but forms thematic blocks such as "The persistence of fragility", "Solutions through violence", "Anatomy of collapse", "The legacy" etc. With this, he wants to direct the view "from the surface to the depth" up to the voices of eyewitnesses. He hopes to avoid the danger of simplifying complex relationships. The question, repeatedly asked in the abundant specialized literature on the 1st World War, whether the Habsburg monarchy was doomed to collapse, or as a state entity had chances of survival, he cannot and does not want to answer conclusively. The book offers something like "alternative historiography" and allows for a new perspective on known facts. In this sense, an important and recommended addition to existing relevant titles.

Netzfeminism : Strategies of Female Image Politics ¤ Pink slips, baby blue-dyed armpits, sulky faces on selfies: what sounds like a male fantasy is a feminist statement by net artists. By doing so, they enter the battleground for the 'right' image of a woman, which is not only metaphorically up for debate in social media. Does a woman act emancipatorily by showing herself breastfeeding - or does she thereby reduce herself and other women to the role of the mother? Does a 'Girl Power' T-shirt confirm the role of the naive little girl - or does it question it? Media scholar Annekathrin Kohout has written a concise and pointed cultural and discourse history of female image politics, which takes all essential phenomena of female image politics from the emancipation movements of the early 20th century to the present-day netfeminist image struggle into view.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4222106-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4222126-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125057-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4571611-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308416-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006568-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113617-2>

Intersectoral Mobility as a Form of Knowledge Transfer between Research and Application: Courses and Motives of "Career Changes" ¤ The change of scientists between public and private sector research is generally considered to be innovation-promoting. At the same time, the permeability of the German research system is considered to be low in international comparison. What is it that German scientists apparently change less often between the university, extramural research institutes and corporate research? Which motives and framework conditions are decisive for this? What effects do intersectoral changes have on the career of individual scientists? To answer these questions, the book presents the results of an in-depth investigation of the career paths of 178 mobile scientists and shows the scientific policy implications that arise from the identified promoting and hindering factors of mobility.

Wasted Future : How We Are Squandering the Potential of the Young Generation ¤ When speaking with students and young people, Gerald Lembke is increasingly overcome with a sense of unease. They show themselves to be disinterested, lacking in drive, and overwhelmed. The professor of higher education sees the causes of their 'couldn't care less' behavior in the growing external pressure: young people are being instrumentalized for economic interests, are a plaything of education policy and its reforms. The concern of many parents for the well-being of their children increases the sense of being overwhelmed and defensive behavior. The result is mediocrity. What this country really needs, however, are young people who can develop freely without fear, who think outside the box and find new solutions. Because without vigilant, creative, and courageous minds, social cohesion and our prosperity will erode. Gerald Lembke offers action aids on how we can counteract this, in schools and universities, at home, and in politics.

Engaged Migrants : Participation in Civil Society ¤ Engaged people with a migration background are no longer absent from the arenas of civic engagement. It is necessary to shape the framework conditions so that they enable equal opportunities and remove access barriers. This collection of essays reflects the current state of the specialist discourse. It has emerged from the long-standing discussions of the working group „Migration, Participation, Diversity“ of the Federal Network for Civic Engagement (BBE). The first chapter deals with „immigration and integration policy over the past 20 years in Germany“. The second chapter focuses on „migrant organizations“, which have been increasingly recognized and acknowledged by politics and the public in recent years. The third chapter is dedicated to the focus area „intercultural opening“. The fourth chapter provides a closer look at some „engagement areas“ in which people with a migration background are engaged. The final chapter takes a look at „forms, contexts, and promotion of engagement“.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043774-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4519498-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7668631-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077570-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151434-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044789-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070815-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134681-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013673-5>

Tatort www : the most spectacular cases of a professional hacker - and how you can protect yourself against hacking, phishing, and data theft ¤ The author warns of dangers emanating from hackers and highlights 5 common attack targets: unprotected WLANs and webcams, online banking, identity theft, and finally smartphones and mobile phones. He then tells broad - but also rather unartistic - case stories based on true events. He offers advice in a comment on how the attacks could have been avoided. There are often repetitions of the rules and regulations that should be observed. This hardly bothers anyone if you don't want to read all the chapters. Faster readers can simply skip the case stories; this halves the reading time with the same learning outcome. Even experienced internet users will certainly find some hints on secure procedures that were not known or not noticed. The important newsletter from 'Bürger-Cert' issued by the BSI will also be unknown to many. - Unfortunately, an index has been omitted.

People, Volksgemeinschaft, AfD ¤ »We are the people!« This is a powerful and challenging sentence, especially in a democracy where the people rule. »All state power emanates from the people« is stated in the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany. But: Who is the people? The eligible citizens? The demonstrators against the dictatorship in Leipzig in October 1989? The orange masses on the Maidan in Kiev, who successfully forced a new presidential election in 2013/14? In the long history of the people, it has always been disputed who belonged to it and who did not. For example, women received the right to vote in most states only in the 20th century. And what happens, as Sebastian Haffner asked in 1933, if the people no longer want democracy? Michael Wildt's historically-political intervention explores the ambiguities and abysses of the political concept of the people, as well as the racist-antisemitic radicalization in the national socialist Volksgemeinschaft. On this basis, he questions the populist statements of the AfD, which loudly invokes the people. Here too, it is about different concepts of the people. The culturally defined exclusion of minorities by the AfD poses the danger of radical exclusion from the »people«. However, even the insistence that the people is demos and not ethnos does not get beyond the cunning imagination of a unified people. Would it not be time instead to take up Hannah Arendt's thoughts and not the people, but the human being and his right to have rights, to put in the center of our democratic thinking?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4273270-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063790-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4300539-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4752223-9>

Culture, Society, Migration: The Reflexive Turn in Migration Research ¤ The anthology works out the contribution of reflexivity for the understanding of the relationship between culture, society, and migration based on three focal points: 1. Policies of cultural difference, 2. Transnational perspectives, 3. Ethnicity and diversity. For this purpose, authors with different disciplinary backgrounds from Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and the USA are brought together. At the center is the relationship between the intellectual crisis, which has affected the existing basic concepts of integration and migration research, and the development of new thematic cuts, theoretical concepts, and research approaches. The content: The reflexive turn in migration research; Policies of cultural difference; Transnational perspectives; Ethnicity and diversity. The target groups: social and cultural science migration researchers; lecturers; doctoral students; advanced students.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0>

Regional problems and policies in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic ¤ #E7y7yThe report informs about the development of regional problems in the Czech and Slovak Republics after the beginning of economic and political reforms. The report mainly deals with the political reactions and measures pursued by the governments in the two countries. The economic policy in the Slovak Republic aimed to address the growth of unemployment, with regional growth centers emerging, which were attended by large industrial companies that had long-term growth in prospect. In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, an attempt was made to intervene in the economic and transformation process only through supportive measures. The development of these different conceptions of economic and regional policy are presented by the conditions of the regions, property relations, and economic preconditions. In the Slovak Republic, four regions are examined and evaluated in terms of their economic development. In the Czech Republic, five economic regions are analyzed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049043-9>
Methods for Adult Education: A Guide for Activating Teaching ¤ Course leaders will find in this volume a broad repertoire of methods for extracurricular course planning and design. Organized according to the most important fields of action, Horst Siebert describes primarily activating, subject-oriented methods that specifically take into account the competencies and resources of the participants. New in this edition is the method of the knowledge exchange, which establishes contacts for knowledge exchange as a mediation agency. The guide provides course leaders in adult education not only with orientation, but also a wide range of suggestions and impulses for the design of teaching and learning processes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189518-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078637-7>

Partial Differential Equations : An Introduction to Analytical and Numerical Methods ¤ Partial Differential Equations are the most important mathematical tool for many application fields, not only for physics and technology. Therefore, it is welcome that, after A. Tveito: "Introduction to Partial Differential Equations" (ID 44/02), another comprehensive textbook in German language appears. This methodically thought-out, somewhat stronger on theory-oriented book begins with examples of modeling and some classical solution procedures, but then deals very thoroughly with general methods within the framework of functional analysis. The longer final section deals with numerical procedures and also provides some hints at useful software. Each chapter is supplemented with tasks as well as readable general comments on historically or biographically noteworthy aspects. The necessary prerequisites rarely exceed the usual material of mathematical introductory lectures. Highly recommended for students from the middle semester onwards.

Economic Geography of Germany ¤ Over the past two decades since reunification, Germany as a whole has undergone a profound economic and spatial transformation, increasingly influenced by international interconnections. The globalization and Europeanization that began in the 1990s have continued to deepen. International trade, direct investments, financial transfers, or knowledge exchange have shaped everyday life for individuals to a significant extent, as well as economic and spatial structures and developments. On the European level, since 1993, the realization of the European internal market has led to a progressive economic integration, which found its general expression with the introduction of the Euro as a common currency; and at the same time, large-scale expansions took place in the new millennium with the accession of former socialist countries in Eastern Central Europe. As a result, economic and spatial developments in Germany are significantly influenced by EU framework conditions and European interconnections. On the national level, the West-East differences were in the foreground in the 1990s; although they still exist to some extent, a highly integrated economic system has emerged overall, where rather center-periphery differences are noticeable, or economic spatial structures are shaped by regional clusters and transregional commodity chains. In structural terms, a progressive change to a service-based society has taken place over the past few decades. Although Germany is still the world champion in high-quality industrial goods, not only in terms of employment shares, but also generally in terms of supply and demand, a clear dominance of services has emerged. Greater scientific attention is also paid to the continuously realized innovations, which not only secure competitiveness, but also change the structures and location systems of all economic sectors – including seemingly traditional ones like agriculture and craftsmanship. The contributions of established scientists discuss the current structures and changes in Germany in sectoral and spatial terms. Regional case studies are taken into account in the individual branch-oriented chapters. All chapters refer to general theoretical and model considerations and transfer these to the regional example of Germany.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066446-6>
Lowering Energy Costs for Buildings : [Legal and Technical Know-how for Builders, Landlords and Property Managers ; Step-by-Step Guide to Using Renewable Energy Sources ; on CD-ROM: Excel Maintenance Planner, Sample Letters, Energy Checks, Glossary, Laws ; current: new Energy-Saving Laws - EEWärmeG, EEG, EnEV] ¤ The guide by expert authors (latest BA 11/07, 2/09) shows homeowners, builders, landlords and property managers what they can do to optimize the energy efficiency of their buildings. Initially, it deals with the new legal regulations and provisions, including the EnEV 2009, which came into effect in autumn, and the Renewable Energies Heat Act (EEWärmeG), as well as the legally correct approach to modernization measures. The focus is on the correct insulation of the building envelope, the replacement of old windows, the renewal of the heating system, the use of energy-saving building materials and the efficient use of renewable energies. Finally, funding programs for the individual measures are presented, as well as 5 examples of efficiently renovated residential buildings. With numerous practical examples, useful checklists, sample letters, glossary, and further tools and laws on CD-ROM. After W. Naumer (BA 5/08), U.

The labour market in Poland ¤ The report focuses on the presentation of labor market policy at high and rising unemployment, on programs for controlling employment effects at company closures and on reforms in the adult education system and in the education system in general. Chapter one summarizes the recent economic development and the development on the labor market. In chapter two, unemployment is investigated and the labor market effects at the transition to a market economy are examined in chapter three in a more detailed review. In total, the labor market in Poland is presented in comparison to the experiences of OECD countries.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8>
In the Land of Despair: An Israeli Travels in the Occupied Territories ¤ Palestinian daily life in the occupied territories, reportages by an Israeli author from the years 2014 and 2015. Review: The Israeli writer, previously known in Germany only as a novelist (2012), went to the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 2014/15 and also visited a kibbutz with a view of the Gaza Strip. His exciting and unsettling reportages, his conversations with Palestinians, settlers, young people and adults aim to show not only his fellow citizens (... the overwhelming majority of all Israelis ...) the partly unimaginable living conditions of the Palestinians. The political insight from his experiences is: The idea of separating the two peoples is outdated. A coexistence of two equal peoples must be organized, in whatever form.

Regional development problems and policies in Poland ¤ Hitherto, different regional developments have been largely absent in Poland. However, in the course of the transition to a market economy, disparities in income development, industrial infrastructure, general infrastructure, and employment are increasingly emerging. The study deals with the legacy of 40 years of planned economy and examines recent changes, regional differences, and regional policy goals and measures that have shown up in the wake of democratic government. In the form of case studies, two typical problem regions are presented: Upper Silesia, where the industry must be restructured, and the Zamosc region, a rural area. Based on examples from OECD countries, proposals are developed for regional policy in Poland.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049043-9>
Occupy! : the first weeks in New York ; a documentation ¤ After Tunis, Cairo, Madrid, Tottenham and Athens, the global wave of outrage has now reached the eye of the storm, Wall Street in New York. The activists, who occupied Zuccotti Park in the Financial District on September 17, 2011, fight under the motto 'We are the 99 percent' for social justice, the strict separation of economy and politics and design models for a more humane society in the 21st century. Immediately after the beginning of the protests, young journalists and activists came together to document the developments on site. In addition to atmospheric dense reports, this volume contains essays on the background and prospects of the movement, including texts by Judith Butler, Joseph E.

Quantum Physics for Dummies : [not for dilettantes, quantum physics; at a glance: complex expressions understand - from eigenvalue to oscillator; the latest research results; prepare successfully for exams; with exercises also difficult equations solve] ¤ S. Holzner is an award-winning author of physical and technical books (lastly BA 12/09) and was active as a professor at an American university for several years. He presents here an introduction to quantum physics, which is primarily aimed at students, but can also be used with benefit by participants in advanced high school courses. However, it is stated on the cover: "Not for dilettantes, quantum physics." It is assumed that thorough knowledge in the field of differential and integral calculus is required. In addition, one learns to handle matrices and vectors as needed. Topics include, among other things, the energy levels of particles, potential wells, harmonic oscillators, angular momentum and spin, the Schrödinger equation and many-particle systems. The "Top-Ten-Part" at the end includes ten web pages on quantum physics and further information on "Ten Highlights of Quantum Physics". Symbols point, among other things, to important equations and knowledge for experts. Notably, the constant effort to provide a good didactic presentation is to be emphasized.

Too Much of a Good Thing : Bonuses and False Reward Systems ¤ If one views wages as a trade for the product of work time and work force, then something must be wrong with manager salaries - or the equation only holds for low wages. But if wages, salary, and bonuses are not everything - what then? Could it be that recognition, self-worth, and self-esteem are more important? One could also play through how rewards in our society look like if one gave up the compensation idea. The insight that one does not always want to conquer, but to cooperate, is supported by findings from two quite different areas: both mathematical game theory and political philosophy have shown that cooperation pays off in the long run. To achieve this, however, we must not only extend the time horizons of our reward systems, but also reduce the dependence of completely different subsystems on each other. If politics tries to usurp science, transports its partly misunderstood standards to the media, economizes education, and makes the economy dependent on technical development and technology dependent on financial investment, then something is wrong. Individual and human image, technology, economy, and society are to be related to each other in a new way.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020310-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112532-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061963-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4168089-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071497-4>
A Little Night Physics: Stories from Physics ¤ This is not a strictly chronologically constructed history of physics, but a collection of well-readable episodes from the lives of physicists from various epochs. The author has understood how to present the otherwise mostly abstractly concerned scientists from their entirely human side in a generally understandable language, without losing themselves in mere chatter. The 35 chapters in total are thematically mostly arranged according to physical matters and biographically thus touch on several physicists each. Among the more than 200 named individuals, Aristotle, Bohr, Einstein, Feynman, Galilei, Heisenberg, Helmholtz, Maxwell, Newton, Pauli, Planck, Plato, Rutherford, Schrödinger, Sommerfeld, and Weizsäcker are mentioned most frequently. In style and structure, it is not directly comparable to similar titles. A little more illustrations would have done the otherwise very successful book good. Almost 100 sources of literature encourage a deeper engagement with the subject. Recommended for physicists, natural scientists, and interested laypeople. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045956-1>
Stromlagen : shaping urban river landscapes ¤ Publisher's information: Vacant areas along riverbanks, often near urban centers, can be found in almost all medium and large cities in Europe and America. Regional river landscapes such as the Rhine in the Cologne/Bonn region, the Seine in Paris or the Thames in London are increasingly being rediscovered and designed as attractive, urban living spaces. This book deals extensively with the revitalization measures of industrially shaped riverbanks. Based on already realized projects, in addition to urban planning measures, strategies for project development and financing as well as specific problems such as building with flood hazards are addressed. The first two parts of the book focus on the urban development potential of the Rhine banks, particularly the Rhine section of the Cologne/Bonn region. The comprehensive third part of the book forms a collection of 90 example projects from all over Europe.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186666-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4336028-2>
Now I Learn SUSE Linux : the Starter-Kit to SUSE Linux 9.1 & KDE 3.2 - with SUSE Linux 9.1 Live-CD ; [Start without Prior Knowledge] ¤ Linux, the alternative operating system to the Windows world, still enjoys great popularity among a smaller part of computer users. Beginner's works are therefore always a good decision, especially if the author or author, as in the present case, succeeds in explaining this system in a comprehensible way. The author's competence has already been proven in the predecessor titles (lastly BA 7/02) and in the present edition, their explanations are based on the current SuSE distribution 9.1 and the graphical interface KDE 3.2. In comparison to the predecessor (version 7.3) there are indeed significant differences, so it is recommended to exchange. Conceptually, less has been changed. Interested parties will find no detailed introduction, but a presentation oriented to practical needs. After installation and KDE explanation, it is mainly about surfing the Internet with Linux, writing emails or creating text documents. Those who want more can supplement their knowledge with Frank Gehrke: "Linux" (BA 9/04) or Michael Kofler (lastly BA 2/04). (1)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4787302-4>
Microsoft Exchange Server 2019 : the Administrator's Handbook ¤ Microsoft Exchange Server is a widely used groupware for collaboration within a group, especially the exchange of messages. This book describes the version 2019 available since the beginning of this year and is therefore a good replacement for the handbooks by Th. Joos, which describe the earlier versions (version 2016). Readers with prior knowledge are addressed; due to the well-explained numerous examples, access is also possible for beginners. The source code of all example files can be downloaded from the network. The author begins briefly with the essential innovations of the current version (high availability, support for Windows Server 2019 Core, new search engine, new metacache database, removal of Unified Messaging functions) and then focuses on configuration. Administration, operation, and maintenance of the new Exchange server.

Political Education Trend Report 2011 ¤ Democracy needs political education - political education makes a special contribution to the future of democracy by conveying information, reflecting on foundations and value decisions, and motivating engagement. In its educational offerings, political education deals with the theoretical and structural foundations of society and continuously checks them for their usability and future viability. It conveys knowledge that enables orientation and enables and encourages engagement in the sense of a living democracy. Based on the Political Education Prize, which was awarded for the first time in 2009, the present trend report provides an overview of exceptional activities and shows developments in political education.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046526-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121028-1>
Dyslexia - LRS: Models, Diagnosis, Therapy and Support: with ... 100 Exercise Questions ¤ Dyslexia is a recurring topic in teacher training. With questions about reading and writing difficulties (LRS), all aspiring teachers must deal with it: How often do reading-writing difficulties occur and how can they be recognized? How does LRS develop? What do we know about the causes? How can we support the children? The textbook answers these questions in a clear manner. In doing so, explanations of information processing, acoustic perception, neurology, biology, as well as social causes are discussed. The authors present diagnostic methods, common tests, prevention and intervention strategies in a critical comparison. In the 5th edition, especially updated and supplemented: current developments in cause research as well as latest tests in diagnostics. (Publisher's text)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074087-0>
The Secret of the Shortest Path: A Mathematical Adventure ¤ Driving from Munich to Hamburg on the shortest possible route is no great challenge: you just get on the autobahn and keep going straight. Planning a route through 15,112 places in Germany without visiting a single town or city twice is much harder. Ruth, 15, and not particularly enthusiastic about math, uses her new computer to explore the world of route planning and the math that goes with it, without which a 'traveling salesman' could never solve the problem posed above. 'This is a wonderful, relaxed introduction to a piece of math that can be roughly bounded by the keyword 'graph theory'. A graph is some things (the 'nodes') connected by some connections (the 'edges') between them. Where the nodes and edges are located is completely irrelevant, and what they mean? Everyone has the freedom to interpret these abstract structures in whatever way corresponds to their problem, and before you know it, you land on very concrete applications: how do the postman, the garbage truck, and the proverbial traveling salesman find the shortest paths to complete their respective tasks?' Spektrum der Wissenschaft ' ... The book is a pleasure not only for those who are first encountering the topics. Students can gain access to the field of efficient algorithms, and experienced readers will not regret the time they spend holding the book. We from the computer science community should forgive the authors the subtitle 'a mathematical adventure' for central computer science topics and buy, read, and also give the book to others.' Prof. Ingo Wegener in InformatikSpektrum 'The special thing about the book is how it tries to involve the reader and motivate them to work further.

German Autobiographies : 1690 - 1930 ; Workers, Scholars, Engineers, Artists, Politicians, Writers ¤ Not only with Goethe's Dichtung und Wahrheit does the autobiography become the most important literary form of self-determination. In contrast to letter and diary, its own tension lies in the fact that the private statement must be very precisely weighed with a view to a desired or undesired publication. For whoever reveals too much runs the risk of compromising himself or others. Once again, a great edition of the Digital Library. Here, 180 autobiographies have been compiled from the Pietist Francke (1690/91) to Jung-Stilling, Bismarck, Eichendorff, Gervinus, Hagenbeck, Lavater, von Ranke, Schliemann, R. Steiner up to the time of the Weimar Republic. Biographical novels and diaries were left out. It remains a wealth of over 76,000 pages that would not be manageable without the excellent preparation. The software is as clear as with all products in the series: With a fixed page layout, the alphabetical list of all authors is found on the left, and the text on the right. Full-text search, complex search, export, etc. is possible, installation and operation are simple. For large libraries, a treasure trove of otherwise hardly accessible texts.

Ecosystem Functions of River Floodplains: Analysis and Evaluation of Floodwater Retention, Nutrient Retention, Carbon Stock, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and Habitat Function; Results of the R&D Project (FKZ 3508 850 100) ¤ Floodplains offer humans a remarkable diversity of functions and services. This publication captures the contribution of river floodplains to floodwater retention, nutrient retention, and greenhouse gas retention, as well as their importance for biological diversity and puts a value on it. The investigation refers to the floodplains of 79 rivers with an area of 15,000 km2 and allows for an interregional assessment of the benefits that floodplains provide to our society.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4388664-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043216-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003484-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7583382-7>
Optics for Media Technicians: Optical Fundamentals of Media Technology: With 32 Exercise Tasks ¤ This book already points to its primary target group in the title: media technicians, media producers, media designers, and students of these fields. Primarily designed as a textbook, the title first describes the physical and biological fundamentals of light and color perception (eye structure, electromagnetic waves, light spectra), then various color systems, different methods of color mixing, or types of image creation techniques are presented. The descriptions are overall already understandable and very detailed, but mathematical and physical prior knowledge greatly facilitates the understanding of the partly complex contents. Numerous, consistently colored illustrations explain the text, each chapter closes with extensive control questions and arithmetic tasks, whose solutions are shown at the end of the book. - Conclusion: Overall, a more demanding but understandable title on the physical, biological, and technical fundamentals of optics for producers of digital media and students of corresponding fields.

Rules for Career and Profession: Success as an Employee and Leader ¤ Our economic system, in which employees and leaders operate, functions according to written and unwritten rules. However, while we are familiar with relevant rules in other areas, qualified and ambitious professionals in the economy are largely uninformed about the "mines" of job application, career planning/design, workday, job change/termination, and certificate questions. They have too short or too long service times per company, miss the "red thread" in their career progression, write unsuccessful job applications, treat their boss incorrectly, recklessly ruin their market value on the job market, and already set central switches incorrectly with their starting position. The book explains the most important rules of this (professional) "game" and points the way to success. The author, with 40 years of professional experience, is one of the most experienced experts in Germany and has been writing extensively about these topics in the VDI News for 20 years.

Scenarios and Potentials for Sustainable and Land-Saving Urban Development ¤ In Part 1, indicators of sustainable and land-saving urban development are first identified and the diverging city models "Compact City" and "Network City" are discussed. Using two case studies, scenarios and potentials of urban development are then shown. Subsequently, the most important strategies for land-saving urban development are filtered out and proposals for the further development of control and guidance instruments or framework conditions are presented. In Part 2, the approaches to land-saving and landscape-protecting urban development investigated in two case studies in various countries are documented and evaluated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177306-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061655-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123611-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063234-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116495-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4264023-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154523-0>
Batteries and Charging Techniques : the Practical Handbook for all Battery Types, Chargers and Charging Methods ¤ The author describes here again (1st edition: "The unofficial book for batteries, chargers", BA 10/09) all important, common battery types, the corresponding charging methods and provides important information on proper handling and maintenance of batteries to extend their lifespan. Compared to the aforementioned previous edition (which may be out of print) he has added the useful chapter "Basic Knowledge", as well as information on further battery types, as well as the chapters on car batteries and lithium batteries. The scope has thus increased by 56 pages, unfortunately also the price. Here the topic is treated even more generally than by L. Retzbach (ID-A 24/14), who goes into batteries for model making even more extensively. Widely recommended, as without batteries nothing works anymore today (neither laptop/notebook, tablet, smartphone, camera, etc. nor cars, emergency lighting, remote controls, etc.). (2) (Rita Weinheimer-Hartmann) After the basic knowledge, an overview of batteries used in everyday life is given and the necessary knowledge for effective use and careful handling is conveyed (correct storage, proper charging with good chargers, tricks to extend the operating time, charging with solar energy, etc.).

The Power of Maps : A History of Cartography from the Middle Ages to the Present ¤ The author, who teaches at TU in Darmstadt, conveys interesting, knowledgeable, and convincing that stored knowledge on maps (e.g. about routes, coast formations, etc.) can mean superior ability, hence: power. Less aware may be that maps not only show, but can also deliberately conceal that they are always egocentric products of cartographers, chosen projection methods, and can also be (among other things, politically motivated and manipulated) commissioned work (see already M. Monmonier: ID 5/97). The text is supported by a wealth of colorful, often large-format reproductions of annotated map examples. A publication that appears as an attractive picture book, is actually a first-class introduction! Since G. Sammet (cf. BA 2/91), it is certainly the most recommendable of the titles presented here on the history, significance, technique, art, and thematic branching of cartography.

New Spaces of Water Management : Investigations on Drinking Water Supply and Sewage Disposal in the Regions of Munich, Hanover and Frankfurt (Oder) ¤ The starting point of the investigations was the assumption that the three case regions are affected by the same overarching water management developments: Europeanization, regionalization of economic relationships, differentiation of consumption patterns, the emergence of new technical options, and commercialization, but otherwise exhibit different framework conditions. The case studies are similarly structured: After a brief description of the socio-economic development of the region, the structure and current changes in the regional water management are presented, followed by a more in-depth examination of the spatial "key issue". In the concluding Chapter 4, a comprehensive and comparative consideration of the case study results is carried out.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000306-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193371-0>
Healthier living - Harmonious living: Room inspirations for well-being ¤ How trees are to be designed so that they meet the demands of harmonious and healthy living is illustrated in this informative text-image book with practical examples. Much greenery, proper light, suitable colors, calming water and scents, as well as the best traditions of Eastern and Western housing are combined here. Installations that promote harmony and relaxation, ideas for revitalizing rooms and avoiding allergenic substances are shown. Considering health holistically, it is an important concern of the author, and aspects of environmental and resource protection are also highlighted. No specific style of living is in the foreground, the topic is transferable to different types of apartments. In times of the well-being and wellness wave, this book will certainly find a lot of support. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020754-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072819-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066761-3>

Stories from the Cinema ¤ Just 110 years old, film is almost 50 years of which has been decisively shaped, influenced, and shaped by the multi-talent Alexander Kluge - at least in Germany; as an author and director as well as a film theorist, film politician, and organizer. On his 75th birthday, he now takes stock in the form of over 100 stories, thought fragments, reflections, memories, and anecdotes and touches on all conceivable facets of cinema: the problems of lighting and set design; the silver content of the negative film is just as important to him as the questions of editing technique, montage, or film screening and projection. Naturally, the various problems of private and collective film reception are at the center, not to mention the many memorable memories of encounters with colleagues and actors.

Corporate Strategies in Competition: A Game-Theoretical Analysis ¤ The book deals with fundamental competition strategies of companies for cost leadership and product differentiation. This includes (from a short-term perspective) sales and pricing strategies and (from a long-term perspective) innovation, F- and E-, product, location, advertising, and standardization strategies. These strategies are examined individually with the help of game-theoretical concepts in the framework of simple models of oligopolistic competition. In addition to the strategic interaction in actual competition, the potential competition and the question of strategic barriers to market entry are also of interest. At the end of each chapter, there are corporate policy conclusions, learning control tasks, and literature references. The book can be used in the context of higher education (both in general and business economics events) and further education. The book has been completely revised and now contains two additional chapters, one on innovation competition, where spillover externalities are at the center, and a second on the taxonomy of corporate strategies. TOC:Foundations: Introduction and Overview.- Game Theory.- Cost Leadership and Competition in Homogeneous Oligopoly: Monopoly: Price Policy.- Price Competition.- Monopoly: Quantity Policy.- Quantity and Cost Competition.- Innovation Competition under Risk.- Innovation Competition with Spillover.- Product Differentiation and Competition in Heterogeneous Oligopoly: Variant-, Location-, and Quality Competition.- Advertising Competition.- Compatibility Competition.- Summary: Strategic Investments and Strategy Taxonomy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200234-5>
I'm Not Playing Along! : Effects of "Entertainment Violence" in Television, Video, and Computer Games - and What Can Be Done About It ; A Guide for Parents and Teachers ¤ The authors report an increasing number of violent depictions in electronic media and want to challenge these "child destroyers". From this perspective, they report how young people use entertainment media today, show what effects "entertainment violence" has on children and young people, and make proposals for what parents and educators can do against the "inner world pollution" of our youth. With a similar tone, but more systematic and founded, Rudolf H.

Warriors of Peace in the Rear : World War I and Contemporary Antimilitarism ¤ In the summer of 1914, there was not only war euphoria in Europe, but also war opponents in all countries. 24 representatives of this early peace movement come here with various contributions. With an explanatory introduction. (Helmut Lange) On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of World War I, it is often pointed out that there was general war euphoria in 1914, which even intellectuals and artists were caught up in. However, not everyone thought so, as there was already a peace movement in Europe at the end of the 19th century, which was pursued and silenced with the outbreak of war. This title attempts to bring back into public awareness the forgotten war opponents. 32 essays by 24 contemporary authors provide a representative overview of the wide range of antimilitarism. Among them are prominent names like Bertha von Suttner, Leo Tolstoi, Joseph Roth, Bernard Shaw, but also lesser-known ones like Ivan Bloch and Rosa Mayreder. The editor, a historian at the Vienna University of Economics, describes in the detailed introduction the history of this peace movement and its end in the war. He sees it from the Austro-Hungarian perspective. So, also little-known battlefields in Southeastern Europe come into view. A good completion of the World War 1 holdings.

Ecosystem Research Wadden Sea : Synthesis Report ; Basics for a National Park Plan ; Key Points ¤ The Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea was the subject of a research project since 1989, in which natural and economic scientists as well as the State Office for the National Park Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea were involved. The report on this is just published (Series of publications, No. 8); it contains in Part 1 the research results, a detailed area description and the planning framework, in Part 2 a conflict analysis and concepts for the future protection of the national park. In public, it is currently being controversially discussed. The present issue conveys in a brief summary the most important key points, but by no means replaces the study of the comprehensive report.

The New Women - Revolution in the Empire : 1900 - 1914 ¤ The title suggests a dry history book, but what the author (last ID-A 45/12) offers is a captivating time-tableau of the years before the 1st World War, which is by no means limited to women. She tells the story in an engaging way, describing the overall political situation, social currents, and typical visions of the time, illustrated by the life stories of many female protagonists. Citing many sources, she spans a range from the 1848 years (in 1897, the bicycle was attributed to have greatly changed the gender ratio; in 1900, the leadership of the paint shop at Siemens in Berlin was transferred to a woman) to the patriotic storm that swept up feminists in early 1914, and the rapid collapse of the triumphal march. In these tense years, new professional worlds opened up for women, sexuality was discussed publicly for the first time, and traditional patterns dissolved. On the other hand, there were inexcusable escapades of Wilhelm II, and in 1912, an association was founded to combat women's emancipation with nearly a quarter of its members being women. Highly recommended! (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018202-2>

The Network of the New Right: Who Leads Them, Who Finances Them, and How They Change Society ¤ Almost unnoticed by the public, a new and influential right-wing network of foundations, associations, media, and campaigns has grown in Germany. For years, Christian Fuchs and Paul Middelhoff have been tracking it: its public faces and those that lie in the shadows. For the book, they have traveled through Germany and Europe and met the key figures of the scene. They were on the trail of secret donors in Switzerland and with an AfD politician in Serbia. They had access to the house of the Identitarian Movement, were at a festival of guerrilla activists, and met the head of Germany's most successful hate site for a conversation in his kitchen. During the research, they were threatened, lied to, and caught up in the shitstorms of a right-wing troll army. This report reveals for the first time the full extent of the milieu - its ideological foundations, its leading figures, its important magazines, publishers, internet platforms, fraternities, and secret financiers. Many connections lead to the AfD, which has become the gravitational center of the movement. The authors show how the New Right is trying to take over the social center.

Mathematics for Engineers : an illustrative introduction for practical study ; with 141 exercise problems and solutions ; [with bridge course for beginners on CD-ROM] ¤ Publisher's text: "Mathematics in a relaxed atmosphere" is the guiding principle of this easily understandable textbook. In a narrative style and with many examples, the author not only illuminates higher mathematics, but also places the subject matter in relation to its applications. The entire mathematics important for the engineering student is treated in one volume. This is achieved by forgoing abstract heights and by a test-adequate subject selection that strictly aligns with the needs of the future engineer. The book can be used accompanying lectures or for self-study. The 141 exercise problems with solutions support the practice of the subject matter and are extensively worked out in the volume "Exercise problems for mathematics for engineers".

Islamic Fundamentalism ¤ Starting from an in-depth presentation of the history of Islamic fundamentalism, especially from an Anglo-Saxon and French research perspective, the ideological development towards terrorism is traced and concretized in country reports. The book is particularly characterized by the numerous maps and photos, as well as by a comprehensive collection of sources and materials, in which the Islamist thinkers themselves are heard and through a very clear page layout distinguished from other representations of the subject. Otherwise: It is increasingly difficult to qualitatively distinguish the incredible abundance of publications on the subject from each other, as one naturally cites each other in the meantime.

Microsoft Office Excel 2003 : compact, complete, competent ¤ This is apparently the successor to the "Magnum" guide to Excel 2002 by Günter Born (not discussed here). The present work is thematically built differently, but as the comparison of the commented overall brief overview "Quickview" shows, the new version also contains all relevant information for working with the spreadsheet program, from start and basic operation to table technology, design, reports and graphical presentation up to special techniques and macro- or VBA programming. As usual, everything is presented in a clear and understandable way, with many exemplary screenshots and enhanced by numerous useful additional notes. Although the book must not be purchased only because of the few innovations in version 2003 - Schels quoted in the appendix: "The software feature wars are over" - but if you want to offer another good, comprehensive handbook by an experienced author (lastly BA 3/04, see his almost simultaneously published, somewhat differently arranged, bound and expensive "Compendium"), you are right here.

More than Sun, Wind and Water: Energy for a New Era ¤ The electrical engineer worked as a developer in the industry and advises a group of inventors in the field of renewable energies. His strength is the thoroughness with which he analyzes the possibilities and limitations of conventional energy forms as well. For example, the unexcited discussion of nuclear power, which he opposes critically after careful examination of all arguments (a different point of view was taken by Jeanne Runber: "The Energy Dilemma", BA 3/08, and articles in "Secure Energy", BA 3/07). Energy storage and technical innovations are also treated in the illustrated non-fiction book, which is written in a clear and understandable way and is also suitable for students of higher classes.

Nazi Perpetrators in German Literature: The Challenge of Evil ¤ The study combines the thematization of the NS extermination apparatus and women who worked in it as protagonists, a double scandal. The author examines the works of Stephan Hermlin, Hans Lebert, Bernhard Schlink, Lukas Hartmann and Helga Schneider. These hold guilty women accountable afterwards, but grant them a non-excluding sense of justice. From the narrative perspective, it is precisely the impossibility of forgiveness that sparks interest in perceiving the interconnections of good and evil, victims and perpetrators. This requires comprehensive cognitive abilities, even for the reader. The book concludes by summarizing the contribution of the novel to the processing of the past. The author addresses the question of how the experience of the negative contributes to human self-awareness and thus also to turning towards the other human being.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1147293449> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050479-7>

Roppongi : Requiem for a Father ¤ As I stayed with my family in Tokyo three years ago, where we lived in the Roppongi district, Josef Winkler writes about his new book, >>my father died at the age of 99, who told me a year before his death, after he had learned that I had not scattered cornflowers or peonies on a farmer from my hometown in my last prose volume, in a short but dramatic telephone monologue that, if it were to happen, I should not attend his funeral. When we heard of his passing, I stood in front of a large glass wall in the Austrian Embassy in Tokyo. I looked out at a pond with orange-colored Wakinfish, as a heron with its wings spread wide landed at the edge of the pond. My dead father had thus, I thought in that moment of grief and happiness, looked at me again in the form of a white heron before he was buried under the earth with his long, thin red legs, his earthy, long, pointed beak, in search of the worms of his future grave in Roppongi. His curse had been fulfilled; we did not return, but stayed in Roppongi.<< 11 episodes, starting from a reading tour through Japan, take up Winkler's familiar themes such as his hatred and desperation feelings towards the father, death and necrophilia again.

Philo : PharmaInnovationsLotse ; Your Way to Successful Open Innovation Management ¤ The present guide is one of the results of the research project „Open Innovation in Life Sciences“ (OIL), which was carried out at the University of Potsdam from May 2008 to April 2011. It claims to support innovation managers in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) of the pharmaceutical industry in the introduction of open innovation management. The objective of the research project was to (1) analyze the opportunities and risks of open innovation, taking into account the requirements of pharmaceutical SMEs in particular, and (2) to derive from this a concept for the implementation of open innovation in pharmaceutical SMEs. The starting point of the project was the recognition that the life sciences sector in general and the pharmaceutical industry in particular are characterized by increasing complexity of innovation processes and a growing trend towards cooperation. Against this background, the open innovation approach opens up new design and growth opportunities for the pharmaceutical industry. Open innovation – defined as the deliberate opening of innovation processes and the strategic integration of the company's environment – is described as a central success factor for innovation capability.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7732141-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031031-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045696-1>

Smart City : Innovations for the Networked City - Business Models and Management ¤ The societal-political pressure of the energy transition combined with the promising possibilities of a networked, decentralized world within the framework of the 'Internet of Things' (IoT) accelerates the transformation of cities towards Smart Cities. While there are some lighthouse cities like Barcelona, Lyon, and Vienna that exploit the potential, most cities have a huge catch-up demand. The gap between leading Smart Cities and lagging cities is growing, the need for action is often recognized, but the ways are often unclear for decision-makers. What are the core elements of a Smart City? What steps from analysis to Sweet Spot to action concept are to be taken? Where is the potential greatest? Where should we start? How do other cities do it and what have they learned so far? What can be learned from Greenfield approaches of Chinese Smart Cities? Which methods and tools can cities apply? What are the business models for the involved companies? How can the different stakeholders be well integrated? This book provides answers to these questions as well as numerous examples. The book is based on several years of research in the field of Smart City on a national and international level. The authors also bring their extensive experience from practice projects from politics, administration, and economy in the implementation of Smart City projects.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1061057097> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7737985-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161817-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056730-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123065-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078604-3>
Economy of Sufficiency : essays on wealth in diversity, enjoyable limits and creating commons ¤ Another summit of change, known as Rio+20, has passed in summer 2012, nourishing the rumours of a green economy. Building up a green economy seems to be the all over recipe for different crises of capitalism, among them climate change and resource scarcity. Yet efficiency and consistency, as their main strategies, do not suffice to reach sustainable levels, as they cause rebound effects and keep stimulating economy growth. Obviously, there are limits to green growth, too. Can we conceive an economy, and respective economic institutions, that serve human needs and wealth without a built-in necessity to grow? What kind of political, mental, and individual changes does a sufficiency economy require? And what are perspectives and policies to actually start implementing it? Just before Rio +20 the symposium "Economy of Sufficiency", devoted to Wolfgang Sachs on the occasion of his 65th birthday in 2011, examined these questions in three dimensions. Accordingly this selection of contributions to the symposium follows the chapters "Wealth in diversity" (Ashok Khosla, Marianne Gronemeyer, Vandana Shiva), "Enjoyable limits" (Richard B. Norgaard, Tim Jackson) and "Creating commons" (Ezio Manzini, Silke Helfrich). The essays indicate the historical development of the ideas on a sufficiency economy. Wandering through discourses of sustainable development for several decades, the authors map the range of perspectives, practices as well as barriers and bridge them between cultures, agencies and schools.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7660153-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4402290-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178391-8>
Rock Science: A Guide for Beginners and Users ¤ In the first part of the well-structured and excellently illustrated book, which includes photos (mostly of hand specimens), tables, and diagrams, the basic knowledge of rock science, the minerals forming rocks, and the magmatic, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks are explained in a clear and understandable way. These rocks are formed according to the corresponding geological conditions within the rock cycle and their classification. This part is also suitable for interested laypeople. The slightly longer chapter on 'Technical Rock Science' is particularly interesting for users, such as civil engineers and environmental technicians, as well as students in corresponding fields. It deals with the properties and use of loose and solid rocks, the relevant regulations (standards), field and laboratory investigation and evaluation methods. There are exercise tasks for each chapter. 'Minerals and Rocks' (BA 1/09) and 'Rock Determination in the Field' (ID 9/06) have different focuses and include less technical application. Highly recommended for the corresponding readership.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020740-7>

Status Work under Pressure? : On the Life Conduct of the Middle Classes ¤ Who or what are the middle classes? How are they doing? What are they doing (against it)? What does their aggregated individual and collective action achieve for society as a whole? This text, conceived as a discussion stimulus, addresses these questions, conceptually drawing primarily on Bourdieu. The middle classes differ from the lower classes and the upper class primarily in that they work purposefully with and on 'status' (social capital, e.g. through qualification). In this regard (especially in terms of the related planning and controllability) the middle classes - in times of growing subjective and objective uncertainty (e.g. financial crisis, pension provision, parallel societies) - are increasingly irritated, overburdened, and threatened. The authors (sociologists at the University of Bremen) shed light on (often crisis-exacerbating) coping strategies and show that the middle classes (e.g. as yield-oriented small investors) are not only victims, but also perpetrators. The book offers no solutions, but replaces many 'advisors'; despite sometimes dense diction, highly recommended. (2) The middle classes often and increasingly see themselves as losers of political and societal developments. The stimulating book provides an overview of the problem situations and shows that the middle classes are not only victims, but also perpetrators within the comprehensive crisis phenomenon.

Biomonitoring of Zoobenthos at selected sites in the Elbe: Preliminary investigations on local and temporal variability including documentation ¤ In October 1991, the growth on 39 stones from stone accumulations at Geesthacht in the tide-free area of the Elbe was analyzed. Among the 17 species found in the stone accumulations, Chironomida larvae, Potamopyrgus jenkinski, Gammarus tigrinus, and Cordylophora caspia were classified as frequent. Three weeks later, 14 sediment samples were taken from the mixed sediment of the Mühlenberger Loch in the tide-influenced area of the Elbe. 13 species were found, with only the Tubificids being frequent, with the species Potamothrix moldaviensis, Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, and L. claparedeanus dominating.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4295330-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224449-3>
Selman Selmanagić and the Bauhaus ¤ Selman Selmanagic (1905–1986) is one of the important representatives of Bauhaus ideas after 1933. As the head of the architecture department at the Berlin-Weißensee Art Academy, he was a highly influential professor and a shaping designer for the workshops in Dresden-Hellerau from 1950 onwards. He came to the Bauhaus for architectural studies, having previously been trained as a carpenter in Srebrenica. After being drafted in 1932, he traveled to Turkey and Palestine, and later worked in the office of Egon Eiermann. From 1945, he worked in the planning collective under Hans Scharoun on the plans for the reconstruction of Berlin. In 1950, his 'Youth Stadium of the World' was built on Chausseestraße. In the same year, he was appointed head of the architecture department at the Berlin-Weißensee Art Academy by Mart Stam, and as a popular and charismatic professor, he was able to exert a great influence on the training of architects in the GDR – through his working methods and course content, he affected generations of students, despite the GDR's departure from modern and industrialized building. The results of his long-term collaboration with the German Workshop from Dresden-Hellerau, as well as his interior designs for numerous schools and exhibition pavilions, are considered classics of modern design. The monograph on Selman Selmanagic, prepared by Aida Abadžic Hodžic on behalf of the Bosniak Institute in Sarajevo and published in Sarajevo in 2014, is now available in German translation and closes a research gap on the aftermath of the Bauhaus after 1933	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130303-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129921-8>
Forest Growth Knowledge-Based Software Systems on the Basis of TreeGrOSS - Application and Theoretical Foundations ¤ Against the backdrop of changing framework conditions and increasing demands on a multifunctional forestry, decision-making for forest managers is becoming increasingly complex. Computer-based forest decision support systems provide assistance in solving complex planning tasks and can be adapted to changed framework conditions and questions. At the Northwest German Forest Research Institute, three decision support systems were implemented for different fields of application and target groups, which are continuously updated and further developed: the ForestSimulator, the Forest Planner, and the Web Business Planner. All three systems are based on the forest growth library TreeGrOSS. (Tree Growth Open Source Software). In this volume, the functions and operation of the three systems are described first, and then the models and methods used are extensively documented and explained.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155059-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055382-6>
The War Has No Female Face ¤ Publisher's information: Approximately one million women fought in the Red Army during World War II, but their fate has nowhere been recorded. In this book, their memories are now documented. The women describe the unheroic side of war, which is usually left out of stories and memories. In contrast to the men who returned from war, the female soldiers were by no means considered heroines, but rather met with distrust, yes, with contempt. Svetlana Alexievich gives the women a voice in this devastating book for the first time. The result is a deeply moving, unsentimental, and yet almost lyrical document	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076906-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018202-2>
Black Book Cotton: What We Really Wear on Our Skin ¤ Sustainability does not come for free - not even when it comes to what we wear on our skin. Cotton, which is already ecologically questionable, is becoming more expensive and scarce. The era of cheap T-shirts is coming to an end - a fascinating outlook.-- Based on his long-standing experience in the textile industry, Engelhardt has in-depth knowledge of the global textile market. His focus is not only on cotton, as the misleading title suggests, but also on other natural and synthetic textile fibers. He deals with the importance of different fibers for the future development of the industry. He considers aspects such as sustainability and environmental impact, durability and suitability, e.g. for sports clothing or airbags, as well as the consequences of agricultural subsidies in industrialized countries for African small farmers, all backed by statistical data. While he predicts a decreasing importance of cotton, he sees a strong trend towards products made from cellulose fibers and polyester. This look at the developments in the textile industry is not comparable to the cultural and economic historical representation by W. Mönnighoff: "King Cotton" (BA 12/06) or the popular insight into the world economy by P. Rivoli: "The Travels of a T-Shirt" (BA 6/06).

Competence-based teaching at the university ¤ The book deals with the overall context of good university teaching from the perspective of the competence debate. It presents theoretical and historical backgrounds of the competence debate, develops a competence-based action theory, and presents current learning psychological findings for university teaching. On this theoretical basis, the consequences are derived in the second, practical part of the book (from Chap. 5) that the previously introduced backgrounds have for the target group of the series, namely university teachers. In a large arc, this is therefore thought and led together, what in the previous volumes of the series is dealt with good teaching with a respective focus - such as reducing material, advising students, testing or supervising them - is dealt with. Instead of focusing on individual facets of good teaching, this book shows the overall context of good university teaching and its backgrounds. In doing so, the theoretically and practically oriented threads are brought together.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069342-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125926-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4241291-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136714-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/104776640X> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195141-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072560-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025226-7>

The text is suitable for basic studies from the third semester and assumes in addition to basic knowledge of algorithms and data structures a solid understanding of C programming.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4337730-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006216-8>
Novemberpogrom 1938 : the eyewitness accounts of the Wiener Library, London ¤ Between November 1938 and February 1939, the Jewish Central Information Office (now the Wiener Library, London), founded by Alfred Wiener, collected a total of 355 eyewitness accounts of the November pogrom. The reports come from all over the German Reich, from small villages, from larger cities such as Frankfurt am Main, Berlin, and Vienna, even from concentration camps. They were written by witnesses of diverse origins immediately after and in part during the anti-Semitic violence organized by the Nazi regime. No other collection of sources documents the escalation of anti-Jewish violence in November 1938, the events of 9 and 10 November themselves, and the consequences of the pogrom for the Jewish population of the German Reich as closely in time. The first complete edition of this unique collection of eyewitness accounts provides an immediate insight into the situation of German Jews in 1938, in which the persecution to which they were exposed became radically more severe.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135539-8>
Alternative Antriebe : so fahren wir in die Zukunft ¤ Large-format reference book with an overview of current and development-stage drive systems for passenger cars. (Michael Müller) How future mobility and individual traffic will shape up is not yet predictable. With rising oil prices and decreasing subsidies, there are different options, e.g. reducing consumption. For several years, vehicles with hybrid technology (combination of combustion and electric motor, e.g. the Prius) have been available. In development and small series, electric drives and in the near future, fuel cells are to serve as a drive. The contributions, partly from articles in the trade magazine, inform vividly with many photos and images around 'drives'. Sometimes the articles appear unmanageable in the magazine style, e.g. when tables, images, technical data, drawings, and highlighted special information are combined on 2 pages. While fuel saving with current models is mentioned, alternatives such as voluntary renunciation of cars or public transportation are missing. In this compilation and theme, there is currently no comparable title (on newer drive types, lastly 'Hybrid', ID-G 38/07).

Wall Stories of Escape and Rescue: Encounters with Eyewitnesses ¤ How did the Berliners deal with the arbitrary act of building the wall from August 1961 onwards? What did the division of Berlin mean for them personally, and how did they try to solve the resulting problems? In this volume, which goes back to a series of events at the Berlin Wall Memorial, people from East and West tell their experiences and the associated dangers: A former convinced FDJ secretary explains his desertion as a border guard and tells how the Stasi pursued him in the West; two couples describe the adventurous ways they found each other despite the impenetrable border; and escape helpers explain how they built tunnels for friends and relatives. The stories provide insights into how the wall interfered with life plans and how it was always possible to undermine the border regime.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001307-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017598-4>

Securing the Exit from Nuclear Power: Why Germany Needs Nuclear Competence for Decommissioning, Reactor Safety, Waste Disposal, and Radiation Protection ¤ Introduction -- How the safety of nuclear facilities can be ensured until their shutdown -- What needs to be done regarding waste and disposal -- Why radiation protection is an important concern at all times -- but especially during the decommissioning of power plants -- The role of research and teaching in training the next generation -- Outlook: Research from a global responsibility and the importance of communication from science -- . Bibliography. In response to the accident at the Japanese nuclear power plant Fukushima Daiichi, Germany will exit nuclear power within a decade, becoming the first industrial nation to do so. However, with the decision to exit nuclear energy, Germany will not become nuclear-free overnight. Rather, it is necessary to ensure a safe operation of the nuclear power plants at the highest safety standards until the planned exit date in 2022. In addition, the decommissioning of the shut-down nuclear power plants and the still unresolved waste disposal problem will occupy society for decades to come. The German Academy of Science and Engineering has taken the exit from nuclear energy use in Germany as an opportunity to bring together central aspects of the current state of nuclear energy. The result is the statement's conclusion: The exit from nuclear energy must not be synonymous with an exit from nuclear competence.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4226736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030318-4>

In the Middle Ages: A Handbook for Time Travelers ¤ Entertaining, popular science presentation of everyday life and the life of the common man in 13th century England using a 'travel guide'. Also understandable for students. Review: Historian Ian Mortimer follows his 'travel guide' for 13th century England with the approach that otherwise dry history is better 'grasped' if it 'happens' and not already past. Due to the approach more popular science, but therefore very entertaining and also easily understandable for students, the author describes in detail and always scientifically correct the everyday life of medieval people in all its facets. The reader learns on a 'stroll' through the era, among other things, how to dress, feed and behave in a contemporary manner. The German edition has a special foreword preceding it, in which Mortimer explains the differences and parallels between German and English high medieval history. The book is illustrated with some color pages with original images and contains an appendix with source and image references. - Due to the special approach to the topic for history collections with a broad spectrum: (2 S)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001307-8>
Civilization or Barbarity? : Islam in Historical Context ¤ In the ongoing debate about Islam, critics and apologists alike are working themselves to the point of exhaustion, losing sight of the very issue at hand. In contrast, Alexander Flores advocates for an expansion of the horizon beyond the current boundaries. He can show that, over wide stretches of Islamic history, the dominance of religion over life has hardly restricted human freedom, creativity, and productivity. It was only certain modern developments that contributed to this change to a certain extent. However, the reasons for this lie not necessarily in the logic of Islamic thinking and action, so that Muslims today have the opportunity to understand their religion in a human-friendly way, if they want to and if one gives them the opportunity to do so.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128337-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027743-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033229-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4351632-4>
Sozialpädagogische Beschäftigungsförderung : Life Management and Competence Development in Youth and Young Adulthood ¤ Vocational promotion has become a central task and field of work for social pedagogy more than ever. Based on the structural change of the working society and the changes in labor market and education policy, it faces the challenge of reviewing its professional approaches and reorienting itself socially. It can no longer assume a largely linear labor market integration of young people, which it accompanies with accompanying and substitutive measures. In this way, the current discussion on life management and competence development in pedagogy opens up a horizon in which the relationship between work, education, and economy is determined anew. It is obvious that the education system as a whole cannot be positioned either unilaterally as a system separated from labor market contacts or - and equally unilaterally - as a mere preparation instance with the goal of successful transitions into the professional world. Against this background, this book provides an introduction to social pedagogical vocational promotion. In addition to this, the question of how transition structures for young people in employment can be socially pedagogically reoriented and designed is at the center of the contributions.

Introduction to Technical Mechanics: Kinematics ¤ Publisher's text: The book deals with the kinematics of the point and the rigid body. In the subsequent kinematics, the translational motion of rigid bodies is first considered in a didactically proven manner. This is followed by the treatment of general motions with applications to planar cases and pure rotation. Further special evaluations of the kinematic fundamental laws concern vibrations with different degrees of freedom, impact processes, and rotor movements in space. For systems of rigid bodies with constraints, the fundamental laws are transformed into Lagrange's equations of the second kind. Finally, in view of the increasing dissemination of computer-supported calculation methods, the formulation of the elastokinetic initial-boundary value problem is offered.

Cathedrals for Waste ¤ The sculptor Winfried Baumann (* 1956) poses questions about social responsibility and the perception of contemporary societal forms with his works. His themes are of great topicality: in terms of content in relation to social and urban planning visions, formally as a transgression of the boundaries between free visual art and applied design. For over thirty years, Winfried Baumann has been dealing with the increasingly pressing ecological problem that has become a matter of survival for civilized society. Waste, slag from incineration, used oil and other waste products of our consumer society are materials that he has used since the mid-1980s for his plastic work and his expansive installations. In the extensive work group 'Cathedrals for Waste', the artist deals with, among other things, waste disposal facilities for megaurban spaces, the securing and marking of areas contaminated with nuclear radiation, waste dumps for urban interstices and the theme of Urban Mining	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4373822-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046277-8>

Overview of Cloud Storage Providers ¤ Through the increasingly strong flood of digital information, more and more applications are based on the use of cost-effective cloud storage services. The number of providers offering these services has increased significantly over the past few years. To find the right provider for an application, various criteria must be individually considered. In the present study, a selection of established basic storage service providers is presented and compared with each other. For the comparison, criteria are extracted that are applicable to each of the investigated providers and thus allow for a possibly objective assessment. These include, among other things, costs, law, security, performance, and provided interfaces. The presented criteria can be used to evaluate cloud storage providers with regard to a specific application case.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4600802-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7623494-0>

Combined Economic Stimulus and Climate Policy: Opportunity for the German Environmental Industry? ¤ In response to the financial and economic crisis governments have enacted measures with the dual purpose of stimulating the economy and pursuing climate policy goals. Some German suppliers of environmental technologies have attained leading positions in the global market and may have profited from these subsidies. The present analysis investigates from a theoretical point of view whether the combination of economic stimulus and climate policy can be a sensible strategy. Case studies present the economic stimulus packages of selected countries. By analysing business reports and polling manufacturers in the renewable energy sector the authors established whether the manufacturers were really able to benefit from the economic stimulus. The effect of the German stimulus packages in the field of energy efficiency was tested by means of an input-output analysis. The results show that German manufacturers in the renewable energy sector could profit little from the economic stimulus packages of other countries. In Germany an estimated 3.3 billion euros has flowed into energy efficiency programmes as a result of the stimulus packages. This generated an additional final demand of around 8 billion euros.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068598-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547705-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113437-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032128-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130981-9>

The Bats of Europe: Know, Identify, Protect ¤ This clearly structured field guide with photos of the species, distribution maps, descriptions of the characteristics, sounds, habitats, quarters, behavior, and food, as well as hints on space use and endangerment sees itself as a successor to the identification books by W. Schober and E. Grimmberger (BA 2/88 and 2/99). The directory of individual species (44 European and North African species and further brief descriptions of species from adjacent areas) is preceded by comprehensive introductory chapters on protection, biology, orientation, and identification methods. The book also offers a dichotomous identification key. It is primarily aimed at young researchers and active nature conservationists, but it should also broaden the interest in this independent order (bats) of mammals. In smaller libraries, the less comprehensive and correspondingly more affordable identification aids by Klaus Richarz may already be sufficient: "Bats in their habitats" (ID-B 13/12) or "Observe, recognize, and protect bats" (ID-B 9/11).

Current Development and Perspectives of Biogas Production from Bio Waste and Manure: Final Report ¤ Manure and bio waste are still causing relevant greenhouse gas emissions due to the necessary storage, treatment, and utilization. They are already being used in biogas plants to provide renewable energy. However, there are still potential for expansion for this use path. Mobilizing the material flows seems to be extremely complex and difficult. Therefore, the state of knowledge was depicted in this project report to identify existing obstacles and possibilities for mobilizing manure and bio waste for biogas production and to derive practical action proposals from this. In addition, a proposal for adapting the EEG funding was developed, which is intended to encourage the use of manure in biogas plants, but also points out that, in accordance with the polluter pays principle, measures in agriculture should be considered. Proposals for the increased use of bio waste in fermentation plants refer, for example, to the increased separate collection of biowaste, the promotion of bio waste fermentation plants within the EEG, and assistance for municipalities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017625-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061643-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145600-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172777-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4451877-8>
Handbook of Sociological Theories ¤ Despite all the crisis talk, sociology has developed an extraordinary productivity in recent years. Not least in the field of general theory formation, a wide range of innovations and developments can be observed. As a result, the spectrum of sociological fundamental theories has not only undergone a considerable expansion, but also remarkable rearrangements. The "Handbook of Sociological Theories" provides an overview of the differentiated and extensively branched sociological theory landscape of the present. In more than twenty individual contributions, the currently most important theory offers, starting with the Actor-Network-Theory, over Feminist Theories and Practice Theories to the Understanding Sociology, are presented and discussed. The well-readable contributions introduce the premises and conceptual starting points of the individual theoretical approaches, outline their conceptual orientations and central argumentation lines in compressed form, discuss the objections of the critics as well as the responses of their protagonists, and position the approaches in the international theory discourse. The Handbook of Sociological Theories is distinguished by the breadth of the selected theory selection, its content design, and the quality of its individual contributions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077628-1>

Excellently illustrated, this volume shows the most beautiful and unusual vehicles in the workers' and peasants' state, which significantly enlivened the street scene in East Germany.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026665-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076001-7>
The Ultimate Practice Book for Windows 8: [for PC & Tablets] ¤ Data Becker's "ultimate practice book" seems to be establishing itself as an informal series. A total of 4 titles were published last year. According to Boris Mayer: "... Mountain Lion OS X 10.8 (ID-A 49/12) is covered by the present guidebook as the 2nd major operating system. The versatile author (lastly "Skype", ID-A 30/12) presents Windows 8 in 3 large sections: Under "first steps" Hollecker summarizes work with the new surface and individual settings (also on the tablet PC), the extensive middle part is dedicated to all important applications, the conclusion is a section on security and troubleshooting. The book is well accessible through table of contents, index and color guide system, it offers reliable information in short sections, extensively commented step-by-step instructions and (in text boxes) useful additional information, supported by numerous screenshots. A comprehensive manual not only for beginners, according to W. Gieseke (ID-A 46/12) and in addition to e.g. "Microsoft Windows 8 for users" (ID-A 50/12) usable. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1027290302>
Stalin and the Genocide ¤ Under Stalin, more than a million Soviet citizens were killed in the 1930s, while millions more died from forced labor, deportation, famine, imprisonment, or during torture interrogations. These crimes were not considered genocide during the Cold War era. The high ideals that Stalin allegedly fought for prevented a confrontation. Moreover, this persecution of their own population was seen as part of the war preparation; the outcome of World War II seemed to justify this approach. Even under international law, the murder of social or political minorities was not considered genocide. Norman Naimark expands the criteria for genocide – the UN conventions of 1948 were influenced by great Soviet influence – and can thus demonstrate that the mass murder ordered by Stalin was a genocide. He tells the shocking stories of systematic destruction. He examines the subjugation and extermination of the so-called kulaks, the Holodomor, i.e., the murder by hunger in Ukraine, the suppression and murder of 'enemies of the people' and the Great Purge between 1936 and 1938. And he concludes that the genocide – similar to the Holocaust – was not possible without the figure of the charismatic dictator.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063690-2>

Theory of the Subject: Subjectivity and Identity between Modernity and Postmodernity ¤ Diverse cultural and social phenomena have been repeatedly explained in recent decades by pointing to the crisis or collapse of the subject in late modernity and postmodernity. In his book, Peter V. Zima provides an overview of the most important theoretical positions on the topic of subjectivity and identity, which underlie such explanations. The interdisciplinary study presents the concept formation and the state of discussion in philosophy, psychology, sociology, and literary science in detail. From a critical engagement with the subject problem in modernity and postmodernity (from Descartes and Kant to Adorno and Lyotard) emerges in the final chapter the outline of a dialogical subjectivity, which becomes the basis for a dialogical theory.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176267-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183903-1>
Joomla! 2.5 : the big book ; [from quick start to professional website ; plan, create & implement content ; adapt or develop templates ; extend Joomla! with plugins, components and modules] ¤ Joomla! enjoys great popularity among users of content management systems. This year, version 2.5 was released for use and Daniel Koch has revised his previous edition for this CMS release (Joomla! 1.7, ID-A 46/11). The trend of adding a little more in each new edition continues in this book. The scope has increased by 209 pages.

Chapters and subchapters on the topics of multilingualism, Aristeer Template Engine, and BreezingForm Form Editor have been added. The final chapter was designed as a red thread for setting up a Joomla! website. Thought for error prevention for beginners and inexperienced users. While there is nothing to complain about in terms of understandability, the quality of the images leaves something to be desired in some parts. Nevertheless, a good title for beginners and switchers and the first for the current version.

Companies in Court: Global Battles for Human Rights ¤ Workers in Bangladesh, trade unionists in Colombia, and rural communities in Sudan are no longer tolerating the crimes of powerful economic giants. Supported by two human rights lawyers, they travel to the affected, they go to court, they are in the right. In September 2012, 260 workers die in a fire at a textile factory in Karachi, Pakistan. This spectacular case is just one example of countless others. Every day, people and natural resources are exploited by companies around the world, often with deadly consequences. This time, the outcry is not silenced. The affected people are fighting against Western companies that profit from cheap labor in South Asia, but show no concern for their safety. They sue the German clothing discounter KiK, supported by Berlin human rights lawyers: They want to hold transnational companies accountable for working conditions in their subsidiaries and suppliers abroad. For this, the Pakistani delegation will make their voice heard at the trial in spring 2016 at the Dortmund district court. The author duo describes their cases - in addition to KiK, against pharmaceutical companies, against Nestlé, the Danzer Group, and the engineering company Lahmeyer - the work of their human rights organization ECCHR, their hopes, defeats, successes, and above all, what everyone can learn from the resistance in the global South: In addition to legal means, boycotts, strikes, and protests finally force companies to change their ways. "On just under 120 pages, Wolfgang Kaleck and Miriam Saage-Maaß do not only provide a wealth of information about the work of their human rights organization ECCHR - European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights all over the world. But they also analyze the complex relationships between economic power structures and human rights violations" (deutschlandfunk.de)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061963-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047577-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4276272-8>
Morphology of Large Fungi ¤ Large fungi include all higher fungi from a visible size of approximately 2 to 4 mm, without there being a uniform and generally accepted definition. This representation of forms (morphology) takes into account - as far as necessary - also the anatomy of the fungi. It is not primarily aimed at experts or students of biology, but rather at practitioners in general, who from various motives have to or want to deal with mycological problems; in the guide, the edible mushroom collector is also mentioned by name. To better understandability for this broad target group, the volume is supplemented with a comprehensive glossary and register, which also lists German names. The text is excellently accompanied by photos, with notes directly added to the images in some cases. Nevertheless, it is likely that, in addition to strong interest in mycology, a solid basic understanding of biology will be necessary, at least to some extent.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046076-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045572-5>

Case Studies on Computer-Aided Conflict Analysis Using Virtual Battlespace 3 as an Example ¤ From the introduction: The initiative for this project originated about two years ago at the planning office of the Federal Armed Forces in Taufkirchen. Various software products are already in use there. The development of a new, specifically tailored software system for the needs of the office is very time-consuming and requires a lot of time. Therefore, one is willing to buy established products available on the market. One assumes that these products are reliable, as they are already used in various armed forces around the world.

The Secret of Transcendental Numbers: A Somewhat Different Introduction to Mathematics ¤ More than 2,000 years lie between the point in time when the task of squaring a circle with compass and straightedge was formulated and the negative solution in the 19th century, namely the proof that the circle number is not a zero of a rational polynomial, thus transcendental. Exactly this way, in modern form, is followed by the author here. Almost in a conversational tone, yet always exactly and without gaps, he leads the reader from the introduction of number systems through the required areas of algebra and analysis to the solution, a project-oriented introduction to wide areas of theoretical mathematics. He always takes the time for methodical considerations, cross-references, and also anecdotal color splashes. The reader feels included in the struggle for the right way to the goal. It is consistent that at the end, in addition to the latest results, open questions also stand. The substantial, almost unparalleled work in the German-language specialist literature can be recommended with great emphasis to connoisseurs who will still find much more original, and beginners as an introduction. (2 S) (Wolfgang Grölz) A project-oriented comprehensive introduction that leads from the beginnings of the concept of numbers through all important areas of theoretical mathematics to the proof of the transcendence of the circle number and thus the impossibility of a constructive squaring of the circle.

Socialism ¤ An introductions to the history of democratic socialism are plentiful. The advantage of this overview lies in the fact that development is focused entirely on the current state of affairs. The Dortmund political scientist, renowned as an expert on the subject, describes the history from the beginning of the 19th century, from early socialism through Marx-Engels, the numerous modifications of their teachings such as revisionism, the SPD's programmatic and communism, to the theory of social democracy in the 20th century. From this historical perspective, the author is always concerned with the question of the political implementation of theoretical demands. He convincingly shows the entanglement of social democracy with political liberalism, particularly in the current situation. As an introduction for students and valuable orientation aid for all readers interested in the history of political ideas.

Dream Work before Freud : Source Texts on Dream Psychology in the Late 19th Century ¤ This source collection contains five significant dream writings of the late 19th century in reprint. In addition to Ludwig Strümpell's pioneering study on The Nature and Origin of Dreams (1874) and Johannes Volkel's book on The Dream-Phantasy (1875), in which the natural philosophical concept of unconscious symbolizing dream activity is discussed in a variety of own dreams, the volume also brings together smaller, now difficult to access contributions, such as Friedrich Wilhelm Hildebrandt's completed essay The Dream and its Utilization for Life (1875) and W. Robert's writing introducing the concept of 'dream work' The Dream as a Natural Necessity Explained (1886), as well as Friedrich Scholz's popular treatise on Sleep and Dream (1887).

Deins ist meins : the uncomfortable truths of the Sharing Economy ¤ With the promise of exchange, community, sharing, and mutual benefit, the Sharing Economy was once started. However, resistance is increasingly growing against this industry, which offers private services on demand through internet platforms. For now, these IT providers have become large corporations that, by circumventing legal regulations, creating precarious jobs, and evading taxes, earn billions of dollars. Airbnb (overnight stays) and Uber (ride services) are the most well-known international providers of this kind. Tom Slee presents in his comprehensive investigation the emergence, business practices, and negative consequences for the affected service providers - who offer their private homes for overnight stays, their private cars for ride services, their cleaning services on demand, etc. - but also for society as a whole. This look behind the scenes of a business model that initially seemed sensible but is actually harsh is very informative, easy to read, and up-to-date. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1068893915>

Municipal Survey: Migration, Housing, Neighborhood : Report within the Research Project "Coherence Needs Spaces - Integrative Housing with Migrants" ¤ In the nationwide research project "Coherence Needs Spaces - Integrative Housing with Migrants", within the framework of which the present publication was created, the housing supply and social spatial integration of newly arrived, particularly refugee people are examined. Equally, the municipal status quo is recorded and municipal action spaces are explored. The project's occasion was the observation that in isolated municipalities, housing projects are emerging that are characterized by an integrative approach, creating spaces for the coexistence of different social groups with (new) migrants. How widespread these are and which other approaches and measures municipalities take for the accommodation, housing supply, and integration of newly arrived and refugee people were recorded in the municipal survey. In particular, the contents of the survey focused on (see questionnaire in the appendix): (1) the accommodation and housing situations of newly arrived/refugees in the municipalities, including the dissemination of integrative housing projects, (2) coexistence and integration in neighborhoods, (3) measures that promote coexistence and integration in districts, (4) plans and conceptual approaches to improve housing supply. This also included the economically relevant question of creating long-term affordable housing (not only) for refugees.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187014-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117672-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017604-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077570-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066772-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066757-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124224-5>
Using Children's Media : Media Competence as a Challenge for Education and Teaching ¤ The authors, predominantly university lecturers, investigate how children's media, i.e. audiocassettes, CDs, children's television and films, but of course also books, can be used to convey reading and media competence to children in school. A collection of essays for educators, also interesting and further-reaching for librarians.

Handbook on Straw Bale Construction: Fundamentals, Constructions, Examples ¤ The handbook for planners, executors (architects, engineers, craftsmen, self-builders) and building enthusiasts provides practical and understandable information on rules for building with straw, building physics aspects, structural planning, constructive details, possible errors and presents 36 realized houses. (LK/KA: Nibbrig) Introduced handbook on straw bale construction for planners, executors (architects, engineers, craftsmen, self-builders) and building enthusiasts. Practical, understandable and well-illustrated are the fundamentals of building with straw, building physics aspects, structural planning, wall and vault construction, insulation, exterior and interior plastering, construction process, possible sources of error, passive houses with straw bale insulation etc. are treated. In detail, 36 realized examples of residential and functional buildings are presented with pictures and floor plans. In comparison to the 2nd edition 2009 (BA 2/10), a few pages have been expanded, updated in terms of technical developments (pre-fabrication, renovation of old buildings) and brought to the current state of the regulations (early 2014 approval for the use of straw as thermal insulation).

Scandinavian Home Design : elegant and simple ¤ After presenting the essential materials that determine the Scandinavian home style, wood, glass, fabrics, ceramics, and carpets, the range of Scandinavian home culture is illustrated by means of 12 unique houses in Denmark, Sweden, and Finland, from the modern country house to the elegantly designed city apartment. The respective design idea of the architect is described in detail under his name from planning to realization and presented in photographs. While material was in the foreground in "Scandinavian Design" (BA 7/03), it is the architects and designers here. The style, as described in the subtitle, is always elegant and simple. A very informative book in solid binding. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072819-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4023693-6>
XML : Introduction, Practice, Reference ¤ XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a format related to HTML, with which structured data can be exchanged. Microsoft Office also works with it. The target group of the book includes, among others, programmers and developers for web services, platform-independent applications, and e-publishing. In individually usable chapters, the basics and application possibilities of XML are presented, as well as topics such as data output, formatting, and interfaces, in addition to HTML5 and XHTML.

One Hundred Years of Revolution : Russia and the 20th Century ¤ Orlando Figes is one of the leading Russia historians in the world. Already in his 1st major work (ID-A 40/08) he set the beginning of the Russian Revolution to 1891, the then hunger riots and the associated politicization of society. He lets it end in the new book with the last Bolshevik, Mikhail Gorbachev, and the final collapse of the Soviet system. In between lies for the author a time of work of Lenin's successors for the utopian goals that he had formulated. It is a great narrative that brings people and events into context, which even the specialist has not seen yet. And it can help to understand Putin and his goals better. Very interesting is the evaluation of the year 1932, a fateful year for Stalin, which he politically only overcame with difficulty. Never again did he want to experience such a situation, a drive for the Great Terror. Brief notes, further literature references and a cross-register enrich and open up the text.

Medienwandel ¤ Medienwandel - or actually: Media history - illustrates the Cologne media scholar primarily using 12 case studies of film and television culture from 1900 to 2000. In an introductory chapter, he illuminates basic concepts such as media, change, as well as factors and models of media change, although without recourse to external sources.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169187-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016825-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033596-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017102-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4234987-4>
Crash Course Recruiting: Talent Acquisition and Selection ¤ As is customary with Haufe-Verlag, Diplom-Psychologist and Coach Ina Fliegen presents an extremely convincing guide to talent acquisition and selection. She begins with the personnel requirement, provides detailed tips for the search, e.g. a target group-oriented, cross-media mix of search channels, describes the organization and candidate management, and finally the decision for the suitable candidate. The author succeeds in creating a well-founded, very clear and practice-oriented guide for experienced recruiters, but also for executives who have never or rarely dealt with personnel selection. The many practical examples and exercises can meaningfully accompany the four phases of recruitment, a comprehensive bibliography offers options for a deeper entry.

After the Armed Struggle: Former Members of the RAF and 2 June Movement Speak with Therapists about Their Past ¤ Almost simultaneously with the interview volume with victims of the RAF by A. Siemens (BA 4/07), the first attempt at internal processing by the RAF perpetrators is now appearing. Former members of the RAF and the 2 June Movement (including K.H. Dellwo, K. Folkerts, M. Berberich, G. Rollnik), who have been living in freedom for years, spoke with therapists between 1996 and 2003 in the group about their past, their relationships with each other, and their current attitude towards the "actions" (so the abstract nomenclature of the murders). When considering the documentation of the 7 years of work in the Memory Mine, one will have to relativize the current discussion about the guilt and remorse of the RAF members. Remorse requires a distancing from one's own actions. What emerges here are internal views from the RAF's murder pit: "I have never experienced so much mutual devaluation in a group" - a therapist says. Although words like "remorse" or "guilt" do not appear, these unprotected, vulnerable, and wounded texts are also an admission of having failed.(2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132300-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072158-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114609-8>
Foundations of Geology ¤ This textbook explains how geological, geophysical, mineralogical, chemical, and astronomical processes and forces interact with the Earth system. In individual chapters, it is detailed how both plate tectonics and magmatism as well as rain, wind, ice, and waves shape the Earth's surface. ... For the fifth edition, Heinrich Bahlburg and Christoph Breitkreuz have revised and supplemented the content at many points. New sections are on the dynamics of magma chambers, wetlands, sea level fluctuations, and the phosphorus cycle.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020227-6>
No New Human Image : On the Language of Brain Research ¤ The current debate about brain research and its consequences for our human image, for legislation, jurisprudence, educational styles, and historical understanding is taking place in a language that is little reflected. From neurophysiological terms to popular philosophical speech about cognition, free will, and self-awareness, from the theoretical discussion of experience, experiment, proof, and refutation to appeals to values in a worldview, the range of linguistic means extends. Polemical sharpness and superficiality of concepts are the complementary features of a mutual refutation and a mutual foreciting, which are to be met philosophically with language criticism. While the discussed questions are certainly not pure language problems. But without clarification of the linguistic relationships, they are not to be clarified at all. This applies not only to public discourses about so-called body-mind or body-soul problems, but also to the claims and results of the specialized, in particular the neurosciences. They touch in a clarifying manner our traditional human image as well as our understanding of science.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016216-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7555119-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074722-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056449-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056475-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4443839-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123382-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171303-5>
Stress, Mobbing and Burn-out at Work : with 3 Tables ; [Dealing with Performance and Time Pressure, Mastering Work-Related Burdens, with Questionnaires, Checklists, Exercises] ¤ Does work make you sick? The World Health Organization (WHO) considers stress to be one of the greatest health hazards of our time and for many, work is the main source of stress. Under performance and time pressure, competitive situations arise that promote bullying. Pressure for change and overloading create chronic stress.

Understanding Economics: An Introduction to Economic Thinking ¤ The Essen professor provides the background for the system of economics, which is rather a collection of various approaches, views, and theories, not a uniform structure in the sense of a doctrine and often contradict each other. The main areas of study with their fundamental problems are briefly presented, then the economic thinking approaches and their inner logic are explained. While an extensive chronology or historical reconstruction is waived, the insights into it are enlightening and help to cope with the conflicting terminologies and teachings and also to recognize the limits of economic theories. Regrettably, the reviewer notes how much trouble and sweat he could have spared himself in his studies if this book had been available at the time. Well-suited for beginners and first-year students, nothing comparable is currently displayed. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Metric Temporal Graph Logic over Typed Attributed Graphs ¤ Graph repair, restoring consistency of a graph, plays a prominent role in several areas of computer science and beyond: For example, in model-driven engineering, the abstract syntax of models is usually encoded using graphs. Flexible edit operations temporarily create inconsistent graphs not representing a valid model, thus requiring graph repair. Similarly, in graph databases—managing the storage and manipulation of graph data—updates may cause that a given database does not satisfy some integrity constraints, requiring also graph repair. We present a logic-based incremental approach to graph repair, generating a sound and complete (upon termination) overview of least-changing repairs. In our context, we formalize consistency by so-called graph conditions being equivalent to first-order logic on graphs. We present two kind of repair algorithms: State-based repair restores consistency independent of the graph update history, whereas deltabased (or incremental) repair takes this history explicitly into account. Technically, our algorithms rely on an existing model generation algorithm for graph conditions implemented in AutoGraph. Moreover, the delta-based approach uses the new concept of satisfaction (ST) trees for encoding if and how a graph satisfies a graph condition. We then demonstrate how to manipulate these STs incrementally with respect to a graph update. Various types of typed attributed graphs can be used to represent system states from a broad range of domains. For dynamic systems, established formalisms such as graph transformation can provide a formal model for defining state sequences. We consider the case where time can elapse between state changes, and introduce a logic called Metric Temporal Graph Logic (MTGL) to reason about such time-controlled graph sequences. With this logic, we express properties of the structure and attributes of states as well as the occurrence of states over time, which are connected by their internal structure, which has not been precisely formalized by any formal logic over graphs so far. First, based on time-controlled graph sequences as models for system evolution, we define MTGL by integrating the temporal operator up to a certain time limit into the established logic of (nested) graph conditions. Second, we sketch how a finite time-controlled diagram sequence can be represented as a single diagram containing all temporal changes (as a diagram with a history), how the satisfaction of MTGL conditions for such a diagram can be defined, and show that both representations satisfy the same MTGL conditions. Third, we show how MTGL conditions can be reduced to (nested) diagram conditions, and show by means of this reduction that both underlying logics are equally informative. Finally, we present an extension of the AutoGraph tool, with which the satisfaction of MTGL conditions for time-controlled diagram sequences can be checked by checking the satisfaction of the (nested) diagram conditions, which were obtained using the proposed reduction for the diagram with a history corresponding to the time-controlled diagram.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006650-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123065-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7623494-0>
School Libraries : Fundamentals of Planning, Construction, Administration, and Use ¤ Publisher's text: This volume deals with school libraries. This should interest every school, as all are dependent on effective institutions for managing their media and using them in the classroom. It informs about important aspects of the subject and addresses the current situation, describes changes, mentions professional standards, provides recommendations, suggestions, and hints for improving media management and media use. The authors' statements incorporate, among other things, findings from advisory work and various service institutions. Long-term experiences with media use in the school sector show that a didactically secured use of media in the classroom depends on favorable organizational framework conditions that ensure the availability and quick access to the media, the didactic suitability of the media available in the school library for achieving the desired learning and work goals, and the qualified library and media didactic competence of the library management and teachers. The appendix is aimed at all those who are faced with the task of building a school library, who intend to adapt their own media equipment to changed concepts and make it more efficient, or who want to gain an overview of the current state of development of school libraries in Germany.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4180097-7>
Medical Basics for Social Professions: Social Medicine ¤ The rapid changes in the healthcare and social services sector, as well as in the field of (fach) universities in recent years show that basic knowledge on questions of health, illness, disability, prevention, health promotion and rehabilitation are becoming increasingly important. Especially social professions are affected, which, in addition to medical and nursing professions, have gained increasing importance in the healthcare sector. Therefore, it was necessary to revise and update the proven "Textbook of Social Medicine for Social Work, Social and Special Education". The "Medical Basics for Social Professions" also account for the further development of the previous diploma courses in social work/social education to bachelor's and master's degree programs and are also aimed at other study and training programs in the field of healthcare and social services. Teachers at universities for social work/special education, physicians, social workers, and practitioners convey scientifically sound, practice-related basics for daily social and pedagogical work, especially with sick and disabled people. - Containing 17 contributions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055676-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055860-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020775-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077555-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077513-6>
Probability for Dummies : [100% a top-notch book] ¤ Following a successful introduction to mathematical statistics (BA 6/04), this second volume in the series by the same author deals with probability theory. Initially, the basic concepts and representation methods are treated, followed by a section on games of chance. In the three main sections, it then deals with various models of discrete and continuous probability distributions, from binomial and normal distributions to Poisson, negative binomial, geometric, and hypergeometric distributions, and finally to equal and exponential distributions. Rumsey conveys the thinking and working methods of this area of stochasticity in the usual loose presentation style without sacrificing thoroughness. - As a parallel reading to an introductory lecture, just as recommended for self-study for all who want to get an overview.

Fake News make History : Rumors and False Reports in the 20th and 21st Century ¤ Rumors and false reports have accompanied human history from the very beginning. Their political and military consequences were often devastating. With the rise of "fake news," it is clear that rumors and false reports are more historically significant than ever in the age of social media. The authors present eleven examples from the 20th and 21st centuries on how misinformation and rumors took their disastrous course in the field of tension between politics, media, and the public. They have chosen cases that were of central importance for Germany - from the Nazi era ("Alpenfestung") to the Cold War ("Amikäfer") to the very latest present.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4294308-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156908-8>
The Hour of the Fools : How We Are Destroying Our Culture on the Internet ¤ The Internet, especially Web 2.0, is a blessing for freedom of opinion, so they say: Finally, everyone can decide what is being discussed - not just experts, top journalists, and eloquent authors who claim the monopoly of opinion for themselves. But what have we gotten ourselves into? Forum contributions that are bursting with stupidity and false facts, and YouTube videos that are hardly outdone in idiocy. It gets even worse: political splinter parties and eccentric crackpots are increasingly masquerading as harmless bloggers to spread anti-democratic hate campaigns. Those affected can hardly defend themselves. Companies are practicing subtle "viral marketing" to have their products recommended by supposedly enthusiastic customers. Clever lobbyists are mixing in with false identities in discussions to push through their questionable interests. We are on a dangerous path, says Andrew Keen: Where half-knowledge and bare lies reign instead of reliable information, there is also a lack of a basis for reasonable and sustainable political decisions, there our culture is shaken to its foundations. A sharply formulated plea against the absurd excesses of the great dumbing-down machine, which is called the Internet. Keen, who himself is a "product" of Silicon Valley and mutated into the sharpest critic of Web 2.0, mainly highlights two consequences of the participatory Internet: cultural flattening and the economic consequences of massive intellectual theft. Blogs in three-digit millions, Wikipedia, YouTube, and other platforms for user-generated content are at the center of the analysis. Discussion book, also especially for librarians.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308416-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4227561-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7548364-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7616549-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156464-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114011-4>
Didactics of Vocational Education ¤ Following his book "Foundations of Didactics", the author deals with special questions of vocational education. Particular attention is given to current developments of modern vocational instruction, which are in connection with reform pedagogy, the 100-year history of which is briefly touched upon. The reader-friendly presentation of practice, supported by graphics and photos, is not about vocational education as a whole, but about selected aspects within the framework of technical vocational education. The reader is referred to two books by A. Schelten for the broader context, namely the revised "Introduction to Vocational Education" in its third edition and "Terms and Concepts of Pedagogical Professional Language". Recommended as a textbook for vocational educators and students of the relevant teaching profession. (3)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070463-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069342-9>
Ordinary Organizations : Sociology of the Holocaust ¤ Why were so many Germans willing to actively participate in the extermination of European Jews during the time of National Socialism? Stefan Kühl claims that it was the integration into state organizations of the NS that led these people to participate in deportations and mass shootings – regardless of the very different motivations that initially led them to join these organizations. Kühl substantiates this thesis by incorporating relevant historical and social psychological research, but with the theoretical tools of sociology. He shows what this scientific discipline can achieve in this regard. Kühl identifies six murder motives on the basis of his meticulous reading of the trial records of Police Battalion 101, which Goldhagen and Browning had already attempted to use, as well as his almost exhaustive knowledge of the entire research literature published on the topic of the Holocaust: different forms of identification with the purpose of the organization, actual or at least expected coercion, the pressure of camaraderie, money, the attractiveness of murder through satisfaction of sadistic desires, as well as the indoctrinated dehumanization of the victims and – finally – the 'generalization' of motives	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077624-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113393-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073091-8>
Description and Analysis of Fuzzy Information: Statistical Methods for Fuzzy Data ¤ Data quality, accuracy, or inaccuracy of data and other information are fundamental aspects of measurements and observations that must be quantitatively described to avoid unrealistic results from analyses. In many practical applications, the provision of real numbers as existing data elements appears questionable. The use of fuzzy numbers allows the uncertainty to be included in the modeling and thus enables a more realistic description of data. The book is written for readers who are familiar with elementary stochastic models and statistical procedures. The goal is to present methods for the quantitative description of fuzzy observations of stochastic quantities and to introduce them into the foundations of statistical analysis of such data. The practical scope with the presented theories and methods is brought closer to the reader through numerous exercise problems. TOC:1 Uncertainty and Information. Fuzzy information and fuzzy data. Stochasticity and uncertainty.- 2 Mathematical description of uncertainty. Mathematical foundations. Fuzzy numbers.- Fuzzy vectors. Combination of fuzzy observations. Functions of fuzzy quantities.

The Late Poison : Consequences of Political Traumatization in the GDR and Their Treatment ¤ Trobisch-Lütge, who founded the counseling center >Gegenwind< in Berlin for victims of the SED dictatorship in 1994, describes the dimensions of the psychological damage caused by persecution and imprisonment on the basis of his 10-year psychotherapeutic practice. What chances do these often severely traumatized people have to find their way into the social spaces of reunified Germany? The legacy of the state-created, massive psychic destruction in the former GDR is carried over into the reunifying Germany in the form of unconscious relationship deformations. Thus, the former victims - largely ignored by the public - still often exhibit behavior of shamefaced withdrawal or angry accusation today; they appear as second-class victims of the second German dictatorship. With a specific analysis of the dangers for helpers to become entangled in the traumatizations of the victims, this book is addressed to those affected and their relatives, professional helpers, and interested laypeople.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046565-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4361388-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057808-2>
How Children Learn to Read and Write ¤ To us adults, it seems self-evident to be able to read and write. We hardly remember how we laboriously learned the first letters as children, and yet all children perform a small miracle when they learn to read and write. To understand such an achievement, this book first explains how writing works in German. It becomes clear: With the right learning offers, children acquire the written language similar to how the mother tongue learns to read and write. That the acquisition of writing is not always problem-free, we know not only since PISA. Many teachers and parents are unsure how to deal with errors. The book shows methods and ways in which we can observe and promote children in the acquisition of written language and which typical stumbling blocks occur. A particular challenge is the acquisition of written language for children for whom German is not the mother tongue. In a separate chapter, the authors explain what teachers should know about other languages in order to help these students with learning to read and write German.

The Roman City: A Brief History ¤ Most Roman foundations are based on fixed patterns. Which ones these are and how they were partly adapted to difficult terrain, although cleverly varied, but still taken into account, runs as a red thread through the presentation of rather limited scope. Nevertheless, sufficient information is provided. Concentration on the essential, accompanied by typical examples, demonstrates the great expertise of the author, former director of the German Archaeological Institute in Rome. He structures his writing chronologically according to the time of the Republic, Imperial era, and higher Imperial era. The difference between colonial foundations and the city of Rome itself is well worked out. On the one hand, the book is more than an archaeological guide to the ancient sites treated, on the other hand, it is certainly worth consulting before a trip, provided one is not bothered by the few Latin terms. Many understandable floor plans. For the city of Rome, F. Coarelli (ID-A 41/13) and even more specifically "The Roman Forum" (ID-G 15/12) are recommended.

Music Therapy for Children with Autism: Music, Movement, and Speech Games for the Treatment of Disturbed Sensory and Body Perception: With DVD for the EBQ Instrument ¤ Developed from the child's perspective, situational music, movement, and speech games for the treatment of disturbed sensory and body perception lead the child with autism out of its socio-emotional isolation. The music therapeutic approach is described and depicted filmically on an accompanying DVD. Patients who have not yet developed shared attention can particularly benefit from music therapy. The possibility of expression and communication, above all the experience that emotions can be regulated, change the symptomatology. Elementary music is always connected to the body and enables, with the help of elementary instruments, the experience of interhuman relationship	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030550-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4296005-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003932-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040878-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170819-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4328911-3>

Geistesblitze : A Different History of Philosophy ¤ Whether a thought approach and a statement are right and justified is one question, another is which specific situation the researcher owes it to. Scientific knowledge, also philosophical, arises primarily through effort and method, but also through external influences that do not occur entirely by chance, but in reading, thinking, and discussion contexts, whose reconstruction is helpful for understanding. The understanding of the origin serves the understanding of the theory itself and has occasional high entertainment value.

Life on Trial : How the Stage Becomes the World ¤ Oberender is the current head of the Salzburg Festival and was previously the leading dramaturge at the theatres in Bochum and Zurich. He is familiar with the rehearsal process from up close. He owes a lot to the actors in his life and everything in this book. In 5 chapters, he does not get lost in anecdotal or chatty talk, but wants to report on the development of roles in a representative way. In doing so, he repeatedly sketches characteristics of certain actor types. He does not mention names, although the portrayed are recognizable to insiders. Stylistically, Oberender writes ambitiously and occasionally falls into whispers about 'emotional reality' and the pretentious terminology of his similarly humorless role model Botho Strauß, whom he has published 2 works on. The little book contains numerous wise comments on the delicate rehearsal process and the psychodramas between directors and actors, which are otherwise happily hidden from the viewer.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059702-7>

Consultation, Power, and Organizational Learning ¤ Pedagogy is in the process of conquering a terrain that seemed lost to psychology and economics for a longer time: the field of organizational learning processes. Consultation, personnel, and organizational development are understood as support for organizational learning processes and thus as pedagogical practice. Questions about the relationship between individual development and organizational excellence are sharpened in this volume to the question of whether and how power is exercised, generated, and modified in the context of consultation and organizational learning. The authors present the results of empirical studies and interpret them from an organizational pedagogical perspective.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126914-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4198012-8>

Probabilistic Metric Temporal Graph Logic ¤ Cyber-physical systems often encompass complex concurrent behavior with timing constraints and probabilistic failures on demand. The analysis whether such systems with probabilistic timed behavior adhere to a given specification is essential. When the states of the system can be represented by graphs, the rule-based formalism of Probabilistic Timed Graph Transformation Systems (PTGTSs) can be used to suitably capture structure dynamics as well as probabilistic and timed behavior of the system. The model checking support for PTGTSs w.r.t. properties specified using Probabilistic Timed Computation Tree Logic (PTCTL) has been already presented. Moreover, for timed graph-based runtime monitoring, Metric Temporal Graph Logic (MTGL) has been developed for stating metric temporal properties on identified subgraphs and their structural changes over time. In this paper, we (a) extend MTGL to the Probabilistic Metric Temporal Graph Logic (PMTGL) by allowing for the specification of probabilistic properties, (b) adapt our MTGL satisfaction checking approach to PTGTSs, and (c) combine the approaches for PTCTL model checking and MTGL satisfaction checking to obtain a Bounded Model Checking (BMC) approach for PMTGL. In our evaluation, we apply an implementation of our BMC approach in AutoGraph to a running example.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274073-3>

Multidisciplinary Documentation and Information Needs Analysis of Cardiological Processes, as well as Conceptualization of Selected Medical Resource Types in the Hospital Engineering Project ¤ The present research report shows the results of the process documentation and information needs analysis of selected medical and administrative processes at the Elisabeth Hospital in Essen. The work is part of the Hospital Engineering project and aims to identify potential for optimizing administrative processes that support medical care. The focus is on measures to increase transparency regarding material management processes in the cardiac catheter laboratory and processes in which material management data can be reused. Optimization potential has been shown particularly in terms of integrating existing hospital information systems. The main focus is on providing material management data for targeted reuse in medical documentation and in supporting material management processes in medical departments. Furthermore, optimization potential has been shown regarding the design and usability of information systems with a view to supporting medical assistants in administrative tasks. Based on the findings, selected domain-specific modeling concepts have been developed, which can be used in the modeling of clinical pathways. These models can provide the basis for a more comprehensive, multidisciplinary modeling of the action system and information systems of the hospital, enable targeted analyses, and thus support future developments of the hospital.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113742-5>
Atheism - in a new form? ¤ While in recent times much has been said about the 'return of religion(s)', the public in Western countries is simultaneously confronted with an unexpected resurgence of genuine atheism. Under the label of 'New Atheism' that has been in use since 2006, protagonists often loudly and confessingly speak out: citing the current scientific worldview, they claim the inferiority and untenability of any orientation that, in the sense of Christianity and other world religions, reckons with a transcendent reality. Instead, they propagate a completely 'naturalistic' worldview. An appropriate engagement should consider the arguments currently put forward, but also place them in the context of the criticism of religion in earlier centuries: it will offer its part of the conversation, but also take a Christian position.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030005-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003364-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018877-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041365-2>
IT Security in the Company ¤ The increasing networking in the commercial sector leads to IT security becoming increasingly important. Unfortunately, awareness of security risks is not well developed in many companies, and this can have far-reaching consequences; for in every network, security is decisively determined by the weakest link. - The author of the present book is known for a compilation of tasks of an IT Security Manager, who is responsible for information security in a company (ID-G 26/12). Now he shows practically how a security concept can be developed with calculable costs in small and medium-sized companies. He begins with important terms from IT security, then addresses weaknesses and errors that can lead to attacks (rarely changed passwords, continuous work with administrator rights ...) and then formulates tasks (user management, access to data, secure server systems ...), which lead step by step in the form of a project to an IT system with an acceptable security level.

German Language History: Basics and Methods ¤ Language is not static, but rather in constant change. To understand how the German language came to be, what it is, one must therefore engage with its history. This introduction presents a comprehensive, understandable, and up-to-date overview of the research in German language history and provides students and teachers with numerous methods to practice historical linguistics themselves. From comparative methods to corpus linguistics to complex phylogenetic methods, the repertoire of German language history research is explained and practiced with many tasks. Numerous examples and exercise tasks, as well as extensive digital accompanying material, make the book an ideal companion in study and teaching.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0>
Superconductivity : fundamentals and applications ¤ Already for three decades, the German edition of this introduction to the field of superconductivity has proven its practicality. The authors explain to non-experts in an understandable and comprehensible way, with a minimum of mathematical derivations, under what conditions superconductivity occurs and how it can be pursued experimentally. Subsequently, they present interesting applications from medicine, technology, and research.-The edition has been consistently revised and updated	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058651-0>
YouTube, Clipfish, MyVideo & Co. : Watch, create, enhance and publish video clips ; [how to: dealing with YouTube, Clipfish and MyVideo ; video editing for beginners: creating and editing own videos with MovieMaker ; making an impression: overlays, effects & Co. ; video portals, video editing, tips & tricks] ¤ Video portals, such as YouTube, are popular. Often practical reasons are decisive for their use and not, as often assumed, exhibitionist tendencies of video producers: It is easier to upload a film to YouTube and distribute the URL by email than to burn a DVD multiple times. The title first describes the passive (search function, rating) and active use (user registration, upload) of the most well-known video communities, such as YouTube, Clipfish and MyVideo, and offers in the second part numerous tips and tricks, such as saving offered films or editing, converting and uploading own videos. The structure of the title is clear and quickly usable, the descriptions are precise and sufficiently detailed, only some technical details are handled too briefly and superficially. Further background information is hardly provided. Although a software supplement is missing, references to the described tools are always offered. Conclusion: Quickly usable and unadorned introduction to the highly current topic of using current video portals.

The House of Government: A Saga of the Russian Revolution ¤ Based on the documented life in the 'House of Government', a massive residential complex opposite the Kremlin, the Russian-born historian teaching in California recounts the rise and fall of the Bolshevik nomenklatura. Review: In this kilos-heavy, internationally acclaimed 'family saga' the Russian-born historian teaching in California tells the story of the Bolshevik nomenklatura as a kind of end-time epic, spanning from the October Revolution to its downfall in Stalin's terror and World War. The focal point is the 'House of Government' erected in the late 1920s opposite the Kremlin, a massive residential complex (and setting of J. Trifonov's 'House on the Moscow River', 1989) reserved for the Bolshevik elite and their families. Based on an impressive array of contemporary sources documented in many quotes, Slezkine reports on the rise and fall of a messianic movement. Vividly, with lively presented material (including many poorly printed photos) he tells of the Bolshevik elite destroyed at the end, their lifestyle, cultural influences, and the daily life of their families. With tenant list and cross-register. - A must-read for advanced readers in expanded holdings. See also K. Schlogel: 'Terror and Dream' (2008).

Relativistic Quantum Theory : an Introduction to Quantum Field Theory ; with 7 Tables ¤ This sequel to N. Straumann's 'Quantum Mechanics' contains the relativistic part of a two-part lecture that the author has given many times. The material is worked out in detail and supplemented by chapters from quantum electrodynamics. The book is a thorough introduction to quantum field theory and its applications. The red thread of this textbook is the quantum theory of electromagnetic processes. The first chapter on the old Dirac radiation theory closes the material of 'Quantum Mechanics' and refers to applications in atomic and nuclear physics. Then, in the chapters on Dirac's wave equation for the electron and on the quantization of the Dirac field, the most important parts of relativistic quantum theory are presented. The remaining four chapters are devoted to quantum electrodynamics, e.g. the Born approximation, the systematic derivation of the Feynman rules up to the treatment of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177688-4>
Access 2010 : [the competent working book for daily practice ; advanced work techniques for efficient use in the office and at home] ¤ Access 2010 is the latest version of the database program from Microsoft. The author duo Kulpa has revised the previous edition ('Access 2007', BA 11/07) in light of changes to the program. The book is primarily aimed at beginners in the world of databases. The individual chapters are very thoroughly worked out. Starting with an introduction to Access and the essential changes to the program, the topics of tables, queries, forms, and reports are dealt with in detail. In the following chapters, it is about programming with VBA. A whole chapter has been added, dealing with automation using macros, and a subchapter on special functions of the new version. Unfortunately, the individual examples are again only clarified by a few screenshots, and these are, like in the previous edition, still very small printed. The previous edition to Access 2010 should be supplemented by this new edition for inventory updating. Currently still almost unbeatable alongside L. Hölscher (BA 9/10).

Welding Technology : Welding of Metallic Construction Materials ; with 497 Images, 95 Tables and 21 Plates ¤ The revised edition of the professional and textbook on welding metallic materials has been completely revised (lastly BA 12/02) and presents itself on the current technical level of traditional and modern procedures. It is mainly aimed at students of mechanical engineering, production and construction technology at universities and colleges of applied sciences, vocational academies and further education institutions. Clear structured, compressed overview, usable as a lecture accompanying deepening of the learning material, as an introduction to the field of knowledge and reference work for practice. Numerous tables and explanatory images, structured bibliography, the keyword register enables a targeted entry. As a cost-effective overall overview still usable for medium to large holdings before e.g. "Practical Knowledge Welding Technology" (lastly ID-G 7/07, edition 2011 not displayed here).

We No Longer Know Who We Are: Forgotten Minorities in the Balkans ¤ Review: The dissolution of Yugoslavia confronted many Central Europeans with a previously seemingly unnoticed variety of different ethnic groups. While the titular nations of the successor states are now generally well-known, their small ethnic-religious minorities remained almost unnoticed. The author, who has visited the mentioned ethnic groups over 15 years, succeeds in conveying the often difficult situation of these peoples in the framework of the still developing countries. The seven case studies in the book are each well connected to the socio-political development of the respective countries. Despite the lack of illustrative accompanying material outside the text, the book is highly recommended in view of the lack of literature on the mentioned peoples. At the same time, it is a must for libraries where interest in the Balkans and processes of state-building exists. (3)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4752223-9>

Illness & Death in the Religions ¤ This is a handbook from practice and for practice. It is aimed at professionals in emergency pastoral care, nursing care, hospital pastoral care, prison pastoral care, in old-age and care homes, in the migration sector and at those interested in religious questions. It provides differentiated answers to the most important questions about illness, dying, death, and burial in various religious contexts. The book was developed by the religious scholars Judith Albisser and Sylvie Eigenmann and the religious scholar Christoph Peter Baumann with members of the various religious communities and with the support of experts from several fields. The handbook is a contribution to a more open and more understanding handling of illness, dying, and death in an increasingly multicultural, multireligious, and individualized society.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032844-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060294-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116609-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065455-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057310-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006054-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4466515-5>

Poor rich Hamburg : Metropolis between prosperity and poverty ¤ Hamburg is the city with the most millionaires in Germany. At the same time, the number of poor people is also increasing here. So the city is becoming increasingly characterized by a gap between wealth and poverty. This is made clear by the authors: The maldevelopments are not compatible with the ethos of the 'Honourable Merchant of Hamburg', but rather a social scandal. They require fundamental corrections that must be politically enforced in order for a more socially just urban development to come about. Their topics are: gentrification and housing shortage, Rich city? Taxes, debts, bankruptcy bank, Hamburg's money nobility: rich and super-rich, unemployed, precarious and poorly paid, Poverty has many faces: old, children, homeless and lighthouses for whom?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128492-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002963-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055736-4>
The Missed Spring : What Caused the Arabellion to Fail ¤ The journalist, who has long worked as a foreign correspondent in Cairo, draws a lively and vivid picture of the developments in Egypt since 2011, from the euphoric beginnings of the Arabellion to the current return of the generals. Review: This is not, as the title might suggest, an analysis of the Arabellion and its (provisional) failure, but primarily a journalistic, also personally grounded report from the hotspots of the movement. Apart from short excursions to Tunisia, Libya, Yemen, and Syria, the author (last in 2011) only refers to Egypt, where she worked as a correspondent for ZDF and various major newspapers from 2008-2015. As an on-site observer, Gerlach reports vividly and vividly from the political and social events in snapshots and conversations with participants and witnesses, and explains in inserted analytical passages how the arc from the euphoric beginnings in 2011 to the success and failure of the Muslim Brotherhood to the disillusioning return of the generals could lean. Small literature selection in the appendix, no index. Widely usable next to A.-B. Clasmann (2016), who sets up more analytically and comprehensively.

Microbiology: The Discovery of the Invisible World ¤ The book describes important and pioneering historical milestones of microbiology up to the present. It also conveys basic knowledge about biochemistry, molecular biology, and the genetics of microorganisms as well as their importance in the natural household. (Helmut Köhne) The book describes important and pioneering historical milestones of microbiology up to the present. They are presented in close connection with the biography and major research achievements of significant scientists such as Leeuwenhoeck, Robert Koch, Ferdinant Kohn, or Paul Ehrlich, who have advanced microbiological research decisively through the development of microscopes, the introduction of more effective laboratory methods, the discovery of pathogens, or the detection of important bacterial metabolic cycles. Basic knowledge is also conveyed about biochemistry, molecular biology, and the genetics of microorganisms as well as their great importance in the natural household. The book, which is understandable with general biological knowledge, covers a central theme spectrum, but it is not a systematically conceived textbook of microbiology.

Mathematics - visually and entertainingly : [for preparation and accompaniment of studies] ¤ The title of this book could also have been the motto for similar publications that try to bring some color to this abstract art for a generally interested public: e.g. Georg Gläser: "The mathematical toolbox" (Spektrum; BA 9/06), Manfred Dobrowolski: "Mathematical excursions" (Oldenbourg; BA 6/10). Paech also presents a similar book with many colorful drawings, highlights, tables, marginalia, and caricatures, which represents a popular science approach in method, yet a serious textbook. It takes the reader from elementary mathematics to the beginning of a scientific study, and can therefore also serve as a bridge course. The representation appears lively through many examples (mostly from physics). Very helpful are the explanations of mathematical notations, which often become an unnecessary hurdle for beginners. - A mathematics book that fits into the gap between learning aids like "Basic knowledge of mathematics 5th to 10th grade" (BA 8/10) and textbooks like "Mathematics" (BA 12/08; Arens ...).

The Urban Code of China ¤ Cliff Notes: When reading Chinese cities, as this book does, it's not primarily about Beijing, Shanghai, Xi an, Shenzhen and other well-known addresses, but rather about the Chinese in the Chinese city, about those features that all Chinese cities more or less exhibit, about their core, about their syntax, in short: their code. Only deciphering this common code opens up our view of their inner structure and allows us to weigh and sensibly order the diversity of empirical impressions. Such a city reading provides the building blocks of the code of the Chinese city: the dualism of open and closed space, which decisively determines the basic structure of the Chinese city; the clear preference for private or community-related over public and social space; as well as the self-evident practice of interpreting and designing residential areas as exclusive, closed spaces and much more. With this code, the author can then also read new city foundations in China planned by European architects. The Urban Code of China thus also provides the reader with insights into China's booming urban development.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056730-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056795-3>
Handbook of Wood Bending ¤ This book is a reprint of an overview presentation from 1903, which was primarily for restorers and collectors of antique furniture as well as museum professionals. The present book is a translation from American and shows for a broader circle of interest the technique of wood bending and answers many questions that the bending work raises: material, bending method, tools and equipment. The preparations require a considerable effort, which the author also addresses as well as the actual bending. In the 2nd part, he then presents some projects in detailed descriptions of the individual working steps, which are well illustrated with photos and drawings: shelves for oval boxes, walking sticks, boat frames, chair backrest slats. Although the inexperienced craftsman with this technique is also addressed in the introduction, a certain level of general experience with woodworking is still important for hobby woodworkers to get started with this no longer very common art.

Introduction to the Nag Hammadi Writings ¤ Carsten Colpe passed away on November 24, 2009 in Berlin. This marks the end of a long history of this publication, which the "Foreword" carefully informs the readers about. The present volume was intended to be one of the first in our "Jerusalem Theological Forum" and, in the eyes of all those involved, was to serve as a kind of starting aid for the still young series. The author's life story took a different course than human planning might have thought. However, completing this work was among the concerns that Carsten Colpe would not have ended his scientific work without. Despite a few remaining uncompleted places, in spite of last efforts, we hand over this "Introduction" posthumously to the scientific public - in accordance with the author's instructions, as well as a sign of our gratitude and respect for a great scholar and an extremely lovable person.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4021391-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4023287-6>
The Consuming Life of Things : An Essay on Consumption ¤ Ist er ein gutes Stück mit ihm gelaufen, then the foot has crushed the shoe. But the shoe can also press on the foot and cause blisters. Wolfgang Schivelbusch's book deals with the reciprocal relationship of humans to things, which can be understood as an endless repetition of creation, use, consumption, and destruction. Schivelbusch follows the symbiosis of human and thing in the history of ideas and science. In doing so, he arrives at such surprising as elementary insights into the foundations of our civilization and the resulting national economies – and proves to be one of the most original historians of our time	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165986-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138031-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132530-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078777-1>
Windows 7 for Dummies : [at a glance: create CDs, DVDs, and playlists with Media Center ; move data from an older PC to a new PC with Windows 7 ; customize Windows 7 to your needs ; understand Windows security warnings] ¤ Introduction to the new operating system with step-by-step instructions and numerous tips. (Sch) Review: The American author has been accompanying the various Windows versions within the "Dummies" series for a long time - the first guide to Windows 95 was discussed by us (cf. BA 1/96) - and of course, he does not leave the users of the latest release of the operating system in the lurch. The basis is the predecessor to Vista (BA 9/07), but although Windows 7 is often referred to as the better Vista, Rathbone has thoroughly renovated it. The structure is largely unchanged, but all innovations have been introduced, with many of the texts, step-by-step instructions, additional information, and tips having undergone more or less significant revisions. Completely replaced are the screenshots and the cartoons at the beginning of each of the 7 major chapters. Remaining are the familiar advantages, that beginners are offered here with solid, practical explanations and handouts in a relaxed tone - and the recommendation.

Learning with Joy - a Lifetime : Why We Need a New Understanding of Learning ; Seven Theses on an Expanded Concept of Learning and a Selection of Contributions to Support It ¤ Why do most children want to have nothing more to do with learning by the end of their first year at school? Why do students, who as babies began to explore the world with such joy, use their creativity in schools and universities only to escape learning or at least to get through it as quickly as possible? Why do hardly any adults experience learning as an enrichment of their own lives and as deeply joyful and fulfilling? Gerald Hüther's answer: Because our understanding of 'learning' is only historically justifiable and, in light of our current state of knowledge, belongs in the trash. We have confined learning to a narrow framework that was prescribed to us by the knowledge transmitters from the institutions specifically created for this purpose. How could we forget that learning is essential to human life? And that we are not the only learning-capable living beings? But we can learn from our mistakes. Learning means nothing less than staying alive. And whoever loses their joy in learning has also lost their joy in life.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167413-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035408-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041871-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044321-8>

Project Management Lexicon: Reference Work on Current National and International PM Standards ¤ Project management is a relatively young discipline, whose content, scope, and importance have grown significantly over the past few years. However, it lacks comprehensive standardization of the associated vocabulary. So, the professional world uses a wide range of terms that are met with different levels of understanding, as multiple term definitions often exist. Especially English or Anglo-American professional expressions often have no exact equivalent in the German language. The qualified professional dictionary provides all project managers and those interested with a comprehensive overview of the field. It is lexically structured and encompasses the current term catalog used in project management, naming the corresponding English words for German professional terms. The author provides a reference work and tool for practitioners in project management as well as for consultants, teachers, and learners in conveying and understanding the project management vocabulary. Now updated and revised, it provides comprehensive and practice-oriented information on more than 1700 terms and significantly contributes to the harmonization and standardization of the vocabulary in project economics. This reference work takes into account the current national and international PM standards: - DIN standards 69000 / 69901 - PM performance images HOAI / AHO / DVP - GPM competence-based project management (PM3) - PM certification guidelines in D-A-CH (NCB) - IPMA Competence Baseline (ICB4) - PMI® PMBOK® Guide(Publisher's text)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047441-0>
Location-Adapted Cultivation Systems for Energy Crops: First Results of the Joint Project "Development and Comparison of Optimized Cultivation Systems for the Agricultural Production of Energy Crops under the Different Site Conditions in Germany" ¤ Excerpts from the results of the first 3 years of the cultivation project: On average, the combination of maize green rye - sudangrass hybrid (second crop) winter triticale and annual ryegrass was the most productive (crop rotation 3). In second place are crop rotations 1 and 2, which consider both C3 and C4 plants. Crop rotation 1 with summer barley oil radish (summer intermediate crop) maize winter triticale and fodder grass (summer intermediate crop) also offers advantages from an ecological point of view, as it allows for a particularly high diversity of insects and wildflowers. In general, this is the case when as many crop species as possible with different cultivation periods and vegetation structures are combined in the crop rotations. When considering the individual crop rotation components, maize remained the most productive and economically viable crop on all sites and over the years. In dry years and at dry-warm sites, the sudangrass hybrid (Sorghum sudanense x bicolor) was on par with maize. At sites with limited suitability for maize cultivation, winter cereals may, under certain circumstances, yield the highest profit contribution per unit area (Source: FNR).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4473009-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4602952-7>
The End of Mass Unemployment: Winning the Future with Correct Economic Policy ¤ Is unemployment our fate? How secure are jobs? Do children and young people today have a realistic chance of finding a half-way secure job in the future? Nothing moves people here more than these questions, and nothing is discussed more heatedly and frequently at pub tables, in companies or political gatherings. Heiner Flassbeck and Friederike Spiecker show that a high unemployment rate is by no means inevitable and that there are indeed ways out of this dead end. Systematically, the authors refute all common prejudices – 'technology replaces human labor'; 'work is too expensive here'; 'Europe is too rigid for structural reforms' – and prove that mass unemployment is less our fate, but rather pure policy failure. All those who do not want to believe that our country is doomed to economic decline will find answers to the question of why economic policy has so far failed in this area – and more importantly, how we can defeat unemployment in the future.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5>
Spaces, Places, Borders: On the Way to a Sociology of Space ¤ Claptext: The development of modernity can be described as a development from the immediately surrounding spaces to the infinitely distant spaces. While a strong bond to the near space can be observed in early tribal societies, modernity leads precisely beyond the given spaces and opens up new horizons. The complaint about the loss of community, the local, and tradition finds its starting point here. The present work argues that this binding of the social to the near relationships has long been in the way of a systematic engagement with space in sociology. Passing through central sociological theory positions and using individual case studies, not only are the effects of this privilege of proximity shown, but also the simultaneity of deterritorialization and reterritorialization processes, of openings and closures is pursued.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077624-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048561-4>
Introduction to Java ¤ The current version 9 of the programming language (or more accurately: development platform) Java again contains an important innovation: large programs can now be divided into multiple modules, which also applies to the class library. As in the predecessor to version 8, the NetBeans development environment is used for following the examples. Beginners with programming knowledge and advanced users learn with this book first basics such as data types, objects, and classes and subsequently more specialized content, for example, polymorphism, multithreading, lambda expressions, and apps with Android Studio. Very practice-oriented, with numerous code examples that can be downloaded as a zip file from the publisher's homepage, as well as exercise tasks with solutions. From the competing titles to this version, "Java for Dummies" has been published and "Schrödinger programs Java".

Windows 10 - the big manual ¤ This widely applicable manual for the Windows 10 operating system by the two well-known authors is a composition of guide and introduction. Both newcomers and experienced users are addressed. Following the first edition published last year (2017), an updated version is now available, taking into account the updates "Fall Creator" from 2017 and "Redstone" from this spring, which have been integrated by Microsoft in the meantime.

Agility? : Challenges of New Concepts of Self-Organization ¤ Agility is a top theme in the world of work. This is due to the fact that self-organized work is becoming increasingly important and therefore alternatives to traditional forms of corporate governance are in demand. Agile procedures offer themselves here. But what can agility actually achieve? In this volume, experts from labor research and practice from different perspectives deal with this question. What exactly does self-organization mean? How must corporate framework conditions be designed so that agility works? How do you deal with the fact that agile procedures are also formal control instruments and restrict self-organization? Which alternative procedures can promote self-organization? And what should be taken into account when exporting agility from software development to other areas where self-organized work is already being done to a high degree – such as stationary nursing care? The book invites a differentiated confrontation with the topic of agility and opens up concrete design proposals for self-organized work.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002805-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161817-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126830-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1123527725>

Education as Redemption : Transformations of the Religious in Reform Pedagogy ¤ The author examines the role of religion in the thinking of reform pedagogues and in their pedagogical concepts. Analyzed is how reform pedagogues deal with the theme of religion or religiosity, whether and how their conceptions of religious terminology are shaped and what positions they take on school religious education. At the same time, the religious dimensions of reform pedagogical practice are asked. This does not only analyze the level of discourse. Also included are the practice forms of religion and religiosity. It becomes clear that reform pedagogical positions on religion move in the field of tension between critical distance to established churches on the one hand and the production of new, individualized forms of the religious on the other hand. The new forms, so the result of the study, are particularly characterized by an evolutionary monism, by Nietzscheanism, mysticism, forms of natural religion, by elements of Asian religions and by folk or Germanic religiosity. Reform pedagogical approaches received essential impulses through the confrontation with questions of religion and prove themselves as a transformation of the religious. This connection has been hardly noticed by research so far.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130226-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049422-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115719-9>
Doing Gender in Today's School Life: Empirical Studies on the Social Construction of Gender in School Interactions ¤ This study is based on the coeducation debate, which has been revived since the 1980s. Here, the active role of acting persons is considered, and the question is asked how girls and boys are involved as actors in the construction of gender. With this work, the time of adolescence is considered, which is particularly important for gender relationships. With the concept of the social construction of gender, the question of how doing gender is practiced, the study offers a theoretically relevant approach for gender research that has been empirically implemented to a lesser extent so far. The results of a longitudinal study are presented, in which three gymnasial classes were accompanied over three years. Not the disadvantageous view of girls leads the interpretations, but the question of the staging forms and also the gains of doing gender. Above all, among the teachers, a far-reaching dramatization of gender can be found. Among the young people themselves, there are of course also dramatizations of gender, because girls and boys benefit from them. But there are also de-dramatizations, behaviors that are not centrally determined by gender.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071776-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027266-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4563270-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053474-1>
Forest Soil Condition Report for Lower Saxony and Bremen: Results of the Second Forest Soil Condition Survey (BZE II) ¤ The Forest Soil Condition Survey (BZE) provides a comprehensive picture of the current state of forest soils and their changes over time. The BZE in Lower Saxony and Bremen is based on a grid network with a total of 272 sampling points. BZE I (1990-1991) showed clearly critical conditions of forest soils, especially due to atmospheric acid inputs. The repeated inventory (BZE II, 2006-2009) now provides insight into changes in forest soils against the background of decreasing acid loads, continued high nitrogen inputs, and the effects of compensation lime applications. In addition to the detailed analysis of chemical properties of various forest soils − from poorer sands in the lowland to rich limestone soils in the upland − the focus is on carbon and nitrogen storage, as well as results on tree nutrition, forest vegetation, and intensive forest environmental monitoring. The Forest Soil Condition Report for Lower Saxony and Bremen provides important decision-making bases for science, practice, and politics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132325-7>

Child Abuse: Recognize, Help, Prevent ¤ Information on the topics of prevention and therapy of child abuse, equally suitable for parents, kindergarten teachers, teachers, etc. (LK/WIT: by Grote) Compared to the first edition (BA 1/99, not available for comparison) this expanded edition of the important title on the topic of child abuse contains 25 additional pages. The psychologist Deegener has been dealing with the topic for a long time. In this well-written, understandable, and at the same time scientifically founded book, pedagogical, psychological, and legal, but also historical and social aspects of the topic are dealt with. The presentation takes the form of typical questions and theses, which are answered and executed in short, clear sections. The extensive literature references, grouped into categories such as literature for affected children, parent and legal advisors, etc. have been updated, the directory with further addresses is extensive. The overall successful book, which has already been characterized by Heidrun Küster as "an excellent working and information medium", can be recommended everywhere as a replacement or for initial acquisition.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076308-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126865-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030550-8>
Typenkompass Raumstationen : since 1971 ¤ The USA won the moon race during the Cold War, but only launched one manned space station, the "Skylab", with the "Spacelab" (ID 49/10 being a returning space lab). Here, the Soviet Union dominated with 7 "Saljuts", and today there is the international space station "ISS" and others. Like in the Typenkompass about the transporter "Space Shuttle" (Reichl: BA 8/09), the long-time EADS employee goes beyond a simple directory and writes a history of the numerous flights and research projects. The missions were often overshadowed by failures and catastrophes. In addition, astronauts from all over the world are presented in the text and the numerous tables and photos. A thoroughly excellent book that offers a lot of information for the price and, in addition to "Space-Shuttle" and Reichl's further catalogs "Manned Spacecraft" (BA 2/09) and "X-Planes" is recommended (BA 2/10, touches on space travel). With "Space Knowledge" (BA 1/07), the author also wrote an overview suitable for all libraries. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048597-3>

User- and Fuel Influences on Fine Dust Emissions from Small Combustion Plants ¤ Household heating systems contribute to a non-negligible share of fine dust emissions in Germany. The aim of the present project was therefore to investigate numerous influencing factors on the emission behavior at various wood chip boilers and to derive recommendations for action from this. For the test program, four heating systems were selected: two chimneys of different price categories, a tile stove heating installation and a wood chip boiler. At the selected heating systems, basic methodological questions were first clarified, in order to subsequently quantify the various fuel-related and user-related influences on the emission phenomenon.[...] (Source: Author)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153891-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4332388-1>
Young Houses for Young Families : Planning and Building ; Examples that one can afford ¤ The book shows examples of single-family homes and some double-family homes that were planned and realized with a relatively small budget, in part also through different shares of self-performance/construction work cheaper. Organized by architect houses, self-build, prefabricated houses, extension houses, the house models and the concepts of the owners are presented on 1-3 pages, with small floor plans and keyword information on construction method, architect, dimensions and costs. The construction prices are largely broken down into construction costs, ancillary costs, self-performance and move (without plot) below 200,000 euros. Embedded specialist articles also inform about land purchase, building planning, different building materials, construction execution etc. The appealing collection of examples on the topic of affordable building is aimed at young builders and offers a good supplement to the more systematic title by A. Linhardt (BA 10/03). (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131331-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013843-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144384-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4245918-7>
Handbook of Religious Studies : Religions and their Central Themes ¤ A compact yet comprehensive reference work on religions and their central themes. Overview articles inform about individual religions such as Islam, Buddhism, and other religions, but also Christianity; in this context, not only existing religions today, but also so-called 'extinct' religions (such as Egyptian or Celtic religion) are taken into account. Topics that connect or separate the religions, that are common to them or that distinguish them (such as conceptions of life after death or rebirth teachings), are treated in detail. They pursue the intention to give a representation or foundation of the religious studies as an academic discipline in essential aspects.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049426-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049396-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4455022-4>
Little 1 x 1 of the Theory of Relativity: Einstein's Physics with Middle School Mathematics ¤ The desire for a better understanding of the theory of relativity is often found among scientifically interested individuals, but it remains unfulfilled most of the time, as the literature is either too shallow or too demanding. This book deliberately and didactically takes a middle path. Formulas are not omitted, mathematics is used intensively, but, as the title honestly expresses, only up to the middle school level. Many theories are first presented in a thought experiment, then the relevant formulas are derived and explained in detail. There are a few calculation examples and graphical representations. Topics include the general and special theory of relativity, gravity, black holes, cosmology, especially redshift and the Doppler effect. This is one of the few books on the theory of relativity that you have to work through, but you really feel like you finally understand something, and it is certainly one of the best that has been published in the non-fiction sector so far. Highly recommended! (1)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049363-5>
Virtualization and Cloud Computing : Concepts, Technology Study, Market Overview ¤ Virtualization and Cloud Computing are currently among the most important buzzwords for operators of IT infrastructures. There are a wide variety of different technologies, products, and business models for completely different application scenarios. The present study first provides a detailed overview of current developments in concepts and technologies of virtualization technology – from classical server virtualization to infrastructure for virtual workplaces to application virtualization and makes an attempt at classifying virtualization variants. When considering the Cloud Computing concept, its basic principles, as well as various architecture variants and application cases are introduced. The detailed examination of the advantages of Cloud Computing as well as possible concerns that must be taken into account when using Cloud resources in the company shows that Cloud Computing offers great opportunities, but is not suitable for every application and not for every legal and economic framework. The subsequent market overview for virtualization technology shows that the major manufacturers – Citrix, Microsoft, and VMware – each offer products for almost all virtualization variants and highlights decisive differences as well as the strengths of the respective providers. For example, Citrix's solution for Virtual Desktop Infrastructures is very mature, while Microsoft can only rely on standard technology here. VMware, as market leader, has found the greatest dissemination in data centers and offers as the only manufacturer true fault tolerance. Microsoft, on the other hand, scores with the seamless integration of its virtualization products into existing Windows infrastructures. In the area of Cloud Computing systems, some open-source software projects are shown, which are certainly suitable for productive operation of so-called private clouds.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7623494-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200434-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4839180-3>
Language with Heart, Hand, and Foot: Paths to the Motorics of Connectedness ¤ The child's language development does not take place solely in the brain - it is closely related to movement. Vahle describes the four 'basic movements' of the body - heartbeat, breathing, touching/grasping, and upright walking - and explains their role in learning to speak. Numerous examples, poems, exercises, and a look at other cultures convey a playful approach to language: so speaking is fun for the children too!	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075004-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056458-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006323-9>
The Globalized Human : How Globalization Changes Humans ¤ If the new capitalism in the form of globalization is understood as a concrete universal claim to power, to which not only the economy has subscribed, but which is also accepted by politics as an unchangeable framework, then the question arises about the effects of this globalization on human relationships. How does the >homo oeconomicus< react psychologically and thus in the design of his relationships to the demands of globalization? This book is able to inform much more comprehensively about the effects of globalization on humans than one-sided blame attributions or very economic attempts at explanation can.

Who's Afraid of Germany? : A History of a European Problem ¤ Germany is in a dilemma. Everywhere it is expected to take on political leadership. But if it does, the accusation of German dominance is predetermined. The renowned historian Andreas Rödder tells the story behind it: the story of 'German strength' in Europe, which has survived all the catastrophes of the 20th century, the story of German self-images as a cultural nation and the story of the many ambivalent feelings of neighbors towards Germany - which are still present to this day. How can Germany deal with these ambivalences? How can German strength and European common good be reconciled? And how can Germany contribute to a strong Europe?

E-Books with ePUB : from Word to E-Books with XML ¤ Publication for professionals in electronic publishing to create appealingly designed e-books in the ePUB format using Word files as source material. (Elke Nibbrig) E-books have become an important topic of discussion in the publishing and media world, since the beginning of 2010 the ePUB format has established itself as an open standard, but surprisingly there has been no professional literature in the German-speaking area except for weblogs. Victor Wang (expert in media-neutral publishing) closes this gap and offers a well-founded publication on the creation of appealingly designed e-books in the ePUB format using Word files as source material. After an introduction to the history of e-publishing, different reading devices, formats, and digital rights management, it deals with XML basics as the basis of the ePUB format and the production of Word-XML documents. In the 2nd half of the book, the different sub-standards of ePUB are presented in detail and the practical implementation of an e-book production is demonstrated using a sample workflow. With numerous examples, screenshots, listings, command references, further web addresses, etc. Recommended for larger computer stocks. No comparison title, to be reviewed is E.

Small Hands in the Great War : Children's Fates in World War I ¤ The „catastrophe of the 20th century“, World War I, put humanity in a state of emergency. This included the generation of children, whose fates are told for the first time in this book. Child soldiers fought in the thousands in almost all armies in World War I. Alone in England, there were about 250,000. But there were also underage war nurses and many children who had to experience the atrocities of the occupation: 100 years after its beginning, the history of World War I is told completely new on the basis of their diaries and letters.

The Interpretative Paradigm : An Introduction ¤ The book introduces the fundamental principles of sociological theory and research perspectives of the Interpretative Paradigm. With this term, approaches are designated in which the abilities and necessities of humans, to gain access to the world, in a meaningful and acting way, are made the starting point of the analysis - mostly in the form of qualitative social research. Sociology is conceived and practiced here - long before the Cultural Studies - as 'cultural science'.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139191-3>
Investment and Financing : Fundamentals of Corporate Financial Management ¤ The textbook defines the goals of investment and financial policy in companies and explains the basics and methods of investment accounting, financing, and financial derivatives in a simple and understandable way. Systematically, classical and new instruments are presented, analyzed, and evaluated. Examples and tasks with solution proposals supplement the explanations. New in the eighth edition is especially a chapter on the Capital Asset Pricing Model. In addition, the necessary adjustments and additions were made due to the Act amending the Stock Corporation Act, which came into force on December 31, 2015.(Publisher's text)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017182-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027556-5>
Lexicon of Sociology ¤ Repeatedly thoroughly revised reference work (latest 3rd edition: BA 9/94), which in its state of processing takes account of the developments of the last few years in the field of sociology. Again, hundreds of articles have been added, rewritten, shortened, and corrected. Furthermore, the editors' efforts are still focused on providing an overview of the vocabulary of sociological language and giving sociological laymen, sociologically interested people, and sociologists the opportunity to look up and find briefly explained specialist terms. The pre-editions from 1973 (ID 38/73) and 1978 with special edition 1988 (BA 6/79, 204 and E-ID 42/88) should in any case be replaced by the 1994 edition if possible. (2 A,S) (LK/GÖ: Vetter) This comprehensive reference work for the social science specialist language offers reliable explanations of terms from sociology as well as from social philosophy, political science and political economy, social psychology, psychoanalysis and general psychology, anthropology and behavioral research, theory of science and statistics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077624-4>
Concrete structures for wind turbines ¤ This book deals with the fundamentals of planning, design, calculation, and construction of concrete and prestressed concrete towers as well as hybrid tower structures for wind energy applications. The focus is on the highly dynamic loads of onshore and, in particular, offshore wind energy applications. The wind industry in Germany takes a leading position worldwide in the development and manufacture of wind energy systems (WEA). With the progressive development of increasingly more efficient wind energy systems and the additional requirements for the design and execution of offshore foundation structures, the existing experience in the various fields of civil engineering is exceeded. In this book, the fundamentals for planning, design, calculation, and construction of wind turbine structures made of concrete and prestressed concrete, for onshore and offshore systems, are treated. Wind energy systems are highly dynamic structures. For the design of load-bearing structures, in addition to the maximum loads, fatigue loads are of great importance, especially in the connection and node areas of concrete and hybrid structures. There, multi-axial loading states occur that are not yet covered by the design regulations. The special influences and non-linear material behavior are presented in detail and the model formations for the calculations are explained. Design and proof are treated under special consideration of fatigue. The chapter on production includes hybrid structures, the segment construction method for prestressed concrete towers, and the foundations for offshore wind energy systems. Since 1906, Ernst & Sohn has accompanied the development of reinforced and prestressed concrete construction with the Concrete Calendar. This book should accompany the progress of reinforced concrete construction annually, as long as the "stormy development", as the first editor Fritz von Emperger (1862-1942) put it, would find an end to the construction method. Selected chapters of the Concrete Calendar are made available to the international market in the new English-language series BetonKalender Series.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4203577-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144990-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128839-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055978-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060592-9>
Renewable Energies : Application Possibilities - Technologies - Economic Efficiency ; with 56 Tables ¤ In view of dwindling resources, it is urgently necessary to save energy costs and reduce emissions when building and renovating buildings. This can be achieved by using renewable energies such as photovoltaics, solar thermal, heat pumps, or by using conventional energy forms more efficiently and better insulation. Accurate analyses are necessary to ensure the economic efficiency of the investment. The professor of building management deals with the basics, advantages and disadvantages of individual plant forms as well as the legal situation and presents exemplary cost calculations. The specialist book convinces through systematicity, argumentative precision and a successful combination of text and images. It is highly recommended for professional users from architects to energy consultants, and is also suitable for homeowners (e.g. Jürgen Brück: "New Energy Concepts" (BA 6/08) or Bo Hanus: "Home Supply" (BA 6/07). High price, but still acceptable in view of the good equipment and comprehensive information.

The Sons of Mars: A History of War from the Stone Age to the End of Antiquity ¤ Primarily military history of war from the beginnings to Late Antiquity for the European and Near Eastern space. Review: The Wuppertal ancient historian, who presented a history of the Roman imperial period here (2014), has now written a primarily military history of war from the 6th millennium to the 6th century AD. He sees the starting point for wars in social conditions and thus also as a historical phenomenon, whose eternal persistence does not necessarily appear. He also relativizes many finds that have been interpreted as victims of collective violence so far. Also interesting is his thesis that the emerging Hoplite formation did not have exclusively social causes, but in its defensive aspects also a later reflection on the vandalizing warrior bands of the dark centuries in the Greek-Near Eastern space. This is also an interesting alternative to H. Sidebottom (2008), who only considers the ancient world. Raimund Schulz also only deals with the period from the Iliad to Late Antiquity in his very readable, less problematic book "Field Commanders, Warriors and Strategists" (2012).

Hattie for Stressed Teachers : Key Messages and Action Recommendations from John Hattie's "Visible Learning" and "Visible Learning for Teachers" ¤ The mammoth studies of education researcher John Hattie (ID-B 40/13 and ID-B 9/14) are still causing lively discussions, both in professional circles and in the general public. Zierer, one of the two German Hattie translators, introduces Hattie's thinking, presents central statements of the 2 large studies, comments on the results and points out limitations. The conclusion is formed by action recommendations for everyday teaching based on the findings of the Hattie studies. The text is introduced by an interview with John Hattie. A compressed and with numerous graphics as well as in print highlighted key messages, summaries and reflection tasks also well understandable introduction. Still before "The Hattie Study in Discussion" (ID-B 25/14) for teachers, but also for all other interested parties who have not read the extensive studies.

Technoscience: Recognize — Shape — Be Responsible ¤ Introduction -- From Engineering to Technoscience -- The Technoscience and its Place in the Sciences -- Recognize in the Technoscience -- Shape in the Technoscience -- Responsibility -- Further Reading. What are the technosciences? What are their characteristics and how do they differ from other sciences? How did the technosciences come into being and what role do technology and technoscience play in society? Despite their social significance, the technosciences have so far been largely neglected by traditional science research. They themselves have hardly reflected on their foundations and fundamental questions. acatech advises society and politics on technoscientific future issues. In order to be able to do this, the German Academy of Technological Sciences must also deal with its own discipline. This acatech IMPULS is intended to provide a stimulus to discuss technoscience as a knowledge system both within and outside of acatech, and to sharpen the self-awareness of technoscience.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137304-2>
Dictionary of Film ¤ The film was still too young at the beginning of the 1940s to have a substantial body of literature on its history and the various social, technical, or economic manifestations. However, during World War II, the newspaper and film scholar Hans Traub undertook a project to create a 'Dictionary of Film.' This ambitious project would have been considered a 'sum' of the film science at the time of its publication. However, the war and Traub's early death prevented the publication of the work, which only survived the end of the war in a fragmentary form. The publication of the 'dictionary' preserved in the collections of the Deutsche Kinemathek as a facsimile allows for a more accurate assessment of the state of German film science at the time and provides insight into the extent to which the National Socialist ideology was effective or even formative. The text fragment spans from the keywords 'Abbau' to 'Wochenschau.' Where necessary, it was corrected, commented, and contextualized. Accompanying essays deal with the fate of the material that had been lost for decades and evaluate Traub's achievements, who is now experiencing a rediscovery. A confident foreword by the National Socialist film director Karl Ritter, possibly also intended as a political guarantee of the publication, was added to the corpus. The book thus continues the current increased reflection on its own professional history in the field of film archiving and science.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154385-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017102-4>

Gardens in the Countryside: Garden Art Yesterday and Today ¤ Historical insights into various epochs of European garden cultures - from regional farmer's gardens to natural, atmospheric gardens - conclude with the appeal to give garden culture a new direction and to include landscape impact in the mood of rural gardens. (Hansgeorg Minzlaff) The starting point of the gardens in the countryside are initially farmer's gardens in the Black Forest with their baroque patterns in the Emmental, then representative gardens in Northwest Germany, including the lordly Artland farmer's gardens. With the description of natural gardens in England, France, and the Netherlands, the development of the lordly landscape gardens is expanded around the historical model function. This leads to the final reflection on garden culture and design with spatial harmony and natural atmosphere, in order to be able to link up with old garden traditions. An excursion clarifies the terms 'Genius loci' and 'Zeitgeist'. The author has been working on and developing the Moorriem garden since 2006 (s. ID-B 32/12). His new book offers in its congruent image and text design (2-column layout, impressive photos, sometimes double-page) a readable insight into European garden art and garden design. With literature, place references (and map), addresses of the visitor gardens. After 'Garden Art' (H. von Trotha: ID-B 40/12) and 'DuMont History of Garden Art' (BA 7/06).

The Mathematics of Existence: A Brief History of Game Theory ¤ Life is a game that follows mathematical rules; our decisions can be calculated, and their greatest possible benefit for all can be calculated. The idea of game theory has written the history of economics, politics, and culture in the 20th century. Game theorists were advisors in the Cold War. And without realizing it, they laid the foundation for the triumph of Homo economicus. In his thrilling history of game theory, Rudolf Taschner spans a range from the invention of probability calculation in the 17th century to the present day of global financial markets.

Ad hoc present: short, crisp, and concise argue and convince ¤ Anita Hermann-Ruess is an expert in presentation and rhetoric (see ID-B 23/12). Her theoretical framework is the limbic communication model, which connects rhetoric with the findings of neuroscience. The model aims to explore how people feel, think, and decide, and how to reach and convince them rhetorically accordingly. The present title describes convincing presenting, spontaneously and in a short time. Short, concise, with catchy arguments, supported by rhetorical devices, visualizations, and multimedia tools, essential contents can be presented convincingly without extensive preparation time. It is also explained how to deal constructively with objections, attacks, and resistance. Hermann-Ruess presents her topics logically, clearly, and understandably, and with a focus on the essential. High practical relevance, broad target group, and constantly requested topic. With literature references. Despite the well-covered segment, broad recommendation.

The Security Society : Social Control in the 21st Century ¤ Social control is changing at a rapid pace. 'Online searches' of computers, storage of telecommunications data, video surveillance, as well as rising prison numbers and toughening of juvenile justice laws are just a few examples of this, which seem to stand independently of each other in the daily political discussion. In fact, they are however expressions of a fundamental change in social control and the societal understanding of security. The book presents this change and interprets it as the development of a new formation of social control, which works with techniques of self-leadership, control, and exclusion. This development is analyzed against the background of the economic, socio-cultural, and discursive changes of the past few years, which form the basis for the state and society to understand and react to crime and deviance differently today. From this, the outlines of a critique are sketched and a look at alternatives is given.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4318539-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117641-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127888-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055719-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134175-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113326-2>
Basiswissen Web-Programming : XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, PHP, JSP, ASP.NET, Ajax ¤ Compressed overview of important web technologies. HTML5 and CSS3 are also considered. (LK/HB: Isigkeit) All currently important web techniques are presented in this introduction book to web programming in a compressed manner. Since the 1st edition (ID-G 27/7), a lot has happened, so the lecturer has decided on an update. The structure of the book remained the same, but in individual chapters, significant changes can be observed. This includes a section on HTML5, extensions for CSS, and a nearly complete revision of the JSP chapter. In the ASP.Net chapter, tables and ASP.NET styles are now considered, and the final chapter on AJAX contains new examples. Case studies serve to illustrate and exercises are intended to promote understanding. Bold printed terms are explained in a glossary at the end of the book. The changed sentence layout now takes up more text, so the book's scope has been slightly reduced. Well suited to gain an overview of the diverse topics. For libraries in the university field. An exchange of editions is appropriate. (3) (LK/HB: Isigkeit)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076370-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1041632088>
The Future of Capitalism ¤ In the last two hundred years, capitalism has emerged stronger from all crises. This time, however, everything is different, capitalism is weakening. A global collapse was only averted thanks to massive state intervention, but for how long? Politics shows itself unable to tame the global economy, and capitalism is destroying, see climate change, further unrelentingly its own foundations. Should it indeed succumb to its contradictions, as Marxists had hoped earlier, then hardly in the form of an entry into the realm of bliss, but rather as a hellish downfall of the human species. At least one thing should be clear: if we want to survive, capitalism will have to change fundamentally - and we with it. The book brings twenty contributions to the discussion on the "Future of Capitalism" led in the Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung. With texts by Wolfgang Schäuble, Ingo Schulze, Dirk Baecker, Paul Kirchhof, Peter Sloterdijk, Martin Walser and others.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029577-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6>

Sociology of Communication Media: Media, Forms, Expectations ¤ The "Media Sociology" has so far concentrated too much on mass media and has failed to develop a distinguishing concept of communication media that also appropriately takes into account the technicality of media. The present volume will propose a proposal for how a sociological theory and analysis of communication media are to be developed, which with sustainable terms captures the socio-technical developments of media differentiation just as the expression of medial communication forms and communication expectations that are related to specific medial horizon of meaning.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077624-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169187-8>
The Global Dumbing Down : Condemned to Decline? ; With a Collection of Quotes on the Topic of Stupidity ¤ For Reutterer, philosopher and adult educator, it is almost unbelievable what we are all ready and able to think and do against all reason. Reutterer describes 'Riches of Human Stupidity', such as media, politics, prejudices, aggression, religion, superstition, esotericism and parapsychology. He pursues the causes of stupidity, which he sees in the emotional area, not in a lack of cognitive ability, shows that stupidity is often artificially created, and makes proposals for its combat. At the end a collection of quotes on the topic. A content-rich and challenging rebuke to human stupidity. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136152-0>

The Africa Lexicon: A Continent in 1000 Keywords; with 101 Images, Maps, and Tables ¤ The long-awaited, ambitious book of the Cameroonian editor, a Berlin-based political scientist and philosopher, informs as the first German-language lexicon, comprehensively about Africa (including the Arab North). Around 200 renowned scholars have written the compact, yet easily understandable individual contributions. These are each accompanied by references to further literature. This reference work not only contains country reports, but also articles on everyday life, history, politics, law, and economy, on art, literature, language, philosophy, religion, on sciences, technology, and media. In view of many still prevailing clichés and generally lacking knowledge about Africa, this book practically leaves no questions unanswered. Unfortunately, due to space reasons, biographies of African personalities had to be omitted. - Nevertheless, this Africa Lexicon is also a worthwhile acquisition for smaller libraries - despite the proud price.

Mosses Simply Identified: A Reliable Guide to the Most Common Species of Central Europe ¤ The identification book introduces the peculiarities of the biology of lichens, their use, collection, and identification. For excursion and "labor". (Olaf Kaptein) The handy identification book introduces the peculiarities of the biology of lichens, their use, collection, and identification in the initial chapters. This includes explaining necessary technical terms and defining the different habitats of the symbionts. So, the main part is divided into descriptions of the most important 20% of the species occurring in Central Europe, grouped by habitats. Each of these chapters is preceded by a simple key to easily find the species descriptions. In addition to the main and distinguishing characteristics, as well as information on distribution and ecology, 1-3 informative photos in suitable format are presented. As a pure lichen identification book, "Lichens of North and Central Europe" (BA 7/92) was presented here last. Common identification aids usually offer lichens, ferns, mosses, club mosses, and horsetails, in very small selection, for example, "Ferns, Mosses & Lichens" (BA 10/10), while the "Lichen and Moss Color Atlas" (BA 8/00) is more comprehensive. For serious identification, a magnifying glass and microscope are indispensable. (2) (Olaf Kaptein)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017450-5>

Educational Constructivism : learner-centered education in school and adult education ¤ Educational Constructivism is a neuroscientifically based learning and epistemological theory that, in conjunction with systems theory, prompts a pedagogical shift from knowledge transmission to support for self-regulated learning processes. -- Educational Constructivism is a widely discussed basic theory of our time. The epistemological core thesis reads: We do not recognize the external world as it really is, but we construct our own realities together with others, which enable a 'viable' action. Learning is also a self-regulated, biographically shaped activity that can be prompted but not organized from the outside. Educational Constructivism emphasizes the subjective perspective of constructing life worlds against the traditional perspective of linear knowledge transmission. It is not the transmission of subject matter knowledge that takes center stage, but the ability to build knowledge networks. This subject-oriented concept is not entirely new in education. Nevertheless, Constructivism contains provocative and irritating stimuli. This book draws a pedagogical balance of the Constructivism discussion and shows didactic-methodological consequences for school, university, and adult education. The organizational development of educational institutions is also inspired by Constructivism. Through numerous examples of educational practice, an attempt is made to reduce the gap between theory and practice. The book aims to encourage readers to make their own experiences with Constructivism. The beginning contains a glossary with key terms of Constructivism.

Kunst-Gewerbeschule Zürich : Re-Restoration and Renovation for the Zurich General Vocational School ABZ ¤ ‘Shoemaking Factory’ and ‘Fashion Wit’ are just two of the nicknames given to the building, which was considered revolutionary when it was built for the Zurich Trade School and the City of Zurich’s Museum of Applied Arts between 1930 and 1933 by architects Adolf Steger and Karl Egender. Today, the spacious building is considered one of the few icons of the New Building in Zurich. The school wing, with its flat roof and grid façades, is the epitome of a modern ‘laboratory for industry’, where renowned teachers of applied art such as Alfred Altherr, Johannes Itten, Hans Finsler, Willy Guhl, or Josef Müller-Brockmann shaped generations of designers and photographers. With a refined restoration and some innovative detail solutions, architects Silvio Schmed and Arthur Rüegg adapted the former site of the legendary Zurich University of the Arts to the needs of the Zurich General Vocational School ABZ in 2016/17. This building monograph provides insight into the prototypical problems that need to be solved when adapting to current standards, presents the building from the perspective of monument conservation in its historical dimensions, and paints a vivid picture of the past and future life in this outstanding witness to modernity	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061577-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049600-4>

Sandwich plates made of natural fiber reinforced bio-polyurethane and PU foam as a contribution to sustainable lightweight construction (NF-BioPUr) of the research unit(s) Faserinstitut Bremen e.V. - FIBRE - : Final report on the IGF project : the IGF project 17913N/1 of the Research Association Research Council Textile e.V was funded by AiF within the framework of the programme for the promotion of industrial collective research (IGF) by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy ¤ The book summarizes the results of a research project. It was possible in the project to produce sustainable lightweight materials from renewable raw materials, which have essential advantages over standard plates. Using bio-based polyurethane in combination with flax fabric or commercial furniture decorations as a surface layer, components were produced that have the following advantages compared to conventional plates: - Low density - Mechanical bending strength at the level of MDF or OSB plates - Extremely low and completely reversible water absorption - Low flammability at a level close to aerospace applications Another advantage of the plates is a thermal conductivity that is still twice as high as that of typical insulation materials, but only half as large as that of standard plates. The results of this project can thus establish a new product class in lightweight construction, which is sustainable in multiple ways (weight reduction, use of bio-based materials), and at the same time offers users an additional benefit in several areas. The sustainability aspect can be positively marketed at the same time and can also become a growing price advantage on the raw material side at expected increases in crude oil prices. Dr. Holger Fischer, born in 1961, is a chemist and has been active in the field of renewable raw materials, natural fibers, and sustainability at Faserinstitut Bremen e.V. since 1997. His areas of focus are enzymatic fiber modification, fiber characterization, natural fibers, surface modification of fibers, natural fiber reinforced composite materials, and biocomposites.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035165-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127568-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179068-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046304-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175327-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7641320-2>
Contract Law General Part: An Introduction with Cases ¤ The General Part of Contract Law contains the basic rules for all contractual relationships. It encompasses not only the (exam-)practically important performance disruption law, but also the termination of contracts and their consequences, tort law, as well as the inclusion of third parties in the usual two-person relationship. The General Contract Law thus forms the foundation, in particular for the individual contract types of the Special Part, but also applies in conjunction with the remaining matter of the BGB. This book provides an introduction to the sometimes not too simple subject matter and deals with all essential questions in an appropriate scope. The 22 chapters offer, in addition to a systematic presentation of the subject matter, over 80 cases with complete solutions as well as almost 300 examples. In this respect, it follows the same concept as the "General Part of the BGB" by the same author, to which it also refers content-wise and with which it connects numerous references. The third edition is entirely marked by the reform of consumer law. The corresponding chapter has been completely rewritten and significantly expanded.

Both methods for continuous risk management as well as for auditing, controlling, and integrated company evaluation and analysis are presented. Continuous "Change Management" rounds out the palette. The book is content-wise and methodically precisely tailored to the requirements of the event "Integrative Management Systems" in the Bachelor's main study of business administration. The target groups are therefore Bachelor students at universities of applied sciences as well as at universities and universities of applied sciences. At the same time, the book is also suitable for practitioners who want to gain a basic insight into the subject matter. The now updated 3rd edition integrates the innovations from ISO 9001:2015 and the corresponding other management system standards. (Publisher's text)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4346301-0>

Mobility Management in Germany: A Critical Inventory ¤ The present contribution puts a (new-) definition for the transport planning instrument mobility management to discussion. Starting point is the hypothesis that the existing partly very different definitions enable the applicability of the instrument, but result in a diffuse overall picture, which prevents a successful agenda setting. In order to overcome the diffuse concept and to provide all involved actors with a uniform basis and to achieve a satisfactory political marketing in the end, the institute of integrated transport planning suggests a definition on the basis of an object-oriented view of transport planning. Central is that mobility management is equal to infrastructure- and traffic-management. Furthermore measures can be assigned to the instrument by their primarily impact on the planning object, which is mobility. Therefore, mobility management has to be focused on its operational level while normative attributes are assigned to the guiding principle of integrated transport planning. The guiding principle of integrated transport planning is also superordinated to infrastructure- and traffic-management and regulates the capabilities of the three fields of transport planning (infrastructure, traffic and mobility).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4417126-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062954-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5>

Python for Engineers and Natural Scientists: Introduction to Programming, Mathematical Applications, and Visualizations: With Numerous Images and Tables, as well as 68 Exercises ¤ This book is a revised and expanded new edition of the author's introduction to the easily learned programming language Python. The main difference lies in the use of the current language versions Python 3.5 and Python 3.2. The author addresses students with a minor in computer science, primarily engineers, and assumes only upper-level high school knowledge in mathematics. He begins with the basics and the installation of Python and then focuses on object-oriented programming, numerical calculations, graphical representations, computer algebra, and 3-D graphics (for the creation of interactive 3-D scenes). The programming help through the extensive standard library of Python is also well considered. At the end of each chapter, exercises with detailed commented solutions. The author clearly shows that with Python, a simpler access to algorithmic thinking is possible than, for example, with a higher programming language like C or C++. A dedicated website for the book provides occasional updates.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4434275-5>

A lot of material - learned quickly: Optimal preparation for exams ¤ The amount of material is increasing and at the same time the learning time budget is getting smaller. Professor Lehner wants to show how students can overcome this challenge and prepare optimally for an exam. He explains how one can manage to extract the essential for the exam without falling into the 'completeness trap'. Then it's about preparing the exam contents in a retrievable way using key terms and organizational aids and 3. he explains how one can effectively repeat and practice exam contents. Finally, there is a compilation of the presented techniques and instruments. A clearly prepared exam coach with numerous illustrations, information tables, quotes, and content summaries, concentrated on the transmission of suitable learning techniques	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125746-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115658-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074168-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025226-7>
Successful Cooperation : Best-Practice Examples of Excellent Collaboration ¤ In recent years, competition has dramatically intensified in many industries and markets. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are increasingly under pressure. Some companies respond to these challenges by entering into more cooperation and networking. Meanwhile, most SMEs still have reservations about the opportunities of collaborative cooperation. A hindering factor is the lack of well-founded experience-based knowledge about the potential and risks of networking. The authors present excellent business networks from the competition	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4402944-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197034-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031031-0>

Learning to Program for Dummies ¤ Books on specific programming languages have already appeared in the "... for Dummies" series. Now, after a longer break ("Programming for Dummies", 2005), a general programming guide is again available in the popular series. The studied computer scientist Lorig begins with the basics of programming and describes in it the general programming concepts as well as the various programming languages. The main content then makes programming with Java and with HTML/PHP for the web. In addition, there are cheat sheets, useful tools, and further tips. The target group are beginners without programming knowledge. The descriptions are understandable, in comparison to other programming guides, there are however relatively few step-by-step instructions. The typical series design looks very simple, next to the programming instructions, there are only a few black and white screenshots in the content.

Compendium of Psychology ¤ Compendium to psychology, explaining fundamental topics and terms of the subject in alphabetical order and can be used both as an introduction and as a reference work. (Inge Müller-Boysen) The compendium from Bildungsverlag EINS explains fundamental terms and topics of scientific psychology. Part 1 prepares the contents from aggression to goals of psychology in alphabetical order. Through the division into main and sub-articles and numerous references, the reader is given insight into the relationships between individual topics, terms, and questions. Part 2 lists the specialist terms alphabetically with a note on where they can be found. Thus, in the interplay of both parts, a comprehensive introduction to psychology and a didactically well-prepared reference work results. For students of psychological and pedagogical study programs as well as for psychological/pedagogical personnel. Alternatively to the well-prepared introduction to psychology by W. Schönpflug (BA 1/07) and relevant dictionaries such as the "Dorsch" (BA 5/09) recommended from medium libraries. (2) (Inge Müller-Boysen)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047704-6>
Spurensuche : Germany's East Yesterday & Today ¤ Since the turn of the century, buildings, streets, squares, cities, and landscapes have changed their appearance everywhere in the former territory of the GDR. After 15 years of German unity, a comparison of yesterday and today is worthwhile. Selected pairs of images from all regions of the new federal states depict a unique transformation by juxtaposing color photos from the time of the turn of the century and today. One recognizes how entire townscapes have changed, how entire building ensembles have disappeared and others have taken their place, and much more.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116587-1>

The Baffled Foreign Policy and Why It Needs the Support of Society ¤ The German foreign policy, long accustomed to success, requires a new orientation. Because numerous foreign policy crises threaten the stability of Germany in politics and society. The main problem is the low support for foreign policy decisions in the population, and thus a lack of legitimacy. In addition, German foreign relations are under dramatically changed influences: new technologies, new strong and authoritarian players on the international stage, as well as new publics in our society. Emotionalized publics are driving politics today massively forward: for example, the globalization-critical Attac movement or Pegida. Here, citizens demand more participation in politics. A solution sees Volker Stanzel in the opening of the state for the co-responsibility of citizens – also in the European Union. Politics must go beyond the traditional means of state action, address the new publics, and thus achieve a greater legitimacy for foreign policy action.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003846-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114382-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008767-0>
Demographic Change - State of Knowledge and Recommendations for Ensuring Mobility of Older Road Users ¤ The topic of safety of older road users has developed into an important focus of behavioral research at the Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt).

Strategies of Municipalities for their Municipal Housing Stocks: Results of a Municipal Survey; a Project of the Research Programme "Experimental Housing and Urban Planning" of the Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development (BMVBS), supervised by the Federal Institute for Building, Urban and Spatial Research (BBSR) in the Federal Office for Building and Spatial Planning (BBR) ¤ Municipal housing companies and stocks have traditionally played an important role on the German housing markets. In connection with realized or planned sales of municipal housing stocks, a lively housing policy discussion has been conducted in recent years. Against this background, the research project "Strategies of Municipalities for their Municipal Housing Stocks" was commissioned by the Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development (BMVBS) and the Federal Institute for Building, Urban and Spatial Research (BBSR). The aim of the study was to gain information about the situation and importance of municipal housing stocks as well as about the strategies of municipalities with regard to their municipal housing stocks.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117670-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056723-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190188-5>

Future of Collective Bargaining Autonomy: 60 Years of the Collective Agreement Act: Balance and Outlook ¤ Representatives from science and trade unions engage in a critical dialogue about the historical development, current problems, and future challenges of collective bargaining policy in Germany. The Collective Agreement Act is now 60 years old. While it has formed the legal basis of practical collective bargaining policy in the Federal Republic of Germany since its adoption in nearly unchanged form, collective bargaining policy and collective agreement structures have undergone a profound change. After the rapid spread of a dense network of branch collective agreements in the 1950s, trade unions achieved partly hard-won distribution and working time policy successes. Since the beginning of the 1980s, economic crises, social cuts, and increased international competition pressure have led to erosion of the collective bargaining system. The current crisis has exacerbated the situation: What can be learned from the past and what perspectives can be developed for a renewed collective bargaining policy?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117168-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059069-0>
Lasers in Science and Technology ¤ The non-fiction book informs about the basics and application areas of laser technology, provides an overview from the discovery of the laser to its practical application in today's time. (Dirk Reinartz) The author provides an overview of laser technology and its applications in this work. In doing so, the history of the laser is illuminated from discovery to current application. The writing style is fluid, easy to understand, and can be read very well. A keyword index, a list of illustrations, and literature recommendations round off the whole. Since this book partially forgoes depth, it is intended as a reading for technically interested parties who want to gain an overview of the operation of a laser. For students or graduates of this field, T. Graf (ID 24/09) or D. Bäuerle (ID 20/09) are recommended instead. (2) (Dirk Reinartz)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4196864-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034610-9>
Outlook 2007 for Dummies : [Manage Addresses and Dates ; Keep Important Tasks Always Present ; Build Your Own Contact Database] ¤ The organization and communication program Outlook, referred to by Microsoft as Desktop Information Manager, was last presented in this well-known series 10 years ago (BA 6/97, not available for comparison). With the new Office package 2007, there is now another modernized version of this program, which is presented here in its familiar appearance.

Gezi : a literary anthology ¤ The Turkish protest movement, which began in Istanbul's Gezi Park in late May 2013, quickly turned into a citizens' movement of environmentalists and social democrats against the increasing oppression of the people and Islamization of state institutions by the AKP government under Prime Minister Erdogan. Gezi, the starting point of the protests, stands in for the literary emergence of the present anthology. In total, 21 texts by well-known and unknown Turkish authors with their literary-intellectual reflections, which embody the dynamics of the Gezi movement in its entire discursive diversity, are included. Crime writer Ahmet Ümet, grande dame of Turkish political literature Oya Baydar, and bestselling author Ayse Kulin let people and trees speak in these stories. This anthology by Sabine Adatepe is an important supplement to the publications "Çapulcu" (ID-A 17/14) and "Taksim is everywhere" (ID-A 24/14) and provides, partly humorously, literary information about the state of the country since the protests.

Mathematics see and understand : Key to the world ¤ Review: This book originated from a series of events at the University of Lüneburg, which aimed to provide an insight into various scientific disciplines. The author represented mathematics. She tries to push back formalism, taking into account gaps in proofs, emphasizing applicability with visually illustrated patterns under the motto "better understanding without calculating than calculating without understanding" in selected areas. This is easily applicable to topics from geometry or graph theory, but also in fields such as, for example, stochastic or number theory, especially targeting cryptography, she leads with appealing ideas. As a supplement, also through moving images, a website is offered. The solutions to the embedded tasks can be found in the appendix. Like O. Deiser: "Basic concepts of scientific mathematics" (BA 7/10), this simpler text can also be recommended to students as a guide for finding a study subject.

NATO in (Dis-)Order : How Transatlantic Security is Re-Negotiated ¤ The current global political imbalances and the new forms of security risks require structural and strategic consequences for the NATO, founded in 1947 in the context of the Cold War. - Review: The introductory textbook, written by an experienced university lecturer, combines an overview of history, structure, and function of the defense pact founded in 1947 with in-depth political science analysis of the current tasks and problems. After the end of the Cold War in 1990 and the subsequent phase of political restructuring of Europe, international politics is currently determined by uncertainties and lack of clarity. The concept of security had to be redefined, expanded by the distortions resulting from globalization and international terrorism. The NATO expansion as well as that of the European Community result in new constellations, also due to the different national interests of the new members. The book provides insights into the spectrum of security issues and the challenges of risk hazards. Especially for students of political science.

Subject-Oriented Transition Research: Reconstruction and Support of Young Adults' Biographical Transitions ¤ The talk of de-standardization and individualization of transitions into work is already a common place. What consequences are to be drawn, however, from the fact that young women and men increasingly make their professional and life decisions alone and develop strategies for coping with requirements increasingly individualized (must)? The volume offers a theoretical and methodological access to de-standardized transitions, which integrates sociological, socio-political and socio-educational perspectives. The claim of subject-oriented transition research is to understand the decisions of young women and men and the biographical sense of their strategies in the context of institutional conditions. The justification of this perspective is shown by empirical findings from European comparative studies, which allow for an internationally comparative view of the German transition system and the biographical spaces it opens or closes. In this way, alternative forms of shaping biographical transitions become visible. Knowledge of these is necessary for critical social research that deals with transitions (not only) of young adults, but also for practitioners who are interested in reflecting the framework conditions and normality assumptions of their work.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167050-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072431-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4681060-2>

Alienation : Stories and History of the Great Task of Our Present ¤ Alienation is universal. It exists in all cultures, among all people. Alienation can enchant. It can also be experienced as threatening. Heinrichs follows the historical, ethnological, and psychoanalytic interpretations, connects alienation with experiences and experiences, and confronts us with the political theme of our time: At what points does the contempt for the other begin? This book brings the great theme of alienation into our mental and emotional proximity. It tells of alienation in the experience of people who flee from other societies in need, and it tells of how each of us can experience alienation. On journeys and in social and private environments, when we are confronted with our own, seemingly alien feelings. But what happens when those who have just been themselves foreigners in another country and have been welcomed, give up their positive alienation experience? "It's not the worst books that leave you with the desire to ask and add more. On the contrary: They are indispensable for a dialogue that opposes the monologues of hatred and exclusion. Hans-Jürgen Heinrichs has succeeded in writing such an inspiring book" (deutschlandfunkkultur.de)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018421-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033569-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4244141-9>

Java : the Basic Course ¤ Java 9 is the new version of a widely used object-oriented programming language. The book, which remains price-stable compared to the previous edition, provides a quick introduction to Java 9 for readers with little prior knowledge. Author Kofler limits himself to the important language elements and selected classes from the Java Standard Library and provides, supported by numerous code excerpts and exercises with solutions, a usable introduction also suitable for secondary school level II. A separate chapter is now dedicated to the "Java Crash Course" and the "Eclipse Crash Course" in the appendix has been replaced by the "IntelliJ IDEA Crash Course". Most of the implementations still work with JDK 8, but the book has been brought up to the level of JDK 9 in terms of content, and some approaches in the book only work with it. A replacement of the previous edition is therefore recommended	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/113696553X>

Economics and Industrial Sociology: Foundations, Questions, Areas of Study ¤ This introduction to economics and industrial sociology presents central questions and areas of study in economics and industrial sociology in a comprehensive manner and attempts to form a comprehensive field of study by combining the usually discipline-specific topics of economics and industrial sociology. The introduction provides students who want to approach these sociological sub-disciplines as a main or secondary subject with a basic orientation. The red thread is the fundamental sociological question of how a social order can come about through coordinated action of stubborn actors - such as employees and management, various competing companies, employers and trade unions - can. Following the recent economic sociology debate, it is discussed which answers the neoclassical economics can give to this with its rationality postulate. Subsequently, considerations and categories from the sociological theory debate are taken up to justify different forms of social and economic action coordination. These categories are used for the analysis of important areas of study in economics and industrial sociology. A special emphasis is placed on the phenomenon of globalization and the associated social and economic transformation processes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066514-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161626-1>

Bitcoin - kurz & gut ¤ Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin operate without banks and can simplify or reduce transactions, but also have special risks: How Bitcoins (but also other cryptocurrencies and money in general) work is explained in this book in a clear and detailed manner. (Martin A. Lobeck) There are already several books about Bitcoin, such as those by Daniel Kerscher (not discussed here). Cryptocurrencies operate without banks and can simplify or reduce transactions, but also have special risks. The virtual currency units - namely the Bitcoins - are only managed in databases, where the content is available as "Block Chain" at many places on the internet. Due to the size of the database, changes take relatively much time, so there are "Thin Clients" with partial information that react much faster, but are not entirely secure. What else you need to know to fill your own wallet with Bitcoins is described by the author, who is well-versed in Bitcoins, in a careful and detailed manner. He also addresses current developments, such as hardware wallets or the Kryptokit, which allows simple and fast payment in the web browser. In a later chapter, it's about the importance of money itself. Even readers who do not want to use the Bitcoin system but want to know more about it can inform themselves well here. (2) (Martin A.

Refactoring : How to Improve the Design of Existing Software ¤ Refactoring means the restructuring of the source code of a computer program, where the original program function remains unchanged. The goal of refactoring is, among other things, to improve the testability and extensibility of the program. At the same time, the probability of errors should be minimized. Literature on refactoring has not been discussed so far. This book is the completely revised new edition of the German translation of the English original title by R. Johnson, in which the term "Refactoring" was introduced in 1990. The didactically well-designed book relies on many code examples in JavaScript, although refactoring is not limited to a specific programming language. The focus lies on the general principles of refactoring and the improvement possibilities they offer for programming, the development of reliable tests for refactoring, and the detection of pitfalls during refactoring. Intensively, the simplification of conditions in programs is also treated. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4784343-3>
Health Purposes and Human Genetics: Medical Ethical Arguments for the Binding of Predictive Genetic Tests to Health Purposes ¤ With predictive genetic tests, it is possible to obtain information about individuals. The range of this information extends from hints for dietary advice to the diagnosis of severe genetic diseases. This spectrum of test forms ranges from those that do not appear to require regulation at first glance to those with a high potential for harm. Currently, the problem is mainly due to the expanding offers for genetic examinations on the internet. An assessment of the regulatory needs of predictive genetic diagnostics is therefore urgently required: The present volume examines the potential risks and regulatory needs for predictive genetic tests. It does not present its own regulatory proposal, but develops medical-ethical criteria for such regulations. A comprehensive documentation presents existing national and international regulatory approaches and analyzes them.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074672-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200230-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048737-4>

It deals with product design suitable for assembly and organizational forms of assembly, primary-secondary analysis for planning and determining the economic efficiency of assembly concepts, ergonomic design of manual assembly, hybrid and automatic assembly systems including automation components. Chapters on material supply, assembly planning, economic calculation and employee qualification round off the content. New fields of application for large equipment and machines, extensions in hybrid systems, robot deployment, image processing represent the state of the art. Problem areas such as flexibility, part supply, procurement concepts and logistics belong to a comprehensive consideration and are also treated. New sections on extended assembly planning, but also on the topic of employee qualification, round out the picture. The book lays the foundations for the development, design and operation of economically efficient assembly systems. TOC:Development of assembly technology.- Assembly-optimized product design.- Organizational forms of assembly.- Primary-secondary analysis, a method for planning and determining the economic efficiency of assembly concepts.- Manual assembly area small equipment.- Manual assembly area large equipment.- Economic efficiency of manual assembly.- Hybrid assembly systems.- Automatic assembly.- Construction of flexible assembly machines with robot deployment.- Material-part supply in assembly.- Integration/combination of part production-assembly.- Availability of assembly systems.- Planning and economic efficiency.- Economic assembly vs. low-wage countries.- Employee qualification in assembly/assembly craftsmen.-	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040126-1>
Soul and Totalitarian State: On the Psychic Heritage of the GDR ¤ The book forms a healthy counterbalance to the predominantly economically and prejudice-laden debate on German unity: Psychoanalytic experts place the unconscious reality of the individual in the foreground and thus point to approaches to individual, independent action	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182676-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060749-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047689-3>
Education to Poverty? : Social Work and the "New Underclass" ¤ The 'new underclass' has been discovered and the education of these precarious members of society is being demanded. Experts from educational science and social pedagogy address the question in this volume of how appropriate such a diagnosis of the 'new underclass' and the associated therapy proposal of an education to poverty is: How is social inequality made the subject in a changed form here? What challenges are associated with this for social work? Does the diagnosis of a 'new underclass' stand up to empirical verification? In what way are certain population groups made the target of political strategies here? The answers to these questions make the tension between structural, cultural, and moral explanatory attempts with a view to a professional and political location of social work analyzable.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062024-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4198892-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055676-1>
Tontechnik : [Vibrations and Waves, Hearing, Sound Converters, Impulse Response, Folding, Sigma-Delta Converters, Stereo, Surround, WFS, Mixing Consoles, Sound Engineering Practice] ; with 33 Tables ¤ The practice book, which is already in its 3rd edition, has meanwhile developed into a standard work for aspiring sound technicians and their daily routine in a recording studio or concert hall. The equally physically-technical fundamentals (including room acoustics or auditory psychology) as well as concrete implementations in converter and transmission technology treated in the book are characterized by good structuring of the material, an instructive illustration, and a very comprehensive keyword index. Compared to the 1st (BA 12/06) and also the not shown 2nd edition, only a few additions and updates have been made, the older editions are still usable. Within the specialized literature on the subject, first choice (also suitable for interested laymen). Hans Jörg Friedrich, "Sound Technology for Media Designers" (ID-G 35/08) is comparable in the basics, but targets a more specialized target group in the practical part.

Wirtschaftsgeographie : economic relationships in spatial perspective ¤ The 4th edition of the scientifically oriented textbook (lastly ID-G 22/12) remains largely unchanged in terms of content structure. In the revision, newer approaches and current developments have been incorporated, the bibliography contains numerous new sources. The authors remain committed to the 'relational approach', thus explicitly emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary cooperation with the social and economic sciences to adequately address the challenges of globalization. The strictly scientifically oriented textbook is suitable for lecturers and students of the aforementioned disciplines in a lecture accompanying manner. Possible in libraries with expanded holdings and corresponding academic audience, the previous edition can remain. More compact and less specialized is the 'Economic Geography' by E. Kulke (UTB; 6th edition 2017; lastly ID-B 43/04)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066446-6>
Gadget : why the future still needs us ¤ Jaron Lanier, who coined the term 'virtual reality,' presents in his new book how the World Wide Web threatens, diminishes, or destroys the individuality of each of us. Like no one else, Jaron Lanier predicted the revolutionary changes that come with the Internet and affect all aspects of our lives: work and leisure, trade and change, communication and sexuality, collective and individual life. Like no one else, he warns of the dangers of permanent online presence, of the loss of subjectivity in the anonymity of the network. One's own intelligence and the judgment of the individual are threatened by computer algorithms. Technological design, file-sharing, the Facebook cult, permanent accessibility, and often unfiltered presentation of one's own threaten the culture of dialogue, individuality, and secrecy, from which individuality feeds. Lanier shows the threats in many facets and advocates for a new, moderate use of the Internet. Computers, he passionately pleads, should improve humanity, not replace it. Jaron Lanier is considered the founder of 'virtual reality' technology. He teaches as 'Scholar at Large for Live Labs, Microsoft Corporation' in Berkeley, California, and has appeared internationally as a musician and visual artist. His contributions have also had a great echo in the German press. 'A provocative, certainly controversial book . . . Radiant, powerful, and convincing.' The New York Times 'Poetic and prophetic . . . the most important book of the year.'

EDV-Grundwissen : an introduction to the theory and practice of modern computer science ¤ With the revision of the previous edition (BA 5/02) of this standard work, account is again taken of the rapid progress in the IT sector. In addition to numerous details (additions to operating systems and programming), new sections or chapters can also be identified (PCI Express, Instant Messaging, Computer and Security). The areas of networking and access to the Internet have been newly structured. To improve use, the table of contents has been further differentiated and the nomenclature has been adopted into the chapter headings. The also updated bibliography now also lists internet resources. Consequently, the scope of the book has also increased further (60 pages). The concept has not changed, however, as comprehensive and profound computer science knowledge is still conveyed. Also suitable for students in secondary education II. Desirable in many computer collections. Due to the significant changes, the previous edition should be discontinued.

Acrobatics with Children and Adolescents ¤ The guide explains the basics and techniques for static and dynamic partner balances and human pyramids. In parallel to Blume's "Acrobatics: Training, Technique, Inscription" (ID-A 25/17), his training book "Acrobatics with Children and Adolescents" was also updated in the 10th edition (last ID-A 6/11). Professor Blume, an acrobatics expert, conveys the basics of partner acrobatics in working with children and adolescents. Here, not only sports and movement art are required. No less important are team spirit and cooperation, i.e. joint action, in order to achieve the desired success. After a basic theoretical introduction and preparatory exercises, the detailed practical part deals with the basics of pyramid construction and partner acrobatics with various variations. The individual figures and techniques are described in a comprehensible way using numerous photos and drawings and are relatively easy to implement. The new edition is largely identical in content to the previous edition. Recommended for teachers and coaches in school and club. The two guides by Blume are currently the only current titles on this topic.

World Culture: How Western Principles Penetrate the World ¤ Publisher's information: Everyone in politics and at the intellectual salon has been talking about world culture for years. The works of the sociologist who has possibly most closely examined the radicality corresponding to this term are almost unknown in the German-speaking world and have not yet been translated. The present volume brings together John W. Meyer's most important works for the first time. Despite national borders and cultural differences, a remarkable uniformity of concepts of statehood, organization, and individuality can be observed on a global level. How can this phenomenon be explained? For John W. Meyer, the developing world society provides general action models that show how states, organizations, and individuals as central actors of modernity should behave in order to find social recognition. The models are based in the culture of modernity, just like the world society itself. Their genesis, structural features, and consequences are derived theoretically and empirically demonstrated at different examples (state tasks, education, environmental protection). With this, John W. Meyer's theses represent an original contribution to the current globalization discussion, which distinguishes itself from economic narrowness and the idea of a fundamental cultural conflict alike.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033596-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4192241-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4434540-9>
Germany and its Refugees: The Rollercoaster of Discourses in the Long Summer of Flight 2015 ¤ The reception of thousands of 'foreigners' in the summer of 2015 was euphorically described in the media as a 'German miracle'. The refugees themselves hardly appeared in this perspective. Following the narrative of the 'culture of welcome', a rollercoaster of discourses ensued, shifting towards the threat of state failure, the burden limit, or sexual assaults. Primarily, it was about the well-being of the nation, and the 'refugee' became the cause of national distress. Uwe Becker analyzes these discourses and outlines which narratives were built up in the 'long summer of flight'. He shows how they rest in collective memory, are activatable at any time, and continue to legitimize a restrictive refugee policy to this day.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154680-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017604-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012475-7>
Dream and Excess : The Cultural History of Early Cinema ¤ The cinema is the art of the industrial age. An enormous effort in technology, capital, and logistics is needed until the dreams of the audience float over the screen. With the triumph of the cinema, not only has a new medium been established, but our perception of reality has also changed. Kreimeier tells the heroic early years of the cinema: from traveling cinemas at fairs to the cinema palaces in metropolises, from the first cinematic experiments to the evening-long epics of the silent film era. "The media scholar proves himself to be a grand storyteller with foresight: For not only the images came into motion in the founding era of film before World War I. The whole world suddenly turned differently. Kreimeier did not only write a new film history in the context of global cultural upheavals. He also explains the revolutions of modernity from those of the cinema" (FR)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017102-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017144-9>
Technical Chemistry: Introduction to Chemical Reaction Engineering; with 47 Tables and 35 Calculation Examples ¤ This textbook is a classic in Chemical Reaction Engineering. For the 5th edition, important data have been updated. A new chapter on Microreaction Technology complements the book, which thus treats this field as a separate chapter for the first time in a German-language textbook. The book can be used as a complete introduction to the subject, ideal for both scientific and practical studies. TOC: Fundamentals.- Tasks.- Economically optimal process management.- Physical and physico-chemical fundamentals.- General mass and heat balances for single-phase reaction systems.- The batch-operated agitated tank (batch reactor) with complete (ideal) mixing of the reaction mass.- Continuous reaction management without back-mixing of the reaction mass (ideal flow tube).- Continuous reaction management with complete back-mixing of the reaction mass in the reactor (continuously operated ideal kettle and cascade).- Comparative consideration of ideal flow tube, continuously operated ideal kettle, and cascade of continuously operated ideal kettles.- The semi-continuous operated ideal mixed tank (part-flow operation).- Residence time distribution and mixing in continuously operated reactors.- Chemical reactions in multiphase systems.- Heterogeneous catalyzed reactions.- Non-catalyzed heterogeneous reactions between fluid substances and solids.- Fluid-fluid reactions.- Microreaction technology.- Reaction engineering of polyreactions.- Mathematical appendix	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078178-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136173-8>
Turbulence and microstructure studies at a shallow sill of a Norwegian Fjord ¤ In autumn 2002, intensive turbulence and microstructure studies were conducted in the Norwegian Sognefjord using a microstructure and turbulence probe (MST probe) to determine the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy in the vicinity of an underwater ridge at the entrance to the fjord. To capture the hydrographic background, preceeding high-resolution measurements were carried out with a towed CTD chain and a shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler. The comparison with different regimes of oceanic turbulence shows that the measurements are also in line with those from other mixing areas with extreme topography (e.g. in the Strait of Gibraltar and at Stonewall Bank off the coast of Oregon).

Drama and Theater after 1989: precarious, intercultural, intermedial ¤ With the system change in 1989, the German theater landscape in East and West undergoes a lasting change. The theaters are increasingly under pressure to legitimize themselves, bow to the (technical) myth of rationality of efficiency, and are committed to the guiding concepts (of EU cultural policy) such as project work, mobility, and flexibility. These developments affect the institutional framework conditions, the theater work, and the self-image of the actors and actresses as well as the aesthetic production. The present volume attempts to clarify the interdependencies between institution and aesthetics (among other things through qualitative interviews), and takes four focal points into view: the economic (as a subject of theatrical texts and as theater work), the ›longing for reality‹, which since the turn of the century has led to the return of documentary theater, intercultural themes, theater concepts, and festivals (as forms of transfer) and lastly intermediality. In this way, the central trends of a German-speaking theater become apparent, which is increasingly moving in European and global spaces. „The clear structure, the stringent division of the volume, as well as the transitions between the individual chapters make Schößler's explanations easily readable and understandable. Alone a summarizing chapter at the end, which connects the results of the individual analysis areas with each other and provides a glimpse into desiderata and possible follow-up research, would certainly be helpful for the reader. In total, the volume should not only be a gain for Germanists and theater scholars familiar with the subject, but also for interested theater visitors. Because through the perspective of the author, the theater as an institution is clearly located in society. The effects of cultural policy decisions as well as economic conditions become visible, and not least, the people who work with and at the theater are taken into view“ (literaturkritik.de)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012899-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059702-7>
The Silence : Novel ¤ One hundred years from the history of two families and from the history of a country: Reinhard Jirgl's 'The Silence' is the monumental epic of the long 20th century in Germany. At the beginning stands an album of photographs, the oldest pictures are over eighty years old: one hundred photographs of two families, one from East Prussia, the other from Lower Lusatia. Two world wars, inflation, flight and expulsion have survived these two families over five political systems, from the imperial era to the present day. Following the one hundred photographs, Jirgl tells stories of injuries, love and betrayal. 'The Silence' confirms his extraordinary rank.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016397-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156601-4>

Excel 2007 for Dummies : everything in one book ¤ Comprehensive reference work for looking up individual problems on the topics of basics, working with worksheets, formulas and functions, handling workbooks, diagrams and graphic objects, data management, data analysis, macros and VBA programming. (Roland Schwarz) Vista started with us (cf. A. Rathbone, BA 9/07 and Woody Leonhard: BA 11/07), now there are also 2 different Dummies guides to Excel 2007. The author is the same in both cases (lastly in the Dummies "address book" BA 9/07), but Harvey has held to the conventions - despite some overlap. The present book consists of 8 "books", which deal with as many individual topics: basics, working with worksheets, formulas and functions, handling workbooks, diagrams and graphic objects, data management, data analysis, and finally macros and VBA programming. This is also a comprehensive reference work, designed for looking up individual problems and answering questions briefly. Unquestionably, the high quality of both books is undisputed, they provide competent and understandable information, offer illustrative illustrations and useful additional tips. Therefore, also a recommendation for this tandem. (2) (Roland Schwarz)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7558101-2>
Business Mathematics for the Bachelor's Program: Textbook and Workbook ¤ Textbook for students of economics in the early semesters, which repeats the school material and introduces economics mathematics with integrated tasks and their solutions. Review (ekz): The textbook is aimed at students of economics in the early semesters. The authors place particular emphasis on the repetition of the school material, as the school time at university for professionals usually lags behind by some time. In addition to mathematical basics, financial mathematics (interest and compound interest), linear algebra, functions with one and multiple variables, as well as differential calculations are explained and practiced using many tasks. The solutions are found by the learners after the tasks. (3)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066472-7>
Verdun 1916 : the Battle and its Myth from a Franco-German Perspective ¤ The Battle of Verdun from February 21 to December 19, 1916 between the German and French armies was the longest battle of World War I with more than 300,000 dead and 400,000 wounded soldiers. The brutal and extremely costly battles had no military outcome, the front line ended up again like at the beginning of the conflict. A hundred years after Verdun, many questions are still open: Why did the battle last almost a year? How did the initial German successes come about? How could the French successfully repel the attack? What significance does the battle have in the memory of both nations? Two renowned historians, the German Gerd Krumeich and the French Antoine Prost, describe the Battle of Verdun and its very different mythologization in both countries. With great expertise and from a comparative perspective, the authors describe the plans of the generals, the implementation by the officers, and the immense suffering of the soldiers. Never before has this total battle been jointly examined and told by a German and a French historian.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4212451-7>

Data Analysis with SAS: Statistical Procedures and Their Graphical Aspects ¤ The "Statistical Analysis System" is a program package developed 30 years ago for statistical investigations, which now runs on all common operating systems for mainframe and PC computers. In this volume, which is an extended 2nd edition of the 2004 published work (not discussed), version 8.2 for Windows is taken as a basis. Initially, the authors provide a thorough introduction to the structures and operations of the system, placing great emphasis on the graphical possibilities. Following a brief summary of the core areas of descriptive and inductive statistics, the main part presents a basic and at the same time practical representation of various procedures and applications using SAS. A reader should be familiar with the general mathematical basics. In addition to students of higher semesters, this is particularly addressed to demanding users of statistical procedures in practice.

The Soul of Illness : How to Release Inner Tensions and Strengthen Your Immune System ¤ This is - as the subtitle may suggest - not another guide to coping with stress and depression, but the doctor Blohm continues here consistently what he started in "Tickling in the Belly" (ID 14/00): to prove the eminent importance of the interplay between psychology, neurology, and the immune system in the development and management of organic diseases. Blohm's plea for the effectiveness of a science-based psychosomatics (=psychoneuroimmunology) is convincingly demonstrated using common disease patterns. After that, thoughts and feelings leave their marks on the body and influence the immune system - especially when they move in the field of tension between one's own inner values and external demands. How a person can become the 'interpreter' of their soul and possibly change its manifestations, Blohm leads through many case vignettes with 'health exercises'. - A pioneering salutogenic approach to overcoming dogmatic views of conventional and esoteric medicine.

Networks for Dummies : [Networkers networking in their own network ; at a glance: Implementation, Administration, Troubleshooting and Security ; Setting up networks over LAN and WLAN ; Protecting networks from hackers ; Network operating systems - Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Mac OS X and Co.] ¤ Now already in the 6th edition, the author again conveys all the knowledge about networks in an entertaining and understandable way. A glance at and into the book shows that all ingredients of the well-known introduced series are again represented. Even the majority of the text agrees with the previous edition (BA 10/08). The changes and updates refer to the consideration of the new operating system Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 Release 2. In addition, Lowe has added a new chapter on dealing with mobile devices. Where he focuses on Windows Mobile and BlackBerry devices. Even the obligatory Top-Ten part received a refresh. Still warmly recommended for updating the inventory. The predecessor can be phased out, but older works should be replaced. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070085-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006216-8>

The Hydrogen Boom : [Wish and Reality in the Climate Protection Race] ¤ Romm thoroughly and differentiated examines the possibilities and limitations of the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier in the face of dwindling oil reserves and threatening climate warming. He knows what he's talking about, because the trained physicist served the Clinton government as responsible for hydrogen and fuel cell research and is active in this field. The regional focus of the demanding, relatively easily understandable book is on the USA, which are both enormous energy consumers and major polluters involved in global problems and do too little about it. It becomes clear how difficult and complicated such a revolution in energy supply is to implement! After the easily readable H. Boethius: "The Hydrogen Turn" (BA 6/05) and alongside the mainly technically oriented Sven Geitmann: "Hydrogen & Fuel Cells" (last ID 51/05) as a comprehensive overview in content, highly recommended. A lot of interesting details can be found, such as the role of Iceland as a possible hydrogen pioneer.

Telecommunication in the new federal states : business and spatial effects since 1990 ¤ After German reunification, the significant infrastructural differences between the two state halves were the greatest obstacle to a rapid convergence of living conditions and economic structures between East and West. This also applied to telecommunications. With a large-scale investment program, the telecommunications infrastructure in eastern Germany is being expanded. The study deals with the spatial and economic effects of telecommunications in the new federal states, using selected economic branches in four case study regions as examples. Its results are based on literature analyses, expert interviews, oral and written surveys of the responsible Telekom service departments, a written survey of 459 companies, and in-depth interviews in 42 selected companies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059360-5>

Future Market Synthetic Biofuels : Case Study Commissioned by the Federal Environment Agency within the Research Project "Innovative Environmental Policy in Key Areas of Action" (Project Identification Number 206 14 132/05) ¤ Synthetic biofuels, together with bioethanol produced from lignocellulose fermentation, belong to the second generation of biofuels. Characteristic of these biofuels is that the entire plant mass is used for their production, including cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. In the fermentative biomass breakdown, ethanol is produced as a product. With the thermochemical biomass breakdown, the so-called BtL (Biomass-to-Liquid) process, synthetic biofuels are produced. In the first process step, the carbon-hydrogen framework of biogenic raw materials is thermally opened to syn gas. Syn gas is a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2). The second process step uses the purified syn gas for chemical fuel synthesis. The synthesis can be tailored to produce gasoline, diesel fuel, or designer fuels for advanced fuel-efficient and low-emission engines.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145658-0>
50 Key Ideas in Mathematics ¤ This 1st volume of a new textbook series follows a uniform schema. Each topic is treated on 4 pages, always with a striking headline, a text that often starts with a historical example, is often supported by some graphics, and closes with a guiding sentence for the topic, which is always rather ugly printed in the text "What it's about". The 4-page concept naturally leads to bite-sized information, which can lead to a basic understanding of many of the described ideas and can also lead to the reading of more specialized books in the library. This applies, for example, to the 4-color problem, the golden ratio, the normal distribution, fractals, or the importance of zero.

Practical Handbook of Architects' Law ¤ With the new Building Contract Act, the legislator has met a long-standing need of the building practice for specialization of the statutory provisions and created individual contractual regulations for the construction industry in the Civil Code. Since January 1, 2018, there are particularly for the building contract and the architect's and engineer's contract separate provisions. On this changed legal basis, the handbook provides an overview of the interplay of the regulatory works and presents the new regulations as well as their impact on practice. Further, the legal issues and questions to be observed by the planner at contract conclusion and contract implementation are treated practically with examples, tips, and model letters taking into account the current judgment of the European Court of Justice on the HOAI.

Strong Art by Autists and Savants: On Extraordinary Artworks, Art Therapy, and Art Education ¤ This book breaks new ground. Rather than pathologizing autists and their forms of expression, their strengths are uncovered and valued. This leads to strong, extraordinary art with personal, impressive stories. In addition to presenting a fascinating world of images, it is also about the question of discovering a creative potential as well as promoting and supporting artistic forms of expression by autistic children, adolescents, and adults. For this, the program of a subject-centered aesthetic practice is standing for school and extracurricular fields of work.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114333-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7558570-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125709-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033423-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003932-8>
Foundations of Analysis for Dummies ¤ A loose and detailed presentation of the mathematical material that one should know before dealing with differential and integral calculus in more detail. (Wolfgang Grölz) The title may raise false expectations. This 4th volume in the series on the topic of analysis, following M. Ryan: "Analysis for Dummies" (BA 6/07) and "Analysis for ... Exercise Book" (BA 12/09) as well as M. Zegarelli: "Analysis II for ..." (BA 8/09), does not deal with theoretical foundations in any way. The book aims to convey all that one should know before dealing with this field, without mathematical depth, often very illustratively. After a general introduction, polynomials and elementary transcendental functions as well as trigonometry with many geometric applications are treated. Only the final section leads over the concept of slope and surface calculations to the first beginnings of differential and integral calculus. The usual loose style and the very broad, sometimes already tiring elaboration are also found here again. The prevailing goal remains to learn solution procedures and application relationships, not to understand mathematical backgrounds.

Planspiele : 10 Game Templates for Social, Political, and Methodological Learning in Groups ¤ Planspiele are role-playing and decision-making games, communication and interaction games. They promote independent and creative work, enable social learning, and show how open, action-oriented teaching can be organized. The effective Planspiele by Heinz Klippert are now revised and updated. -- In this book, ten complete Planspiele with all related materials are documented. They have proven themselves in class 8 and are also used in adult education, including teacher training. -- Topics are municipal, ecological, economic, and development policy problems that are investigated in complex working processes to find possible solutions. -- 'The Planspiele can be used in the most diverse subjects: in German class just as in Social Studies, Ethics, Religion, and to some extent in Geography and Biology. And of course, they can also be implemented perfectly in interdisciplinary teaching or in the context of project days, project weeks, or boarding school stays.'

The Origins of Human Communication ¤ Supported by rich empirical material from primate and infant research and the most influential theories of language philosophy, as well as a variety of striking examples from human everyday communication, he presents a sophisticated multi-stage model of language development in both individual and species-historical perspectives. Central hinge in this model are gestures - showing and pantomiming - that have evolved in the course of the development of social cooperation among primates. In these gestures, Tomasello recognizes the proto-forms of human language. In order to move from these gestural precursors to a complex linguistic communication that can then be culturally encoded, transmitted, and refined, there is, however, still a further biologically rooted but exclusively human prerequisite: a 'psychological infrastructure of shared intentionality'. This ensures that humans can adjust their perceptions and intentions to each other and make them the point of reference for their common actions. Man speaks, so to say, because he is a genuinely social being.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077740-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031883-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071050-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140571-7>

Open Access : Development and Perspectives ¤ Both on an international level and in Germany, Open Access - the free availability of scientific results on the internet - is currently being discussed by science, politics, and associations. The background is the strongly increased prices for scientific journals since the mid-1990s in conjunction with product bundling. In Germany, the German research organizations have already expressed themselves in 2003 in the framework of the so-called Berlin Declaration in favor of "promoting the dissemination of knowledge over the internet in accordance with the principles of open access". In principle, there are two strategies for making research results freely available on the internet - the Golden and the Green Way. While the Golden Way involves the first publication of scientific contributions in an Open Access journal, the Green Way involves the provision of scientific contributions, in particular preprints and postprints, in freely accessible repositories. The four major German research organizations (Fraunhofer Society, Helmholtz Association, Leibniz Association, and Max Planck Society) are taking various measures to promote Open Access. These measures affect both the Golden and the Green Way.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7525775-0>

In the morning, twenty-year-old Nelia Fehn says goodbye to her deceased grandfather, and in the evening, she sits as the youngest author at the German Book Prize award ceremony. In Frankfurt, she meets her biological father for the first time. At the book fair, she is asked why she has written a novel now. "She had only not been able to say what she had done. Or why. She had simply written and now it was a novel, and life went on. She didn't even know if she wanted to write again. Further writing."

Pruning Atlas for Roses ¤ After the optimal cut based on the different growth forms, the most important rose varieties of each class are portrayed with a photo of the bloom. Tips on fertilization, soil care, plant protection, and winter protection measures round off the guide. Review: The small guide from the Pocket Atlas series introduces the hobby gardener to the proper pruning of roses. The author explains the basics of rose pruning based on the different growth forms, pruning types (plant, maintenance, and rejuvenation pruning) and pruning tools. In the main part, spring, summer, and possibly winter pruning are described according to rose classes (hybrid roses, climbing roses, shrub roses, climbing roses, dwarf roses, wild roses, and standard roses). The most important rose varieties of each class are presented in short portraits with a photo of the bloom. In the final chapter on rose cultivation, additional and useful information on fertilization and soil care, plant protection, and winter protection measures is given (2009). The book has been updated at the short portraits and the overview of the current ADR roses; some varieties have been replaced here. An exchange of the old edition is not necessarily required.

Company Valuation ¤ The textbook provides an in-depth introduction to all relevant approaches to company valuation, which are discussed in theory and valuation practice. Starting from the various legally or economically motivated reasons for company valuation, as well as the presentation of the dogmatic-historical development in Germany, company valuation is founded investment-theoretically. The prognosis problem and the capitalization problem are considered separately. In the framework of the presentation of cash flow forecasts, various methods are presented to arrive at a consistent and plausible prognosis. In the framework of the presentation of the capitalization problem, the classical income capitalization method and above all the modern variants of the DCF procedures are presented under various tax regimes and the relevant valuation formulas are developed. An evaluation of special valuation procedures (option price procedures, multiplier procedures) rounds off the text. TOC: The market for company valuations.- Dogmatic history of company valuation: teaching, practice, legislation, jurisprudence.- Company values as capital values: principles of capital value calculation.- Estimation of the numerator size of company valuation: future surpluses.- Estimation of the denominator size of company valuation I: individual capitalization rate in the framework of the income capitalization method.- Estimation of the denominator size of company valuation II: fictitious capital market valuation in the framework of the discounted cash flow procedures.- Other procedures for company valuation.- Application of option pricing theory in company valuation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078594-4>

Pill ¤ Joshua used to be called 'Pill' due to his excessive drug consumption, which caused a drug-induced neurosis in him. After a three-quarter year detox in the clinic, he comes back home. At this point, the story of the book begins, as various people (parents, friends, acquaintances) report on Joshua and his further development: He has to catch up on school material and find an apprenticeship. He is quite overwhelmed with this, as he is an artistic aesthete. He increasingly alienates himself from his friends and ultimately commits suicide. The gripping story illustrates to the reader how hard it is for ex-addicts to get back on their feet. As a reader, one cheers on and hopes for a good ending until the end. The narrative style is unusual, but varied and interesting. The drug problem is depicted very realistically, which is why the book can be recommended widely. - from 12. . - Joshua comes back home after a long drug detox from the clinic.

Statistics for Economists : [Extras in the Web] ¤ The feared danger that statistics will only be insufficiently represented in the curricula of economics and social sciences for bachelor's degree programs is countered by this text as suitable reading material or for self-study. After a general introduction, selected procedures are treated in equal scope from descriptive and inductive statistics. Although the application to problems mainly from economics is the actual goal, examples always explain the general and each section ends with a compilation of formulas for direct use, the authors also place a certain value on understanding the basics, without, however, pursuing mathematical backgrounds deeper. Recommended for students of corresponding direction as reading material for the basic study. (3)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056995-0>
German Language History: Basics and Methods ¤ There is no lack of introductions to German language history, but when dealing with Stefan Hartmann's "German Language History", one quickly notices the difference from other textbooks. While this one also has a relatively conservative content structure for historical linguistic themes, his concern to present methodological pluralism in historical linguistics is often neglected in other textbooks. He wants to encourage students to research, think further, and ask more questions. To this end, he provides concrete assistance in conducting experiments, practical tips for planning questionnaire studies, or presents software for corpus linguistic studies. With many graphical representations, references to digital accompanying material, a comprehensive bibliography, and an appendix "How to write a historical linguistic (seminar) paper", the textbook is a helpful tool for beginners and tutors.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0>
The Golden Age of Aviation ¤ The airplane has become a mass transportation means today. With low-cost airlines, it is possible to reach distant destinations for little money. However, from the late 1940s to the 1970s, flying was an exclusive pleasure for wealthy people, who were also offered a perfect service, good food, comfortable seats, and in first class even a bar. Journalist Borgmann draws a comprehensive picture of this - also due to the good profits of the companies - "golden" era. He describes the transition from propeller planes to jets, legendary constructions such as the "Comet" or the "Caravelle", the development of Lufthansa and other companies, and much more. The very informative text is illustrated with excellent selected images of airplanes and airports, aircraft production, passengers and flight personnel, historical advertising, and more. Smoking was allowed! A remarkable aviation history that can be recommended even to small collections. Comprehensive, for example, R. Niccoli: "Aviation" (ID-B 4/14). Querformat.

Forest Condition Report for Saxony-Anhalt: Results of the Second Soil Condition Survey in the Forest (BZE II) ¤ The soil condition survey in the forest (BZE) provides a comprehensive picture of the current state of forest soils and their changes over time. The BZE in Saxony-Anhalt is based on a grid network with a total of 76 sampling points. BZE I (1992-1994) showed clearly critical conditions of forest soils, especially due to atmospheric inputs. The repeated inventory (BZE II, 2006-2008) now provides insight into changes in forest soils against the background of decreasing acid and fly ash inputs and continued increased nitrogen inputs. In addition to the detailed analysis of chemical properties of various forest soils – from unleached sands in the lowland, loess soils in the hilly country and bedrock in the Harz – the focus is on carbon and nitrogen storage, as well as results on tree nutrition, forest vegetation and intensive monitoring. The forest soil condition report for Saxony-Anhalt provides important decision-making bases for science, practice and politics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132325-7>

This anthology, based on more than 150 poets' names, provides a cross-sectional overview of this genre from the Middle Ages to the present. (Manfred Bosch) In addition to many monographs on individual authors, the diligent Germanist (deceased 2013) has anthologically revised and opened up German love poetry since the early 1980s, most recently in "German Love Poetry" (2005, not discussed here). This edition is based on this edition, which has been expanded by 65 pages, presenting the most important theme of the poetry genre from the Middle Ages to the present in chronological order based on over 150 poets' names. Although one or the other weighting does not seem to make sense and the selection appears to be a collection of literary historical evidence in some places, it still offers a rich fund that includes discoveries and surprises and can be matched with "German Love Poetry from Eight Centuries" (ID-A 29/96). A roughly 80-page appendix provides brief author information, literature lists, and a postscript that summarizes the genre from a literary historical perspective. The beautiful edition will already complement one or the other of the numerous existing poetry anthologies in medium-sized holdings.

Applied Statistics : Collection of Methods with R ¤ The freely usable program R is a learnable and flexible tool for data analysis. In the book, the application is illustrated by means of simple, but also more complex examples. Statistical procedures are explained and necessary details for data acquisition, analysis, and interpretation are conveyed. New in the 14th edition are, among other things, sections on Bayesian estimation and the evaluation of repeated measurements, further recommendations for planning and evaluating scientific studies and a more comprehensive index.

C# 3.0 - Steep Course : [Learn C# programming in 12 challenging lessons] ¤ C# 3.0 is the current 2008 released version of a widely used object-oriented programming language for the .NET Framework by Microsoft. The predecessor was described by O. Lüder (BA 1/07 - should expire). The book is based on a programming course in the computer magazine c't (based on C# 2.0 and .NET 2.0). This programming course was revised and significantly expanded, as Microsoft changed the language standard with C# 3.0 and .NET 3.5 and also introduced a modified programming model for designing Windows applications. The present book, a steep course, is only partially suitable for beginners without comprehensive knowledge in object-oriented programming and requires hard work. The author presents basic language elements and concepts. Emphasis is placed on Windows Forms-, WPF-, and control programming. However, concepts of generic programming and the integrated development environment Visual Studio 2008 are also well considered. Many examples and tasks.

The Beginner's Seminar Adobe GoLive 9 ¤ Although Macromedia's Dreamweaver has replaced Adobe's web editor GoLive in the new Creative Suite from Adobe, the predecessor GoLive CS2 has been further developed and is now available in version 9. The numerous users of the software will be pleased. The present title is primarily aimed at new users. In the usual, row-standard layout, the author duo introduces the basic functions of GoLive. In this way, those interested learn step by step the most important functions until the completion of their own site. Now, the innovations of the current version are indeed limited, and the need to adapt the text of the previous edition (BA 9/04; not available for direct comparison) is hardly necessary, as confirmed by a glance at the table of contents. The chosen images account for the modernized interface, reminiscent of InDesign. The practice example in the application part remained unchanged. Suitable for updating and initial acquisition, as no alternative titles are available. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7625355-7>
Grounded theory : towards a socio-theoretical and epistemological foundation of a pragmatic research style ¤ Little has been written so far about the epistemological foundation of Grounded Theory in pragmatic social philosophy and the resulting consequences for the understanding of the methodological conception as well as the practical procedures. The book closes this gap by presenting the model of knowledge, based on the work of C.S. Peirce, J. Dewey, G.H. Mead and W. James, and tracing the traces left by this model as a justification of validity in the methodology of Grounded Theory. The text also deals with the significant methodological differences between the variant of Grounded Theory shaped by Anselm L. Strauss and the one represented by Barney G. Glaser, and deals with essential developments of a pragmatic Grounded Theory in the context of postmodern thinking.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4395694-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014606-6>
Mathematical Foundations of Natural Sciences ¤ The work conveys to students of natural sciences and technical subjects the simple mathematical foundations from analysis and linear algebra that they need. Review (ex): Mathematics provides engineers and natural sciences with very effective tools, which are needed to describe and understand processes and events in nature and technology. The present work now wants to convey to students of natural sciences and technical subjects relevant mathematical foundations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037944-9>
Microsoft Office Word 2003 ¤ Word 2003 is the current version of the market-leading word processing and part of Microsoft Office 2003. The experienced author duo (lastly BA 1/03 for Word 2002) offers here a comprehensive introduction for beginners and advanced users. 5 thematic blocks cover: Introduction to the main methods of text input, saving, printing / possibilities for text and document design / techniques for creating large documents / use of Word in everyday office life, e.g. with series letters and e-mail / integration of graphic elements and design of web documents. Clearly designed with margin symbols, markings, readable screen images and clearly written, sometimes with smaller projects in step-by-step instructions, e.g. designing own business cards. Useful appendix, e.g. with keyboard shortcuts and glossary. On the CD-ROM are example and exercise files, helpful tools, graphics for web design. The majority of the content applies downwards to Word 2000. W. Giesecke (BA 2/04) is more comprehensive, also covers macros and team functions. (2) (Elke Nibbrig)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4755000-4>
macOS : the comprehensive handbook for power users ¤ This handbook is aimed at Apple users who want to use the macOS operating system more professionally and with more insider knowledge. It is an updated and lightly revised version of the predecessor and now takes into account the innovations of the "High Sierra" version. In fact, most of the content remains unchanged. The work, still divided into 8 parts, takes into account, in addition to a series of minor changes (e.g. the "content caching" function), additional information and hints for the new APFS file system. The author has waived a slim chapter on iCloud Drive usage. Due to the marginal differences between the two editions, an exchange is not necessary. However, a first-time purchase is sensible. Ambitious users will receive good background knowledge and find topics that are not addressed in the standard works of A. Ochsenkühn and J. Wolf (e.g. on Virtual Appliances or automation). Some black-and-white illustrations have been added.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1149758007>
The Swiss Reformation: A Handbook ¤ The Reformation is one of the great events in Swiss history. The new religious conceptions trigger intense social conflicts, which shake the trust base between Catholic and Protestant locations and put the cohesion of the Confederation into question. The strong influence of Humanism, the balanced power relations in the cities, and the religious autonomy of many rural communities all together give the Reformation in Switzerland a unique profile. The handbook meticulously depicts the spread of the reformist movement in the cities of Zurich, Bern, Basel, St. Gallen, Schaffhausen, and in the rural areas like Graubünden, Appenzell, and the French-speaking Switzerland, but also the failed reformations or the Anabaptist movement. It shows how, in the course of the 16th century, a diffuse movement developed into a disciplined group of churches with defined dogmatic principles and an independent culture, and explores the long-term consequences of the Reformation on Swiss society, on religious culture like everyday culture, on education, community, and politics. With contributions by Irena Backus, Jan-Andrea Bernhard, Erich Bryner, Amy Nelson Burnett, Emidio Campi, Bruce Gordon, Kaspar von Greyerz, Sundar Henny, Karin Maag, Thomas Maissen, Martin Sallmann, Regula Schmid, and Andrea Strübind.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048946-2>

Are substances more persistent than the test systems believe? : Evaluation of test systems for persistence assessment by the example of hydrolysis ¤ Hydrolysis is an abiotic process that is crucial for the fate of many water-soluble substances in an aquatic environment. The ability of chemicals to undergo hydrolysis is currently tested in purified lab water in accordance with OECD guideline 111. It has been suggested that the addition of particles such as sediment or microplastic fibers may result in a change in the rate of hydrolysis or in the formation of different transformation products. This study therefore tested the hydrolysis of three environmen-tally relevant compounds with and without addition of microplastic, sediment, or humic acids.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160918-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173007-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136095-3>

Profession: Musician : despised - deified - marketed ; a social history in images ¤ Music history is often pursued much too one-dimensionally as a history of form and style. The fact that it is unthinkable and dependent on the social conditions to which musicians are subject without active persons, without sound finders and musically performing individuals, is often overlooked in this process. Salmen shares his richly illustrated social history of the professional musician in a historical passage and a systematic part of enlightening image comments. From the shaman to the minstrel, to the court trumpeter, field piper, dance master, castrati, klezmer musicians, orchestra musicians, and star conductors, the quickly written review of the musical pleasure bringers, propagandists, and mood makers ranges.

The Most Beautiful Gravel Gardens: Luxurious Gardens with Little Effort ¤ An optically appealing picture book with concrete instructions for the creation of a gravel garden. With many examples of extraordinary plant combinations and with detailed plant plans. (Hans-Ulrich Struck) British gardening expert Beth Chatto experimented with plants on drought-prone sites in the 1990s and presented the results in her fundamental picture book "The Gravel Garden" (BA 10/01). Since then, gravel gardens have also gained many followers here. The advantages are obvious: With the right selection of perennials and grasses, one can create attractive plant combinations and beds throughout the year and do so with minimal maintenance effort. The authors (gardening journalist and perennial expert) have made a luxurious selection of such plant arrangements for this book. In addition, they provide information on the optimal selection of plants and their care. Well-known gardening experts present gardens created by them and explain them using detailed plant plans. An optically appealing picture book with concrete instructions for imitation. (2) (Hans-Ulrich Struck)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7716386-2>

Online-Marketing and Law ¤ Operators of websites and online shops, as well as internet traders, but also web designers and system administrators can significantly minimize legal risks with this comprehensive, well-founded, and up-to-date specialist book. (Roland Roth-Steiner) "Before the court and at sea, we are all in God's hand" ... Well, this title is not suitable for sailors, but operators of websites and online shops, as well as internet traders, can significantly minimize their legal risks with it. Starting from an introductory, systematic overview of the most frequently observed errors, the author (IT lawyer) guides the reader through the pitfalls of domain law, online contracts, internet advertising, data protection, general terms and conditions, copyright and other protection rights, etc. For all understandable, but yet with enough legal depth. Web designers and system administrators of web servers also benefit, for example, in questions of imprint obligations or provisions on access protocols. It is pleasant that the author forgets the main purpose of the activity in all paragraphs: to conduct business and transactions. It is definitely worth recommending from medium-sized libraries. For self-employed individuals, it is also suitable for dealing with the tax office, if possible, alongside J. Wilde: "Quick Course on Internet Entrepreneurship" (in this issue).

Space-Oriented Risk Management in Technology and Environment: Catastrophe Prevention through Spatial Planning ¤ The volume contains the results of the working group "Space-Oriented Risk Management in Technology and Environment". With this, it has been possible for the first time to present the overlapping areas of catastrophe prevention and spatially oriented planning in important outlines. Because the spatial sciences have hardly paid attention to the large, catastrophe-prone risks in the environment and technology in the past. At the same time, the spatial dimension has often been neglected in the various scientific approaches to this topic. With a view to the state of scientific research, the regional or spatial implications of large risks in the environment and technology are therefore systematically brought to the forefront here. The effects on the human capital of a society are considered just as much as those on natural, real, and social capital. Often, it is an unadapted use of locations and institutional deficits in social systems that are responsible for outstanding risks. The working group has assumed that from the integrative perspective of spatial planning, the anthropogenic dimension of large environmental and technology risks is at the center of interest. Space-oriented prevention against environmental and technology risks a) Spatial risks and risk prevention b) Risk-oriented spatial planning policy: approaches and foreign experiences Case studies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4447164-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121555-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121590-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029932-6>
Protected Areas in Germany in the Context of Climate Change - Risks and Options for Action : Results of a Research and Development Project (FKZ 806 82 270) ¤ The mutually reinforcing problems of biodiversity loss and rapid climate change are now widely known and recognized. It must be assumed that climate change will have a negative impact on many species and ecosystems. On the other hand, the protection of ecosystems can contribute to the mitigation of climate change and its consequences, for example, through the function of natural peatlands and forests as carbon sinks or the water retention in the landscape through wetlands. Protected areas can therefore take on an important function in climate protection in addition to their central importance for the conservation of biodiversity. Within the European Union, the common network of protected areas Natura 2000 has been established with the aim of ensuring the continued existence or, if necessary, the restoration of a favorable conservation status of certain habitat types and species.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041414-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4601495-0>
Biogas-Messprogramm II : 61 Biogas Plants in Comparison ; this work was prepared within the framework of the project "Federal Programme for the Evaluation of New Biomass-Biogas Plants" (Funding Code: 22003405) ; the project was financed by the Agency for Renewable Resources (FNR) with funds from the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMELV) ¤ In total, the results show that there are large differences between the plants in terms of function, performance, and operational safety as well as in terms of economic efficiency. It is clear that the remuneration through the EEG is not a guarantee for the profitability of the plant operation. The correct dimensioning of the plant in combination with an optimal selection of the fermentation substrates is together with a high load of the BHKW at the same time using the available heat the key to the economic success of biogas production. Not least, the qualification of the operator plays an important role (Source: Author).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006340-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066424-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006798-1>

Bitcoins and other decentralized transaction systems: Blockchains as the basis of a crypto economy ¤ This book describes for the first time in the German language comprehensively the various digital currencies, the fascinating potential of electronic money as well as a possible new economic order: money in the Bitcoin system is a programmable value, protected by cryptographic technologies. Experts from the financial industry are working today together with lawyers, economists and software developers intensively on new cryptographic financial products. The expectations are high: it's about the hope for significant efficiency gains and application scenarios on macroeconomic and microeconomic level. With the new financial products and services, individuals, organizations, and even machines are to perform transactions more flexibly, efficiently, and productively. The author gives the reader a comprehensive guide to the complex present and possible future of cyber money with its advantages and disadvantages, information about the practical use possibilities, legal implications, and protection against its dangers.(Publisher's text)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1081489480> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1041888279> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014359-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1124028595> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1099507774>

Algebra II for Dummies : [end the first algebraic uncertainty] ¤ Comprehensive textbook on the basics of algebra, solving equations, and handling algebraic functions. (Martin A. Lobeck) Review: The American author (Book 1: ID 19/06) explains the basics of algebra and solving equations and inequalities in detail. Factoring expressions is also presented with many examples. The graphical representation of functions is also a focus, where the learner can already form an idea of the appearance of the graphs of a parabola by looking at the standard form of a function. Many hints for solving practical problems are also given for polynomials, exponential functions, and the equations of conic sections. Shorter chapters on complex numbers, matrices, and set algebra are also found. The Top-Ten-Lists at the end of the book are probably due to the structure of the "Dummies" series, but are not particularly important. - If you do not want to use interactive CD-ROMs on this topic, you will find a engaging reading for learners who can well follow the many examples with detailed step-by-step instructions.

Statistics and Intuition : Everyday Examples Critically Examined ¤ Verl.Beschr.: This non-fiction book shows how statistical thinking can be successful and lead to greater competence in dealing with uncertainty. Deeply ingrained thought habits make us intuitively search for truths and patterns in everyday life, not for probabilities, as statistics provides. The book clarifies how the thought patterns of statisticians and non-statisticians differ, what misunderstandings arise from this, and what statistics has to do with truth. It thus promotes active and responsible handling of statistics through practical examples from everyday life and shows how to correctly interpret and communicate statistical statements. A current focus lies on Big Data and the associated data journalism	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126901-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001307-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4802620-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056995-0>

Screening and Selection of Amaranth Varieties and Lines as Trace Element-Rich Biogas Substrate ¤ The project aimed to evaluate various Amaranth varieties and lines in terms of their suitability for biogas use. The focus of the one-year field experiment was therefore the analysis of the yield potential of the varieties as well as the investigation of their ripening behavior as a basis for loss-free silage and the substrate quality decisive for the methane yield. With promising results, a detailed processing of selected accessions should take place within the framework of a follow-up project. Ultimately, the results should lead to practical recommendations for agriculture, promoting the cultivation of the crop and contributing to the improvement of biodiversity through the expanded species diversity of biogas crop rotations (Source: Publisher).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4473009-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4342663-3>

The World Upside Down : A History of the Little Ice Age from 1570 to 1700 and the Emergence of the Modern World, Connected with Some Considerations on the Climate of the Present ¤ Long cold winters and short cool summers: In the 17th century, the climate in Europe changed dramatically. Grain became scarce, the economy and society stumbled into a deep crisis. The Little Ice Age gives us an idea of the severe upheavals that a climate change can trigger. People tried to free themselves from their dependence on nature with the help of Enlightenment, science, and technology. But today, this modern world is hitting its limits, because it is summoning another climate catastrophe. Philipp Blom unfolds a great historical panorama in which we can recognize the challenges of the present. „Most convincingly, Blom can prove his thesis where he describes the climate-dependent revolution of European agriculture. In times of poorer harvests, the feudal subsistence agriculture had served its purpose. To secure nutrition, massive grain imports were now needed... Blom has written a instructive history of the early modern period, which certainly also provides an occasion to think about connections between climate and innovation. The thesis of the birth of modernity from a cold shock deserves a question mark“ (deutschlandfunk.de)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4743707-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114570-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136817-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077587-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131628-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020588-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112646-4>
Außenwirtschaft : Theory, Empirics, and Policy of the Interdependent World Economy ¤ In the theory of international economics, countries are chosen as a basis for distinguishing between domestic and international economies, and the conditions, causes, and effects of their exchange relationships in the real and monetary sectors are investigated. The methodological framework is formed by traditional micro- and macroeconomics. Space, time, and heterogeneous actors are largely excluded. Empirical tests based on country data are often contradictory. In the present book, the external and internal economies are considered as economic regions, structured into the levels of resource endowment, culture/society, technology, territory/state/politics, and companies. It is asked to what extent the respective level influences the type, scope, and effects of exchange relationships. In order to make this extension of the perspective possible, a closed theoretical framework is deliberately waived.

Nobody is a Gypsy: Condemning a European Prejudice ¤ Review: The author (last ID-A 46/14) sees anti-Gypsyism as a pan-European prejudice. He describes the historical course that led to its emergence and spread, and the religious, social, racial, and romanticizing elements it contains. He answers the disputed question among historians of 'genocide' and the associated European collaboration with 'yes'. The author praises German Roma policy despite its weaknesses compared to other Western European states. For the period after 1990, he notes a deterioration in integration opportunities, especially in Eastern Europe, where official policy should also be classified as anti-Gypsy. A special chapter deals with the history and present of the often disreputable 'Gypsy research'. The book offers a readable overview of the history and current situation of the Sinti and Roma and the state of research, equipped with examples, glossary, and additional literature references. - Along with R.

The Service Sector in Northeast Germany - Development Problem or Future Opportunity? ¤ The tertiary sector is often seen today as an economic policy approach to solving all structural problems of Germany. This also applies and especially to Northeast Germany. However, special development problems accumulate here, which further exacerbate the long-term structural change and its associated adaptation problems. With this volume, further results of a working group of the Landesarbeitsgemeinschaft Berlin/Brandenburg/Mecklenburg-Vorpommern on the tertiarization process in Northeast Germany are presented: Initially, the existing theoretical argumentation lines on the general process of tertiarization and its spatial structural consequences for the regions of Northeast Germany are presented. This is followed by empirically founded descriptions of important framework conditions and trends in population and economic development in the countries and regions of Northeast Germany. The subsequent examples of sectoral and regional-specific analyses deepen individual aspects in view of the potentials and development obstacles that are significant for a service-oriented development policy. Finally, experiences of the previous spatially related control of the tertiarization process and proposals for a new conception of regional development in Northeast Germany are presented.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012183-5>
The Global Surveillance : The Snowden Case, the American Intelligence Agencies and the Consequences ¤ In June 2013, Glenn Greenwald published the first NSA documents from the archive of whistleblower Edward Snowden. Since then, increasingly alarming details of the global surveillance system of the American intelligence agencies have been uncovered. Now, Greenwald presents the full extent of mass surveillance in light of a wealth of exclusive, never-before-published secret documents. Everything and everyone is being spied on, the population is under collective suspicion. Freedom of opinion is suppressed in the name of security, and there is no longer any privacy - anywhere. In May 2013, Edward Snowden met in Hong Kong with documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras and lawyer and journalist Glenn Greenwald, thus setting the NSA affair in motion. Glenn Greenwald has now written a book about the 'Snowden case', in which he reports extensively on the background. Chronologically, from Snowden's first, covert contact attempts, which almost failed due to Greenwald's lack of interest, to Snowden's flight to Moscow, he recounts the events once again and illustrates the enormous dimension that the surveillance drive and the collecting frenzy of the American security agency NSA have taken on. Based on the documents obtained by Snowden, Greenwald analyzes the NSA's actions and warns impressively of the possible consequences for society.

Poetry Slam in Germany : Theory and Practice of a Multimedial Art Form ¤ Interviews with slam poets and event organizers, extensive background research, and the author's own long-term observations of the German slam scene provide a detailed insight into the modern poetry slam competition and the associated subculture. In addition to the early, often improvised beginnings of spoken word poetry and the influences of rap and hip-hop, Stefanie Westermayr also illuminates the course of a slam itself and the factors that influence its success. This pioneering work of literary science explains the many different slams in a competent theme and language analysis and shows the development of poetry slams in new media. verlagsinfo	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4271372-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4709615-9>
Competition for Resources : Conflicts over Climate, Water, and Land ¤ Climate, water, and land are equally indispensable and endangered resources of humanity. What happens when a competition for their use breaks out? What conflicts can arise from this? Internationally renowned experts address the question of how resource conflicts and resource scarcity affect both domestic and global levels, and examine exemplary forms of cooperation and conflict resolution. Their contributions reflect the findings and perspectives of different disciplines: The book covers political science, economics, economic and social geography, international law, regional science, as well as theological-normative aspects - and thus opens up a highly topical field of research in peace and conflict studies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020830-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177874-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075236-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164266-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4007394-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055747-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115589-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064811-4>
The Time of the Forest : A Photographic Journey Through History and Future of Our Forests ¤ At first glance, a lavishly designed photo book on the history of forestry. Upon closer inspection, the effects of climate change, acid rain, and interventions by hunting and forestry on the forest ecosystem become apparent. G. Meister, a forestry graduate and author, has taken photo series from exactly the same location and with exactly the same image cut at intervals of days, months, years, or even decades. In a time-lapse, the development dynamics of the forest become visible, hidden ecological relationships become apparent. It is astonishing what effects small interventions have decades later, just as astonishing is the regenerative ability of the forest ecosystem when left to itself. The "time-spring images" are explained by expert commentaries, formulated by the co-author in a generally understandable way. An environmental book that unfolds special persuasive power through excellent visuality. For possibly many libraries At first glance, a lavishly designed photo book on the history of forestry.

I Pluck an Eyelash and Stab You with It ¤ Reisen, um heimatlos zu werden. Henri Michaux writes: "Reisen, um heimatlos zu werden". The Austrian Josef Winkler has repeatedly traveled to Italy during the writing of his novels about his homeland, Carinthia, later to India and then to Mexico, carrying with him the stories of other authors, from which he uses short quotes as inlays in his poetological reportages: from journeys that bring him back to his own surprise with variations of a picture from childhood - a child lying by the roadside, already wrapped in packing paper, run over. Last in Klagenfurt, where during roadworks in preparation for the 2008 European Football Championship a child is run over and dies. Story by story, death by death, Winkler draws closer to his state of being homeless. Erzählung für Erzählung, Todesfall für Todesfall rückt Winkler seiner Heimatlosigkeit näher.

Landscape Culture : Between Preservation and Development ¤ How we deal with our landscape, shape and change it, is all part of landscape culture. Man has been shaping the landscape for thousands of years through use. Our cultural landscape has thus come into being and has been in continuous change ever since. However, the speed of change is increasing. The proportion of settlement and traffic areas is rising rapidly, that of fields and meadows is falling. The familiar landscape image is changing. Since landscape is able to instill identity in a very special way, dealing with it is a matter of general societal concern. - - The DGGL-Themes Book Landscape Culture spans the arc from the preservation of the cultural landscape to its active development	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4259046-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033573-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034354-6>

What does Parallel Society mean? : on dealing with differences ¤ We are already living in a society shaped by mobility, diversity, and global networking. There are currently multiple opportunities for individuals to arrange themselves. In the face of this diversity, some are tempted to invoke outdated classifications and dissolve experienced mobility, practiced diversity, and everyday networking. Although these 'cleanup attempts' are futile, they cause a lot of damage. A tangible example of this is the talk of a 'parallel society': it divides what has long been mixed and appeals to a fictional clarity. It is time to make the discussion more objective.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033542-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4214151-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195641-2>

PHP 5 & MySQL 4.1 ¤ PHP and MySQL is still the most popular combination when it comes to web programming with database connection. Accordingly, the number of developers, online resources, and literature is also large. In addition to much inferior, quality is also found again and again. The present title is an example of this: Christine Peyton, who has already presented several books on PHP, writes in a very appealing and informal, didactically but stringent style. The structure is logical, especially in terms of the introduction to object-oriented programming. MySQL is treated - in contrast to other titles - in an appropriate length and well integrated into the PHP context. Shorter listings and longer projects illustrate the theoretical introductions sensibly, screenshots of the listings have a real added value here, because PHP code, HTML code, and the result are presented together. Overall, a very good price-performance ratio. No CD-ROM, listings can be loaded from the website to the book. (1)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4763174-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4786129-0>

Strategic Talent Management : Finding, Developing, and Retaining the Best Employees ¤ Successful companies need talents - talents make companies successful. But how do they find the employees they need? How do they succeed in filling key positions? This book provides the answer: In seven steps, it presents a practical concept for talent management and shows how implementation works using two companies. The benefit: CEOs, managers, and personnel managers can recruit, develop, and plan efficient succession of their talents within a short time from their own ranks. The authors show, using a case study, how a single business unit can find and develop the required talents for a new strategy. They describe not only success stories, but also how and why talent management processes occasionally lead to a dead end.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1157518206> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121465-1>

The book has special topicality with regard to - the discussions on the intergovernmental fiscal balance (which must be newly regulated by 2019), - the recent changes to the Basic Law on research promotion (Article 91b GG as of 23.12.2014) and - the upcoming decision of the ECJ on euro rescue (C-62/14, Advocate General's conclusions of 14.1.2015). The systematic treatment of the individual subject areas is rounded off by numerous case examples and diagrams. In this respect, the textbook is aimed less at practitioners than at students of relevant legal focus areas and students of economics who deal with financial science and want to learn the current applicable law.

Atatürk's Angry Grandchildren : Turkey Between Democracy and Demagoguery ¤ Where is the 'Land of Unlimited Contradictions' heading? The renowned Turkey expert and former editor-in-chief at Deutsche Welle, Baha Güngör, is a sharp advocate for press and freedom of opinion. He analyzes the current situation in Turkey, researches its causes, and explains possible future developments. The end of freedom of opinion, re-Islamization, constitutional reform, dependent justice, and internal purges - are they leading Turkey away from Europe, NATO, and democracy? How can the broad support for President Erdogan be explained? What historical causes lie behind the current situation? And what share of responsibility does the West bear for the state of Turkish democracy? For Güngör, it is too easy to simply condemn Erdogan - he wants to achieve a better understanding of this great land on the Bosphorus, its contradictions, traditions, and historical upheavals in Germany.

Linguistic Appropriation of Reality : Studies on the History of Modern German ¤ Language change is always also cultural change. Under this motto, Dieter Cherubim has been researching the history of the German language for more than thirty years. He ties in with de Saussure's axiom of the solidary connection between synchrony and diachrony in language. In this volume, he presents bundled analyses of the linguistic appropriation of reality in the most recent phase of German language history - the 19th and 20th centuries. Specifically, it is about studies on the development of the German language in the 19th century, on the historical stratification of the German language, on multilingualism and language variation in historical texts, as well as on the overarching theme of the relationship between language change and cultural change.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020517-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077741-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056508-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074250-7>
Stairs, Staircases ¤ The accessibility of buildings represents a crucial aspect in the design and detailed planning. In addition to constructive aspects and building physical requirements, the formal, safety-related boundary conditions are to be noted in particular.

On the Aesthetic Education of Man ¤ Friedrich Schiller's Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man belong to the most profound and educationally most substantial works of pedagogical anthropology. Although the text has been occasionally interpreted by educators, a comprehensive educational theoretical analysis of this writing has not yet existed. Therefore, an attempt is made here to make Schiller's draft accessible to contemporary readers and to explore its pedagogical implications for the educational tasks of the present. The letters are illustrated by numerous everyday examples, placed in their historical context, and explained in view of their language and terminology, which are not always easy to understand. One of the features of this commentary is an illustrative discussion of the concept of play used by Schiller and the fundamental aesthetics of Immanuel Kant, which underlies the letters.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044308-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000628-1>
Bionics : Current Research Results in Natural Sciences, Engineering, and Humanities ¤ In many scientific and technological fields, the practical benefit of bionics is recognized. The solution of technical problems with the help of biologically motivated principles is successfully practiced. However, the understanding between the involved scientific disciplines has been left out so far. This book provides an up-to-date overview of the different research fields, starting from optimization strategies in robotics to adaptive leg prostheses, information processing in natural and artificial systems, optimization strategies in industry up to philosophical aspects of bionics. Thus, it supports a discourse between the disciplines for the first time and enables an exchange between researchers from different fields of expertise. The contributions are written in a generally understandable way and take a look into the future of exciting research tasks.

Final Report of the TaBuLa-LOG Project ¤ The TaBuLa-LOG project was based on the results of the previous project »Test center for automated buses in the district Duchy of Lauenburg« (TaBuLa) and added the component of goods transport to the functioning automated shuttle service. The further development of pure passenger transport towards a combination of passenger and goods mobility was tested in order to examine the previous, often singular concentration on separate systems against the background of resource bundling for automated means of transport. In more rural regions, the linking of passenger and goods mobility can make a contribution to sustainability of transport, where concentration on separate systems has so far not promised any success from an economic point of view.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7714938-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4304075-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1024622754> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022492-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164101-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043176-9>

Principles of Game Theory: A Textbook and Workbook for Self-Study ¤ Verl.Beschr.: Game theory is a theory of optimal decisions. It addresses the question of which decisions people should make if the result of their decisions depends on the decisions of other people, if there are decision interdependencies. Game theory is now able to provide useful solution proposals for an enormous variety of decision problems. In this case, game theory is not only helpful in analyzing complex economic phenomena, but it can also provide valuable services in everyday life. Many principles of game theory are therefore explained in this book in simple everyday problems. This book follows a few basic principles in content and structure that are intended to facilitate entry into game theory: immediate application is promoted by entering through examples, the use of technical terms is limited to a minimum, the necessary methodological knowledge is also conveyed through examples. The content of this book provides an easily accessible representation of the most important ideas of game theory. Sample tasks with solutions and extensive supporting materials support the entry additionally	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8>

Erfolgreich promovieren : a guide by PhD holders for PhD candidates ; with 33 tables ¤ The comprehensive PhD guide accompanies PhD candidates from all fields in all phases of the PhD process from the decision to pursue a PhD to framework conditions, planning, organization, and actual writing process up to the completion and publication of the dissertation - including possibly occurring crises. Those who have finally succeeded can devote themselves to the DIY guide for a doctoral hat in the appendix. The guide, which is also intended to be understood as a workbook, benefits from the participation of about 90 PhD holders and PhD candidates from the interdisciplinary PhD network Thesis, who pass on their personal experiences and advice. Comparable in scope and concerns with "GEW-Handbook PhD with Perspective" (BA 4/06). (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175921-7>
Inductive Statistics : An Introduction with SPSS for Windows ¤ Statistical procedures are used in all natural sciences, economics, technology, and even partially in the humanities. Despite this, statistics is considered difficult. To overcome this hurdle, the author provides an application-oriented introduction to the methods of inductive statistics and data analysis in the present book. He describes the ideas and methods of modern data management using practical examples. The reader can deepen his knowledge using the many exercise tasks, where the sample solutions show how an exercise can be solved. SPSS, the statistics software, is used in this book.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4247120-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4334316-8>
Why it doesn't matter how we write : Panel discussion with Burghart Klaußner, Ulrike Holzwarth-Raether and Peter Gallmann, moderated by Kathrin Kunkel-Razum : recorded on 30.10.2017 at the Duden reaction in Berlin ¤ We often hear complaints that students or students can no longer write (correctly). Positions cannot be filled because applicants fail the German test. Investigations show poor spelling performances. - Is that true? If so, what's wrong in our schools, in our society, when correct writing is no longer considered a key qualification? And how can we change that? The head of the Duden editorial department discusses with representatives from science, school, and media on the topic "Why it doesn't matter how we write".

Atemschaukel : Novel ¤ So truly happy with the virtuos glimmering texts of Herta Müller (so lastly BA 10/03; ID 44/05) could mostly only a very literarily skilled reader be. Now - how beautiful! - a larger readership will be able to get excited. After conversations with Romanian Germans (first of all poet O. Pastior, 1927-2006), who were deported to Soviet forced labor camps in 1945, the moving story about the 17-year-old Leo and a dozen villagers from Transylvania came into being - written not in the Solzhenitsyn style, but as a touching monologue full of surreal dream and poetic sequences with age-philosophical wisdom of one who had been released after years of imprisonment. He remains until old age marked by the terrible suffering in the Gulag - by hunger, hard labor, cold, violence, by diseases and death, mistrust and hate, by homesickness and opportunistic 'buckling'. And feels himself now among the 'homebodies' foreign and shunned, due to the traumatic memories and also his homosexuality. 'We were all different than we are.' A nearly unimaginably large novel.

MySQL 5 for Dummies : [relational databases with MySQL develop ; the database server MySQL - perfect data organization ; examples and installations for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X] ¤ The MySQL database system belongs to the community of open-source products and is therefore available for free. In the fall, the new version MySQL 5 was released and as a result, the author revised his work (BA 8/02) from the introduced Dummies series. The significant changes of the version change have only minor effects on this introductory work. The deviations are rather formal in nature. Clearly improved step-by-step instructions, e.g. when creating a table, in the chapter on ODBC and in web programming. Additional subheadings provide for greater clarity. Some chapters also provide additional information and in the installation section, only hints for Windows XP and Windows 2000 are now found. The software on the accompanying CD-ROM contains current versions of MySQL, Perl, and PHP as well as additional useful tools. For updating the inventory, in addition to Michael Kofler (BA 3/05) and Rolf Däßler (BA 11/05), it is again usable, but an exchange of the preface is not yet required.

Quality Management in Social Work: An Introduction ¤ In social work, certifications in the field of quality assurance are increasingly playing a central role in negotiations with cost bearers. Therefore, it is important to know the various approaches and standards in order to choose the right method and then implement it correctly in the organizational context in order to really ensure quality assurance and not just further bureaucratic requirements. Merchel provides a clearly structured overview for students as well as professionals and honorary officials in leading positions in social institutions. The book by U. Birner and H. Fexer ("Quality Management for Social Institutions", ID 12/00) has a more introductory character, considers the legal background in more detail and is therefore to be preferred over this overview work.

Poverty in Prosperous Societies ¤ In 11 scientific contributions on the latest state of the art, renowned experts (including Butterwegge, Hradil, Huster, Opielka) express themselves on the changed forms of relative poverty, public reaction, evaluation, and increasing social polarization. They make well-founded statements on child and old-age poverty, health, and irresponsible precarious classifications. Approaches to self-help in life management have also been identified. A contribution deals with European developments and threats. With some background knowledge, the individual contributions - also as a repetition - are well understandable, especially a comprehensive overview has emerged with everything that is relevant for social developments and problem situations. With literature lists and abstracts. (2) Poverty research has long been a field of research on marginalized groups, but poverty has long become a central theme of social structure and inequality research. It seems that poverty is becoming more entrenched in our society. At the same time, salaries and bonuses in executive boards are rising, and the extremely unequal distribution of wealth, real estate, and productive assets is increasing. In addition, the labor market is deeply divided. Not all employees benefit from economic prosperity, the low-wage sector is growing further, precarious employment relationships are increasing. Exactly this development makes the question of social justice louder and is discussed by the authors with different focus. A readable book that takes up the controversial positions of the poverty discourse.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066741-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002963-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128337-5>
Statistics for Dummies : [well advised with the data; at a glance: bias, samples and probability explained in a comprehensible way; calculate with median, arithmetic mean and correlation; learn about graphical representation possibilities; with exercise tasks and online solutions] ¤ Typically, the author introduces interested readers to the 'secrets' or the basics of statistics. Review (ex): Introduced series. The preface of the book was not available for direct comparison. However, the changes seem not to be of a deeper kind, so the preface can be discontinued. Nevertheless, exercises and their solutions are now available online. In earlier editions, there was a separate exercise book. The author, who has published further titles in the Dummies series, conveys general knowledge of statistics, especially descriptive statistics, in a comprehensible way and with the help of many everyday examples. She shows how statistics can be read and interpreted correctly. Without higher mathematics, she cannot get by. Anyone who wants to use the book meaningfully should already have solid mathematical knowledge, e.g. know summation formulas and also understand probability calculation. The title is conceivable as a 1st introduction like Günter Buttler's textbook in many libraries. The author has also written a sequel, 'Statistics II for Dummies' or 'Advanced Statistics for Dummies'. (2 S)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151278-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056995-0>
On the Reform of Social Self-Governance in Statutory Health Insurance: Kassel Concept ¤ Social self-governance has significantly contributed to the fact that German social insurance is more than just economically acting enterprises. Above all, self-governance has the function of involving those affected in the decisions of their insurance funds. This special form of lived social democracy is primarily practiced by trade unionists and employer representatives. Driven by various social, economic, and political changes, the pressure on this institution has increased steadily over the past few years. In response, proposals for the further development of social self-governance are identified with the Kassel concept, in order to enable a "revitalization of this institution" in the sense of a compatible readjustment. It is about reforms that are to be carried by the acting actors themselves. Intended is a quality-, needs- and affected-oriented form of co-determination, which innovatively further develops social self-governance.(Source: Hans Böckler Foundation / Internet).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071796-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115716-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054442-4>
Asking God in Life : Ecumenical Introduction to Christianity ¤ Why theology in the first place? If theologians are supposed to explain what they have learned and why it is supposed to be good for anything, then embarrassment is usually great. Worlds collide. Over two millennia grown, often abstract and somehow antiquated contents of Christian world interpretation meet a multifaceted, often irreligious and tradition-distant reality. This book bridges the "ghastly broad chasm" between the traditional contents of theology and the present. It starts with lived life, with the existential experiences and questions of people today. It takes these up, relates them to the main themes of theology, the traditionally so-called "theological lessons", and makes it clear how theological thinking makes the world and life life-serving.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172412-4>
Medium, Messenger, Transmission : A Small Metaphysics of Mediality ¤ What is a medium? The contemporary media debate reconstructs media mostly in terms of technical means and devices and (re)explains them as the archimedean point of our world relationship. The new book by Sybille Krämer undertakes a change of perspective: What does it mean if we determine media not as means, but as a middle and mediator? The answer to this is given by the 'messenger model', which highlights transmission as a key concept in cultural philosophy. The messenger appears in this context as the figure of a third, placed between heterogeneous worlds and thus enabling communication and exchange. The culturally creative achievement of transmission is analyzed by the example of the imaginary figure of the angel, disease transmission through viruses, property transmission through money, language transmission in translation, feeling transmission in psychoanalysis, and finally the transmission of perception and knowledge through witnesses. 'Aisthetisierung' - in the sense of making a absent or absurd thing perceivable - proves to be the elementary task of media. Sybille Krämer wants to prepare the ground for a critical confrontation with our demiurgic self-understanding as Homo faber or Homo generator. What does it mean if we understand ourselves more as messengers than as makers and constructors?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063060-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4604953-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038639-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125698-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7610872-7>

Energy-Efficient Windows and Glazing: An Information Package ¤ Comprehensive guide by FIZ Karlsruhe for architects, builders, planners, and students on the currently available glass and window technology. (LK/KA: Nibbrig) Comprehensive guide by FIZ Karlsruhe for architects, builders, planners, and students. Compared to the 2nd edition 2000 (BA 8/01 - must be replaced) thoroughly revised, updated, and expanded by 40 pages. Particular attention is paid to the topics of daylight autonomy, window energy balance in summer and winter, thermal comfort, prevention of summer heat gain through innovative shading systems, and the requirements of the new EnEV 2007.

Protest - Movement - Turning Point : From Representative to Participatory Democracy ¤ For years, we were accustomed to being ruled over our heads. Now we no longer want this division of labor. Political protest will become a way of life - a feeling of life. The young activists report unfiltered from the hotspots of the European-wide protests and address the generation of 18- to 40-year-olds, who so far have only expressed their discontent through abstention from voting. The extension of power plant operating times, the transformation of Stuttgart's main station into Stuttgart 21, rising education costs, pension cuts, and rigid austerity programs, however, drove people onto the streets. The authors shed light on the networking and implementation of protests and let the reader participate in finally showing the flag again. They describe how they were swept up by the movements in London, Paris, and Vienna. And tell how they went from being part of the movement to its motor - determined to take the reins into their own hands. The book shows the courage and finesse with which young people in the fight for their goals win the interpretation of public opinion.

PowerPoint 2010 for Dummies : [at a glance: everything about AutoCorrect, SmartArt diagrams, and slide painting - use graphics and ClipArt specifically - perfect animations with sound and video - use note pages cleverly as to-do lists] ¤ A clear introduction, which equips PowerPoint beginners with the necessary basic knowledge when starting with the current version of the popular presentation program. (LK/HB: Isigkeit) In the introduced series, the author, known through numerous publications on the presentation program PowerPoint and network technology, presents the necessary basic knowledge for the new version PowerPoint 2010 (further programs of the Office package within this series see in this issue). Both the structure and the majority of the text are based on the predecessor to PowerPoint 2007 (BA 9/07). At a few places where innovations come into play (e.g. image editing functions; mathematical formulas) or the terminology has changed (e.g. menu bar instead of multifunctional toolbar), the text has been revised and updated. The numerous illustrations have also been replaced to a large extent. Beginners also receive a competent guide to the widely used program with this software introduction from the popular series.

Algebra for Dummies : [D(U+M)+(M-Ie)/S=Math quickly, easily and fun learned, this equation always holds true] ¤ Review: With "Algebra gives Power" the author surprisingly answers the self-set question of what for. Then, without mathematical depth, arithmetic with numbers, fractions and simple terms, first beginnings of number theory, linear, quadratic and a little cubic equations, some geometry and combinatorics, as well as text problems are treated. The very broad representation with many detailed sample calculations is easily understandable, genuine term discussions are rare. Pseudo definitions like "A function is a unique relation" without explanation of what a relation is, occur more often. The extracted chatty intermediate text tires rather than stimulates, the excursions into the history of mathematics mix secure traditions with legendary ones. One should not be misled by the title part taken from the American original, the core of the middle school material is reliably reproduced. A reading requires little prior knowledge, but a lot of time. For greater need. (3) (Wolfgang Grölz)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037951-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001156-2>
E-Health in Germany : Development Perspectives and International Comparison ¤ The present study examines the state of digitalization of the German healthcare system in international comparison and develops recommendations for its further design. For this purpose, the development of digitalization is traced over the last two decades, causes for the still low digitalization rate are identified, the implementation status of relevant legislative initiatives is investigated and implementation obstacles are identified. The study also takes a look at non-legislative initiatives, evaluates data protection and cyber security aspects and examines e-Health business models. Improvement and innovation potentials are identified, among other things, through a comparison with Denmark, Estonia, Spain and Austria. Finally, action recommendations are derived for the future design of digitalization. In order to make the complex subject of investigation manageable, the focus of the considerations is on five central applications of digitalization: the telematics infrastructure (TI), telemedicine, electronic patient record (ePA), digital health applications (DiGAs, i.e. apps on prescription) and the electronic prescription (E-prescription).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7542254-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020775-4>

Refugees in the Company : Practical Guide for a Successful Hiring and Integration ¤ Through the euphoria of the welcome culture in 2015, mainly driven by politics and business associations, the difficulties of integration were completely overlooked. Since the integration of refugees into the labor market promotes social integration, the topic is treated comprehensively from various angles: labor shortages, social fears regarding competition for jobs, the need to consider cultural peculiarities in personnel acquisition and selection, the influence of respective denominations, the experiences of interviewed company representatives, proven concepts, practical examples, labor law questions regarding the employment of refugees, with current research results, extensive bibliography, and also helpful links to public institutions. In this sense, the book is more of a structured collection of materials, but it has been missing alongside socially/socially/theologically oriented books.

City of Lost Souls : Life in the World's Largest Refugee Camp ¤ The so-called 'refugee crisis', which has been shaking and changing society in Europe and especially in Germany since mid-2015, is primarily based on the bloody conflicts in the Middle East. On the other hand, the drama in the inhospitable northeast of Kenya is hardly noticed by the public. There, refugees - mostly Somalis who fled from the terror of the Shabab militias - have been living in 4 camps around Dadaab (with around AL0 million people!) for almost 25 years. Rawlence, a journalist (among others for the BBC) and NGO employee ('Human Rights Watch'), was on site 7 times from 2010 and spent a total of 5 months in the camp, where urban structures have inevitably developed. He conducted conversations with countless residents, but especially focused on 9 refugees. Their stories form the foundation of his disturbing reports: from the daily struggle for survival, the harassment by corrupt police officers, the hopelessness. Ultimately, a fiery appeal to the politically responsible, not to give up on these people! (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017611-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001307-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4318331-1>

Railway Disasters : Consequential Train Accidents and Their Causes ¤ Publisher Weltner does not aim for a complete listing of train accidents, the subject has already been thoroughly treated by Erich Preuß in several volumes (most recently: "Railway Accidents with the German Railways", BA 2/05) up to 2003. The present book is mainly about major catastrophes, which exemplify errors in the system, failing technology, human inadequacy, attacks or influence by extreme weather. A number of authors (including Preuß) take up individual aspects and substantiate this with descriptions of accidents. Many photos, sketches and other illustrations complement the text. In addition to the descriptions of the catastrophes and analyses of the course of events, one also learns in brief form about interesting facts on the legal processing, safety regulations, measures for accident rescue or the function of relief trains. Recommended as an insight into the field, even if the books by Preuß are available. Older titles from the last decade can be replaced by this book. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191670-0>
Personal Firewalls : 10 Customized Workshops ¤ The "Personal " in the title is certainly unnecessary, as it's not about personal protection. Furthermore: the, the, or the firewall? Tobor uses "the", Microsoft uses "the" in Encarta, "the" in the computer dictionary, Brockhaus uses "the" and Bertelsmann uses "the" (maybe the FAZ uses "the"?). Anyway, the protection against external attacks on one's own PC through such a firewall is important and is well described here in 10 chapters ("workshops"). 3 of them deal with available programs: ZoneAlarm 3, Outpost 1 and Sygate Personal Firewall 5.1 (all free and delivered on a CD-ROM; in March 2004 Sygate 5.5 is current). The following chapters deal with general questions and solutions that affect firewalls, as well as not quite so expensive professional solutions, but the last chapter deals with variants of encryption, an appendix describes hacker programs (also on the CD-ROM) with which one can check vulnerabilities of one's own computer. - Well-written and thought-out work, which can avert some harm.

Seven Leaps from the Edge of the World : Novel ¤ Simone loves her father Eustachius - and yet she can't get close to him. Eustachius Grolmann, 83, is a war child. Grown up in the propaganda state, he fled from Silesia to the West in 1945. He is still haunted by the memories of the flight and the death of his brother. "Be glad you're alive." This post-war sentence he has often told himself, until he believed that what he felt could finally be this joy. Ulrike Draesner crosses the life paths of the Silesian Grolmanns with the fate of a family from eastern Poland who were expelled to Wrocław. Four generations speak. Virtuosely, she creates a kaleidoscope of memories that fit into ever new images. They show how the traumas triggered by flight and expulsion continue to work and how mental landscapes are passed down from one generation to the next. The stories of the Grolmanns and the Nienaltowskis become a mirror of a hundred years of Central European history. They tell of the hardships and joys between parents and children, of air roots, freedom and migration. "Ulrike Draesner has packed a lot into her novel. Not only war and expulsion, but also various family conflicts, traumas and neuroses. And in addition, a lot of details from primate research. For the reader, it's not always easy to follow all the clues and pitfalls. Occasionally, one has the feeling that Draesner is straining herself a bit in her ambition to create a masterpiece. Sometimes the author overdoes it and reaches too far into the effect box, for example when Grolmann, the brain researcher, implants electrodes in his skull to observe his own brain while thinking. Finally, he also appears in a talk show and makes himself into a monkey - that's funny for a moment, but also somehow unnecessary. And yet: "Seven Leaps from the Edge of the World" is one of the great books of the spring. That biographical influences play a role is not surprising, Draesner's father's family fled from Silesia in 1945. What the author has made of it is fulminant. Again and again, she finds great images and metaphors, switching - as a poet known for her poetry - sometimes into the lyrical. Often it succeeds her to crawl deep into her characters, which she lets speak alternately. So, the war-disabled get a painful liveliness for the reader. Now one would like to have infinitely much time to immerse oneself in this colossal novel about fate and will to survive“ (Spiegel)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002053-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062386-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060748-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187879-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033114-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7619850-9>

Pädagogische Basiskompetenzen : Theory and Training ¤ In which way does pedagogical competence show itself? Where and how does it arise? In which way can its development be promoted? These three questions are of central importance for teacher education and for the self-understanding of main subject teachers. The first part of the book conveys research results on pedagogical competence and makes proposals for modeling and measuring cross-disciplinary pedagogical basic competences. The basic competences are classified and assigned to six dimensions: structuring contents and clarifying goals; background work (planning and organizing); forming social structures; communicating; steering interaction; designing learning environments. The second part contains training materials and reflection aids for the targeted promotion of basic competences in each of the six dimensions. Topics such as goal concretization, orientation towards pedagogical values, variants of the teacher role, evaluation, plenum and small group work, teamwork, group leadership in large groups, moderation, pedagogical interaction, coaching and consulting, designing beginnings and endings, body work and maintaining physical and mental health in the profession are treated. The book is aimed at all those who train and further educate teachers, at students of educational science courses and at trainers, consultants and personnel developers	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035093-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173076-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047376-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173086-0>
Anatomy & Stretching ¤ Visually appealing, comprehensive stretching exercise book with very good anatomical representation of stretched musculature in function. With introduction to the subject, detailed guidance and practical hints, as well as a compilation of exercises for complaints. This is the third in a series of current stretching books ("Stretching Anatomy", ID-A 4/16 and C. Ramsay, ID-A 44/15), which represent the stretched musculature in function as anatomical drawings. At the present title, the excellent quality of the illustrations, which also leaves no wishes open for the medical or sports science professional, is to be highlighted. The division of text/image, the text structure, which also contains hints for safe execution, effect, and indication, are clear. The stretches are grouped by body region, which is represented with all muscles (Latin name, location, function) in text and illustration. Introducing various methods of stretching and their value in sports and everyday life are presented. At the end, - in this detail and clarity a clear added value compared to the above titles - a compilation of exercises that are helpful for complaints is presented. Conclusion: Comprehensive, for professionals in the sports and health sector just as attractive for interested laymen, title, at least recommended next to the above.

Elementary Analysis : from Intuition to Theory ¤ Like many other methodically similar titles from the publisher, e.g. G. Wittmann: "Elementary Functions and their Applications" (BA 2/08) or S. Krauter: "Experience Elementary Geometry" (BA 2/06), this text introduces elementary differential and integral calculus by leading from initially only intuitively supported concepts to a theoretically founded formulation. It begins with examples of functions and considerations of slope and surface determination. Then, real numbers are defined as interval enclosures and with a precise limit concept, the first central areas of infinitesimal calculus are extensively discussed. Didactic considerations and historical information are variedly integrated. Frequent references to the Internet concern not only the solutions to the tasks. Recommended especially for active and prospective mathematics teachers, but also for interested upper-level students. (2 pages)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072798-1>
Digital Video School : From Beginner to Expert ¤ Using digital video technology, high-quality video material can be produced at a relatively low financial cost. The reason for failed videos is usually due to a lack of knowledge of the filming persons and errors in video editing. The title clearly describes the most important knowledge from various fields (technical basics, equipment and handling of the camera, lighting, image design, video editing) that can be understood and successfully applied by interested laymen without relevant prior education. The individual subject areas are clearly separated and reasonably weighted, the selection of the discussed devices (hardware and software, additional devices) is appropriate in terms of performance and price for the target group. Very good: The consistently colored informative illustrations explain the text well, review questions at the end of the chapter enable the reader to self-control. Conclusion: Compared to Ulrich Vielmuth's title "Filming like a Pro" (BA 10/04), slightly more focused on the topic and more consistently aimed at ambitious laymen.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274176-2>

Charging Electric Vehicles in Germany with Renewable Energy Contracts ¤ Based on a survey, it is analyzed how high the share of Plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) users in Germany is who obtain renewable energy for charging through corresponding supply contracts and how this is to be evaluated. The evaluation has shown that for all charging locations - at home, at work, and public fast and slow charging columns - the share of renewable energy contracts is very high (>75%). Especially when charging at home, which is the most common charging location, the share of renewable energy contracts among PEV users (84%) is far above that in German households (30%). The various renewable energy contracts, however, differ significantly in their ecological requirements. The knowledge about this seems to be rather low among PEV users.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068598-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151795-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1023745712>

Strengthening Basic Competence at the Workplace: Experiences with Work-Oriented Basic Education ¤ How can work-oriented basic education offers be implemented in companies? The contributions of the collective volume bundle experiences and findings from different perspectives and scientifically classify them. In the practical part, the BasisKomPlus project is presented. Using examples from seven federal states, it is explained how work-oriented basic education can be anchored and implemented in the company. The look at opposing project scenarios is particularly exciting, which cover a broad range: city vs. rural area or SME vs. large company. The question is also addressed of how offers can be designed so that they are attractive and suitable for employees in auxiliary activities or in areas with formal low qualification. The second part of the volume contains contributions to the scientific classification of BasisKomPlus, supplemented by current findings from basic education (LEO study 2018), general adult education and company-based learning. The focus is on the question of how access and learning opportunities can be designed and which frameworks and action principles are conducive to successful adult education in the company context. The following fact sheets show exemplary examples of basic education formats in different industries as well as a cross-industry sensitization workshop. The formats were implemented in the period 2016-2020. Multipliers from companies, chambers, guilds, trade unions and business associations benefit from the know-how of this publication.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144782-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015428-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069332-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068576-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0>

Introduction to Buddhism ¤ In European reception, the question has been asked whether Buddhism is a science, a philosophy, a religion, or rather a practical meditation system. Michael von Brück shows in his introduction that Buddhism is all of these at the same time, and more: It is a science of the psychological processes and factors that influence perception and thought. It is a philosophy that has developed a consistent theory of knowledge, cosmology, and anthropology. It is a religion that has created values for large cultural spaces through ethical instructions and cultic practice. It is a practical meditation system that enables conscious awareness in everyday life, control of emotions and thoughts, and integration of physical and mental processes through different methods.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008690-2>

Principles and Applications of Physical Chemistry ¤ The book is written as a compact introduction to physical chemistry for non-chemists in bachelor's degree programs. This can be especially students of biotechnology, but also chemical engineers, bioinformaticians or other life scientists/engineers. In addition, it should also be useful for chemists as an introductory reading. The most important basics and the necessary mathematics are presented, including some important derivations for understanding. Furthermore, many examples and applications are in the main focus in the text and in their own chapters. It is shown how physical chemistry contributes to understanding and provides practical solutions. In addition, a little historical context is formed; but the necessary basis is in the foreground to successfully understand this diverse and demanding subject, especially in the life sciences and chemistry. A chapter deals with information on physical-chemical practices, which are often linked to such courses. The book is rounded off by understanding questions, exercises and files that bring formulas, tables and illustrations to life. The author Michael Schrader has been a professor of physical chemistry and instrumental analytics at the Weihenstephan-Triesdorf University of Applied Sciences for over 10 years. Before that, he was active in biotechnology for 10 years and earned his doctorate in physical chemistry at the University of Hanover	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045959-7>

The Quran as a Text of Late Antiquity: A European Approach ¤ Is the Quran a message to the heathens of the Arabian Peninsula, which led to the founding of a new religion within just 22 years? Is it the already canonized holy scripture shortly after the death of its prophet, which is still authentically preserved? Given the unprecedented success of the Quran, it is no wonder that this representation is repeatedly questioned and hypotheses are formulated that rewrite early Islamic history and make the Quran emerge in a different region, at a different time, and even without the involvement of Muhammad. All previous reconstructions, however, are mutually incompatible and do not provide a plausible picture of the events, but only raise numerous new problems. The question must be asked differently: Is the Quran really a purely Islamic and therefore foreign text to the Western reader? Or is it rather a new and idiosyncratic voice in that concert of late antique debates, in which the theological foundations of Jewish and Christian religion were also laid? We do not need to remodel the Quran based on new manuscript finds or with the help of linguistic experiments – we need to change our perspective on the Quran decisively if we want to grasp its revolutionary novelty. Angelika Neuwirth, director of the Corpus Coranicum project – Documented Edition and Historically-Literary Scientific Commentary at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences, reads the Quran as a text of Late Antiquity, an era that was also formative for European cultural history. The Quran is thus recognizable as a familiar text that we could count among the 'European heritage' if it were not for ancient prejudices that prevent an unbiased perception.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124227-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117192-5>
Charisma and Politics : Why Our Democracy Needs More Passion ¤ Charisma is an archaic force: a person embodies the hope for a better world. In politics, however, it has a dubious reputation, because charismatic leaders have often enough plunged their countries into misfortune. But can a democracy function with politicians who are only sober technicians of power? Helmut Schmidt embodies a reassuring reliability, Petra Kelly made the issues of the Greens into issues for everyone, and with Marina Weisband, the history of the Pirates might have unfolded differently. Julia Encke shows in her journey through recent history that our democracy could stagnate without charismatic figures who inspire citizens for politics	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4009779-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011413-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046514-7>
History of Design ¤ The basis of this book is the successful volume "Design" ("DuMont-Schnellkurs", BA 9/95), which has brought it to numerous editions and 11 language versions in over 18 years: a true bestseller. The new publication, which is about 300 pages thick, is based on the structure and research of the smaller predecessor, but uses the gained space for solid background information. These shine societal developments and their consequences for the design of mass products well out and are therefore more than most design histories, which arrange products, producers, and designers chronologically. A book that is well written, distinguished by analytical sharpness and historical expertise. Only to be mentioned is that the volume itself is a successful design product - from the cover to the layout, and it is perfectly printed with numerous illustrations. Because current trends such as "Digitalization", "Environment", "Art and Design" or "Design and Marketing" are treated, it is a good opportunity to replace older volumes on the subject in the collection.

Handbook on Children and Domestic Violence ¤ That children are affected by domestic violence between parents, that they suffer and are harmed under this situation, is no new topic. In order to optimize the support practice in the field of youth welfare and to make suitable offers for the affected girls and boys, to understand their fears and ambivalences, it requires profound professional knowledge. Such is compiled for the first time in an interdisciplinary approach in this handbook. Professionals from the fields of Social Work, Police, Justice, Therapy, and Politics receive insight into various professional questions and practice projects. At the same time, a basis of information is created, on the basis of which the willingness for institutional cooperation in the sense of a successful child protection can be strengthened.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030550-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039563-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126366-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4723056-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028892-4>
Globalization : Economy - Politics - Culture - Society ¤ This book aims to provide the reader with an overview of economic, political, cultural, and social aspects of globalization. Special emphasis is placed in the first part on the analysis of the latest phase of economic globalization. In the second part, the question is addressed of how the political system can react to these current challenges. In the center of the representation of cultural globalization, on the other hand, are the various ways in which language and cultural boundaries have been overcome for centuries. Finally, it is investigated what follows from these developments for the future of societies whose foundation has always been in successful territorial and social closure against other societies. It shows that developments can be made in the direction of a world society, but these will not lead to a world state or even a world culture.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112846-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125698-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4557997-0>

Lesesozialisation in schriftfernen Lebenswelten : Reading and Media Use of Mainstream Students ¤ This study takes exploratory journeys in the education cellar. It provides insights into the everyday cultural reading and media practices of young adults who have recently completed mainstream school, and examines the life-historical genesis and the effects of school experiences on attitudes towards reading and actual reading practice. With great clarity, the data show that mainstream graduates have a concept of reading as an educationally important practice, but do not take it over for themselves. Reading is predominantly not an element of their lifestyle, as varied as it may be in individual cases. As a result, graduates have only limited access to a key instrument for the development of professional and personal perspectives in modern society. From a biographical perspective, it becomes clear that family socialization has hardly opened up access here and the school has actually taken on no compensatory functions. Rather, the suspicion is confirmed that reading and literature instruction is still suitable for perpetuating social inequality rather than building specific support structures.

Power in the Middle: New Tasks of Germany in Europe ¤ From the leading role that Germany plays within Europe and has grown into without its own initiative, there arise demands and questions of the highest explosiveness. (Klaus Hohlfeld) Is the future of Europe in German hands? In the face of numerous crises and dwindling acceptance among Europeans for the common project, the question of Germany's role is more current than ever. Some states fear its renewed strengthening; others expect it to finally give up its restraint in favor of a clear, fearless attitude. Must Germany dare to take more leadership to prevent Europe from drifting apart?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4168427-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003846-4>

Opening up the residential quarter for the elderly: Development of a communicative information infrastructure to bridge structural gaps in the social space ¤ In focus are older people who live a reclusive private life, are little involved in local networks and have not been reached by information and offers from care providers for the elderly so far. For these people, the idea of a 'communicative information infrastructure' in the social space of the residential quarter and district was developed. With the infrastructure model, it should be avoided that such people fall into emergency situations unnoticed, but also ensured that they are continuously informed about opportunities for successful management of their life situation. The book describes the developed model and the experiences with its practical implementation. The model shows perspectives for social planning that can effectively mediate between private life management in old age and public care provision of the elderly care. Retired older people are supported from their local environment to inform themselves comprehensively and to take advantage of opportunities for co-determination of offers according to their needs.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066749-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117672-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141482-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134681-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001413-7>
Acoustic Phenomena ¤ Publisher's text: This book clearly shows that acoustics can be a very exciting field within physics. Its concern is to make acoustics more realistic and to enable active participation of students. Starting from an exemplary analysis and explanation of sounds and noises from nature and technology, they can record and investigate interesting sounds for themselves. Whether animal sounds, their own voice, musical instruments or the dentist's drill - the interdisciplinarity required by lesson plans can be successfully implemented with this book. Everyday, typical, but also curious sounds and noises are presented, analyzed and explained. In this sense, the book can also be seen as an encyclopedia, in which one can specifically search for information on a particular topic.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000988-9>
Drawing and designing with Windows 10 and Paint 3D: the digital drawing school for everyone ¤ Software for digital image processing does not have to be complicated or expensive. The formerly discredited "Paint" is now included as a new "Paint 3D" in all Windows 10 versions, is relatively easy to use, and significantly more powerful than its predecessor. This title on Paint 3D starts with a brief chapter on design basics, then deals with typical tasks (importing images into the PC, designing cards and posters, image presentation), and ends with a chapter on printers and printing images. The explanations are limited to the essentials, but are sufficiently detailed. The selection of topics, structure, and depth of explanations are geared towards a quick "problem-solving" and clearly aimed at occasional users without relevant prior knowledge. Good: All chapters are color-coded, the font is slightly enlarged, and all images are high-quality color printed. Conclusion: a well-balanced, easily usable title for software that many users already have on their PC and is sufficient for many tasks.

Interpreting Literary Texts: Lyric - Prose - Drama ¤ The introduction to the interpretation of literary texts is aimed at students of German studies and literary science as well as at teachers at schools and universities. A focus is placed on the development of systematic questions to the text. The author bases his approach on a "four-color method" that evaluates literary texts in four aspects: situation of speech, content, form and structures as well as imagery. The author then categorizes by genres and briefly introduces typical text structures and the terminology that unlocks them. This is followed by model interpretations and exercises for written term papers and exam essays. The suggested solutions are available for download at an internet address.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035964-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072905-9>
Selected Sensor Circuits : From Data Sheet to Simulation ¤ It introduces simulation of sensor circuits based on manufacturer data sheets of sensors; for students of electrical, energy, micro- and opto-system technology, mechatronics, applied physics technology at universities of applied sciences and universities as well as corresponding practitioners. Review: sensor circuits serve the acquisition, evaluation, and possibly processing of physical quantities such as temperature, light, pressure, humidity, etc. Here it is shown how parameters can be determined from the data sheets of various sensor manufacturers and then applied for a circuit simulation. For some sensor circuits, simulations with PSPICE are also extensively documented and are also directly usable. Sounds not quite simple and is indeed not; the course material is therefore aimed at students and corresponding practitioners	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4272489-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038824-4>
Wildwater Rafting : from Beginner to Pro ¤ The author and instructor at the German Kayak Association demands in this kayak school first to a playful handling and self-experimentation with boat and paddle to get a feeling for the movement sequences. This rather unobtrusive tone is also transferred to the actual content. Never primarily instructive, yet precise, informative and richly illustrated, paddle technique and fluid dynamics are described separately in three performance classes. The verbal explanations are presented by sequence recordings. In boxes, training tips repeat the essentials in the individual chapters. A third of the book deals with hazard recognition and avoidance as well as rescue and safety aspects. A successful handbook for beginners and advanced in best equipment. Everywhere where wild water is to be found, broad, otherwise from medium-sized bodies of water as current textbook on the subject recommended. Last "Besser Wildwasserfahren" (BA 5/05), F.

Exit, Sovereignty, Isolation: The Brexit and its Consequences for the Future of Europe ¤ The EU exit of Great Britain is less the consequence of the anti-European British special path, but above all a sign of the current vulnerability of Western democracies to right-wing populist agitation. Part of the Brexit rhetoric is the lament about the alleged citizen distance in Brussels and oligarchic EU structures, the fanning of fears of decline or resentment against refugees. The supposed solution: a 'sovereign' Great Britain that no longer lets itself be dictated by continental European bureaucracy. But all bridges are broken without a deal, and this path can also lead to isolation from which there is no return. The scientists gathered in this volume work out the strategies of the 'Brexiters', their semantics, their propaganda and their political consequences. And they dare to take a look at the future of the European integration project.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191125-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1109778066> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071013-0>
Information Security and Data Protection - simply & effectively: integrated management instrumentarium systematically build and anchor ¤ In the book, the essential challenges of data protection and information security, including cyber security, and the necessary building blocks for their management are shown using examples. A particular focus is on the information security management system and the linking of data protection, information security, and EAM as an integrated holistic management system for the sustainable anchoring of data protection and information security in the company.

Sustainable Settlement Ecosystems: Planning, Implementation, and Operation; a User Handbook ¤ The current human population and its activities have a tremendous impact on the planetary ecosystem, e.g. on climate change and biodiversity. Rural and especially urban settlements play a major role in this. The rapid urbanization continues unabated. More than half of humanity already lives in cities. How can these be sustainably designed? This handbook aims to make a contribution to this. The authors treat settlements in a comprehensive sense as ecosystems. These should function according to the model of mature natural ecosystems and are therefore planned in such a way that both the symbiosis of the two subsystems (technical-cultural and natural) of the settlement with each other and with the higher-level systems is possible. To this end, a comprehensive information and quality management is also used, which deepens and expands the usual process control and participation in planning. All this can support users and those affected in planning and designing sustainable settlement ecosystems. The handbook pursues and conveys a holistic and integrative approach that encompasses fields such as architecture and urban planning, landscape architecture and green planning, environmental protection, life and social sciences, ecology, management, etc. It deals with topics such as energy saving, cycles and reuse, renewable raw materials, land use and traffic, socio-cultural framework conditions, real participation, holistic information, material and quality management. The authors explain the overall concept, the steps of implementation and provide tools for the user. The information, recommendations and tools are directed at the following groups, among others: - local authorities (guidelines for procedure and participants) - planners, engineers (holistic approach, procedures, tools) - licensing authorities, financing institutions (requirements for procedure and procedure) - implementing companies and organizations (recommendations, working materials) - operators (guidelines for operation, checklists) The experiences are based, among other things, on a joint German-Ghanaian program at the Valley View University (VVU), the largest private university in Ghana, which serves as an example of how the vision of a comprehensive ecological university and its campus is implementable.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026152-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5>

No Fear of Linux, Unix: A Textbook for Linux and Unix Users ¤ After an 11-year hiatus, a classic of UNIX literature is being re-released in a thoroughly revised form due to ongoing demand. The fact that Linux is now mentioned in the title before UNIX reflects the development that the related operating systems have undergone in the meantime. Compared to the 10th edition (BA 8/02; now replaced), a significant amount of updating was necessary, and a first introduction to system administration is now offered. In total, the scope has increased by about 50 pages. In essence, the introduction is designed as a basic and advanced course in computer science studies, but it is also very suitable as a first introduction for interested Linux users of all kinds who want to not only learn the basics of configuration and application, but also the various possibilities of shell programming or graphical user interfaces. The clear structure and good didactic design with summaries, tabular overviews, and examples have been retained. Independent of current practice books on Linux and its distributions recommended!(2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061835-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4337730-0>

Introduction to Technical Computer Science ¤ The present introduction is very strongly oriented towards technical relationships. It shows how electronic components can be used in computer systems and makes the technical possibilities and limitations of computer systems clear. The necessary electrical engineering basic knowledge for reading is conveyed in the book in a concise summary. In the first line, students of computer science in the initial semesters are addressed. The present book has a different objective than, for example, W. Küchlin (ID 6/05) or C. Vogt (ID 11/04), where mathematical-algorithmic aspects are treated much more strongly. In comparison to the 1st edition (not discussed here, can still remain in stock) new sections on USB and FireWire as well as on networks are added. The focus lies on logical circuits, signal processing, the VHDL design language, and Moore circuits. The basics of operating systems and system software are well considered. Many illustrations. Summaries for each chapter.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4196734-3>
Sustainability is Change: Actors of Environmental and Sustainability Education in Interview on Development, Change, and Strategy ¤ The world of environmental education is inherently balance-oriented. Protection and preservation of nature, the conservation of life bases, the avoidance of risks define not only the themes and contents. A conservative approach also lies over the organizations of environmental education, determines the program and mission and characterizes the mentality of most of the actors. This is not to be criticized, but to be supplemented. In times of globalization and in the face of the challenge of sustainable development, the ability to change itself becomes a prerequisite for the continued existence and success of many organizations of environmental education and nature conservation. This book has emerged from the consulting activities of stratumŘ, a sustainability agency specifically for the non-profit sector and CSR-engaged companies. That stratumŘ exists is largely due to the German Federal Environmental Foundation, which in 2005 supported the pilot phase of a new consulting approach that led to the founding of stratumŘ. What is special about the consulting practice of stratumŘ is to be clarified by this book through numerous examples.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061627-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5>

The Reason of Nations: On the Nature of Foreign Policy ¤ The book of the American former Foreign Minister and political scientist has multifaceted insight value. It provides a global overview of foreign policy thinking and action since the 18th century. While Europe is initially in the focus, the interest shifts to the USA in the more thoroughly treated 20th century. The fact-rich representation is always set through the analysis of the prevailing, succeeding, or opposing principles: the doctrine of the balance of power, the geopolitical interest, the universalistic claim of the USA for the realization of freedom and democracy. Kissinger represents foreign policy in the classical sense, excluding economic and social aspects. For German readers, important insights from the development since 1945.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015753-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003846-4>

A clearly structured key helps even laymen to find their way around when traveling to tropical countries or to access markets at home with confidence and expertise.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042838-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130857-8>
River Landscapes : Interrelations between Regional Cultural Landscape Design, Preventive Flood Protection and Low Water Management ; a Project of the Research Programme "Model Project of Spatial Planning (MORO)" of the Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development (BMVBS), managed by the Federal Institute for Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Research (BBSR) at the Federal Office for Building and Spatial Planning (BBR) ¤ The present publication deals with the consideration of interrelations between preventive flood protection and regional cultural landscape design in river landscapes. The focus is here on a social and political science perspective. So laws, planning documents and informal documents are analyzed, to what extent relationships between flood protection and low water management and cultural landscape design exist. Furthermore, it is investigated whether synergy potentials exist and to what extent these gain importance in the course of a climate adaptation policy. Exemplarily, the increasing linking of various policy fields is investigated in four regional case studies: the urban-shaped Emscher region, the tourism region of Franconian Lake District, the city region of Cologne/Bonn with the Regional 2010 and the Havel region as the venue of the BUGA 2015.[...] (Source: Publisher)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025290-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033573-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132857-7>

In addition to free games, it includes problem-oriented tactic games and supplementary exercise situations. In addition to concrete aids for lesson and hour planning, in accordance with the new guidelines (playing in and with rule structures), numerous game options for handball, basketball, and hockey are shown beyond the game of football	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018968-5>
Wood Chips from Short Rotation Crops: Fuel Quality and Combustion Behavior ¤ The fuel quality of wood chips from short rotation crops (KUP) often differs from that of forest wood chips. Notably - in addition to a typically higher water content for KUP - there is a high content of combustion-critical substances, particularly nitrogen, cadmium, zinc, and aerosol-forming elements. Fresh KUP wood chips can be expected to produce higher emissions of CO, NOX, and total dust during combustion in small furnaces. Report 56 of the TFZ includes results on the fuel quality and combustion behavior of KUP wood chips from two projects supported by the Bavarian State Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Forestry. The analyses were carried out by the Technology and Promotion Center (TFZ) and the Bavarian State Institute for Forestry and Forest Management (LWF). The focus of the work was, inter alia, on the influence of tree species, rotation time, processing, or location. Combustion tests were carried out in both a commercially available small furnace (50 kW) and the 1.3 MW heating plant of the TFZ.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008186-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179311-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4306823-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4507769-1>
Soziobiology : the Evolution of Cooperation and Competition ¤ Soziobiology is on the trail of the evolutionary origins and reasons of animal and human social behavior. The costs and benefits of this social life are treated in this book just as strategies of social competition, that is violence, fight and dominance but also cooperation, altruism and solidarity. The fundamentally conflicting interests between the male and female sex are fuel for sexual selection. Love and partnership on the one hand and hegemony and exploitation on the other are sexual strategies. Cooperation is to be understood as a temporary, always also fragile compromise in the struggle of the sexes. And finally, this book is also about the latest findings on the evolution of parent-child relationships and thus about the question of how the natural course of events could produce a parental care behavior that makes child neglect and -killing and at the same time also intense, deeply felt parental affection and care possible. This book is aimed at students and teachers of biology, anthropology, psychology and social sciences and at all those interested in the evolutionary history of human social behavior.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153283-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069490-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055903-8>

Introduction to Moral Psychology ¤ Heidbrink explains essential psychological approaches to moral thinking, feeling, and acting. In addition to classical models of developmental psychology (Piaget, Kohlberg), he also presents current social and neuropsychological approaches and refers to the latest research results. Heidbrink succeeds in presenting these theoretical considerations in a vivid and lifelike manner through examples from everyday life, politics, and society as well as from literature and film. In the final chapter, he discusses the possibilities and limitations of learning and teaching moral judgment and moral action, and shows how insights from moral psychology can also help with everyday conflicts. A very well-founded and further-reaching discussion, located at a high level and yet easily understandable for everyone interested. The new edition is thoroughly revised and expanded (the 2nd edition was published in 1996, the 1st edition already in 1992 under the title "Justice. Introduction to Moral Psychology", both pre-editions were not shown here). (3)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170541-5>

Blockhouses : massive wooden houses for living and living ¤ After a brief introduction to the history of buildings made of solid wood, the large-format picture-text book presents 30 houses, which were realized in the last few years as a block house or in solid wood construction, of which 19 houses in Germany, the rest in Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Ukraine and Canada. The range includes rustic block houses in the Canadian or Finnish style, traditionally Alpine buildings up to modern-sensible plus-energy houses. Each house is presented with short texts, interior and exterior photos, floor plans, building technology, manufacturer's address and in some cases, a statement of construction costs. Attractive, but expensive collection for friends of this natural building method. After Erwin Thoma: "Solid Wood Houses" (BA 7/08) and "Eco-Houses for Energy Savers" (Blottner Publishing, BA 2/09) with a focus on wood construction.

Parametric Control : Operationalized Target Specifications as a New Control Mode in Urban Planning ¤ In connection with the discussion about the change of state control towards the 'activating state', a shift of urban planning towards new control instruments is also observed. A promising approach is the Parametric Control. Under this, in planning, control is understood as the assignment or agreement of operationalized goals (parameters), where the way of achieving the goals is largely left to the addressees themselves. The publication presents the results of a DFG research project at the University of Hanover. The goal of this research project was to work out the functionality, advantages and disadvantages, as well as possible success conditions of Parametric Control approaches. For this, examples from spatial planning as well as comparable approaches from other disciplines, e.g. business administration, were examined. As a result, conclusions could be drawn on the potential, but also on the limitations of the application of Parametric Control in urban planning.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4574213-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172618-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190791-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049040-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037278-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4212404-9>

The Trauma in Psychoanalysis: A Psychological and Political Critique of Psychoanalytic Trauma Theory ¤ Starting from the assumption that the scientific discussion of trauma, due to the fear and horror-inducing quality of the research material, has a traumatizing effect on all actors in the trauma discourse, Hillebrandt represents the thesis that psychoanalysis has itself been traumatized through its discussion of trauma. He diagnoses the prevailing trauma concepts in the mainstream of psychoanalysis as failed attempts at trauma management. The glaring weaknesses of analytical theory formation on trauma, as well as parts of their trauma therapy, such as their psychologizing, objectifying, individualizing, and depoliticizing trauma interpretation, as well as the refusal of psychoanalysis to use its political influence to abolish traumatizing social and political conditions, appear as a result of defense mechanisms that are supposed to protect the institution and its actors from traumatizing death, guilt, and reality anxieties.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060749-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047689-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8>
The teacher today : tasks, conditions, policies ¤ Teachers are today in the focus of education policy and discussion in most OECD countries.

The Universe and I: The Philosophy of Astrophysics ¤ A learned and fascinating philosophical journey into the world of astrophysics and a love letter to the exploration of the universe. Astrophysicists know a lot: that the universe consists of 26 percent dark matter and that the black hole at the center of the galaxy M87 weighs as much as 6.6 billion suns. But how do they actually come to this knowledge? Could the universe in truth not look quite different? The philosopher and astrophysicist Sibylle Anderl tells captivatingly about the work of astronomers who conclude from smallest indicators such as the light spectrum or the movement of stars what planets consist of and what mass black holes possess. Her book is a love letter to the exploration of the universe. And a fascinating philosophical journey to the limits of our knowledge. „Sibylle Anderl has studied philosophy and physics and currently works as an editor for the science section of the FAZ. The book – her first – is aimed at scientifically interested readers who are willing to question the common observations and theories... A rather personal book has emerged. This is already shown by the chosen first-person form and the self-drawn cartoons (as the only illustrations). Scattered throughout are scenes of a phone call with the father, in which it is about black holes, their observations in Chile and many fundamental questions of astronomy. The father represents the readers with their many questions – an interesting concept.

We Life Artists ¤ How should we live? What constitutes happiness? In the fleeting modernity, we would rather not be bothered with such questions. We know exactly what matters: more money means more happiness, and each individual is responsible for their own success and failure. At the same time, the question plunges us into bottomless uncertainty, as it seems completely unpredictable what we will see as happiness tomorrow. That orientation is still possible, however, is shown by the great essayist Zygmunt Bauman, who checks the classics of philosophy for their messages for the immediate present. If we contemporaries, so his conclusion, are already forced to consider our lives as a work of art, to change and redefine ourselves permanently, then we can reject the instructions of morality and ethics, but we cannot escape the consequences of our actions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026751-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4021325-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020588-5>
Integrative Social Research : Concepts and Methods of Qualitative and Quantitative Empirical Research ¤ The present book is the result of a multi-year process, with which established ways of representation and discussion of the methods of empirical social research are left behind. The volume does not compete with the numerous, sometimes very differentiated representations of methodological questions and methodical procedures of qualitative and quantitative social research. Rather, it is about supplementing the existing handbooks and textbooks with regard to aspects that are usually neglected. Qualitative and quantitative perspectives and procedures are thematized equally, parallels and differences are named, and possibilities of mutual reference are checked. With this book, the claim is connected to provide readers who are at the beginning of their engagement with empirical social research or whose knowledge and competences are mainly related to a methodological tradition, a comprehensible information basis for empirical social research. It cannot offer concrete instructions or recipes, nor replace own research practice. Here, an overview of the basics and procedures of qualitative and quantitative social research is given, the possibilities of application and combination of various methods are discussed, and some questions are clarified that arise in this context.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4232139-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014606-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137346-7>
Duden, right gender : how you write appropriately and understandably ¤ Gendern stands for a gender-conscious language use, which goes hand in hand with modifications of the conventional language in the interest of gender equality. The Duden editorial team presents here the 1st comprehensive guide to the subject and thus understands the book as a practical assistance for people in institutions, administrations and companies who want to write gender-sensitive texts and get an idea of the possibilities. After an introduction to the linguistic basics of gendern, the main part shows which diverse possibilities language and other sign systems provide, but also which limits there are. Numerous examples of double names, concise writing, replacement forms and reformulations explain how to write appealing and readable texts through gender-sensitive formulations that also reach their recipients. The concluding part offers a brief essay on the historical overview of feminist linguistics and gendern in Germany.

Arisierung and Reparation in Celle ¤ Publisher's information: The public associates the persecution of Jews during the NS era primarily with the mass murder in the extermination camps. Much less attention is given to the fact that a thorough economic exploitation of the Jews began as early as 1933, which continued to intensify. This study shows, using the example of Celle, how the Jewish retailers of the city were gradually stripped of their property and assets. After the war, they were given the opportunity to apply for compensation and restitution of their property as part of the reparation. This volume outlines the process of the so-called 'Arisierung' of Jewish retail trade in Celle and subsequent reparation using extensive archival material. The focus is on the businesswoman Ida Freidberg, who still owned the largest department store in the city in 1933 and was able to flee to New York eight years later, completely impoverished. The work was awarded the promotion prize for Lower Saxon state history by the Historical Commission for Lower Saxony and Bremen in 2008.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4219952-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127747-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136959-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028808-0>

Lenin's Train : The Journey to the Revolution ¤ The author describes one of the most consequential train journeys in world history, the legendary journey of Lenin with some companions from Zurich to Petrograd. She reconstructs the journey with filigree and corrects many errors in the previous literature, including the route. Review: We follow the author (lastly 2014) on one of the most consequential train journeys in world history, Lenin's journey with some companions from Zurich over Germany to Petrograd. It was a world war and so a tour was difficult to organize. All sorts of strings had to be pulled, visas and stamps had to be prepared punctually and the financing had to be clarified. The English historian reconstructs the journey with filigree and corrects many errors in the previous literature, including the route. She describes the intermediate stations of the train journey and repeatedly brings the revolutionary events, which Lenin is heading towards, to the forefront as a framework action. Thus, a kind of historical travel guide to the way to the October Revolution has come into being. German politicians and officers hoped that the revolutionary would overthrow the Tsar and get Russia out of the war. So both sides could agree on the conspiratorial 'journey in the sealed carriage'. In the last chapter, the tragic fate of Lenin's companions is depicted. Bibliography, illustrations and index.

It shows that there is still a significant need for research and that emissions trading would have to be flanked by further instruments. This also includes a reform of the EU agricultural policy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547705-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7507290-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4438735-0>
India's Suppressed Truth : A Polemic Against an Inhumane System ¤ The two authors complain: enrichment, disinterest and arrogance of the elites are on the agenda in India, the political system is rotten and degrading living conditions shaped the daily life, especially that of women and children. (Reinhold Heckmann) India is a commendable democracy and deserves high recognition. This prevailing opinion in the general public, but also in politics and business circles, is vehemently contradicted by the two journalists, who have already proven themselves as profound Asia experts on several occasions (G. Blume lastly in BA 8/08, C. Hein lastly in ID-A 16/13). Rather, enrichment, disinterest and arrogance of the elites in the country are on the agenda, they find; the political system of India is rotten and degrading living conditions shape the daily life, especially that of women and children. They describe this 'reality of the victims' with many illustrative examples from the Indian daily life, report on their conversations with victims of violence, but also with politicians and business leaders, substantiate their sharp criticism with a lot of numerical material and also go into the latest developments up to early 2014.

Patent Law at Universities: A Study on the Value of Industrial Property Rights in University Technology Transfer ¤ In the public, it is commonly assumed that there is a pronounced patent weakness in Germany with regard to the university sector. This is regularly linked to an allegedly inadequate perception of the technology transfer function by many German universities. Is the patenting of university findings in Germany actually neglected? Do there really exist fundamental differences between decision-makers within and outside the universities regarding the use of the patent system? The consortium commissioned by the BMBF has investigated the questions posed in four clearly defined, yet coordinated and corresponding to the previous experiences of the institutions, parts. These are: a patent statistical analysis, the analysis of the legal and organizational framework conditions in this area of universities, a series of interviews from selected universities, an analysis of the work of various exploitation institutions in Germany. Table of Contents: 1. Statistical analysis of the current patent inflow at universities 2. Framework conditions of patent law at universities in international comparison 3.

Introduction to Python ¤ From the well-known and productive author, an updated and revised edition of his introduction to the platform-independent programming language Python is available. The differences compared to the predecessor are quite modest. Now, it is no longer necessary to point out deviations between the underlying version 3.6 and Python 2 in each section. Misunderstandable formulations have been corrected, occasional minor additions have been made, and the typography has been improved, but for the most part, the content comes from the previous edition. Only in the last chapter, which deals with the interaction with the Raspberry PI (Python is available on every device as the primary language), there are clearer changes. In addition to considering the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, Theis omits 3 example programs and offers a new one instead (fan control). Furthermore, a well-suited introductory work, primarily for initial acquisition and as a replacement for worn-out editions. Before the more comprehensive M.

Service Work: On the Ground of Facts; Findings from Trade, Industry, Media, and IT Sector ¤ If service work - in Fourastiés words - was "the great hope of the 20th century", how does it behave in the 21st century? Does it still justify greater hopes, or does it bring the great disappointment? The contributions of this volume plead for abandoning secular prognoses and not rewriting myths about modern service work, but rather going to the bottom of the facts. They present new empirical findings on the current development of service work, which were gained in a research consortium of four institutes (IAT, ISF Munich, ISO Saarbrücken and WSI). The investigations cover four industries that are suitable to clarify the discrepancies and disparities inherent in the concept of service work. They deal with simple and complex, low- and high-skilled, old and future, task-bound and intangible, solid and precarious, limited and unbounded, spatially fixed and spaceless services. They sketch the current requirements for companies and employees, the differences in search strategies and approaches, and the driving forces of development	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224244-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061963-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126724-2>

Training emotional competences : with 121 slides ; [TEK - step by step] ; [all materials online] ¤ Emotional competence is the ability to deal constructively with stress and burdensome feelings. If our emotional competence is well developed, we are mentally healthy and can cope with the demands of life. If it is impaired, this can lead to mental problems and disorders. Therefore, every psychotherapy should capture the competences of patients in dealing with stress and negative emotions and, if necessary, strengthen them through targeted training measures. Step by step, the author explains TEK - the training of emotional competences. TEK is based on current neuroscientific findings. You can apply TEK individually or in a group. - TEK consists of seven phases:1. Muscle relaxation2. Breathing relaxation3. Perception without evaluation4. Acceptance and tolerance5. Self-support6. Analyze7. Regulate. In addition to the book, the author offers a website with patient brochure and audio materials.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027251-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176284-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019702-5>

Spatial Planning Coordination in Eastern Bavaria's Border Region: Legal and Practical Perspectives ¤ The ordering and development of connected spaces across existing but increasingly permeable borders in the EU area pose great challenges for regional and state planning. This is particularly true for EU expansion. The border obstacles are overcome in an integrative approach by coordinating national and regional approaches across disciplines. In this context, material and procedural regulations on both sides of the border must be established, which also follow the guidelines of EU law. The legal forms of transnational coordination of spatial planning are presented in their current state, their previous proven track record, and their future prospects. National and regional spatial planning in the European context (Council of Europe and EUREK) is also addressed. Two maps illustrate institutionalized transnational and multilateral cooperation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4021993-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048590-0>

Erfolgsfaktor Standortplanung : in- and foreign locations correctly evaluate ; with 40 tables ¤ The evaluation of international production locations becomes increasingly important for companies. Location decisions are often made primarily on cost grounds. The quotas of disappointed re-locators show that the risk of failure is high. In addition to internal company reasons such as limited planning capacities, methodical causes can also be identified for these wrong decisions. How can the critical parameters for the respective location strategy be identified? Is the network requirement at the respective location taken into account? The authors present proven methods in practice, how industrial companies can subject their existing company locations to a strategically founded evaluation in comparison with international location alternatives, which does not remain on the level of a static cost comparison. A book for practitioners in industrial companies as well as for scientists dealing with international management and location decisions.

Israel and Germany : Thorny Path to Partnership; Ambassadors Report on Four Decades of Diplomatic Relations (1965 - 2005) ¤ Cliffnotes: May 12, 1965 marks the decisive stage of an unusual partnership. Twenty years after the end of the NS regime and the Shoah, Israel and the Federal Republic of Germany established diplomatic relations. For the ambassadors, who play an important role in the cooperation of the two countries, the activity has always been a special challenge. On the occasion of the 40th anniversary, all 18 Israeli and German representatives - in memories or released reports to the governments - describe their term of office and the experiences gained. Personal experiences and assessments, rather than the description of individual areas of cooperation, are in the foreground.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138523-8>

Development of Instruments for the Prevention of Food Waste ¤ With the production and processing of food, significant environmental burdens are associated, which could be clearly reduced by reducing loss rates. In the context of the project, a reliable assessment of the environmental impacts was made for the first time, which are associated with the losses in the production, distribution, and consumption of food for the German population. Based on an analysis of existing proposal measures and further possibilities for state action, concrete measures are proposed, which are expected to effectively reduce relevant food waste and can be taken by the Federal Ministry of the Environment in the framework of the implementation of the German waste prevention program (Source: Publisher). --SW: Food waste.

Speech-Language Oriented Early Intervention for Deaf Children: Speech as a Way to Social Integration into the Hearing World ¤ Das Leben mit einer Hörschädigung stellt den Betroffenen und vorrangig dessen Eltern vor Entscheidungen, die ein normal Hörender oder Eltern eines normal hörenden Kindes nicht kennen. Die Problematik der bestmöglichsten Förderung für eine erfolgreiche Integration des Kindes steht im Mittelpunkt der Diskussion, wobei die lautsprachlich-hörgerichtete Frühförderung schon sehr früh einen essentiellen Grundstein heraus aus der Isolation der Gehörlosigkeit bietet. Die Lautsprache dient als Hauptkommunikationsmittel in unserer Gesellschaft und ist von entscheidender Wichtigkeit, wenn es darum geht, soziale Kontakte aufzubauen Die umfassende Bedeutung der Lautsprache ist kaum jemanden bewusst, der diese versteht und beherrscht und damit als Mitglied unserer Gesellschaft fungiert. Die Auswirkungen einer Hörstörung sind viel weitreichender als der reine Hörverlust. Eine nicht behandelte oder vorrangig gebärdensprachlich-orientierte Hörschädigung hat einen Teufelskreis zur Folge, der seinen Anfang daran nimmt, dass das hörgeschädigte Kind durch die Hörschädigung seine noch vorhandene Hörfähigkeit nicht schult und dadurch auch keine Lautsprache aufbauen kann. Das Hören und somit auch die Lautsprache müssen sehr früh in die Persönlichkeit der Kinder integriert werden, denn nur so können auch diese Kinder einen hohen Grad an Selbstständigkeit für ihr eigenes Leben gewinnen und müssen sich nicht von Dolmetschern abhängig machen	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030550-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4378534-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113643-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134997-0>
Youth and Religion : Inventory, Analyses and Case Studies on the Religiosity of Young People ¤ In this book, the topic of youth and religion is illuminated in its complexity. This is done on the basis of an integrative theory concept of religion and a typology of the various forms of religion or attitudes towards religion, as well as on the basis of a solid current quantitative and qualitative data basis, in which the most important empirical studies are taken into account. The authors also draw on their own empirical research. This includes biographically reconstructive, i.e. qualitative analyses carried out at the Biographical Research Institute and the online survey Youth & Religion of the Bielefeld Research Institute, on whose results reference is made at many places and whose results are presented to the public for the first time here. Four basic approaches to religion among young people are distinguished on the basis of their life experiences and needs and portrayed in exemplary case studies: religiosity within established institutions, religiosity in groups with strong demarcation from the outside and strong inner social control, forms of religiosity beyond established religious organizations, often under the heading: spirituality, and religiosity beyond confessions and religious self-attribution. The book is aimed at a wide readership with an interest in the profile and diversity of religion in the current youth cultures.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049396-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049428-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132300-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049426-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028859-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013943-8>
Action-Centered Approach : A Concept for Geography Education ¤ Action-Centered Approach is a guiding concept for both constructivist geography and its didactics. The focus is placed on the discourses, actions, and action logics of actors in situative contexts as well as their spatial representations and constructions. In the classroom, students act discursively: they produce 'space', they learn to deal with diverging problem perceptions and interpretations, and to work on these results openly. This volume invites to an action-centered extension of the geographical gaze. It shows how the handling of everyday geography-making and the diversity and variability of world connections can be implemented didactically.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038971-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020219-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020216-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125440-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053474-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113844-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070463-4>

What is Art Nouveau? : An Analysis of Art Nouveau Architecture; 1890 - 1910 ¤ All too quickly today, any lavishly decorated facade of the turn of the century is referred to as Art Nouveau. However, the special stylistic features and characteristics of this short architectural fashion around 1900 are rarely taken into account. - - Stefanie Lieb therefore describes in the first, systematic part of her book the general conditions and characteristics of Art Nouveau architecture and explains its history of origin as well as its interactions with handicraft and design. In the second part, she presents the high points of European Art Nouveau and their most striking buildings. The Glasgow School, the Vienna Secession, and Parisian Art Nouveau, Brussels by Victor Horta and Barcelona by Antoni Gaudí are equally impressive through their variety of forms and richness of fantasy	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028939-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072819-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138356-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>
Industrial Cost Accounting: An Introduction ¤ Cost-conscious thinking and acting are today seen as a self-evident requirement for all executives in practice in the face of increasing competitiveness. This applies equally to commercial and technical executives, whether they are active in construction, production, or sales. Every executive must be able to assess which cost information is required for which decisions, how the data is to be interpreted, and what consequences for business operations can be drawn from them.

Evaluation of Internet Subject Gateways : (EJECT) ¤ The scope and heterogeneity of the information offer require always differentiated methods and tools for the targeted and as possible ballast-free finding of information sources in the context of a specific field of study or a scientific discipline. In order to achieve this goal, a series of so-called subject gateways have been developed in recent times. So far, neither many investigations on the quality of such tools are available nor has a differentiated methodology for such evaluations been developed. The EJECT project (Evaluation of Internet Subject Gateways) therefore pursued the following goals:1) through analysis of already realized subject gateways to show the versatility of the term and to contribute to a clarification of the term formation;2) to show a methodical way to qualitative evaluation of subject gateways;The results of the evaluation are presented in detail in this study and it is shown to what extent a transfer to the evaluation of other gateways is possible.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4634625-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071034-8>
Where the Journey Goes ... : Life Sciences in Dialogue ¤ Not only in genetics, but also in many other areas of biological sciences, there has been a remarkable increase in knowledge in recent years. In the present book, renowned German experts provide an overview of the current state of knowledge in the individual biological disciplines. Gibson and Kettelmann dealt with the construction, working method, and most frequent functional disorders of the brain. Nachtigall reports on technologies that are based on the construction, process, and development principles of organisms. And the paleoanthropologists Schrenk, Bromage, and Kaessmann describe how the family tree of Homo Sapiens is reconstructed today. However, molecular biological topics are at the center: from the deciphering of the human genome to therapeutic cloning and methods of gene and biotechnology. The book is easy to understand, attractive, and affordable. Only the dark sides of biology are sometimes neglected. Not only suitable for school libraries (from secondary level II).

Lava, Magma, Stardust : Chemistry Inside the Earth, Moon, and Sun ¤ It's about the Earth (including hydro- and atmosphere), planets, comets, and asteroids, sun, and moon. Schwedt analyzes the layers of the Earth's interior and their properties in a comprehensible way using the deep drilling (over 9100 m) in Windischeschenbach, makes a tour through the Vulkaneifel and presents exemplary models of geochemical cycles (cf. Georg Schwedt: "Pocket Atlas of Environmental Chemistry", BA 11/96). It's harder to access the chemistry outside the Earth, but we have plenty of moon rock, and further contributions are made by space probes and spectral analysis. Not a chemistry book, but knowledge of chemical terminology helps; the glossary is a bit concise. Only black-and-white illustrations. Engaging, mostly broad, and up-to-date presentation with enlightening and informative excursions into the history of science. Currently, there is no comparable title in this breadth, individual topics are mostly scattered across geography, geology, and astronomy. As a textbook, lastly Gregor Markl (BA 1/09), on the topic possibly also "Encyclopedia of the Earth" (BA 3/09).

Study Guide France ¤ The guide presents the education and university system as well as the study and living situation with their peculiarities and offers numerous practical tips and assistance. (LK/W: Thorn) As the French education system, like the German one, is undergoing change, updating the study guide, first published in 1999 in the tried-and-tested DAAD series (BA 1/00), is sensible. The extensive address section and link and literature tips have been brought up to date, individual chapters have been streamlined, and the whole has been thoroughly revised. After all, one in ten who decides on a foreign study chooses the neighboring country of France. And the present study guide, which informs just as reliably about questions of student life as about study opportunities, admission requirements, and student life in France, is a valuable help in preparing and designing the study stay.

Integration through Education : Education Acquisition of Young Migrants in Germany ¤ In Germany, education is a key indicator for social integration. That education is an essential prerequisite for access to vocational training and employment is beyond question. Children and young people with a migration background, who have significant disadvantages in education acquisition and access to the labor market, are not a marginal phenomenon in Germany. Despite various educational and labor market policy efforts, significant inequalities in education, training, and employment continue to exist to the detriment of migrant children. Whether education and, based on this, successful access to the labor market contribute to the integration of young migrants in Germany is the subject of the present volume. In the foreground, the description and explanation of the education and labor market opportunities of young migrants in Germany are compared to those of their native peers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053369-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4009736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006681-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7544915-8>

Your Death, My Life : Why We Find Organ Donation Right and Still Shrink Back ¤ The medical ethnologist directs the gaze at all the euphoria over the medical possibilities of organ donation to the far less discussed but no less contentious aspects of the discussion: the ethical and anthropological dimension. For if the recipient of the organ in the best case also receives a new life 'given', there are 'residual risks': Who are the organ donors and what are the circumstances of their death? What burdens can the relatives expect when releasing a relative for organ donation? What does the brain death criterion mean and what human image stands behind this concept of death? How does the care of potential organ donors proceed? And what significance does organ donation have for the recipient in terms of their identity and self-awareness? The author has investigated and problematized these questions on site. Her also understandable to laypeople writing is a clear call to all to answer them before a hasty agreement to organ donation.

Collection of Indicators and Development of an Evaluation Index for Practical Assessment of Animal Welfare Aspects, Using the Example of German Trout Farming : Project Duration: 01. October 2017-31. March 2021 ¤ Scientific studies on the sensitivity of fish have increased the demand for a precise quantification of animal welfare and the implementation of comparable standard procedures for animal welfare evaluation in aquaculture. The aim of this study was therefore to define indicators that can be reliably and practically collected on the farms („farm-based“ indicators) and to develop an animal welfare evaluation index, using the example of the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) during the fattening phase in commercial flow-through systems in Germany. This will give the fish farmer the opportunity to check himself and his holding more closely and to identify and eliminate animal welfare-relevant weaknesses in his production. With the help of the index, the operator can communicate the results, for example, to consumers and authorities. In addition to operators, veterinarians, the qualified service, monitoring programs, and certifiers can also use the index as an additional evaluation tool.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154983-1>

eLearning for Corporate Practice ¤ E-Learning was predicted to be a boom for training and further education on PCs and within computer networks, but this has yet to materialize. Nevertheless, so-called "E-Learning" is gaining importance, not least in the corporate environment. The collection of essays brings together experiences with training measures based on electronic learning, with examples from the field of small and medium-sized enterprises. The 13 contributions were grouped into 3 thematic areas, once concrete experiences from companies, then necessary standards and norms for quality assurance, and finally didactic concepts of electronic learning. The authors argue that E-Learning should also be used in smaller and medium-sized enterprises. However, the prerequisite is that the use takes place on-site and is tailored to individual needs. From a cost-benefit perspective, neither standard products nor expensive individual adaptations can be justified. In addition to introductions such as A. Beck (ID 28/02); for developers, see e.g. E.

Consequences of Social Aid: Theoretical and Empirical Approaches ¤ What happens to people who are professionally helped? Focusing on this, the book targets the core of institutional assistance: their consequences for the addressees. A complex concept of consequences is taken as a basis. They refer to interpretation and action patterns, living conditions, images, and categorizations by means of which addressees are perceived, or by means of which they perceive themselves in the sense of possibly institutionally co-constituted self-understandings. This perspective is worked out and discussed both fundamentally theoretically and in a comparison of different fields of work.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006340-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055776-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129356-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055676-1>
Freedom, Guilt, and Responsibility: Outlines of a Naturalistic Theory of Free Will ¤ No scientific debate has been conducted in the public sphere in recent years with as much vehemence as the dispute over free will. The traditional concept of 'free will', which also underlies German criminal law and its concept of guilt, assumes that people can decide and act beyond all psychological and neurobiological determinants. Such a conception of free will is neither conceptually-philosophically nor empirically acceptable. In this book, Gerhard Roth and Michael Pauen develop a new concept of free will together. The basis is an 'enlightened naturalism' that takes pre-scientific phenomena, philosophical concepts, and scientific methods equally seriously. This results in an understanding of freedom that places the ability to act self-determiningly on the basis of one's own desires and convictions at its center. Roth and Pauen thus avoid the difficulties of many traditional conceptions, capture the everyday understanding of free will, and also do justice to the findings of neurobiology. Their concept, as argued by the authors, also makes possible a significantly more differentiated understanding of guilt and responsibility, from which far-reaching consequences for criminal law and penal execution follow. 'Free actions may not be carried out under coercion or under complete determination. We designate this requirement as the autonomy principle, but actions that we call free may not also be random.'	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079320-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171303-5>
Artificial Intelligence ¤ Excerpt from the table of contents: "Jerry Kaplan discusses the most important social, legal, and economic aspects for the current and future significance of Artificial Intelligence in this book. He addresses fundamental questions such as: Will machines one day be smarter than humans? How will learning, flexible robots affect the job market? Can a machine be held responsible for its actions? The author makes it clear how progress in the intellectual and physical capabilities of machines will fundamentally change our society. He shows that this continuous development of machines will play an increasingly important role and will be inseparably connected to many areas of our daily lives."

Functional Illiteracy - Research Perspectives and Discourse Lines ¤ This study text describes the national and international state of research on the phenomenon of functional illiteracy. The author distinguishes terminologies from one another, illustrates argumentation lines and thus creates a sound basis for the development of new perspectives and approaches for further empirical and theoretical research on reading and writing proficiency deficits. Students of adult education and interested actors in the field of literacy programs receive here a theoretical foundation for scientific basic studies or practical project work.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134373-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155672-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017894-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001863-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068576-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4481193-7>
Pilatestraining 50+: for more mobility and radiance ¤ Pilates exercises, specially modified for the 50 plus age group. With relaxation, lesson pictures and information on Pilates.

Measure and Integral ¤ This textbook is a compact and lecture-tested introduction to the theory of measure and integration for mathematics students after the introductory lectures. The concentrated presentation provides a consistent and transparent system of the most important results, also for readers who need the theory as a basis for other areas and therefore require a concise compilation of the central facts. The presentation is focused on the bachelor's degree program, in which the theory of measure and integration is increasingly considered as a compulsory event in the study plans. The work is well suited for the transmission of the basics, but cannot replace more comprehensive works such as those by Heinz Bauer (last ID 19/91) or Jürgen Elstrodt (last ID 15/03). With tasks (without solutions) and due to the scope only a few examples. Suitable for collections with the corresponding target group, otherwise recommended as a supplement.

Computer and Internet Criminal Law: A Foundation ¤ The modern information and communication technology poses new challenges to the entire law. Criminal law is faced with the task of capturing both classical crimes in their new technized attire as well as new forms of criminality made possible by the use of computer systems and the internet. This textbook provides a comprehensive and detailed overview of computer and internet criminal law, ranging from classical computer fraud and data hacking to the latest criminal manifestations such as domain hijacking and phishing. Furthermore, it also deals with future developments to be expected, especially the increasing internationalization of the law in this field	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074661-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308416-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057795-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4010452-7>
SAP - the Technical Introduction ¤ The SAP world is large and difficult to overview for beginners. Anyone who wants to succeed as a technical expert in this field needs a broad and systematically built introduction to the architecture of this leading platform for Business-IT. This title offers this introduction to the future consultant, administrator, or developer. It helps to understand, use, and adapt the various products, modules, application, and configuration scenarios. This title is not suitable for clerks and users of SAP modules in operation. However, those who possess technical basic knowledge are offered the opportunity to master the whole world of this complex and powerful software from the basics (SAP modules and architecture layers, tenants, roles, and authorizations) to configuration and customization (HANA, database connection, workflows, and processes) to self-developments and evaluations (objects, warehouse, reporting, APIs).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4841146-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/104188639X> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4801683-4>
Python for Dummies ¤ The Python programming language has a clear, easy-to-learn code and can be used on various platforms, which is why it belongs to the most popular languages. It serves as a scripting language for applications such as Gimp or Scribus and also for the Raspberry Pi. The author quickly gets to the point and explains how beginners and those switching can write their first Python programs with the free distribution "Anaconda" and the development environment "Jupyter Notebook". After the introduction of the basics, everyday examples follow, before more challenging tasks such as saving data in files are addressed. The previous edition was based on Python 3.4.2, the current one on 3.6.3; in the meantime, there is 3.7.1, but this does not limit the usefulness in any way. There are a number of differences between the editions, especially in the chapter structure, yet the 1st can still remain in stock and/or be supplemented by the current one. After T.

An Anatomy of Power : The Chomsky Reader ¤ A great collection of unpublished basic texts: Noam Chomsky is worldwide considered as one of the most important intellectuals of our days. In the past thirty years he published books that became standard works of language as well as of political science. As one of the sharpest critics of US-American world power politics he has long since become a leading figure also outside the academic circles. To his lectures people of all social classes and age groups stream today. It is effortless for the now seventy-year-old to fill halls with up to ten thousand seats. And the way Noam Chomsky spreads his thoughts is unique: calm, yes quiet, with great consideration. In doing so, the speaker often leaves room for intermediate questions, so that the lectures are not infrequently formed first from the dialogue between Chomsky and his audience. "An Anatomy of Power" brings together for the first time the most important of these speeches of the last ten years, which, due to their particularly easy-to-understand dialogical form, offer the best introduction to Noam Chomsky's thoughts and represent an indispensable supplement to his other, "more academic" books.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126263-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037877-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252093-9>

Haben wollen! : How the Brain Controls Our Desires ¤ The focal point in addiction medicine is the craving: the continuous, unrelenting desire that creates deep physical and psychological suffering when left unfulfilled; the overwhelming feeling of needing something - cigarettes, alcohol, sex, or food - regardless of the damage to the body, mind, bank account, or relationships. And a lasting success in resisting the "substance craving" will not come easily to the affected individual. As US psychiatrist and addiction expert Manejwala puts it: the brain is the mastermind behind the craving. The author convincingly shows how, in the case of an addiction, cognitive distortions can change the form, structure, and function of brain cells and that the shame of the affected individual is one of the most toxic elements of the craving. Along with case studies, the expert illustrates how the craving cycle can be neutralized with self-help (e.g. the 12-step program) and professional interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy). - Primarily for professionals in addiction help/therapy.

Innovationsfinancing for SMEs: Special Features and Opportunities in Eastern Federal States; Summary of the Research Project 2009-2012 ¤ The present study deals with the business economic special features of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Eastern Germany, which are generally also shown in financing. The research proves that the insufficient innovation dynamics in Eastern Germany is not just a cyclical or even mental, but a structural phenomenon. The analysis emphasizes a special need for action in the eastern federal states, as there are on the one hand a large number of small companies, and the middle class is largely established overall, but in comparison to the West, established large companies are less frequently found as partners and have a positive impact on medium-sized supplier companies. In addition, the financing conditions in Eastern Germany are special, i.e. the proportion of external financing is differentiated.

This is done through concise and clearly formulated statements without, however, neglecting the actual approach of science - not only development, but also the dissemination of knowledge.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026596-1>
Site Management ¤ Foundational series for architecture and civil engineering students, which externally resembles study scripts and provides a clear introduction to the topic (cf. in this issue B. Bielefeld, T. Brandt, H. Klein et al.). The present title is also directed at beginners in the profession. The working areas of the architect/civil engineer as site manager are conveyed: foundations of site management, construction site organization, scheduling and workflow planning, quality assurance, costs and settlement, acceptance and warranty, handover to the client. Practical and understandable representation with black-and-white photos, workflow plans, diagrams, additional tips and hints, as well as further literature. The topic is also dealt with in the textbook by K. Stark: "Construction Management - Foundations" (ID 13/07). G. Weizenhöfer: "The Construction Site Handbook" (BA 2/03) is directed at the private client. A ekz-folio binding is recommended. (3)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004785-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004942-5>
Signal Transmission : Fundamentals of Digital and Analog Communication Systems ¤ Since 1975, this fundamental textbook has been appearing for students of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Physics as well as corresponding practitioners. It has been expanded by almost 150 pages compared to the last reprint of the 3rd edition (ID 15/89). On the one hand, some important facts for the future were added, on the other hand (since the 6th edition of 1995) detailed solutions to the exercise problems, which are now also available online. Here, too, it should be noted, as with A. Neubauer (see in this issue), that there are already some fundamental titles in this theoretical field and that older ones are still valid. In case of doubt, the more comprehensive and yet hardly more expensive Ohm should be bought instead of Neubauer. (3)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171039-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054947-1>
The Left and Religion: History, Conflicts, and Contours: A Publication of the Rosa-Luxemburg Foundation ¤ Church and the socialist workers' movement have had a difficult relationship from the very beginning. What does that mean for the left today? How do they see the relationship between religions and the state, in the dispute over headscarves, military chaplaincy or religious education? And what are the standards for a left-wing religious policy? It is a conflict-ridden relationship that the left has with religions and churches. From the beginning, the churches have suspected or fought the socialist workers' movement as atheist and church-hostile. For the left, religion was often just false consciousness, 'opium of the people' (Marx), harmful in the fight against exploitation and oppression. The critical and utopian potential of religion, which is often suppressed by the churches, receives little attention. A left that commits itself to the human right to freedom of religion is challenged to ask anew how an open society can be shaped socially, politically, culturally, and in terms of worldview, and how a modern left-wing religious policy can be developed. Because the religions are also a contested site in the undertaking to 'turn all relations upside down in which man is a subjugated, abandoned, and contemptible being' (Marx). This formulates a standard of social change that should remain valid for the left and forms a basis for the alliance of secular or religiously motivated emancipation movements.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035854-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049416-0>
Dreamland Germany? : the first year after the flight : two brothers from Syria tell ¤ How does integration in Germany succeed? Antonie Rietzschel combines the life story of two Syrian refugees with political analysis. Yousef and Mohanad, two brothers from Syria, have made it. For a year now, they have been in Germany. Antonie Rietzschel has been accompanying them from the beginning: She has experienced what happens when debates about refugees and welcome culture meet real life. How does one become part of German society? How does one continue to live when the family is still in the war zone? The brothers tell how they had to fight for their right to stay, received support and experienced the shift to the right. In doing so, they are not only speaking for themselves. Because what began as a state of emergency will change our society in the long term. The impressive portrait of the immigration country Germany in 2016. "Antonie Rietzschel tells in 'Dreamland Germany?' convincingly and comprehensibly the story of Mohamad and Yousef. For a year, she accompanied the Syrian brotherly pair in Germany and experienced not only how many a dream bursts, but also why many a help offer for integration, although well-intentioned, does not always work... The story of the brotherly pair enriches her with short factual information on the topics that are at issue in the individual chapters. Through this connection between concrete fates and generalized information, a vivid picture of the immigration country Germany at the beginning of 2016 emerges. Worth reading!"

The Great Saints Encyclopedia ¤ The encyclopedia lists all Christian saints listed in the Roman General Calendar of 1969, as well as a selection of significant regional and some only still legendary saints who still enjoy great veneration. The approximately 330 clearly written, but rather uncritical presentations contain information on feast day, life, legend, patronage, veneration, cult sites, superstition, and above all, representations in art. 82 outstanding color illustrations and around 170 black-and-white illustrations (an overview of the illustrations unfortunately lacks) illustrate the surprisingly affordable work.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041189-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4159400-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117606-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4024052-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4024055-1>
Culture as Intermediate Realm: An Evolutionary Biological Perspective ¤ No serious adherent of the biological perspective will deny the importance of culture for human behavior. And no serious adherent of the cultural science perspective will deny the importance of evolution for human behavior. But both tend to trivialize the importance of the other side as quickly as possible in order to return to their own perspective. For Karl Eibl, human cultural ability is not in contrast to biological equipment, but he understands it as a product of biological evolution. Only the objectification function of human language makes it possible to refer to non-present things: past, future, absent, or even just invented. It also allows for coherent own worlds to be designed: intermediate realms. Cultures as intermediate realms are relatively autonomous, huge relay stations, in which the variably changing environment of humans is adjusted to their old, evolved nervous system over millions of years. The book presents the most important biological conditions and cultural internal mechanisms of such constructions and also makes the biological conditions of high cultural phenomena such as religion, philosophy, and the arts visible. "In the ability of decoupling lies the specificity of human problem-solving. By introducing a second level into our information inventory, we gain the possibility of managing huge amounts of information without these directly influencing our actions. We can note where an information is valid, when it is valid, who it comes from (and how reliable it is), how often it is relevant, which information may compete and so on. Each information can be so to speak marked with a small yellow sticky note that informs about the conditions of its validity."	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002230-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125698-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071050-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062860-7>
Knowledge and Education in Foucault: Enlightenment between Science and Ethical-Aesthetic Educational Processes ¤ Enlightenment in the sense of a critical attitude is only possible for Foucault as a radically voluntary aestheticization of one's own life. Here he sees a scope for the individual, which is forced to form a normalized subjectivity. Achim Volkers examines Foucault's assessment of enlightenment from an educational-theoretical perspective. Initially, he analyzes how the normative connection between professional knowledge and power is represented. The formation of a critical attitude can thus not be realized within the framework of a scientifically conducted pedagogy. Foucault's thesis that this is only possible in the form of ethical-aesthetic educational processes is analyzed in its systematic and historical content.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070955-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190121-6>

Speed Reading for Studies ¤ The author wants to support students in increasing their personal efficiency in studies and improving their individual learning behavior. The speed reading technique introduced by the British intelligence researcher Tony Buzan in the 1970s (T. Buzan: "Speed Reading") can help here to increase reading speed, text understanding, and memory of the contents taken in with the enormous text volumes that occur in studies. The author conveys the basics of the method, shows how to get rid of counterproductive habits and then introduces the individual techniques of speed reading in five consecutive stages with numerous exercises. The last stage is about speed reading techniques when reading digital texts on screens. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4253957-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035439-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058216-4>
Federal Funding Programs and Projects with Robotics Reference since 2010: Short Study ¤ The focus of this study was on the research funding of Germany with reference to robotics. Initially, an overview of current specialist and funding programs of the German federal government was given, as they are designated by the funding ministries. For a detailed examination of the funding projects contained in the programs, access was made to the funding catalog (FÖKAT) of the BMBF. The authors point out the restrictive notes on the statement value of this data basis. Within the scope of the study, a distinction was made as far as possible between industrial and service robotics. This distinction is not to be made sharply in the practice of funding - it is noticeable above all that service robotics is increasingly being used in industrial contexts. The funding volumes of individual programs are therefore not to be allocated to industrial and service robotics in proportion. Nevertheless, the presented programs and projects give an impression of the thematic priorities and order of magnitude of the federal government's robotics project funding.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125049-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4261462-4>

Verification of the applicability of drone-supported thermal imaging cameras for the detection of ungulates (using the example of roe deer) in the Palatinate Forest and surroundings : Final report on the research project ¤ The determination of wildlife populations in forest areas forms an important working basis, especially in the field of wildlife management. For this purpose, different methods of data collection – terrestrial and aerial – have been used in recent years. In particular, the roe deer count remained often unsatisfactory in previous attempts, because too faulty and/or laborious and/or cost-intensive (e.g. Gräber et al. 2016). Therefore, a new experimental approach was chosen within this study: the nocturnal counting of roe deer using thermal imaging cameras and drones (UAV – unmanned aircraft systems). The use of this new technology has the following innovative and scientifically interesting aspects in wildlife detection: flight in the main activity time of the species to be detected, low flight altitude (<100 m) in combination with the latest drone and thermal imaging technology (longer flight times and higher sensitivity of thermal imaging cameras), handling of larger and impassable areas, higher safety for the pilot, and live transmission of thermal signals for spontaneous flight maneuvers and their evaluations in real-time. Despite these advantages, a systematic and comprehensive procedure test was lacking so far.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4052009-2>

1968 : Trail of a Year ¤ The great visual history of the year that changed the world. 1968 is long since the cipher of a social upheaval, frozen in the same arguments and images. Ades Veiel and Gerd Koenen have delved into the archives and brought to light things never seen before, long forgotten. They show and tell the story of this breathless year, a story that begins long before 1968 and extends far beyond it. Veiel and Koenen take up the visual trail of '68 from the Spiegel affair, the Auschwitz trial, and the Vietnam War, following it through the Kommune 1, the Prague Spring, the racial unrest in the USA, and the German student movement to the radicalization of the protest by the RAF.

Planning and Operation of Logistics Networks: Cross-Company Supply Chain Management ¤ The concepts and applications of Supply Chain Management (SCM) are extended to networks. The partnership-based cooperation between company parts and various companies over two and more stages of the supply chain forms a special focus in the book written for practitioners. Equal attention is paid to the logistics-adequate design of products as well as to the economically optimal conception of logistics networks. For potential analyses, i.e., preparatory work for projects, and continuous improvements during operation (redesign), analyses are conducted and evaluations are made. Practical examples supplement the explanations, new terms are defined in a glossary. In the 2nd edition, the topics - outsourcing of logistics services - partner management and - coordination principles are supplemented. &nbsp; TOC:Why Supply Chain Management?- An Introduction.- Local Planning - A Look into the Past.- Procurement, Analysis, and Preparation of Planning Data.- Forecasting Procedures and Demand Planning.- Supply Security through Inventory Management.- Strategic Supply Chain Management.- Operational Supply Chain Management.- The Bullwhip Effect.- Logistics-Oriented Conception of the Supply Chain.- The Importance of Structure for Logistics Networks.- Logistics Partnership.- Key Figures for Improving Supply Chain Processes.- Future Supply Chain Management.- Bibliography.- A Web Resources.- Associations	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4684051-5>
Tuition Fees and Their Social Impacts: An Analysis of Data from the USA, England, Scotland, the Netherlands, Austria, Australia, and New Zealand ¤ Methodically, the investigation of tuition fees and their social impacts is based on the concept of law and economics, a research branch of institutional economics. In principle, methodological individualism is assumed. The system behavior is reduced to individual actions. Individuals are assigned certain characteristics (preferences) that do not disappear or change when interacting with other individuals. In the background of the investigation, the question stands whether in Germany or in other countries, more academics are needed, whether additional financing needs exist, whether the state provides sufficient financial means, and whether a shift of a part of the financing to the private side improves the situation or only leads to a faster withdrawal of the state from the financing.

Graph and Network Optimization ¤ A comprehensive and detailed introduction to basic concepts and selected elementary accessible areas, also with a view to applications. (Wolfgang Grölz) Graph theory allows for an intuitive and playful approach to basic concepts, many of its non-superficial results can be justified without complicated mathematics, and various applications are always offered. This text is also a proof of this. The author always introduces the topics from examples, in order to then thoroughly and understandably illuminate selected interesting questions, such as e.g. colorings, directed graphs or certain algorithms. Again and again, cleverly inserted questions force the reader to think along, at least to search for the answers at the end of the chapter. The solutions to the tasks listed there can be found, at least in hints, at the end. Proof methods that could not be covered by the usual school material, such as e.g. complete induction, are carefully explained in an appendix. More clearly than the similar title P. Tittmann:	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4390818-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4021842-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043664-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4705155-3>
Reading Motivation in Elementary School: Empirical Findings and Models for Teaching ¤ The international comparative studies PISA and IGLU have triggered a debate about the central questions of education in Germany, with the importance of reading, reading competence, and reading motivation at its center. Central findings of the Erfurt study on the possibilities and limitations of school influence on the development of reading motivation in elementary school age are presented here for the first time in detail. The focus on elementary school is mainly due to the importance of this phase of education for the processes of literary socialization. Recent findings of brain research also make it clear how consequential neglect of educational opportunities - especially of dealing with language and literature - in this age phase is for the entire personality development. In parallel to the empirical survey and its evaluation, the authors have tested various possibilities for developing reading motivation in a multitude of teaching experiments at different literary examples as well as in the media context. Against this background, the book makes visible at models for various genres how the deficits identified in the study can be overcome and both girls and boys can be encouraged to read.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073409-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011975-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167434-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022349-8>
We think, therefore I am : about knowledge and knowledge illusions ¤ Our brain can produce brilliant insights, but can also miserably fail and make a lot of mistakes. How can that be? ask the two renowned American cognitive scientists and investigate and describe the thought processes in us, especially also the social dimension of our thinking, i.e. the interplay between brain and its respective environment - scientifically accurate, but without many technical terms, with numerous examples of human errors and catastrophic errors from politics, society and everyday life, and also written quite smoothly.

The Laboratory School in the Mirror of its PISA Results: Pedagogical-Didactical Concepts and Empirical Evaluation of Reform Pedagogical Practice ¤ The Laboratory School - the most well-known German experimental school - has been put to the empirical test. A research group has used PISA instruments to determine the level of academic achievement of 15-year-olds at this experimental school. From this, a book has emerged in which, first, the pedagogical-didactical concepts of the school are described from the inside and, in addition, in the empirical outside view, the competences, social orientations and attitudes that the students have achieved are presented. These empirical results, in which strengths and weaknesses are reflected, are then reflected again from the inside of the school. In this way, reference is made to fields in which the pedagogical concept of the Laboratory School is confirmed by the empirical results. On the other hand, it is also thought about in which areas the practice of the Laboratory School needs to be further developed, so that the reform pedagogical approach can be linked to good results in all fields. The book is an important contribution to research on reform schools, because here the pedagogical program of an experimental school is brought into a comprehensive dialogue with its own empirical data for the first time. And it is an exemplary example of how, using instruments of school comparison research, a single school can be evaluated in selected areas in such a way that a potential for school development arises from it	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4198340-3>
Interdisciplinary Communication: Basics and Concepts ¤ Hans Jürgen Heringer presents his introduction to intercultural communication in the meantime in the 4th edition (previous edition not shown). He first describes general linguistic aspects. He presents communication models, describes the connection between signs, their meaning and understanding, deals with conversation, conversation analysis, speech act theory as well as nonverbal communication. He relates language as the basis of communication to culture and knowledge and describes cultural differences. These topics already take up about half of the title before intercultural aspects of language are considered. Heringer describes critical situations and events as focal points of intercultural communication and exemplifies cultural standards and stereotypes. Written in a scientifically-academic style, he illustrates his explanations with graphics, images, examples and suggestions for own considerations. Supplementing possible, after H.R. Yousefi (ID-G 20/14) and "Intercultural Communication" (BA 7/06).

We Have Rebuilt : Women of Hour Zero Tell Their Stories ¤ In today's Germany, the landscapes of ruins can no longer be imagined, on which the rebuilding began after the war - by women of a generation that will no longer exist in a few years. Their life paths dictated the unthinkable today, all the more touching when they emaciated and hardworking yet smile into the cameras. The image-text volume documents an impressive piece of our history. It tells of flight, expulsion and death, of survival in the winter of hunger 1946/47, 'stubble' on harvested fields, of unimaginable housing shortage, smuggled coal in briefcases, imaginative clothing recycling and food (liver sausage made of flour and marjoram! When eating gruel, one imagined Kassel sausage) and of disappointment over returned, foreign husbands. Shocking, touching stories of hardship and breakthrough and very different experiences and social developments in East and West. This book belongs in all libraries!	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018202-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065958-6>
The Social Structure of Germany ¤ The 7th thoroughly revised edition of this standard work provides a comprehensive overview of the social structural development and social change in Germany before and after reunification. By comparing the conditions in the GDR and FRG, as well as new and old federal states, important differences and similarities are highlighted. On an empirical basis, the following areas are presented: population structure, material living conditions, social inequalities and class structures, re-shuffling processes in important groups (elites, service classes, self-employed, farmers, working-class groups), poverty and precariousness, migration and integration, social mobility, social inequality between women and men, as well as family and other private life forms. Finally, the main lines of overall development are interpreted within the framework of modernization theory and a mid-term balance of two decades of German unity is drawn from the perspective of social structure analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077587-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4235034-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055898-8>
Europe Against the Jews : 1880-1945 ¤ In his new, comprehensive representation 'Europe Against the Jews 1880-1945', the well-known historian Götz Aly shows that the Holocaust cannot be explained solely from German history. Both in Western and Eastern Europe, anti-Semitism and Jew-hatred had increased sharply since 1880, driven by nationalism and social crises. For the first time, Götz Aly presents modern anti-Semitism as a transnational phenomenon. Without diminishing the guilt of the German perpetrators, he shows how rivalry and envy, discrimination and pogroms have contributed to preparing the ground for deportations and genocide in many places since the end of the 19th century. During World War II, the Nazi occupiers finally murdered six million Jews, most in Eastern Europe, partly with the help of local police and authorities. With his pan-European perspective, Götz Aly enables a new, comprehensive understanding of the Holocaust. 'Götz Aly's book comes exactly right in 2017 - because it also shows how much Europe's hatred of the Jews was fueled by nationalism. He shaped thinking in ethnic categories - and thus Jews were stamped as a group that was allegedly 'different'. Only as such a group could they be fully targeted. And in them, the dehumanizing mixture of envy and nationalism found its most defenseless victims' (deutschlandfunk.de)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028814-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002333-3>
Designing and Living ¤ Fifth title of the new fundamentals series for students of architecture and civil engineering (cf. M. Hegger in this issue, as well as N. Kummer; B. Bielefeld; T. Brotrück in BA 2/07). Externally, the thin volumes resemble student scripts. In terms of content, they each provide a well-understandable introduction to the subject. The present volume conveys first knowledge on the design of residential buildings. The basics of living (life cycles, usage areas, room formation etc.), relationships between individual living areas (sleeping, working, cooking, traffic spaces etc.) and variants of building forms are dealt with. With numerous drawings, practical tips, normative references and literature references. In addition to the aforementioned target group, it is suitable for all building enthusiasts as a first step. A ekz-folio binding is recommended. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004744-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066772-8>

The Africa Boom : the great surprise of the 21st century ¤ The authors are predestined for the topic "Africa Boom" as economic journalists through their long-term correspondent activity in China and South Africa. The 8 chapters of the book have headings like "Africa's new middle class", "Energy supplier", "Infrastructure" or "The end of poverty". However, the topics often overlap, so that a targeted use of the diverse and also very current information is only possible through the (good) register and the clear map. A red thread of the book is the plea for "Upswing instead of pampering, investments instead of development aid", which China recognized and practiced with its African investments much earlier than the USA, the EU and Germany. The final chapter "The rise without the West" emphasizes the beginning cooperation of the BRICS countries, of which only one is located in Africa. And after Torsten Dennin: "Africa - Continent of Opportunities" (ID-G 22/13) and Christian Hiller from Gaertringen's "Africa is the new Asia" (ID-G 47/14) the boom in Africa is no longer "The great surprise".

Innovationsmanagement : from idea to successful product ¤ Innovations belong to the most important entrepreneurial, but also economic success factors. Under apparently equal initial conditions, some companies seem to have an exceptionally high innovation power and thus a higher success potential than many of their competitors over the years. The contributions of practitioners from various industries and companies are at the center of this book, who summarize their experiences - many of them focused on important individual aspects of innovation management - . In addition, conceptual overview contributions are made to various aspects of innovation management.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161817-8>
Theoretical Computer Science : with 22 Tables and 78 Exercises ¤ The author is known for a book on the fundamentals of technical computer science (BA 10/07). In the present book, he deals with theoretical computer science, the oldest branch of computer science, the conceptual foundation on which all other branches of computer science are built. The book explains the basics very clearly and conveys the knowledge that is necessary for a bachelor's degree in computer science at universities and universities of applied sciences. The presentation is practical; various methods and procedures are introduced using examples. Many exercise problems (with solutions on the internet - also numerous links to further information). Emphasis is placed on propositional logic, formal languages, finite automata, and computability and complexity theory. Very helpful is almost 30 pages glossary with extensive comments on individual terms. Comprehensive bibliography. In addition to the present work, R. Hollas (ID 29/07) is recommended (goes even further into theoretical foundations and proof theory). (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4196735-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003953-5>

Maschinenwinter : Knowledge, Technology, Socialism ; a Polemical Essay ¤ It is well known that it is not the machines that shut down machines, but people who build and use them. Therefore, it is no longer acceptable that machines increasingly worsen living conditions, although they were originally intended to improve them. Even in the richest countries, there is little to be seen of relief from life through technology: The creative computer consultant lives a biblical day laborer's existence; the high-tech doctor writes reports on the alms entitlement of sick beneficiaries; every modernization of production means mass layoffs instead of reduced working hours. But not even access to these relatively luxurious forms of misery is granted to the poorer regions; there everything is simply outsourced that cannot be done with Western wage earners for the time being. How can one storm the machines to take possession of them? Can one maintain modern division of labor, but get rid of the hierarchies, dependencies, and injustices that cling to it? What do industry, the wealth created by it, and the dirt thrown out by it have to do with freedom? The essay Maschinenwinter risks a literary, political, polemical, and speculative fantasy about how one could make history with technology	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038639-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059205-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4198902-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029577-1>

Office-Lexikon : Quick Guides from A - Z : [for PC and Mac ; for Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Entourage, Outlook] ¤ Rez.: The author is known for titles on various computer science topics (most recently, e.g., "Microsoft Office:mac 2004", BA 3/05) and offers here a reference work on individual Office programs for users who already master the basic functions of the programs. Word, Excel (about a third of the content) and PowerPoint are each treated for the PC and Macintosh versions, as well as the e-mail and communication software Outlook (PC) and Entourage (Macintosh) - all largely independent of the individual program versions. The chapters on the individual modules are alphabetically sorted, e.g., from "Absolute Reference" to "Cell Format", additionally accessible through a keyword index and containing working instructions and problem solutions for use in everyday office life. Written in a clear and understandable way, with numerous step-by-step instructions and numerous screen images. The topics are all included in the Office literature presented here so far. However, a direct comparison title is missing, which animates fixed reference - hence usable everywhere for further use. (2) (Elke Nibbrig)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4382024-4>

After his award-winning novel 'Swim Home', Rolf Lappert, the author from Switzerland, delivers another masterpiece of storytelling, which describes the peculiarities of life and opens up a fascinating foreign world. kno	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115775-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128227-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4221436-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053978-7>
Business-Software : ERP, CRM, EAI, E-Business ; an Introduction ¤ Where information technology (IT) is used to support business tasks, software is its essential design element. Initially, business software was only used to improve existing processes, but it has increasingly become an organizational design tool in recent years. This book provides an introduction to business software, particularly in ERP, CRM, EAI, and E-Business systems	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069386-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4592128-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120906-0>
An individual-centered approach to visualize people's opinions and demographic information ¤ The noble way to substantiate decisions that affect many people is to ask these people for their opinions. For governments that run whole countries, this means asking all citizens for their views to consider their situations and needs. Organizations such as Africa's Voices Foundation, who want to facilitate communication between decision-makers and citizens of a country, have difficulty mediating between these groups. To enable understanding, statements need to be summarized and visualized. Accomplishing these goals in a way that does justice to the citizens' voices and situations proves challenging. Standard charts do not help this cause as they fail to create empathy for the people behind their graphical abstractions. Furthermore, these charts do not create trust in the data they are representing as there is no way to see or navigate back to the underlying code and the original data. To fulfill these functions, visualizations would highly benefit from interactions to explore the displayed data, which standard charts often only limitedly provide. To help improve the understanding of people's voices, we developed and categorized 80 ideas for new visualizations, new interactions, and better connections between different charts, which we present in this report. From those ideas, we implemented 10 prototypes and two systems that integrate different visualizations. We show that this integration allows consistent appearance and behavior of visualizations. The visualizations all share the same main concept: representing each individual with a single dot. To realize this idea, we discuss technologies that efficiently allow the rendering of a large number of these dots. With these visualizations, direct interactions with representations of individuals are achievable by clicking on them or by dragging a selection around them. This direct interaction is only possible with a bidirectional connection from the visualization to the data it displays. We discuss different strategies for bidirectional mappings and the trade-offs involved. Having unified behavior across visualizations enhances exploration. For our prototypes, that includes grouping, filtering, highlighting, and coloring of dots. Our prototyping work was enabled by the development environment Lively4. We explain which parts of Lively4 facilitated our prototyping process. Finally, we evaluate our approach to domain problems and our developed visualization concepts. Our work provides inspiration and a starting point for visualization development in this domain. Our visualizations can improve communication between citizens and their government and motivate empathetic decisions. Our approach, combining low-level entities to create visualizations, provides value to an explorative and empathetic workflow. We show that the design space for visualizing this kind of data has a lot of potential and that it is possible to combine qualitative and quantitative approaches to data analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188417-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038459-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006292-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123037-1>
Life without Minimum Wage - Poor because of Work: Low-Paid Workers, Temporary Workers, and "Supplementers" Tell Their Stories ¤ In January 2007, chambermaid Antonia H. made headlines nationwide: 2.46 euros gross per hour she had earned as an employee of a cleaning company in a luxury hotel in Hamburg. Further research from recent times revealed that little has changed: low wages in hotels are no rarity. And this also applies to many other areas. In the ?low-wage reports? of the trade unions ver.di and NGG, more and more people report their experiences. Their stories show an authentic picture of the everyday life of ?low-paid workers? and ?supplementers? and their precarious working conditions	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170008-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002623-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4437731-9>
Russian Diary ¤ In the discussion about the state of modern Russia, about the question of whether the Putin regime is still democratic, the most striking statements came from Anna Politkovskaya ('Chechnya', BA 5/03). How the authorities reacted to the treacherous murder of the unyielding journalist, it impressively proves the correctness of many of her analyses. Posthumously, her diary has now appeared, containing entries from December 2003 to September 2005. Alongside still remembered events such as the tragedy of Beslan, there are infinitely many small details that, in total, make the desperate situation of the democrats in Russia vivid. Gagging and intimidation by the regime's henchmen, the divided opposition, and the largely apathetic population shape the image of a deeply unsettled society to this day. With increasing discontent, Anna Politkovskaya also registered the ignorance of the West, which, for economic benefits, gives up criticism of Putin. As an impressive time document: (2) (Dietmar Adam) The posthumously published diary entries of the murdered Russian journalist describe the desperate situation of the democratic opposition in a state that is increasingly taking on authoritarian features.

The Own God : On the Peace Potential and the Violence Potential of Religions ¤ All world religions are exposed to radical transformations at the beginning of the 21st century, all world religions as well as all cultural creations and symbols exist simultaneously next to each other and are mostly, detached from their temporal and spatial contexts, open to general availability, to fundamentalist or individual appropriations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121582-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003974-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049396-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186917-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020832-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224263-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4296178-6>
Moral in Times of Crisis ¤ Autobiographical overview of the outstanding representative of political psychoanalysis Horst-Eberhard Richter (born 1923) about his diverse engagement. Life balance, criticism of the decline of values in politics and economy, plea for the regeneration of morality and encouragement to resistance. (Dieter Altmeyer) Autobiographical overview of the well-known psychoanalyst (born 1923) about his professional and private engagement. Personal experiences and experiences are connected by the 'Father of the German Peace Movement' and author of 'The God Complex' (latest BA 4/01) with analytical reflections, so in his reports on his encounters with Brandt, Gorbachev, Sakharov, Mandela or Ustinov, so also in his statements on the nuclear threat, climate destruction, social injustice or the 'gambling evil' of banks, as he holds the boundless egoism, the lack of empathy and the general decline of values responsible for their common causes. He sees the only way out of the current crisis in the 'strengthening of a new moral sense of responsibility'. - The book can be read equally as a kind of life balance of the now 87-year-old outstanding representative of political psychoanalysis, as criticism of the decline of values in politics and economy, as plea for the regeneration of morality and as encouragement to resistance.

Oskar Leo Kaufmann : 69 Projects 2012–1996 ¤ This first monograph of the internationally active Vorarlberger architect Oskar Leo Kaufmann offers a very immediate insight into his work and is at the same time a unique book object. The unaltered competition contributions are shown in reverse chronological order, as well as - where the projects have been realized - photographs of the buildings. The focus is not on descriptive texts, but on the graphical representation and the details of the individual projects.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>
1941 - the year that does not pass: the seed of hatred in the Balkans ¤ Publisher's information: A unique narrative about one of the great tragedies of the 20th century. "A perfectly executed blend of personal memory and historical reflection. All those who read this book will, through Slavko Goldstein's profoundly humane gaze on the experience of horror, come to understand much for the first time." Timothy Snyder. In 1941, the Germans occupied the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and in Croatia, the fascist Ustaše took power. Slavko Goldstein, one of the most renowned intellectuals in former Yugoslavia, recounts these weeks and months that he himself experienced as a fourteen-year-old. He vividly describes the dynamics of violence on the Balkans, which was set in motion in 1941 when the Ustaše government murdered hundreds of thousands of people, primarily from the Serbian population. Goldstein describes the events day by day, week by week, recounts the fates of numerous people, whether perpetrators or victims, and tries to understand their motives without judging too quickly. The violence of 1941 shaped the region even after the war, when the perpetrators were secretly tried, but remained silent in public. The hatred finally unleashed itself again in unprecedented brutality in 1991. Slavko Goldstein makes this ominous cycle of violence, which is exemplary for many similar conflicts, immediately understandable. His narrative is driven by a profoundly humanistic attitude, which at the same time clearly shows that good and evil are inextricably linked in this tragedy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079167-1>
The Full-Day School : Everyday Life, Reform, History, Theory ¤ In the public discourse, there are numerous motivations for establishing full-day schools: one expects - after PISA - an overall performance increase in the school system, hopes for intensive care and support to strengthen the school and personal development of children who have a problematic family environment. One sees the possibility of pedagogical rhythmicization of the school and understands the full-day school as an important condition for the connection of family and profession. The opponents see the full-day school as an attack on the family connected with the attempt to totalize state education. The present book wants to depoliticize the educational policy discussion and promote current pedagogical school development. The various questions that arise in connection with the introduction of full-day schools are dealt with in various contributions in a constructive and critical manner. With the help of authentic examples, school leaders, teachers, parents, and not least school administrators can gain inspiration for their own school profiles and design concepts. The comparison with other European countries helps policymakers to advance the development and quality assurance of full-day schools in Germany. The arguments for and against full-day schools are discussed in the light of systematic and historical analyses and thus contribute to depoliticizing the often emotionally driven discourse on the introduction and design of full-day schools. With contributions from Christina Allemann-Ghionda, Albert Berger, Annette Brockötter, Konrad Fees, Herbert Fitzek, Thelma von Freymann, Marianne Hauth, Heinz-Jürgen Ipfling, Monika Köhne, Volker Ladenthin, Michael Ley, Harald Ludwig, Max Mangold, Andreas Messerli, Ottwilm Ottweiler, Jürgen Rekus, Uwe Sandfuchs, Christopher Winch and Rainer Winkel	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155947-2>
Theoretical Foundations of Social Work : a Textbook ¤ In the book, the theoretical foundations of social work are introduced in a comprehensible way. This discourse is not an academic self-purpose, but necessary to understand social work as a whole. In the book, the theoretical foundations of social work are introduced in a comprehensible way. The answers to six guiding questions show why social work needs theories, why there are so many different theory offers, how theories can be systematized, why the subject of social work is the central criterion for its theories, and what effects the theory discourses have, especially on the teaching and practice of social work. Through these answers, it becomes clear that dealing with the theories of social work is not an academic self-purpose, but a necessary discourse to understand social work as a whole. Stefan Borrmann, Prof. Dr. phil., born 1974, is Professor of International Social Work Research and Dean of the Faculty of Social Work at the University of Applied Sciences Landshut. His areas of focus are theories of social work, the science of social work, international aspects of social work, and youth and youth work.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055676-1>
Human Rights between Universality and Islamic Legitimacy ¤ Human rights are in a normative field of tension in contemporary Islamic discourse. On the one hand, they must be Islamically legitimized, that is, anchored in Islamic legal thought, on the other hand, they should also be universally consensual. Mahmoud Bassiouni develops in his book a new possibility to fulfill these two claims simultaneously, by conceiving human rights, based on the theory of Islamic legal purposes ("maqasid al-šari?a"), as institutions for the protection of fundamental human needs.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027743-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186918-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4409409-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035043-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074725-6>
Why There's Enough Money for Everyone ¤ Basic income, local currencies, negative interest rates: Stefan Mekiffer's radical new history of money shows how we will live and work in the future. Do 20 hours of work a week suffice? Is it more economical to share than to save? Yes, says young economist Stefan Mekiffer and speaks for a whole generation. We must move away from the idea of an economy that is instilled in us by economists; away from the image of a machine whose dials are turned by politics, to that of an organic system. Mekiffer shows us how we will live in the future - with basic income, local currencies and negative interest rates. To achieve this, we must however redefine the role of money: from an instrument that restricts us, to a means of freedom. A passionate plea for a new form of economics.

Bathrooms : plan, renovate, redesign ¤ Suggestions for the installation or redesign of a bathroom. First, it needs to be clarified whether one wants it brave or flippant, elegant or cheerful. Then comes the financing and planning with the craftsmen, not to forget the temperature control of the room and warm water. Checklists and tips for the right purchase are missing just as much as guidelines for safety in the bathroom for children, seniors, and people with disabilities. Finally, a wellness oasis is described. In this book, it is less about DIY work for DIYers, but about planning and cooperation with craftsmen. For DIYers, the book "Bathrooms self-build and modernize" (BA 8/03) is recommended. Whereby, for planning, this book should also be recommended to the DIYer.

Child Abuse : Recognize, Help, Prevent ¤ Deegener, who has been active in child and adolescent psychiatry in Homburg/Saar for many years, is one of the most important experts on the topic of "child abuse". His basic title is now in its 5th edition. Based on 21 typical questions and statements, the topic is approached in its entirety in a combination of factual and practical knowledge. A complete revision, however, cannot be recognized. The text is largely identical to the previous edition. Current developments (e.g. the scandal at the Odenwald School) are mentioned in addition. In addition to a few address changes (the sorting by postal codes instead of alphabet as in the previous edition is irritating at first glance) only the bibliography has been revised. Now titles up to 2009 are considered, some older literature is no longer listed. In public libraries, the 4th edition of the title, which is also suitable for laypeople, can be consumed. Furthermore, it is still valid: "good to read, understandable and scientifically sound" (BA 5/09). (1) (LK/WIT: Grote) Basic title on the topic of child abuse, which addresses parents and educators, teachers, doctors and psychologists and presents social causes, backgrounds, extent and forms of the phenomenon, but also shows possibilities of prevention and help.

Spionage unter Freunden : Partner Service Relationships and Western Intelligence of the Gehlen Organization and the BND ¤ Intelligence agencies, like the BND, cooperate to a limited extent and are equally curious about their partners and adversaries. The present representation illustrates this in the relationships of the BND to the partner services of the western neighbors of Germany between the 2nd World War and the end of the Cold War. - Review: The NSA investigation committee of the Bundestag has just presented its final report at the end of the legislative period. The topic is of interest. And already in 2002, E. Schmidt-Eenboom, a well-known publisher, called his history of the BND "Against Friend and Enemy". This topic is worked out in detail and with great care with regard to the specifics of partner relationships to Western services, together with co-authors from Austria and Denmark, using several case studies (Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Spain, Great Britain, France, Scandinavia, and the USA) for the time from the emergence of the infamous Organization Gehlen to the end of the Cold War. It becomes clear once again that the entire profession is more concerned with mistrust than trust and that, despite all alliance rhetoric, national interests and informant protection are at the top. No one wants to reveal their sources. Anyone who wants to deal with the history of Western intelligence or the BRD will not be able to avoid this book. 80 pages of appendix and register.

Paulus : History - Tradition - Faith ¤ He is loved and hated. His letters are studied and interpreted. Some consider him the founder of Christianity as an independent religion, some as a saint, others as a fanatic and misogynist. But who was Paul of Tarsus and what do his writings say to us today? This introduction wants to get closer to him with the help of questions and make his message more understandable.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059758-1>

Mathematics for Biologists ¤ Introductory textbook with formula collection on mathematics and statistics in the bachelor's and teacher training study of biology. Review (ekz): The increasingly quantitative working method of biology uses the statistical and analytical instruments of mathematics. Similar to A. Riede, Professor Horstmann has also converted his 2-semester introduction to mathematics for biologists into a textbook, which was first published in 2008. About half of the book is dedicated to statistics. The chapters on functions, differential and integral calculus repeat and expand the secondary school material from level II. In the current 2nd edition, the section on difference equations and the formula collection for looking up are new. Many examples refer to questions in the life sciences. In the tasks (solutions online), the reference is, however, sparse. Mathematical concepts are well structured and conveyed with biographical additions...(3)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037944-9>
Making Work Better : Positive Psychology for HR and Leadership ¤ Many companies are not doing well, economically and humanly considered. They are being under-led or poorly led, missing out on necessary change. Instead, fear and cynicism rule. "Making Work Better" enables you as a leader or HR responsible person to counteract this. With the help of Positive Psychology, you learn to make the best of organizations, what they can be: places of meaningful and profitable growth for people and organization.

Methods of Empirical Social Research ¤ Textbook with the focus of presentation on the attempt to mediate a connection between sociological theory and empirical social research. (LK/GÖ: Vetter) Introduced textbook (last ID-G 10/05), which focuses the presentation on the attempt to mediate a connection between sociological theory and empirical social research. For this edition, the subchapter "Critical Psychology" was removed, the chapter "Theory of Science" was reorganized and the part on "Content Analysis" was completely revised. Internet links were updated, cited data were rewritten and newer literature was incorporated. More detailed, but also more theoretical than Michael Häder: "Empirical Social Research" (here last BA 3/07), which conveys corresponding basic knowledge through numerous examples.

The Power at the Mediterranean : French Dreams of a Different Europe ¤ The plan seemed perfect: President Sarkozy wanted to win over his southern neighbors for a Mediterranean Union to establish a counterweight to German dominance in Europe. Angela Merkel knew how to prevent this. For Wolf Lepenies, this is no footnote in contemporary history. The French dream of power at the Mediterranean leads into the unconscious regions of European history. The rivalry between Germany and France draws on ideas and stereotypes that date back to the 18th century and provide political discussion material again today.

Circuit Simulation with SPICE: Experiments in the Virtual Electronics Laboratory ¤ The hobby electronics enthusiast is first introduced to the most important components; he is then introduced to working with the SPICE simulator Multisim. (Rita Weinheimer-Hartmann) With such software for simulating the behavior of electronic circuits (this is the modern way of developing and experimenting with circuits, and also of electronics tinkering) the user saves a lot of time (e.g. he does not have to solder) and money (expensive measuring instruments do not have to be purchased, nor can they be destroyed, nor can the required components). This is particularly of interest to the hobby electronics enthusiast, and that is why SPICE, which is actually more of a simulation program for professionals, is explained in a very understandable and practical way after some basic statements about the most important components, based on Multisim, a module that is available for free as a full version with a time limit. This booklet is highly recommended, in addition to an earlier book by the author (BA 6/08) in which he deals with virtual experimenting in a similar way.

Conflict Regulation and Peacekeeping in the International System ¤ The bloody collapse process of the former Yugoslav multi-ethnic state is a good example of the limitations of common explanation models for intra- and inter-state conflicts. In the prevention, management, and aftercare of this conflict, the international community has clearly failed, which ultimately led to a regional prolonged crisis that requires a peacekeeping engagement (KFOR) for the time being. Against this background, the authors analyze the possibilities of political peacekeeping in a very differentiated manner, taking into account the challenges of a future multipolar world system.

Network Management: Coordination of Professional Networks: Foundations and Practical Examples ¤ Vernetzung' and 'Network' are more than just modern buzzwords. Rather, both terms refer to a new organizational form for bundling collective strategies. Networks represent loosely linked value creation collectives, whose cooperative union is oriented towards mutual benefit. This textbook focuses on the special instruments and methods responsible for successful management of collaboration: Network management in the acquisition and social economy stands at the center. Under the guiding concept of 'network management', theory and practice are conveyed on how actor and organization networks are built and organized. In the form of practice reports, the art of management by practitioners is illustrated in various examples.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4245322-7>
Data Analysis with SAS: Statistical Procedures and Their Graphical Aspects ¤ The program package "Statistical Analysis System" developed around 40 years ago runs on all common operating systems for mainframe and PC computers. For this 3rd, completely updated edition of the work published in 2004, the current version 9.3 for Windows is now used as a basis. At a few places, subchapters have been added, otherwise the basic concept remained the same. "Initially, the authors provide a thorough introduction to the structures and operations of the system, where they place great emphasis on the graphical possibilities. Following a concise summary of the core areas of descriptive and inductive statistics, the main part presents a basic and at the same time practical representation of various procedures and applications using SAS. A reader should be familiar with the general mathematical foundations. In addition to students in higher semesters, this is particularly addressed to demanding users of statistical procedures in practice" (Wolfgang Grölz).

Theories of Revolution: An Introduction ¤ With the collapse of communism, not only did the victory of capitalism seem final, and any further thought of revolution seem obsolete - history itself seemed to have come to an end. However, with the increasingly apparent crises and excesses of current systems, politically in phenomena like "Occupy" or "Arabellion", literarily in texts like "The Coming Uprising" (see ID-B 6/11) or Hessel's "Indignez-vous!", the need and possibilities of radical political change are again being thought about in greater depth. Against this backdrop, the philosopher Grosser examines exemplary questions and problems of revolutionary theory through selected thinkers since the Enlightenment. Novelty, freedom, and violence are some of the conceptual reference points by which the author measures the positions of Rousseau and Marx over Bakunin, Fanon, and Zizek; others relate to the revolutionary subject and the relationship between planning and spontaneity. A systematic, concise, and accounting for the complexity of the subject introduction; current and widely applicable. - With bibliography and index.

Seven Molecules: The Chemical Elements and Life ¤ To say it right from the beginning - reading this book is simply fun! This already starts with the very cleverly chosen title, which makes a potential reader much more curious than, for example, a simple "Introduction to Biochemistry". The authors, who both describe themselves as "enthusiastic chemists", have done an excellent job of didactically bringing the chemical processes that take place in an organism to life in a fascinating way. They use such artistic names as "WaGluLe TyAtOhRe" for the molecules water, glucose, lecithin, tyrosine, ATP, oxyhem and retinal, as well as the verb "CREATE", which serves as a mnemonic aid for the 7 elements sulfur S, carbon C, hydrogen H, oxygen O, phosphorus P, iron Fe and nitrogen N. Throughout colorfully illustrated and equipped with numerous control questions. By J.-H. Fuhrhop, lastly 2 titles on chemistry for medical professionals (BA 8/89 and ID 31/89).

Web Hacking : Security Vulnerabilities in Web Applications - Solution Paths for Developers ; with Playground on the Internet ¤ Presentation of attack methods in web applications from the attacker's point of view. In addition, advice for programmers on how to avoid security vulnerabilities. (Klaus Barckow) Security issues play a significant role in web applications. Various attack scenarios are presented by P. Kraft (ID-G 45/12). An important textbook is W. Poguntke (ID-B 44/13), which deals in particular with cryptographic procedures. The author of the present book takes a somewhat different approach. He chooses the attacker's point of view and shows how effective hacking techniques really work and how effective protection against them is possible. He is known for a book that deals with secure work in social networks (ID-A 44/12). Readers of the book should have basic knowledge of PHP, as the author focuses on programming. Various attack methods are presented, mainly from the field of high-level hacking, including short code snippets. A playground is very helpful for understanding, where the reader can study developed attack methods and the effect of defense mechanisms. Briefly treated are low-level hacking techniques such as exploits and programming errors. (2) (Klaus Barckow)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113821-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011144-1>

Economic and Social History of Western Europe since 1945 ¤ The study book provides a brief and compact overview of the history of the economy and society, politics and culture of Western Europe since the Second World War. It discusses in comparative perspective commonalities and differences in the development of Western European societies. In doing so, it includes, in addition to classical fields of social history, newer topics such as environmental history, history of youth, as well as women's and gender history. The book is divided into three major sections: the years of hunger in the post-war period (1945-49), the breakthrough to mass consumption (1950-70) and the age of globalization (since 1970). In addition, long-term developments such as value change, secularization or Americanization are also addressed. (Publisher's text)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020588-5>
The Bombing War : Europe 1939 to 1945 ¤ Comprehensive depiction of the European air war 1940 to 1945, its doctrines, the air battles over England and Germany, and its evolution up to 'moral bombing' and the strategic bomber offensives in the final phase of the war from September 1944 onwards. Review: The literature on the bombing war 1939 to 1945 has become differentiated. While F. Taylor (2005) and A.C. Grayling (2007) dealt with the bombing war against Germany from a historical moral perspective, J. Friedrich (2002; 2003) and S. Burgdorff (2003) provided a historical depiction of the bombing war against the 3rd Reich, D. Sü (2011) characterized the sociological dimension of the air war societies of Germany and England (2011), and O. Lubrich (2007) reconstructed the subjective view of the air war from the published testimonies of foreign observers. Renowned British historian R. Overy (latest 2011) succeeds in providing a comprehensive, readable, and unbiased view not only of the main participants (Allies, German Reich) and a technique of war that, according to the author, was continuously pushed forward despite high costs and inefficiency. Very well suited, also alongside R.-D. Müller (2004). Notes, Literature, Register.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079167-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036571-2>

Nonviolent Communication : a Language of Life ¤ Nonviolent Communication : A Language of Life / by Marshall B. Rosenberg - Translated by Ingrid Holler - Without perhaps intending to, our words and the way we speak often result in hurt and suffering - for others and for ourselves as well. Nonviolent Communication helps us to listen more consciously and to give respectful attention to our counterpart. At the same time, we learn to express ourselves honestly and clearly. As a language of life, we can apply NVC in communication with all people, regardless of age, independent of their cultural or religious background in the most diverse situations. - With stories, experiences, and exemplary conversation situations, Marshall Rosenberg makes it clear in his book how complex communication problems can be solved with the help of NVC.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127802-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133262-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164814-6>

Defend Freedom: How We Can Win the Fight for an Open Society ¤ We are in a crisis of liberal democracy. The widespread fear of social decline, of a runaway globalization and uncontrolled immigration creates an aggressive mood. Trust in democratic institutions is falling, populist demagogues are gaining traction. What lies behind this revolt and how can we respond to it? These questions are addressed by the Green thinker Ralf Fücks in his book. He follows the long lines of opposition to liberal modernity and shows that retreating into a national fortress and abandoning an open society will lead to a dead end. In contrast, Fücks advocates for the renewal of the democratic republic: We need strong public institutions that secure social cohesion - and citizens who stand up for the same freedom for all. "This book is particularly recommended for those who are discouraged and resigned, also because it contains a to-do list at the end: Go to the polls, join a party, do not belittle democratic institutions, support critical journalism through newspaper subscriptions, support civil society organizations through donations, distrust simple solutions, defend the constitution, never justify violence. Freedom is defended by each individual" (deutschlandfunk.de). "In other passages, Fücks again emphasizes that a free society can only be defended if there is also social security for all and, in particular, more participation for workers. The green economic liberalism that Fücks proposes remains somewhat vague at the end. However, the Green thinker argues strongly when he presents the fight for open societies as a cultural confrontation, for example with Islam. Fücks does not confuse Islam with Islamism, unlike many right-wing populists. However, he makes it clear that all religions - and especially radical currents - must remain equally criticizable" (ndr.de)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033203-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123879-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132695-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011413-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135889-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018326-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129521-3>

Forest Soil Condition Report for Saxony-Anhalt: Results of the Second Soil Condition Survey in the Forest (BZE II) ¤ The forest soil condition survey (BZE) provides a comprehensive picture of the current state of forest soils and their changes over time. The BZE in Saxony-Anhalt is based on a grid network with a total of 76 sampling points. BZE I (1992-1994) showed clearly critical conditions of forest soils, especially due to atmospheric inputs. The repeated inventory (BZE II, 2006-2008) now provides insight into changes in forest soils against the background of decreasing acid and fly ash inputs and continued increased nitrogen inputs. In addition to the detailed analysis of chemical properties of various forest soils – from unleached sands in the lowland, loess loams in the hilly country and bedrocks in the Harz – the focus is on carbon and nitrogen storage, as well as results on tree nutrition, forest vegetation and intensive monitoring. The forest soil condition report for Saxony-Anhalt provides important decision-making bases for science, practice and politics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132325-7>

Das Drupal-6-Kochbuch : [New features in Drupal 6; Working with modules, themes, and templates; Drupal as a PHP framework; on DVD: Drupal 6] ¤ Drupal is establishing itself alongside Mambo/Joomla and Typo3 as a free PHP-based content management system. The author presents the system in an application- and project-related manner. All relevant topics for an entry are treated: general (in this context not necessarily necessary) considerations for project management and CMS in general, Drupal's core with user administration, profiles, etc., administration, practical use, themes, and the use of Drupal as a framework. One notices that the author is a personal advocate of Drupal - he also maintains a blog on the subject - and learns many details that can be inferred from his experience with the technology. What is lacking somewhat is the abstraction from the individual case and thus the systematic presentation. Compounding this is a somewhat unclean language that is sometimes unnecessarily difficult to understand. Overall, however, a good introduction for more technically interested users. Extensive appendix. On DVD: Drupal 6 and contents of the book. (3)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7614080-5>
Psychomotoric Adventure Games for Kindergarten, School and Movement Therapy: A Practical Book ¤ The psychomotoric adventure games presented in this book combine role-playing, movement games and cognitive and language development. Such movement offers serve better communication and affect the development of social behavior such as tolerance, acceptance and mutual consideration. In these arranged psychomotoric scenarios, which generate high motivation, fun, joy and engagement in children and animate them to connected action, the authors see the best opportunity for holistic development promotion in children. Furthermore, the question is pursued, which every practitioner has asked himself several times: How can the psychomotoric promotion units be designed so that the clients can perceive the psychomotoric promotion until the end of the recommended time gladly, motivated and engaged and actively participate in it? The authors represent the view that individual behavior, needs, habits and talents of the client play a decisive role for the success or failure of the promotion/therapy. Therefore, it is important to analyze the personality of the client when planning the psychomotoric promotion offers and to involve them in the promotion hours if necessary. Psychomotoric scenarios must therefore be designed so that the clients can gladly enter the optimal promotion and become active and creative in the process. Movement landscapes in adventurous scenarios have the advantage of promoting all psychomotoric competences (the I-competence, the thing-competence and the social-competence) as a basis for sensoric-cognitive processing processes auto poietically in a natural child-centered way. These and similar topics are treated in a practical way. The authors come to surprising conclusions that can change the view on psychomotoric practice.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006323-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077704-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055542-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176239-3>
Cardinals, Artists, Courtesans: True Stories from Papal Rome ¤ The 19 true stories collected in this volume reflect the public and private life in Rome during the Renaissance and Baroque periods: They deal with great politics, power struggles between German emperors, French kings, and the Pope amidst political intrigue, cardinal intrigues, and the will to make oneself immortal through monuments and buildings. They tell of family conflicts of the great people, of the lives of artists, culture, and the world of the common man, of the role of a world city with the population of a small town, where there were almost more ruins than evidence of 2,000 years of history, as people lived and lived in them. The narrators are a historian from the University of Fribourg (Switzerland), an expert on Italy in the 15th to 18th centuries (BA 1/91, 12/99, 5/02, 6/03) and an art historian from the Humboldt University of Berlin, who writes for "Damals"; an effective mix for the benefit and enjoyment of the reader, who is well informed and educated.

Review: Electromobility offers great opportunities for energy efficiency and environmental protection, but at the same time presents a great challenge for society, politics, and technology. Werner Klement devotes himself to the last point with an overview of hybrid technology in the automotive sector. Typical hybrid vehicles have a combustion and an electric motor. This combination poses special requirements on the transmission. The author takes an overarching view for his representation, without losing the practical reference. He considers the overall system and refrains from technical details on individual components. This way, fundamentals are conveyed that are becoming increasingly important for students of mechanical engineering and engineers in vehicle development. Online solutions are offered for the exercise tasks. A current topic with stronger professional specialization than by Robert Schoblick (2013) and broad potential for influence in the future	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160835-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153580-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7524499-8>

Technical Documentation: Standards for Technical Product Documentation and Document Management ¤ The requirements for technical documentation are constantly growing. Liability aspects play a role here just as much as traceability, reproducibility, and data exchange. This specially designed collection of standards (original texts) for technical editors, designers, product managers, university lecturers, and experts provides all the structural elements needed for the construction and maintenance of a technical product documentation: documentation methodology (structure, changes, release, tamper-proofing) // document management (metadata) // user and operating instructions // product life cycle // representation of three-dimensional CAD models // classification and labeling of documents // copyright notice // writings // terms (CAD models, drawings, bills of materials) // drawing templates // text fields.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252279-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157139-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4303691-0>
Modern Nutrition Myths : what's behind: Sugar makes you sick, Eggs increase the Cholesterol level, Diets make you slim ¤ With the seal of the German Society for Nutrition Medicine and Dietetics e.V., 3 specialist journalists subject many common nutrition dogmas to a TÜV. Claims such as "Sugar causes diabetes!", "Ready meals or deep-frozen food contain no vitamins", "To lose weight, you have to starve", "Supplements are unnecessary", "Gummies transmit BSE", "Whole food is always healthy", "There is a cancer diet" or "Eggs increase the cholesterol level" are all sent to the realm of myths, prejudices, half-truths or conscious manipulation - and this is done very seriously and always scientifically proven. Conclusion of the authors: There are no foods that are healthy or unhealthy on their own; it's all about eating as varied as possible and, in addition, taking care of physical and mental fitness. - The easily understandable guidebook has many parallels to U. Pollmer's "Lexicon of popular nutrition misconceptions" (BA 1/01) and is recommended as a complement to the current Pummelalarm titles from S. Fröhlich's "Moppel-Ich" (BA 6/04) to R. Künast's "Dickmachern" (BA 11/04). (2) (Uwe-Friedrich Obsen)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4340678-6>
For a Better Life: The EU Invests in People with the Help of the European Social Fund ¤ What does the EU actually do for its citizens? The European Social Fund (ESF) is one of the answers to this question, as it invests every year in around ten million people in all 27 member states. This book tells the story of 54 people (two per member state) who have taken advantage of the opportunities offered by initiatives financed by ESF funds. Women and men of all age groups (from young people to pensioners) were questioned in urban and rural communities in all EU countries.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055879-4>
Handbook of Crime Literature: Theories - History - Media ¤ The handbook provides a systematic, theory-guided, and historically founded overview of crime literature for the first time. Both literary scientific concepts from genre reflection to space theories are taken into account as well as theories of the crime novel and poetological approaches. Essential aspects such as paranoia, confession, or riddles and central figures of the genre are taken into consideration. Another focus is on the literary history of German-speaking crime literature since its beginnings in the 17th century. The handbook concludes with contributions to the crime in film, television, radio play, comic, and digital media	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165739-1>

Leading Oneself and Others: Shaping Change in Libraries ¤ Good leadership starts with oneself, whether as a leader in libraries or in an informal setting. If one wants to lead other people, one should first know and lead oneself. The book provides the right tools for this, promoting knowledge of one's own person and the determination of one's own goals. "It is a book that can be recommended not only to beginners. Even the experienced practitioner, the experienced leader finds in the book important and useful tips, instructions for action and above all reflection possibilities related to one's own actions."

Frankenstein and Belle de Jour : 30 Film Characters and Their Psychological Disorders ¤ Does an autistic person behave like Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man? And do patients in psychiatric clinics possibly spring straight from the silence of the lambs? 30 well-known film characters on the couch, interpreted by people in the field: psychologists/psychotherapists mostly (e.g. Eva Jaeggi, F. Pfäfflin, U. Rauchfleisch). Strictly along the ICD-10, the International Classification of Mental Disorders, enriched with film posters and scene photos, the experts have analyzed the film actions and characters in how far they correctly depict the disease picture. E.g. the antisocial Hannibal Lecter, the compulsive Professor Rath from the "Blue Angel", Truman Capote as an obsessive person with narcissistic personality disorder, Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of the autistic person in "Rain Man" or - quite current - the theme of pedophilia in Fritz Lang's classic "M". The strict scientific approach does not disturb, as the contributors are film fans with engagement in the matter. For cinephiles a discovery, psychological laymen get here disorder pictures in a new garb celebrated, and the professionals can critically work through the analyses of their colleagues.- In the context of "Cinema in the Head" (ID 48/06) and "Interworlds" (ID 19/08).

Handball: History of a German Sport ¤ Erik Eggers, former handball player, sports historian, and freelance journalist, first published this comprehensive work in 2004 (BA 8/07). It is now available in a revised and updated edition. This comprehensive handball history spans from the beginnings in Germany around the mid-19th century to the present day, repeatedly interrupted by portraits of great player personalities, the most successful German teams, as well as the most important trainers and officials. The book has been revised in terms of content, equipped with a new attractive layout and predominantly with color photographs, and, including the statistics section, brought up to date (2013). Still unmatched and most comprehensive reference work on the history of handball. Good price-performance ratio. Recommended for all libraries with an expanded sports collection before Erhard Wunderlich's chronicle (BA 12/06).

Controlling for Business: A Guide and Toolbox for Practice ¤ Too few companies consider controlling as a management task in good times. Especially in small and medium-sized enterprises, controlling is strongly neglected. But the rapidly changing market conditions, such as changes in demand and new competitors, or internal factors in the company (e.g. high burdens due to interest and repayments) force entrepreneurs to plan more precisely and to set the course for tomorrow - precisely through controlling. Based on his many years of experience as a controller, the author presents a roadmap for the introduction of a functional controlling in a company. At the same time, the most important scientific innovations in controlling are also taken into account. &nbsp; TOC:Why Controlling.- Creating transparency in day-to-day business.- Financial controlling.- Investment and project controlling.- Creating transparency for the future.- Typical controlling projects	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070102-5>

Mythos Cyberwar : about digital espionage, sabotage and other dangers ¤ We have learned to fear the Cyberwar: For decades, Hollywood has fed us images of dark powers that, with the help of secret and highly complex computer networks, blackmail states and detonate nuclear warheads. The myth of the cyber war has sunk deep into our worldview. Politics and the military are making use of this fear. It's high time to ask: Does the cyber war really exist? The political scientist Thomas Rid is sure: The cyber war does not take place. The documented cyber attacks cannot be described as a war, because the targeted violence against humans, the brutal destruction, which is inextricably linked with the idea of war, is missing. We cannot relax yet, however. Because Thomas Rid also makes it clear that real dangers such as espionage, sabotage, and subversion can indeed threaten from cyberspace. He tells in detail and knowledgeably about espionage attacks, sabotage acts, and attempts to destabilize governments and trigger revolutions using information technology. However, these are not military actions for Rid, and it's about more than just rhetorical disarmament: We must understand who profits from the myth of Cyberwar. And we must define the real dangers we are exposed to, in order to be well prepared to meet the security requirements. "A strength of his work on the 'Mythos Cyberwar' lies in the variety of examples of cyber attacks and their analysis. Not every one of Rid's conclusions may be desirable to follow, to be sufficiently proven or plausible, but the value of this book also lies in the fact that the author knows how to move between different worlds: computer science, political science, technology history" (deutschlandfunk.de)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4051131-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056287-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4461975-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4817534-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1075612675> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131194-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308416-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213485-7>

From Classical Physics to Quantum Physics: A Historically-Critical Deductive Derivation with Applications from Solid-State Physics ¤ This book takes a new approach from Classical to Quantum Physics. After describing Euler's and Helmholtz's representations of Classical Mechanics, the Schrödinger equation is derived without making any additional assumptions about the nature of quantum mechanical systems. Emphasis is placed on the similarities between Classical and Quantum Mechanics, and four fundamental problems of quantization named by Schrödinger are solved. The historical literature is referred to in detail. This book is not only addressed to students and scientists, but also to school teachers: It contains many details that are no longer included in modern representations of Classical Mechanics, but are important for understanding Quantum Physics.

Dimensions of Complicity: European Collaboration with the Third Reich ¤ That, despite being one of the most thoroughly researched periods in world history, nearly 75 years after the end of World War II, a comprehensive representation of European collaboration with the Third Reich was still lacking, can be considered a major, if not the greatest, desideratum for this historical complex. Klaus Kellmann has taken on the sensitive task, and he does not limit himself to individual analyses of all 24 states that were subjected to German terror rule until 1944/45. In the final chapter 'European Memory and European Identity', he brings his research findings into the design of Europe of Tomorrow: Without thorough examination and verification of collaboration with the Third Reich, there will be no common European narrative and no shared European culture of remembrance - that great project, with which the field of history will be centrally and decisively engaged on the Old Continent in the coming years and decades.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041316-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031748-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013021-6>

Home, Smart Home : the practical introduction to home automation ¤ A very structured overview of the Smart Home (home automation) topic: network-enabled devices and home entertainment, integration into the home network and control. A successful mix of theory and practice in a very relaxed and concise writing style. Review: If the door opens automatically, the light turns on, and the heating is already turned up, then the dream of home automation has come true thanks to wireless networking with Smart Home. The topic is relatively difficult to research for beginners, so this book serves as a good guide. The book provides - after an introduction, use cases, and first steps - an independent overview of what is available on the market. Even voice assistant control is briefly touched upon - however, a lot has happened in this field in the last half year, and this book is no longer up to date. If you don't want to read every chapter, the summary at the end of a chapter often suffices. Helpful: The book's structure is color-coded; QR codes in the book refer to the internet, where you can find further information on the topic. Corresponding checklists support the selection (in the blue chapter: Smart Home systems and providers compared) in the selection. Whether you like the consistent use of 'du' is not evaluated here.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113858-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162962-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4204356-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003957-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113651-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4216130-7>
Nowhere Welcome : On Poverty Migration from Central and Southeastern Europe to the EU-15 Countries with Special Consideration of Roma Minority Members ¤ Everywhere in Western Europe, not only in Germany, the poverty migration of mainly Sinti and Roma has become a widely discussed problem. This book by Max Matter succeeds in bridging the gap from scientific discussion to everyday life in the community: indispensable for all who want to make responsible and correct information for Roma policy. Poverty and misery of this group are often not free from racist attributions. Despite all differences, the negative attitudes connect the Roma - similar to the Jews, who were forced together by murderous antisemitism. This volume provides factual foundations for a discussion on sociopolitical tasks and political decisions to improve the inclusion and participation of Sinti and Roma in Germany.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4198721-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002963-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050473-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013960-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076527-1>

The High Line : the green vein of New York ¤ In this photo book, planning, development, maintenance of the facility, as well as the background of the project "High Line" are presented. On the over 3 km long area of a former freight rail track in New York, the famous landmark has been created, which was opened as a park in 2014. After the introduction of a co-founder of the project, in an essay the basics and prerequisites of modern landscape design in the urban space are discussed, which made the creation of the modern facility possible. In the main part, the individual garden areas are presented from south to north using a map, which are characterized by different design and planting. In addition, chapters on the maintenance of the facility and seasonal aspects are included.

The Remnants: How Refugees Have Changed Germany Over the Past 20 Years ¤ In 2015, German authorities counted 1,091,894 arriving refugees. The number of xenophobic and racist attacks reached a record high, yet numerous welcome initiatives emerged. Journalist Christian Jakob describes how deeply civil society and institutions in Germany have changed since the so-called asylum compromise of 1993. This is also the work of the refugees themselves. With decades-long protests, they have broken through their isolation in asylum seeker homes and driven the necessary modernization of Germany into an immigration country. From his years-long engagement with the topics of migration and asylum, Christian Jakob shows how a German and European refugee policy would look like, which finally accepts the reality of migration. For Jakob: Whoever wants to close access to this country again will fail. "The editor of the daily newspaper 'TAZ' succeeds in summarizing asylum policy over the past 20 years in a compact image. It reminds us of still familiar names and events and the courage of those persistent among asylum seekers who tried to claim their rights. Furthermore, it documents an astonishing change in attitudes in German society towards strangers" (deutschlandradiokultur.de)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017604-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4199676-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079262-6>
Agile Learning : new Roles, Competencies and Methods in the Corporate Context ¤ In light of the rapid technological progress, education or studies are no longer sufficient for a whole career. Employees must continuously further their education. Corporate learning will be flexible, individual, time- and work-place-oriented, and agile, as needed. This book presents future-proof learning formats and a definition of the new roles of personnel developers, executives, and employees.

Critique of Life Forms ¤ Can life forms be criticized? Can we say that life forms are good, successful, or even rational? The political order of the liberal constitutional state understands itself as an attempt to shape social coexistence in a way that is neutral or 'ethically abstinent' towards the different life forms. As a result, questions about the way we individually or collectively lead our lives are outsourced to the area of non-further-questionable preferences or as un-avoidable thought questions of identity. Just as with taste, we can no longer argue about life forms. However, Rahel Jaeggi claims: We can argue about life forms with reasons. Life forms are directed towards the solution of problems as ensembles of social practices. They find their yardstick 'in the matter' of the problem	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034863-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055876-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015602-3>

Gods, Heroes, Philosophers: History and Culture of the Ancient Greeks ¤ The concept of Greek history and culture is treated here in a broad sense. So the bow spans from the late Stone and early Bronze Age (Cycladic culture, Minoan culture) to the conquest of Byzantium by the Ottomans (1453). Nevertheless, this comprehensive view, which can not fall too detailed, focuses on the time of Greek Classicism and offers, in addition to the chronological overview, mainly interesting information about religion, architecture, society, and everyday life around 500 BC. Enriched with numerous good photos (black and white and color), reconstruction drawings, and maps, the book by two renowned historians and archaeologists provides a very good 1st entry into the subject.

How Can Germany Become Climate-Neutral? : Options for Technology Upgrade, Consumption Reduction, and Carbon Management : Position Paper ¤ For a climate-neutral energy supply, Germany must expand technologies and infrastructure: it needs more renewable energies, heat pumps, electromobility, power and hydrogen networks. However, achieving climate neutrality will not be enough on its own. How Germany can become climate-neutral has been investigated by experts of the ESYS Academy Project. The focus of their consideration lies on the following areas: What importance does consumption reduction have for achieving climate goals? What contribution can an accelerated technology boost make to achieving the goals? Under what circumstances would a climate-neutral energy supply be possible before 2045? With what measures could a climate-neutral industrial production and sustainable consumption be designed? What importance do negative emissions have in these strategies? The position paper shows: For the upcoming system transformation, ambitious measures are necessary in all these areas, because only in this way can successes in individual areas compensate for failures in others. In 22 action options, the ESYS experts show how this change can succeed. As a basis for the discussion, model calculations and a systematic evaluation of existing energy scenarios were used. The ESYS analysis \	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055572-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068598-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057952-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079329-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1210494086> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1233691872>
Der Brockhaus Astronomie : Planets, Stars, Galaxies ¤ The new standard work for amateur astronomers. 3,300 entries contain all important information on astronomy, famous astronomers, and spaceflight achievements. 500 illustrations, including specially prepared graphics of the most important star charts, in which the individual star brightness is also indicated. There are numerous general introductions to astronomy at all levels, with the market being significantly narrower for lexicons. So, the Brockhaus Astronomy closes the broad gap between the very popular "Dictionary of Astronomy" (H.-U. Keller: BA 5/05) as the first reference work and the 6,000 term explaining "ABC Lexicon of Astronomy" (BA 1/97) for a scientifically pre-trained audience (Spectrum; BA 1/97). Approximately 3,300 entries, accompanied by 12 special articles, many information boxes, tables, and instructive color graphics, offers the present reference work, which, compared to the Brockhaus Encyclopedia (20th edition: from BA 5/97) and the 3-volume "Brockhaus Natural Sciences and Technology" (BA 1/03), contains significantly more extensive biographical and subject articles. These are clearly organized and partially already very helpful for student presentations. - Library-worthy title, to be acquired for smaller collections if possible.

Cultivated Plants: Botany - History - Perspectives ¤ The nine most important cultivated plants, their botanical basics, the origin of the cultivated form, the history of their products, and sociocultural impacts on humanity. (Hans-Ulrich Struck) Already in his book "Foundations of Plant Breeding" (ID-B 7/11), the professor at the University of Hohenheim has proven that he can convey specialized knowledge in an entertaining and understandable way. Here, he presents the 9 most important cultivated plants: wheat, rye, barley, oats, triticale, maize, rapeseed, sugar beets, and potatoes. From wild plants that yielded little, high-yielding food was produced through breeding. Miedaner describes not only the botanical basics and the origin of the cultivated form, but also sociocultural impacts on humanity. Thus, the French Revolution was triggered by a lack of bread, potatoes enabled industrialization, and maize led to the impoverishment of entire Italian regions. Also, the history of products such as bread, beer, whiskey, muesli, sugar, cooking oil, cornflakes, fries, and chips is presented in an entertaining way. Finally, stimuli for discussion on genetic engineering, bioenergy, and agricultural trade are given. With this comprehensive orientation, already interesting for secondary school level II.

Human Biology ¤ A multi-faceted and colorful introduction to human biology with a focus on evolution, ecology, culture, health, social and sexual behavior. For students in the main and secondary subjects. (Oliver Mitesser) By combining their respective specialist areas, three university professors achieve a rich and colorful textbook that covers both the microscopic and macroscopic views of the structures and processes of human life. The focus is on evolution, ecology, culture, health, social and sexual behavior. In addition to students in the main and secondary subjects, the title also addresses students in secondary education II and interested laypeople. Marginal notes facilitate learning, infoboxes provide background knowledge and relativize some prejudices from the human behavior repertoire. While "Human Biology compact" (BA 3/10) strongly focuses on anatomical aspects in a similar target group, it is mainly development and behavior that structure the book and provide special reading pleasure. With current research results, such as Neanderthal DNA in the human genome (see also ID-A 15/14), a content advantage also arises compared to publications that are only a few years old.

Excel 2010 for Dummies : [at a glance: create and safely edit worksheets ; sort, analyze, and present data ; enhance tables and conjure up diagrams ; make life easier with formulas] ¤ Review: In the introduced series, the author, known for numerous publications on the spreadsheet calculation Excel, presents the necessary basic knowledge for the new version Excel 2010 (further programs of the Office package within this series see in this issue). Both the structure and the majority of the text are based on the predecessor to Excel 2007 (BA 9/07). At a few places where innovations come into play (e.g. Sparklines, screenshot integration, Web App) or the terminology has changed (e.g. menu bar instead of multifunctional toolbar), the text has been revised and updated. The numerous illustrations have also been replaced to a large extent. If there are deviations due to different operating systems (XP, Vista, Windows 7), this is explicitly addressed. Beginners also receive a competent guide to the widely used program with this introduction from the popular series. For many libraries for updating the holdings after Rainer Schwabe (BA 10/10).

The new version CS5 holds moderate innovations ready, which are however explicitly not pointed out in the book. The layout and structure remain unchanged and large parts of the text were adopted, illustrations were partially replaced.

Computerlexikon für Dummies : [the colorful IT world explained in a comprehensible way ; where is the "Any Key" actually? ; computer knowledge from A like Account to Z like zip ; over 2000 terms explained in a comprehensible way ; now with Windows Vista and current technologies] ¤ Alphabetical reference work on the most important terms and abbreviations of the computer age. (LK/M: Zimmermann) Current reference works on computer terms and abbreviations belong in every library collection, whether the corresponding title of the popular "Dummies" series should be added is a matter of taste. Sometimes the selection of terms appears somewhat arbitrary and occasionally also unnecessary (e.g. the keywords Eclipse, Knoppix or MySQL are missing while end users, end paper or spaces do not necessarily require explanation), it is worth noting positively that the explanations are absolutely accessible and layman-friendly and, as expected from the series, often amusing to read. Overall less a title for targeted look-up than for entertaining reading with the side effect of having the most important computer technical vocabulary at hand. It was updated throughout at approximately the same scope as the previous edition 2002 (which should be discontinued soon) and the last edition shown here 2000 (BA 2/01) should be replaced.

Psychology of Spirituality: Handbook; with E-Book inside ¤ In people's lives, institutionalized religiosity, especially belonging to large churches, loses importance – but interest in individually experienced spirituality is growing. That's why it's becoming a topic in psychology as well. In recent years, science has devoted itself more and more to the research of spirituality. Anton Bucher provides a comprehensive overview of the topic: What is spirituality, why is it important, how does it develop, and what effects does it have? The explanations are consistently supported by empirical findings and are illustrated by numerous experience examples. A focus is on spirituality in psychotherapy. Spiritual therapy forms, spiritual elements in established psychotherapies, and spirituality and positive psychology are also highlighted. Based on a 2004 highly sought-after lecture that was also published as a handbook, the theology professor at the University of Salzburg questions the importance and genesis of the concept of spirituality and its relationship to religion. The attached bibliography, which mostly includes titles published after 2005, shows that research on the topic has exploded. For many, spirituality is the alternative to institutionalized religion, which opens up new perspectives on the brain and the cosmos. After locating the concept in the context of recent history and antiquity, pre-psychological stage models (Hinduism), stages of consciousness according to Ken Wilber, structural-genetic models of religious-spiritual development, and the handling of spirituality in individual life phases are analyzed. Subsequently, the impact on mental health, happiness and well-being, stress reduction, and use in hospital care is discussed. A comprehensive inventory that distinguishes itself from esotericism.

The Betrayed Generation : What We Demand of Women in Midlife ¤ The women of birth years 1955 to 1970 - the Baby Boomers - started as the first female generation in Germany with a good education and a lot of enthusiasm in a life that promised them equal opportunities and rights like men. Today, good thirty years later, the balance is far from positive for everyone. The careers of many of these women ended abruptly when they had children. Subsequently, they had a significantly more difficult access to the labor market - and after a divorce, they bore the financial responsibility for themselves and the half-grown children. Today, hundreds of thousands of these women are facing old-age poverty. Christina Bylow and Kristina Vaillant write about the discrimination of Baby Boomer women in a society that is geared towards sexiness, about pension injustice, the alienation between men and women - and about what this female generation has achieved nonetheless. "First, women should study, then stay at home, keyword: Spousal Splitting. If there are children, it often can't be done otherwise, because there is no daycare place. If the money of the male main or sole breadwinner is not enough, a part-time job must be found. And if divorce threatens, the then single parent is often stuck in the Hartz IV trap. And in old age in the misery of poverty: Over 40 percent of those affected in the West have to reckon with a statutory pension of under 600 euros. In the East women, it's only 20 percent - due to long-term employment. Everything is correct, everything is thoroughly researched and everything is precisely documented. With studies, expert opinions and explanations, with case examples and many numbers. Bylow and Vaillant present a stocktaking, a kind of women's canon, which should be on the shelves of many members of the German Bundestag. But: Will they order and read the book? Questionable. Not only women around 50 have adjusted themselves" (taz)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002963-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124931-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050129-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018202-2>

Reform Pedagogy: A Critical History of Dogma ¤ Reform pedagogy has once again become an important point of reference in the educational policy and pedagogical discussion. It is used as a quarry of ideas for today's needs of school and education practice. In such a concise manner, one can only falsely and incomprehensibly adopt a historical legacy. In order to ensure familiarity with their ideas and possibilities for today's problem-solving, a thorough engagement is required with both the prehistory of what we call 'reform pedagogy' and its consequences. Reform pedagogy can, of course, not be described. The author refrains from unitary conceptions, does not work with fixed time limits, and does not depict any 'movements' either. The composition starts from concepts and models of pedagogy and refers to discourses that are reconstructed in their theoretical content. It presents reform pedagogy as an ensemble of approaches, experiments, and more or less popular reflections, from which the theory problem does not emerge smoothly, but must be reconstructed. In doing so, both continuity and discontinuity were taken into account, so that an inheritance is not taken up that did not exist at all.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115719-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138031-9>
Relaxation Techniques : the Practical Handbook ¤ The often demanding daily work routine leads to stress and tension in us, we suffer from asthma, diabetes or sleep disorders, our children struggle with headaches and neurodermatitis, the dentist visit is a horror trip every time.

Asked and at the same time demanded in a historical turning point, which also does not hold back in front of the traditional school system. The answer: Montessori-, Freinet-, Waldorf pedagogy, foundations of free schools both in the new federal states as well as generally in Central Europe. These pedagogies have developed over decades and are experiencing a stormy demand. Their concepts and practices are presented in this book thoroughly and in a variety of ways: What distinguishes and connects Montessori-, Freinet- and Waldorf pedagogy? What is the 'polarization of attention' at Montessori, how does Freinet pedagogy liberate children from their emotional difficulties, how does Waldorf pedagogy convey mathematics and environmental education?

Perl : Fundamentals, Advanced Techniques, Exercises ; [Operators, Functions, Regular Expressions, Hashes, References ; User Interfaces, Persistence, CGI Programming, AJAX ; Exercises with Pattern Solutions for each Chapter] ¤ Perl is a free, platform-independent programming language. Perl is used today not only in system and network administration, but often also in the development of web applications. The author is known for a comprehensive introduction to Perl 5.6 (BA 11/02). In the present book, he devotes himself to the current version 5.8.8, but often also uses Perl 6-compatible modules (the next version Perl 6 is already in development). The book is based on lectures at the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences. Extensive prior knowledge is not expected; however, experience with a higher programming language is very helpful when reading. Fundamentals of Perl are briefly summarized. Based on this, selected Perl concepts are explained and shown what can be done with them. This results in a collection of solutions to typical problem statements that the reader can easily generalize for their own applications. Summaries of the individual chapters. Many examples and exercises. Interesting alternative to J. Schröter (BA 9/07). (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4307836-9>
Everyday Nutrition in Transition: Opportunities for Sustainability ¤ The present book examines everyday nutrition practices of Austrians from a sociological perspective with the aim of making visible potentials for sustainable development in nutrition. Sustainability is a development concept that is directed towards the long-term, dynamic self-preservation of societies in ecological, economic, and social terms. How can societies shape their relationship with nature so that future generations can find functioning ecosystems? How can societies be made more just and large social and economic differences be reduced? How can current societies be brought into a relationship with the natural living spaces in a globally networked economy, so that a dynamic interaction of all systems is possible in the long term? These are just some of the questions addressed by sustainable development. Even in the food system, the question of sustainable development is of high relevance. How food is produced, processed, traded, consumed, and disposed of has ecological, social, economic, and health impacts. The entire food chain is facing the challenge of sustainability (Brunner/Schönberger 2005). In this book, the focus is primarily on the consumption side of the food system, on everyday nutrition practices of people. Previous studies have mainly focused on agricultural production and the ecological dimensions of sustainability. Food consumption and everyday nutrition have been underrepresented so far. Sustainability concepts were largely appeal-oriented and normative-ecological, they have excluded social contexts, the possibilities and restrictions of human action, and underestimated the implementation problems of sustainability requirements.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136846-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015332-0>
Excel 2019 : All-in-One for Dummies ¤ Already this year, the author has published a Dummies guide to Excel 2019. The present book consists, like its predecessor, of 8 "books", which, however, seem to have been completely revised after comparing the contents lists. The comparison of both Dummies guides shows that there are some overlaps, but the present one deals with many individual topics to a greater extent. This book also presents itself in the new Dummies layout, but the smaller font is still not an advantage. Screenshots and illustrations support the instructions. This edition has 52 more pages, but it is still cheaper than the predecessor. It is also practical as a reference work. Libraries with a tight budget could just as well decide on Helmut Vonhoegen: "Comprehensive Handbook to Excel 2019", as it is more extensive but cheaper.

Praxis Wärmepumpe : Technology, Planning, Installation ¤ Due to rising energy prices and CO-2 reduction measures, the use of environmental heat is gaining more importance. For the author (energy advisor/renewable energies) heat pumps, together with thermal solar systems, wood heating systems, and ventilation systems, offer the optimal combination for using domestic energy sources. When the heat pump is operated with "eco-power", the CO-2 emission is reduced to a minimum. Starting from energy policy considerations, this book clearly and comprehensibly conveys the technology of heat pumps, the planning of a heat pump system, as well as the installation and commissioning with practical examples. With numerous, illustrative colored images, photos, and graphics, economic considerations, cost comparisons of heating systems according to VDI, standards, and regulations, glossary, manufacturer directory, and examples of applications and offers.

Learning from failure : a history-based, lightweight test prioritization technique connecting software changes to test failures ¤ Regression testing is a widespread practice in today's software industry to ensure software product quality. Developers derive a set of test cases, and execute them frequently to ensure that their change did not adversely affect existing functionality. As the software product and its test suite grow, the time to feedback during regression test sessions increases, and impedes programmer productivity: developers wait longer for tests to complete, and delays in fault detection render fault removal increasingly difficult. Test case prioritization addresses the problem of long feedback loops by reordering test cases, such that test cases of high failure probability run first, and test case failures become actionable early in the testing process. We ask, given test execution schedules reconstructed from publicly available data, to which extent can their fault detection efficiency improved, and which technique yields the most efficient test schedules with respect to APFD? To this end, we recover regression 6200 test sessions from the build log files of Travis CI, a popular continuous integration service, and gather 62000 accompanying changelists. We evaluate the efficiency of current test schedules, and examine the prioritization results of state-of-the-art lightweight, history-based heuristics. We propose and evaluate a novel set of prioritization algorithms, which connect software changes and test failures in a matrix-like data structure. Our studies indicate that the optimization potential is substantial, because the existing test plans score only 30% APFD. The predictive power of past test failures proves to be outstanding: simple heuristics, such as repeating tests with failures in recent sessions, result in efficiency scores of 95% APFD. The best-performing matrix-based heuristic achieves a similar score of 92.5% APFD. In contrast to prior approaches, we argue that matrix-based techniques are useful beyond the scope of effective prioritization, and enable a number of use cases involving software maintenance. We validate our findings from continuous integration processes by extending a continuous testing tool within development environments with means of test prioritization, and pose further research questions. We think that our findings are suited to propel adoption of (continuous) testing practices, and that programmers' toolboxes should contain test prioritization as an existential productivity tool.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133869-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132652-0>
The Germans on the Somme 1914-1918: War, Occupation, Scorched Earth ¤ The documentation on the prehistory, history, and aftermath of the Battle of the Somme, the bloodiest battle of World War I, contains excerpts from letters, diaries, and other documents with scientific introductions and also provides information on memorials. Review: Revised and significantly expanded edition of the first documentation on the Battle of the Somme, the bloodiest battle of World War I, published in 2006. The chapters each contain a scientifically founded introductory essay, as well as mainly excerpts from letters, diaries, and other contemporary documents from predominantly German bourgeois origin. Supplemented by poorly printed photographs, maps, and other documents, they cover the entire war period: in addition to the battle itself, also the conduct of the war in the Somme region before and after 1916. 2 French sources reflect the German occupation practice, special chapters are devoted to Ernst Jünger and Otto Dix as well as the propagandistic Somme film. At the end, visitors receive valuable information on memorials. Literature references at the essays, place register. World War specialist Krumeich, now retired, has recently also published a study on the more heavily remembered Battle of Verdun (2016). For those with a special interest in contemporary history.

Southeast Asia: Societies, Spaces, and Development in the 20th Century ¤ This collection of essays originated from a lecture series at the University of Vienna. In 14 challenging essays, renowned experts present the politically, ethnically, and culturally very heterogeneous region of Southeast Asia. The large area is distinguished by an insular-Malaysian part from a continental part and from the mountainous regions in the northern border areas. The focus of the representation is on historical developments up to independence as well as physical and anthropogeographic aspects. Several authors deal with contemporary problems, i.e., deforestation of the rainforest, the development of megacities like Manila and Bangkok, the politicization of Islam, and the precarious position of ethnic minorities, especially the Chinese. The enormous dynamics of economic and political transformation since the beginning of the 20th century are clearly visible, making Southeast Asia one of the most interesting regions in the world. Supplementing, for example, J. Rüland (BA 8/98) and the East Asia volume from the same series (see BA 6/99). Also suitable for smaller libraries. (2) (Andreas Ufen)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073972-7>
Materials Science for Practitioners ¤ No doubt: materials have their own language, which sometimes hinders communication between practitioners, engineers, traders, and users. This textbook now offers a clear introduction to materials science for all the mentioned groups, including beginners from the commercial sector or practitioners switching careers. With a largely avoidance of formulas and calculations, the essential basics of material development, testing of their properties, and current application questions are explained simply, briefly, and understandably. Topics include metallic materials (steels, cast iron, important non-ferrous metals such as aluminum and copper), plastics, ceramics, and auxiliary materials as well as recycling. Whether state diagrams, mixed crystals, recrystallization, displacement, hardening, martensite, or grain boundary - the textbook explains the terms and relationships simply and comprehensibly using informative graphics, photos, and didactically constructed texts. This makes the book suitable for training, but also for self-study and looking up in practice. In this 8th edition, the texts have been updated and numerous illustrations have been revised for better understanding. The textbook is written in a modern language and refers to all examples with valid European standards.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079184-1>
Logic in Law: Foundations and Applications ¤ In this textbook and study book, it is shown to what extent logical structures determine legal thinking. This is done by presenting the essential logical foundations and their subsequent application to selected examples in the field of law. This leads to a better understanding of legal dogmatics and a systematic penetration of the relevant legal material. By moving the considerations between the disciplines of logic and legal science, they contribute to new insights for both subjects. The following logical structures of law are treated: propositional, class, combinatorial, modal, deontological, action, relational, syllogistic, fuzzy, and paradoxical structures.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135337-7>

Relativistic Quantum Mechanics : with 44 Problems and Complete Solution Paths ¤ BEGIN - What problems arise in relativistic extensions of the Schrödinger theory, especially when one holds to the usual one-particle probability interpretation? - To what extent can these difficulties be overcome? - What is the physical necessity of quantum field theories? Many books only inadequately answer such fundamental understanding questions by quickly dealing with the relativistic-quantum mechanical one-particle concept in favor of an early introduction of field quantization or omitting it altogether. In contrast, the present textbook emphasizes this one-particle aspect (relativistic quantum mechanics 'in the narrower sense'), discusses the associated problems, and thus motivates the necessity of quantized fields in a physically understandable way. The first two chapters deal with the detailed presentation and comparison of the Klein-Gordon and Dirac theories - always with a view to the non-relativistic theory. In the third chapter, relativistic scattering processes are treated, and the Feynman rules are developed from propagator procedures. Here too, it becomes clear why one ultimately cannot do without a quantum field-theoretical justification. This textbook is aimed at all physics students who are interested in a clearly organized presentation of relativistic quantum mechanics 'in the narrower sense' and its demarcation from quantum field theories.

Parasite Biology ¤ This volume, not yet displayed, is a biology of parasites for biologists and medical doctors (also veterinarians), now available in an expanded and above all adapted to the current state of science second edition (first edition 1997). General questions on definition, characteristics, co-evolution of parasite and host, etc. are treated in the first part. In the following three parts, single-celled parasites, worms, ticks and mites, crustaceans and insects are described. The book appears at Springer as study literature. Understanding questions follow each chapter, which are answered at the end of the book. The book is primarily aimed at students or practitioners of the above-mentioned disciplines. In addition to P. Wenk's "Parasitology" (ID 28/04), it can be used. It can replace D. Matthes: "Animal Parasites" (ID 41/88). Although frequent pests of humans (worms, lice, ticks) are also treated, looking up without certain familiarity with the terminology is little rewarding. Widely usable on the subject, lastly Marlene Zuk: "What would life be like without parasites?" (BA 8/08). (3) (Olaf Kaptein)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122308-1>
Technical Possibilities of Alternative Design of Urban Water and Sewage Infrastructure: A Technical Research within the Project 'Transformation Management for Sustainable Water Economy' ¤ With the technical research, the research network netWORKS presents a stocktaking of selected national and international experiences and projects on technical possibilities of alternative design of urban supply and disposal infrastructure. The available technical possibilities and their already realized applications are shown. Implementations in the framework of research and pilot projects as well as already realized large-scale projects for alternative concepts of water supply and sewage disposal were taken into account. Gained operational experiences were evaluated as far as available. The report also serves as background information for the scenario-based game planned within the project 'Transformation Management for Sustainable Water Economy'. Due to its overview character, the study should also be of interest to other professionally interested parties from science and municipal or municipal economic practice.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127028-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122755-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064811-4>

Let's code Python ¤ The author is known for a book about app programming that requires no prior knowledge and can be used very well in school lessons. This book is primarily intended for school lessons, also requires no prior knowledge, and introduces the principles of programming based on the Python language with its simple syntax. The development environment TigerJython (attached on DVD) with its many libraries is used; entry is made via a computer with a correct keyboard, on which even graphics and acoustic possibilities are available. For working on mobile devices, a reference is made on the book's website to the free WebTigerJython. The author begins with the basic concepts of programming (commands, modules, loops, objects, ...) and then implements these concepts in games (gamegrid, Breakball, Space Attack, TicTacToe, ...). Together with the aforementioned book a good opportunity to get familiar with the basics of the digital world in class	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4434275-5>
Digital Technology - a Practical Introduction ¤ Digital technology is omnipresent today. It combines many disciplines: physics, mathematics, electrical engineering, computer science, etc. This book brings both the necessary theory and a consistent reference to practice. Each chapter contains numerous tasks (unfortunately without solutions) and detailed literature references. On the internet, you can find additional exercises, examples, animations, and slides for lecturers. Worth mentioning is also an important aspect that is not often treated, namely verification. The lecture material serves mainly bachelor students as an introduction, especially beginners due to its applications tailored to them. Now it is not the 1st textbook; here only the newer ones: H.G. Fehn (ID 34/07), K. Beuth (BA 3/07), H.M. Lipp (ID 51/06), K. Fricke ID 32/00; Reprint: 2005), K. Urbanski (ID 3/04). Recommended, if there is too little of these in stock.

Ethics in Sports ¤ The book addresses the moral prerequisites (e.g. the Olympic idea), ethical implications (e.g. the ban on doping) and the resulting institutional responsibilities (e.g. the sports media) of current sports operations in three steps. Fifteen renowned sports scientists and philosophers, who have already expressed themselves in different ways on questions of morality and ethics in sports in recent years, present their various positions for discussion. In this way, a documentation of contemporary statements on ethics in sports has arisen, which was not yet available in such a compressed form.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015602-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056366-2>
The Tea Plant Book: The Best Varieties to Grow and Use Yourself ¤ Guide with portraits of nearly 40 tea plants, all suitable for personal cultivation. After a detailed description of the plant, the author discusses cultivation in the garden, harvest and application, as well as ingredients and effects. With 12 recipes for herbal tea blends. Review The author F.X. Treml, the "Kräuterpapst von Niederbayern", has already published the book "Der Kräuter-Coach" (2017). This book, specifically about tea plants, begins with an interesting interview in which he tells about his mother, who already produced herbal tea blends herself, and the development of his nursery. It follows portraits of nearly 40 tea plants, all suitable for personal cultivation. After a detailed description of the plant, he discusses cultivation in the garden, harvest and application, as well as ingredients and effects. Each portrait includes at least one informative photo of the plant. It follows tips on collecting, drying and storing, and at the end 12 tea recipes against colds, stress and overexertion, for restful sleep etc. A comparable title with this focus is not known to me. Since many herbs are suitable for the production of teas, tea preparation is also mentioned in other herb books, e.g. "Kräuter-Lust" (2015) and the aforementioned title by the author. In addition, recommended for a health-conscious audience.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059283-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114299-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019286-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165418-3>

Fear - Experiencing Strong Emotions: 40 Kindergarten Project Ideas Based on 5 Picture Books ¤ After a very brief introduction, 5 picture books are briefly presented (Leo Lionni: "Swimmy"; Philip Waechter: "Rosi in the Ghost Train"; Elizabeth Shaw: "The Little Scared Rabbit"; Max Velthuijs: "Frog is Afraid"; Norman Junge: "Fifth to Be" - all available at Beltz). Each of them serves as a basis for 8 project ideas that are intended to help children cope with their fears. Many actions serve the in-depth mediation of the picture book content through storytelling, drawing, or reenactment. Some motivate children to confront and let go of their own fears. The diverse actions can be carried out without extensive preparation and with few materials (unfortunately also food!). They are varied and promise a good processing of fear	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129809-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030638-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064017-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002053-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019702-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030550-8>
On the Significance of "Conventions" in Labor Administration: The Allocation Practice of the Founding Grant ¤ Michael Grüttner is a research associate at the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) in Nuremberg. The founding grant is the most significant funding instrument for entrepreneurship from unemployment. While comprehensive evaluation studies on its labor market policy effects are available, there are hardly any theory-guided works that shed light on its allocation in the employment agencies. This process itself is characterized by a high degree of uncertainty, as the market success of company founding is a priori uncertain. Empirically, it shows that both employees in the employment agencies and entrepreneurs perceive and shape their role in the mediation conversations very differently. Grüttner examines in his qualitative study which conventions are present and guiding in this situation of uncertainty for the actors involved in labor administration - and what difference it makes if entrepreneurship conversations are oriented more strongly to one or the other convention.

Word 2010 for Dummies : [give your words structure and beauty ; at a glance: proficiently apply text processing ; use templates correctly ; create series letters and address labels ; tricks for tables, tabulators, and keyboard combinations] ¤ In the established series, the well-known author (lastly BA 10/10) presents in his usual humorous style the most important components of text processing Word 2010. The structure and parts of the text are based on the predecessor to Word 2007 (BA 9/07), but a comparison shows that the content has been consistently revised and updated. Relevant innovations affecting both beginners and switchers from older versions are addressed. The linguistic deviations are probably the work of the new translator. Due to a text reduction (the chapter on quick start is missing as well as the passages on WordArt) the scope is slightly narrower. Nevertheless, this edition also offers a competent guide to the widely used program. Suitable for updating the existing version, also after Rainer Schwabe (BA 10/10). For advanced users, Michael Kolberg is recommended (BA 11/10).

Simplified Flow Zone Theory : on the basis of the Zarka Method ¤ For a life prediction of variable loaded structures, such as plant and machine construction as well as civil engineering, the cyclically accumulated distortions and possibly also the elastically-plastically tensile vibration widths are required. The Simplified Flow Zone Theory (VFZT) is a direct method that provides estimates of these and all other mechanical quantities in the elastic and plastic engagement state. The present book presents the VFZT in detail and attaches importance to the fact that not only scientists, but also practicing engineers and students of higher semesters can form an image of the possibilities and limitations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4306794-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4311399-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7579569-3>

The Age of Anger : A History of the Present ¤ How can we explain the origin of the hate that covers our world - from mass shooters to the IS, from Donald Trump to nationalist rage, racism, and misogyny in social media? The British-Indian intellectual Pankaj Mishra offers a surprising explanation in his new book. By first looking back to the 18th century, he shows how those who did not benefit from modernization were vulnerable to demagogues. And all the others who came too late, were left behind or excluded, always reacted in the same terrifying way: with hate for invented enemies, the invocation of an imaginary Golden Age, and self-empowerment through spectacular violence. Today as then, mass politics, technology, and the pursuit of wealth and individualism drive millions of people aimlessly into a demoralized world: uprooted people who do not benefit from modernity - with the same terrible consequences.

Mass Media in Germany ¤ The established standard work on the structure and system of media in Germany has been consistently revised and updated. A new chapter on global communication has been added. The crisis of the media industry since the beginning of the century, the rapid structural change of classical media press, radio, and television through the digitalization of communication are further important topics. The basic overview of the media landscape in Germany should be available in many libraries in the latest edition. (I. Müller-Boysen) General understandable, basic introduction to the political, legal, and technical development of mass media in Germany. (I. Müller-Boysen) The consistently updated new edition of the established standard work on "functions, structures, and developments" of mass media in Germany is characterized by the perception of a media landscape that is in the deepest crisis of the post-war period. Declining sales figures and dramatic declines in advertising revenue lead to bankruptcies, mergers, and mass layoffs. Many hopes that the industry, for example, in pay-TV and online offers, have proven to be an illusion. Hermann Meyn, who was chairman of the German Journalists' Association for over a decade and has been teaching as an honorary professor at the University of Hamburg since 2001, also addresses these current developments, which have left no media area untouched.

Future Energy Grid : Information and Communication Technologies for a Sustainable and Economical Energy System ¤ Germany's energy transition can only succeed with Smart Grids. By 2022, Germany wants to exit nuclear energy and switch to an energy supply based on renewable energies. These can only be integrated into the power grid to a large extent with the help of information and communication technologies (ICT). In a so-called Smart Grid, ICT and energy technology merge and provide sustainable, reliable, and affordable electricity – to the benefit of electricity customers, energy producers, and the German economy. But with the rebuilding of the electricity infrastructure, immense challenges also come to politics, economy, science, and the population. With eight theses, acatech sketches the future of energy supply in Germany and provides concrete action recommendations for the construction of the Future Energy Grids.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7708028-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014736-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068598-6>

PREFAB HOUSING : Investigation of Production Processes in View of Efficiency Enhancement and Cost Reduction for Demand-Responsive Housing ¤ Starting from the ongoing and pressing debates on strategies for demand-responsive and affordable housing, this study focuses on prefabricated building systems and examines their contribution to the development of a more sustainable housing construction. On the one hand, some existing systems are presented and their production processes and qualities are investigated, on the other hand, a look is taken at further developments, possible optimizations, and potentials that reside in prefabricated housing. Based on a selection of various manufacturers, a current state of affairs is described in the field of industrial and serial construction. The companies are representative of various construction methods and the use of different materials. In addition to the degree of prefabrication, which initially refers to the manufactured elements or modules and subsequently to the building as a total product, the topics of automation, standardization, and integration of planning and production processes are also evaluated. While the offered systems for the most part exhibit a very high degree of prefabrication and achieve a relatively high productivity through standardization, potentials on the fields of automation and above all digital integration are not exhaustively exploited. In comparison with other industries, technical developments have not yet been established to the same extent in serial construction. Therefore, there is a special development potential for increasing efficiency, reducing error rates, and optimizing production processes, from which the further dissemination, competitiveness, and also the acceptance of prefabricated building systems depend. This study is intended to represent a location determination in view of this development process and provide an insight into approaches and possibilities of prefabricated housing construction.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154137-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004822-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4329754-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016887-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4276531-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066772-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156130-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154155-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4509392-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4240895-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4443806-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004821-4>

Fascination Children's Skiing : New Perspectives through Ski Instruction ¤ In the course of the curriculum development in the ski teaching profession, a change in the training and teaching structure ensued. Multi-perspective teaching, which serves both sports education and personality education, is to be pursued. The book shows the addressee which possibilities, for example, a teacher has at their disposal to offer the student a diversity of perspectives. Furthermore, the book shows which possibilities the ski teacher ultimately exploits and in which didactic-methodological, social, and pedagogical areas he works to further develop these.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030550-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4181666-3>
What is German? : the developments of the linguistic circumstances in Germany ¤ Utz Maas, Professor of Linguistics in Osnabrück, has developed a comprehensive, readable, and extremely stimulating overall representation of German language history from an introduction lecture script. Starting with the present and working his way back to the earliest sources around 750 AD, he shows how erratic and fed from numerous sources the language development runs and continues to take place. Special attention is paid to the political and social environment, the influence and status of dialects and migrant languages, and especially the instrumentalization of language for political purposes. He himself writes in a clear and understandable academic style, objectively and concisely, except for the chapters on phonology, grammar, and etymology, which require advanced linguistic knowledge from the reader. Where an interested audience is to be expected, especially in the Low German region, this extremely informative book is recommended. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113292-0>
The Art of Teaching: Foundations of Instrumental and Vocal Pedagogy ¤ Losert, professor of instrumental and vocal pedagogy, deals with the central artistic competences of the teacher for instrumental and vocal instruction and then goes into the learning and practice competences of the teacher in detail; these are particularly essential, because in instrumental and vocal instruction, whole teaching phases are characterized by imitating, reinforcing, and practicing. Further, it deals with the general abilities and knowledge of the student as well as his special musical talent as a prerequisite for a successful lesson. A guidance for instrumental and vocal instruction, founded on basic didactic-methodological considerations, current research results, and the author's long years of teaching experience, especially in extracurricular training areas, but also in general education schools; alongside Peter Röbke and following the "Handbook of Vocal Pedagogy" by Hildegund Lohmann-Becker	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156945-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040843-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027218-7>

A Woman Flees a Message : Novel ¤ David Grossman (last BA 6/06) wanted to protect the life of his son, who was called up for military service with this novel. Something similar happens to Ora, whose son Ofer volunteers for a deployment after completing his military service. Her anxiety-driven idea of having to receive the news of her son's death forces her to flee and wander through Galilee with her friend Avram, a journey she had originally planned to take with Ofer as a gift to mark the end of his military service. As they wander, she forces her friend and Ofer's father to get to know his son, his place in the family, his attitude towards war and violence, and the painful changes for the mother that she cannot bear. Ora's stories reveal the atrocities of the torture to which, for example, intelligence officers like Avram are exposed, the powerlessness of random victims, and the breakdown of families in a conflict-torn country like Israel. A novel of extraordinary intensity and outstanding linguistic symbolism. Unique.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4522377-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4150643-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055409-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041158-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018202-2>

SMD Practice for Hobby Electronics: Basics, Soldering, PCBs, and Projects ¤ Well-structured and easily understandable guide to handling and processing SMDs (electronic miniature components) for hobby electronics enthusiasts. (Ulrich Wesser) SMDs (Surface mounted device) are small, highly integrated electronic components of 1 to 2 millimeter size, which can only be precisely recognized under a magnifying glass. For several years, SMDs have been installed in devices of interest to amateur radio operators or hobby electronics enthusiasts, for example. The author wants to dispel the prevailing skepticism in the hobby sector against these miniature components and provide a clear and understandable guide to handling and assembly. After the title has described the forms, values, and tips for handling SMDs, concrete practical tips and instructions for soldering and measuring SMD circuit boards are explained and, for training purposes, the assembly of some circuit models is exemplarily carried out. Numerous good black-and-white photographs and many circuit diagrams illustrate the learning material well. Conclusion: Overall, a successful, cost-effective, content-rich, and unadorned guide to handling SMDs for hobby electronics enthusiasts who already have basic knowledge, including handling the soldering iron.

It shows that a theory-guided and rule-guided, interpretative text analysis enables a deeper understanding of the subject area and at the same time generalizable research results.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4248861-8>
Planning of Public Passenger Transport ¤ Millions of people are transported daily in Germany alone by buses, trains, and airplanes. Public passenger transport (ÖV) is of great importance for the quality of life of individuals but also for the performance of entire regions. The quality and efficiency of ÖV systems depend on political framework conditions (state-planned, competitively organized) and the suitability of the infrastructure (railway systems, airport locations), the available traffic offer (schedules and flight plans), the use of suitable technologies (information, control, and booking systems) and the optimal use of operational resources (energy, vehicles, and personnel). The decision-making, planning, and optimization problems that arise in this context are sometimes gigantic and scream for support from mathematics due to their high complexity. This article outlines the current state and importance of the use of mathematics in planning and implementing public passenger transport, describes existing challenges, and suggests forward-looking measures.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045298-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062954-5>
The Lucifer Effect : The Power of the Situation and the Psychology of Evil ¤ Every human being is potentially a violent offender and in each of us there is a devil; but it is not the predisposition that makes a person do evil, but the situation in which he finds himself or is placed, is the provocative thesis of Zimbardo (see also BA 12/08). Using historical and current examples as well as his own research, the renowned American social psychologist shows in detail how group dynamic processes, situational forces and the social environment can work together to turn decent citizens into torturers and murderers. He analyzes, among other things, the phenomenon that originally innocent American soldiers committed mistreatment and torture in Abu Ghraib. He also clearly highlights the complicity of political and military decision-makers. A highly explosive study that has already received much attention in the media.

Economics and Computer Science at Schools: Status and Desiderata with a Focus on North Rhine-Westphalia ¤ Against the backdrop of the far-reaching transformation process triggered by information technologies (IT) in all social, societal, and economic areas, the research report explains the relevance of economics and computer science for school education. After a basic description of the subject area of economics and computer science, essential requirements for the mediation of economics and computer science topics in the school sector are derived. For a subject of economics and computer science, there are currently only lesson plans available in North Rhine-Westphalia at vocational schools. The results of the first lesson plan analysis indicate significant weaknesses in the representation of economics and computer science concepts and methods in the corresponding subjects. An appropriate mediation first requires the adequate training of teachers. The report provides an analysis of teacher training courses with a vocational subject area of 'economics and computer science'. Finally, measures are proposed that appear suitable from a subject matter perspective to influence the fact that the topics of economics and computer science will be represented more appropriately in the lesson plans of (vocational) schools and in teacher training in the future.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053474-1>

Titus Schade : Allnacht ¤ The canvas is his backdrop. Titus Schade (*1984 in Leipzig), former master student of Neo Rauch, paints complex and detached image spaces that work as controlled as they are peculiar. Half-timbered houses, windmills, churches, and raw 1960s buildings appear strangely flattened – as if cut out – as if they had no volume. And they inhabit a space that has lost its familiar perspectives. Whether as part of a bookshelf in a row or in front of a deep black area in the background, the painted buildings form a kind of magical community that can be entered with the eyes, but hardly described with words. The monograph brings together an extensive selection of these unique works, which were created from 2009 to 2016.

Virtual Information Exchanges for Forecasting and Investment Risk Management ¤ With the establishment of choice exchanges for forecasting later election results, a variety of application fields for virtual information exchanges emerged as a new tool for market research. The particularly emphasized forecasting quality of the procedure and the scientific attention paid to it suggest that it is also worth examining the suitability of exchanges for investment planning. In the present book, the authors examine both theoretically and empirically to what extent the exchange mechanism is suitable as an integrated solution approach for obtaining information about the probability of success of an investment and at the same time as a means of securing investment risks. Initially, the information value and the possibilities of securing an information exchange are evaluated theoretically and compared with conventional isolated procedures for investment success forecasting and risk management. The authors also provide a theory-based trading design for such an exchange. Based on these results, a trading platform is structured that provides a decision-making aid for the implementation of investments through the issuance of special securities. An empirical verification in various test series confirms the information function and thus the suitability of an information exchange for collecting decision-relevant information for specific questions. The authors also analyze, however, which types of questions to be forecasted are more suitable for other mechanisms of information collection. Finally, in addition to the internal use of virtual information exchanges for improving information transfer, a selection of further application fields is presented to facilitate implementation for future users.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131113-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4399931-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4475258-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114044-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6>

The new edition appears at the same price as an identical community edition of the publishers Blottner and Fraunhofer IRB (ISBN 978-3-8167-9182-9). In comparison to the 4th edition of 2009 (BA 9/09) more readable due to a 2-column layout, consistently updated, expanded and brought up to date with the current regulations and building insulation standards (EnEV 2014). Previous editions must be replaced. Further recommended as a basic title. Before G. Hopfensperger: "Renovate and Modernize" (ID-B 34/14), "From Old Building to Efficiency House" (ID-A 21/14), K.

Python 3 : the comprehensive handbook ¤ The freely usable object-oriented language "Python" is no longer downward compatible with earlier versions since version 3. However, the innovations of version 3 have already arrived at version 3.6 (previous edition was at the level of version 3.4.3.). In addition to many small changes caused by updates, the CD-ROM with examples is now also omitted. The example programs can now be found in an online solution for free download. The greater practicality and the didactic concept since the last edition have been retained and can be compared with other titles. The price increase of 5 EUR is understandable for a 1,000-page comprehensive work, however, the target groups in libraries have alternatives: Bernd Klein: "Introduction to Python 3" or Thomas Theis: "Introduction to Python" - both titles can be afforded for this price. Those who want it more extensively should replace the previous editions up to version 3, the 4th edition can still remain in stock	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7624871-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/113674746X>
Karl Maybach : his Engines and Automobiles ¤ Karl Maybach, one of the sons of Wilhelm Maybach, the >King of the Constructors<, made the name of his family world-famous. With his luxury-class automobiles, the >German Rolls Royce<, he created a myth within two decades. The second area of the Maybach empire was aircraft engine construction. With the construction of the new >Maybach<, the DaimlerChrysler conglomerate has revived the legend. In this book, which appears in time for Karl Maybach's 125th birthday and has gained importance through its inclusion in the >Automotive Hall of Fame<, the author draws a captivating portrait of the gifted constructor and his developments	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4275781-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076001-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4704960-1>
Handbook of Emissions Trading Law ¤ The book deals with the law of emissions trading. In emissions trading, it is about the allocation of emissions rights for industrial plants (in Germany approximately 2,500 affected plants). In the future, these plants must have a sufficient amount of emissions rights (certificates) for reasons of climate protection. If this is not the case, the operation of the plant may be prohibited. In addition, severe fines are threatened. The certificates are tradable: This means that plant operators who save emissions can sell their certificates, or plant operators whose emissions increase are forced to buy certificates. The book is aimed at all those involved in emissions trading: plant operators, consultants (lawyers, management consultants, technical consultants), scientific institutes, as well as authorities (e.g. DEHSt, responsible state authorities) etc. The book illuminates all relevant legal questions of emissions trading.

Long-term Environmental Balance and Future Potential of Alternative Drive Technologies ¤ The aim of the present study is to perform an economic and ecological evaluation for alternative fuels and drives for passenger cars in the compact class in Germany for 2020 and 2030. The economic evaluation is carried out according to a Total-Cost-of-Ownership approach, without taxes, levies and subsidies being taken into account. The ecological evaluation is carried out according to the Life-Cycle-Assessment approach. In the context of drive change in passenger cars, battery-electric mobility will probably play the most important role by 2030 and beyond. It is already available on a larger scale commercially today. It is the most economical and energy-efficient of the available reduction options with high potential. The challenge lies in the fact that certain limits are set by the speed of market penetration. Plug-in hybrids can take on a bridging function. Other options, in particular biogas and also synthetic fuels, can contribute to a reduction in THG emissions in passenger car traffic by 2030 at highest in a small extent due to potential limitations and high costs. In the long term, fuel cell passenger cars could still represent an addition.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4299127-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144126-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073757-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1021591971> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125883-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008195-3>
Inclusion - Dealing with Difficult Situations: Effective Development and Implementation of a School Concept at an Inclusive Comprehensive School; [5th - 10th Grade] ¤ Inclusive education leads to students of different ages and abilities coming together in the same class, with varying social-emotional development and personalities. This creates a high potential for conflict. It is becoming increasingly common for difficult situations to arise, such as massive disruptions to lessons. It is advisable for every school to develop a concept for dealing competently with difficult situations and preventing them from arising in the first place. This book helps you to develop and implement such a concept at your school. Based on the experiences of an inclusive comprehensive school, fundamental considerations for such a concept are presented, followed by eight practical building blocks for collaborative development. Copy templates for work in individual project sessions, as well as for preparation, support you on your way to a comprehensive concept that is supported by the entire staff.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020463-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047704-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7693876-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164958-8>
Hermann Czech : Architect in Vienna ¤ Hermann Czech, born 1936, is one of the most renowned architects in Austria, whose reputation extends far beyond the country's borders. This influence is based not only on his architectural work, which includes not only buildings but also designs for furniture, interior design, and exhibition layouts, but also on his activity as the author of numerous architectural theoretical writings as well as his editorship of new editions and translations of 'classics' of architectural history, including Otto Wagner, Adolf Loos, Josef Frank, and Christopher Alexander. This new book is the first monograph on Hermann Czech's diverse work. The first cultural-historical part links his work with the approaches of Viennese Modernism. The second, biographical part includes Czech's youth and study years and analyzes the contemporary influences on his thinking and building. The third part goes beyond mere project descriptions and also presents numerous references and considerations by Czech and offers a complete directory of his buildings, projects, and writings. An essay by the Viennese philosopher Elisabeth Nemeth on the relationship between architecture and philosophy in Hermann Czech's work rounds out the volume	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>

The Education Lie: Why We Know Less and Must Understand More ¤ Our students are not learning too little, but the wrong things, claims Fuld, literary critic and author (lastly BA 10/03). He advocates for a radical break with educational traditions and demands a redefinition of the concept of education, which no longer emphasizes abstract factual knowledge, book reading, and historical knowledge, but rather practical life experience, learning to deal with new technologies, and finding one's way in the emerging digital communication society. A rich and pointedly presented polemic and a good complement to the less radical analyses of our education system by K. Adam (BA 12/02) and J.

Cruise and Data Report of the Research Cruise KERNE 2000 with WFS Planet from 25.4. - 28.4.2000 ¤ From 25 to 28 April 2000, a research cruise with WFS Planet took place in the central Baltic Sea. The aim of the cruise was to identify suitable deployment positions for the experiments of the FWG research project RADIS (Reverberation, Attenuation and Detection in the Sediment) and EXSESO (Experimental Sediment Sonar), as well as to conduct bottom investigations for mine hunting in the Baltic Sea. Investigations with side-looking sonar, video recordings, and core sampling were carried out in possible deployment areas west of Warnemünde and northeast of Darßer Ort. Within the framework of the bottom investigations, several core positions between Kiel and Darßer Ort were sampled. In total, 14 vibrocores with core lengths between 5 cm and 180 cm were retrieved, 3 box corer samples and 1 gravity corer (gain 290 cm) were taken. The report is a compilation of all measurement data from the research cruise.(AUT)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4959351-1>
The Islamic Party of Revival : A Study on Islamism in the CIS ¤ Currently, when it comes to the Islamic republics of the CIS, it is often spoken of an Islamic revolution in the spirit of fundamentalism. In order to be able to weigh such considerations correctly, it is important to sift and evaluate the ascertainable evidence for Islamic movements in the Muslim regions of the former Soviet Union. The author does this by way of example with the 'Islamic Party of Revival'. This party, which was founded in 1990 as a union-wide organization and addressed all Muslims of the Soviet Union, forms the most important point of reference for the ideological tendencies of Islam within the CIS, which could be described with the disputed term 'fundamentalism'.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137178-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138592-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040921-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044737-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027743-4>
3D-Print Practice: Everything for the Start; [Foundations, Construction Technology, Endless Possibilities!] ¤ If replacement parts for the household are out of stock, toys for repair require components, parts for model making are missing, or ambitious art objects have not been realizable so far - 3D printing offers a solution for everything. A device and software comparison helps with the first orientation. (Oliver Mitesser) 3D printing has reached the mass market in the last year. Devices - as a kit, ready-to-print or via online service - are affordably accessible and the application possibilities are almost unlimited. If replacement parts for the household are out of stock, toys for repair require components, parts for model making are missing, or ambitious art objects have not been realizable so far - 3D printing offers a solution. In some places, even a paradigm shift from industrial to individual production is predicted (see "Makers", ID-A 12/13). O. Bothmann presents techniques and applications of 3D printing, compares devices and model development software. So far, there are only a few German-language alternatives for a broad audience. "3D Printing for All: The Do-it-yourself Guide" (planned for review) is more comprehensive and 10 euros more expensive. Makerspaces (including 3D printers) are currently a controversially discussed topic in public libraries. Literature on technical trends - even if they should prove to be short-lived - should not be missing anywhere. (2 S) (Oliver Mitesser)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1032223197>
Inner and Outer Boundaries: Psychological Structure Formation as a Pedagogical Task ¤ The repeated confrontation with boundaries has played a central role in the pedagogical field since time immemorial. In education, setting and demanding certain boundaries is just as self-evident as the fact that they are violated, disregarded, and overstepped in everyday life. Their transgression can be liberating and development-promoting on the one hand, but also accompanied by fatal consequences on the other. In order to prevent the ongoing struggle against meaningfully given outer boundaries, children and adolescents must develop psychological structures as reliable inner boundaries. - The authors deal with the complex relationship between boundary setting and transgression, as well as their justification, negotiation, and enforcement in an interdisciplinary manner. In doing so, they take into account the respective historical, social, and cultural framework in which education and socialization take place, by specifically addressing boundary situations such as migration, deprivation of liberty, violence, and trauma. - With contributions from Günther Bittner, Annelinde Eggert-Schmid Noerr, Manfred Gerspach, Evelyn Heinemann, Sabrina Hoops, Peter Kastner, Heinz Krebs, Peter Möhring, Hanna Permien, Mathias Schwabe and Brigitte Vogl	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173874-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044302-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135174-5>
Sound Technology for Media Designers: Hearing Sounds - Understanding Technology - Designing Media ¤ Fundamental yet practice-oriented textbook on all areas of sound technology for individuals from related professions. (Ulrich Wesser) The author deals with all areas of sound technology in this book conceived as a textbook and prepares them for media designers and individuals from other related professions: sound in physics, electrical engineering, human biology, technical tools for transmission, manipulation, recording, and playback, specific requirements for modern sound technology. In addition, adjacent areas are also illuminated, such as production organization. The structure is strongly differentiated but quickly graspable, the descriptions are very precise, sufficiently detailed, and understandable, the explanations are sparingly illustrated with illustrative graphics. Despite the claim to be able to do without mathematical or physical knowledge, knowledge of, for example, specialized terminology facilitates understanding. Conclusion: Fundamental yet practice-oriented textbook for newcomers and professionals working in a field adjacent to sound technology.

Sexualities : Discourses and Patterns of Action in Flux ¤ Sexuality is omnipresent in the present day in images, reports, films, and as a topic of conversation in everyday life. Obviously, this is also connected with massive trends of change in sexual behavior, especially on the part of women. The handling of sexuality has become more open, and sexual patterns of action have expanded. However, hopes have long since vanished that this would lead to the disappearance of the problems of sexuality and a sexuality freed from all constraints becoming a reality. Much speaks in favor of the fact that despite their omnipresence and openness, sexual socialization and sexual practice have not become easier for individuals. New constraints of a culture of success have massively taken hold in this private area and pose new demands on individuals. There are also voices that, despite all trends of change, speak of the continuation of the discrepancy between women and men. The contributions of the book deal with the change in forms of sexual desire and sexual discourses, with male and female sexualities in the life course, and with sexual problem fields (pornography, prostitution, sexual violence). The volume is aimed at social and educational scientists, at pedagogical practice, and at staff in sexual education counseling.

Overview of Cloud Storage Providers ¤ Through the increasingly strong flood of digital information, more and more applications are based on the use of cost-effective cloud storage services. The number of providers offering these services has increased significantly over the past few years. To find the right provider for an application, various criteria must be individually considered. In the present study, a selection of established basic storage service providers is presented and compared with each other. For the comparison, criteria are extracted that are applicable to each of the investigated providers and thus allow for a possibly objective assessment. These include, among other things, costs, law, security, performance, and provided interfaces. The presented criteria can be used to evaluate cloud storage providers with regard to a specific application case.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4332175-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4691234-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7623494-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4600802-0>
Management of IT Projects : From Planning to Realization ; with 20 Tables ¤ It is always astonishing how rarely the procedures and methods of project management are consistently applied. Many problem-ridden projects speak a clear language here. Knowledge of project management and its application possibilities is indispensable for IT managers and IT developers. In this book, the most important procedures and methods of PM are presented. The practical relevance is established through the extensive practical knowledge of the authors in the management of IT projects and results in concrete action recommendations for the use of the project management instrumentation. An important chapter deals with project policy, i.e. how IT projects are to be integrated into corporate policy.

Unbelievable Wonders : Conversations with Holocaust Survivors in Germany, Austria, and Israel ¤ Twenty-five Holocaust survivors, between 74 and 105 years old, who live today in Germany, Austria, and Israel, tell of their terrifying experiences during the Nazi era and how these shaped their lives. Expressive photographic portraits accompany the book. Review: Journalist Alexandra Föderl-Schmidt portrays in this book 25 Holocaust survivors, including Charlotte Knobloch, who are between 74 and 105 years old, whom she met in Germany, Austria, and Israel and questioned about their life paths. They tell how they survived and how their experiences shape their view of the present. The current political developments make many look pessimistically into the future. The renowned photographer (the "Chancellor Photographer") Konrad Rufus Müller has taken expressive black-and-white photos of the portrayed individuals. Preceding the contributions is an interview by journalist Heribert Prantl (SZ) with the author and photographer, in which they speak about their encounters with the survivors.

International Relations ¤ The academic introduction covers the political science sub-discipline in breadth based on current problems of world politics. Review: This textbook also clearly shows that today the political science sub-discipline of 'International Relations' is not understood as a sum of the foreign policy of states and organizations, because much more socioscientific approaches are necessary here. The book has come from academic instruction and is sensibly used in parallel to broad lectures and exercises. Theories and main topics of the discipline are presented and explained extremely compressed. Topics such as war and peace, trade policy, financial relations, poverty, migration, human rights, environment correspond to the current state of affairs. A comprehensive bibliography and a glossary of technical terms are valuable aids. For an overwhelmingly student audience.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072885-7>
The Revitalisation of Livestock Farming in Central Asia: A Five-Country Analysis ¤ Comparable to many other emerging economies worldwide, growing urban incomes spurred demand for animal products in Central Asia. Due to underused pasture reserves in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, international observers suggest significant potential for exports of meat and dairy products. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, all five Central Asian economics (CA5) experienced a reallocation of stock of animals to private households, partly accompanied by a drastic decline in numbers. This project aimed at analysing the current situation of animal husbandry and suitable strategies for its revitalisation. A major focus rested on a systematic compilation of a cross-country dataset. Furthermore, the project aimed at enhancing the scientific collaboration among Central Asian researchers among each other and with German institutes. Key insights of the project illustrate that animal husbandry is still dominated by a fragmented structure of small household producers with poor access to land, family farms and very large (but often inefficient) enterprises. Few producers can supply quality livestock products at high volumes. Only in Kazakhstan do international agreements, slaughter and animal health arrangements favour export prospects in the near future. Since the 1990s, winter fodder deficits have limited livestock productivity. Domestic fodder production is increasing in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, but is hindered by state order policies in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Amongst mobile meat producers with access to winter pasture a class of large commercial operations is emerging, whilst smaller farms lacking access to grazing resources find it harder to grow. Government policy often magnifies differences between small and large producers, for example through conditions for subsidies or land access procedures. Subsidised credit is available in most republics but uptake is limited by effective demand. Improved public services, better support for service cooperatives and decentralised processing and slaughter facilities would help producers increase value from their livestock.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4286868-3>
Computeralgebra ¤ Computeralgebra refers to the boundary between algebra and computer science, which deals with the design, analysis, implementation, and application of algebraic algorithms. In line with this view, the author presents some computer algebra systems and demonstrates their capabilities through examples. Basic techniques, such as computing with large integers, are investigated. For complex questions like polynomial factorization, several algorithms are offered, as they have different strengths. Often, the apparent detour through other mathematical structures is the fastest way. In the first chapters, the necessary mathematical foundations are provided. The following chapters can then be read largely independently of each other. All presented algorithms are justified and partly presented in a pseudocode language. The book is equally aimed at students of mathematics and computer science. TOC:Introduction.- What is computer algebra? Literature. Computer algebra systems.- Foundations.

SAP HANA : the new introduction ¤ Processing and analyzing massive data volumes (Big Data) is now a core task of IT in medium and large companies. Here, speed is the trump card, the strength of the in-memory database SAP-Hana. In addition, SAP-Hana has grown into a development and operation environment for large business applications (ERP, Data, Business Warehouses) and is a core component of complex SAP implementations. In this 3rd edition, now discussed for the first time, the rather expensive title introduces this technology and is aimed at technicians, (business) computer scientists, modelers, and analysts, preferably with SAP knowledge. After an introduction, Hana is presented in detail as a database, application, and cloud platform.

Handbook of Eating Disorders and Obesity: With 21 Tables ¤ Eating disorders and obesity: Both disorder pictures have an increasing prevalence and lead to severe health problems, if not even to death. Both disease pictures have in common that they are generally considered to be difficult to treat, relapses, little disease awareness, and a often lengthy therapy are the consequences. The publisher and author team has made it their task to explain all aspects of the disorders scientifically competent and based on the current state of data, and at the same time to show ways for treatment. Special emphasis was placed on a school-independent concept and on treatment guidelines that link pharmacological and psychotherapeutic elements. As a reference work and treatment guideline, the book is valuable for both aspiring psychiatrists, psychotherapists, psychosomaticians, and clinical psychologists as well as for experienced colleagues in clinic and practice.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113475-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016953-4>

Report of the Federal Ministry of Health and the Federal Environment Agency to consumers on the quality of water for human consumption (drinking water) in Germany (2014 - 2016) : Reporting period: 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016 : in accordance with § 21 Drinking Water Ordinance based on the format for reporting by the competent highest state authorities (Bundesgesundheitsblatt 2013·56:1191-1215) ¤ The present report is based on the reports of the federal states to the Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) and the Federal Environment Agency (UBA) for the period from 2014 to 2016. The form of the report is based on the report format prescribed by the European Commission, which is binding for the annual reports of the state authorities. In 2016, 72.4 million people, approximately 88% of the population of Germany, were supplied with 4,350.8 million m³ of drinking water (from central facilities) in 2,490 water supply areas (distribution of more than 1,000 m³ of drinking water per day or supply of more than 5,000 people). The raw water for the treatment of the drinking water supplied in these areas came from 69.1% groundwater, 15.6% surface water, 8.2% bank filtration, 7.0% artificially enriched groundwater, and 0.1% from other resources. The drinking water in these water supply areas is of very good quality. More than 99.9% of the examined samples met the requirements of the Drinking Water Ordinance, i.e., the limit values were complied with.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060916-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047966-3>
Happy Abortions : my belly belongs to me - not yet ¤ The author has been following and analyzing parliamentary debates and media reports on the topic of "abortion" over many years and has also spoken with those affected.

Small Sewage Treatment Plants Today ¤ Comprehensive overview for professionals and planners in water management, but also for homeowners on small sewage treatment plants, i.e. small plants with biological wastewater treatment. The number of building permits for small sewage treatment plants has doubled in the last 2 years and the German standard DIN 4261 has been replaced by the European standard DIN EN 12566. These reasons led to a rapid update to the latest state of the art and standardization, a stronger consideration of plant-based sewage treatment plants and almost a doubling of the scope compared to the 1st edition (ID 36/04 - must be replaced). In addition, chapters on biological processes of wastewater treatment, on the hygienization of wastewater, on alternative solutions for wastewater treatment, on tightness tests and wastewater disposal obligations have been newly taken up. Following the generally understandable guide by W. Lack: "Wastewater treatment with plants" (BA 1/07) and in addition to F. Wissing (ID 29/03) primarily recommended for libraries in East and North Germany, respectively libraries with corresponding specialist readership. (3) (Elke Nibbrig)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164150-4>

Blutsbande : Kinship as Cultural History ¤ Patchwork, same-sex marriage, in-vitro fertilization - what some call the downfall of the West, is for others an opening of our concepts of love, relationship, and family. Christina von Braun, one of the most renowned cultural scientists in the country, looks far back in history to explain how our ideas of kinship developed. Her new foundational work will change our view of the present. 'Blood is a very special juice,' says Mephisto to Faust, whom he signs a pact with his blood. For Western culture, 'blood ties' are also the basis of kinship. This is not the case for all cultures. Christina von Braun shows in her new standard work how the idea of blood kinship is based on which conceptions and how these conceptions change in the age of genetics and reproductive medicine. On the one hand, the idea of a long chain of blood relatives is solidified. On the other hand, social and cultural definitions of kinship come to the forefront: trust in and responsibility for one another replace blood ties	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125698-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133957-5>

Childhood & Child Labour: Sensitizing Youth for Sensitive Topics; Childhood and Child Labour Past and Present, Information Texts and Tasks ¤ Childhood and child labour is an educationally relevant topic that particularly appeals to children. The engagement with the topic takes place in appealing worksheets, both historically and contemporarily. A look into the past shows that child labour has existed since the Stone Age. Up to the present day, child labour is a current and sensitive topic. Especially in developing countries, children are considered as small, powerless adults, which is why they have to work like adults, and unfortunately often only for a low wage. This is an unacceptable state of affairs that needs to be brought to the awareness of young people and changed with united forces. The young people are sensitized to the differently lived childhood with these print templates.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055852-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054365-1>
Gründe and Purposes: Texts on Current Action Theory ¤ Are actions and action explanations naturalizable? How do everyday psychological and scientific explanations relate to each other? Can expressions like 'goal-directedness', 'appropriateness', etc. be causally interpreted? Against the philosophical mainstream, which considers everyday psychological action explanations as a variant of causal explanations, an opposition has formed in recent years, holding that action explanations are irreducibly teleological: The explanation of an action should consider the goal to which the behavior of a rational actor is directed, and not its causal history. The volume brings together – mostly for the first time in German translation – the most important contributions to the newer analytical action theory, inter alia by Donald Davidson, Harry Frankfurt, Ruth Millikan, and Michael Thompson, and provides an overview of the current reasons-purposes debate.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113844-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022317-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068190-7>
F0rb1dd3n Network : Anatomy of a Hack ¤ This book on information technology security is primarily aimed at somewhat inattentive administrators. Their interest is to be sparked by a thriller story that takes up the first 40 percent of the book. Two young hackers get into a confrontation with sinister other hackers, which gives the authors the opportunity to describe a series of attacks on WLANs and PCs, which are then commented on in the second part of the book. These chapters contain many information about common methods and tools used by hackers, but also the countermeasures that a prudent IT department can take. Many links and further literature references can be found, but almost only US sources. There are also descriptions of some programs used by hackers, but also by network administrators, e.g. to detect attacks from the outside for the first time. This is the translation of the 2nd edition with a completely new factual part (the 1st US edition contained many plagiarisms and was withdrawn).

Differential Equations with MATHCAD and MATLAB ¤ This textbook provides an introduction to solving differential equations (Dgl). Both ordinary and partial Dgl are treated. The mathematical theory is presented as far as it is required for users, for exact and numerical solution methods. Proofs are omitted, instead necessary formulas, theorems, and methods are explained by means of examples. Furthermore, the problematics of difference equations and integral equations are sketched. A second focus of the book lies on the application of the computer algebra and mathematics systems MATHCAD and MATLAB to solve Dgl. In addition, the book is suitable as a reference work: The reader can find properties and solution methods for practically occurring Dgl and use them for the solution with MATHCAD and MATLAB. The book is written for engineers, natural and social scientists.

Shame, Guilt, Responsibility: On the Cultural Foundations of Morality ¤ What makes people moral individuals? How do specific circumstances arise in which phenomena like guilt, shame, responsibility, and respect occur? And why do we often feel so foreign to our self-understanding - why is it so difficult to understand our own circumstances with our moral concepts and philosophical theories? At first glance, these are hopeless questions, because moral life is not based on moral philosophical arguments. Rather, it develops in social practices and cultural forms of life that cannot be reduced to theories. Maria-Sibylla Lotter draws on relevant ethnological research on different forms of life and brings it into conversation with the moral philosophical discourse. This opens up an innovative access to ethical questions. "Shame comes before guilt: Maria-Sybilla Lotter compares concepts of responsibility in different cultures... Instead of adding another special study to the constantly growing literature, she takes the existing material and sorts it out anew, taking into account different social practices, cultures, and epochs. This does not lead to relativism, according to which each culture and each time has its own incommensurable concept of the responsible person, nor to naive universalism, which marks our own culture as the ultimate goal of a rational development" (FAZ)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015602-3>
We pet them and we eat them : our paradoxical relationship to animals ¤ Who might expect a plea for vegetarianism based on the title will be disappointed. American anthrozoologist and professor of psychology Hal Herzog is not about to spoil our appetite for meat. Rather, he shows through many examples how ambivalent and sometimes paradoxical our behavior towards animals is: "We love some, we hate some, we eat some" - this is aptly the title of the American original edition. It's more about explanations than condemnations. On an entertaining but also scientifically sound way, topics such as: Why people keep and love pets, do women treat animals differently than men?, the relationship between humans and meat, laboratory animals in science are dealt with. It's not just about scientific and psychological, but also about ethical and philosophical questions. The book provides stimuli to think not only differently about animals, but also about ourselves. (2) Anthrozoologist Hal Herzog shows why we like some animals, why we are convinced of the benefits of dolphin therapy and why man and dog often look so similar.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194901-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038639-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060087-7>
Molecular Biology of the Cell ¤ Since 1986, this "classic of modern biological textbooks for universities" (H. Lüdtke for the 4th edition: ID 9/04) has been praised as "extremely sovereign and competent representation of the entire general biology" and "great textbook of the central area of general biology (Bock)" for the first German editions. It is currently in its 6th edition. Since its last appearance, approximately 5 million scientific articles have been published in the field. Consequently, the textbook has been significantly revised in content while maintaining its basic structure: new functions of RNA molecules, new information on the human genome, stem cell research, cancer therapy, etc. In return, it has been strongly concentrated and "to keep the book portable" (preface) also reduced by 300 pages. The DVD supplement, which also offered the text of the English edition, has been omitted, and instead, reference is made to video material on the homepage.

Philosophy as Cultural Policy ¤ Philosophy as Cultural Policy, the last collection compiled by Rorty himself, containing some previously unpublished essays, can be read as his legacy: Religion and Moral Philosophy, Wittgenstein and Kant, Naturalism, romantic Polytheism, and again and again Analytic Philosophy and its "healing" through Pragmatism are the seemingly disparate themes that are nonetheless held together by a strong bond, namely the question of the role of philosophy in Western culture, more precisely: How must one philosophize in order to be able to make a meaningful contribution to human culture as a philosopher? Rorty's answer: One must decide, namely against the ivory tower and for cultural change through conversation - with the natural sciences, art, literature, religion, and politics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001869-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045791-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125698-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047046-5>
Modeling and formal analysis of meta-ecosystems with dynamic structure using Graph Transformation ¤ The dynamics of ecosystems is of crucial importance. Various model-based approaches exist to understand and analyze their internal effects. In this paper, we model the space structure dynamics and ecological dynamics of meta-ecosystems using the formal technique of Graph Transformation (short GT). We build GT models to describe how a meta-ecosystem (modeled as a graph) can evolve over time (modeled by GT rules) and to analyze these GT models with respect to qualitative properties such as the existence of structural stabilities. As a case study, we build three GT models describing the space structure dynamics and ecological dynamics of three different savanna meta-ecosystems. The first GT model considers a savanna meta-ecosystem that is limited in space to two ecosystem patches, whereas the other two GT models consider two savanna meta-ecosystems that are unlimited in the number of ecosystem patches and only differ in one GT rule describing how the space structure of the meta-ecosystem grows. In the first two GT models, the space structure dynamics and ecological dynamics of the meta-ecosystem shows two main structural stabilities: the first one based on grassland-savanna-woodland transitions and the second one based on grassland-desert transitions. The transition between these two structural stabilities is driven by high-intensity fires affecting the tree components. In the third GT model, the GT rule for savanna regeneration induces desertification and therefore a collapse of the meta-ecosystem. We believe that GT models provide a complementary avenue to that of existing approaches to rigorously study ecological phenomena.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043216-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274073-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4832365-2>

Nanotechnologies can contribute to preventing water pollution (e.g. by substituting water-polluting processes) or to eliminate it (e.g. by nanomaterials/membranes for wastewater treatment). Furthermore, nanotechnologies can be used for monitoring water quality (e.g. by nanosensors).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4327470-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064821-7>
Expert Report "Spaces for Generations" : on the spatial planning approach to demographic change processes ¤ Background and content of the expert report: Politics and society are slowly, and unfortunately often very late, drawing consequences from the demographic development in Germany, which affects all areas of life. In the framework of the evaluation of the DGGL funding competition Ulrich Wolf 2002 on the topic Gardens of Generations a research group of the Department of Landscape Architecture of the University of Duisburg-Essen, commissioned by the FLL, conducted a literature review on the competition theme. It was essentially about a systematic search for large-scale projects, whose spaces conceptually meet the special requirements for older people. The FLL publishes in its expert report the evaluation of proposals and ideas of the DGGL funding prize Ulrich Wolf 2002, which referred to the Dortmund-Wambel residential area as the competition area, as well as the consequences drawn from the literature review for age-specific spaces. The contribution presents important focal points of the expert report and informs about considerations of some North Rhine-Westphalian housing companies to make older residential areas more attractive for the tenant group of people over 60 through renovation and living environment design.

Future Market Electric Energy Storage : Case Study Commissioned by the Federal Environment Agency within the Research Project Innovative Environmental Policy in Key Areas of Action (Project Number 206 14 132/05) ¤ Energy storage serves to balance between the fluctuating energy supply and the changing energy demand. In terms of power supply, the offer and demand must be balanced at all times in the electrical networks. This can be achieved by controlling power generation, power demand, or intermediate storage. Power storage systems can balance both supply peaks (charging) and demand peaks (discharging). Energy storage systems will be an indispensable component for power supply from fluctuating and possibly decentralized energy sources in the future, ensuring a stable operation. There are a variety of possible storage technologies with different properties and application areas.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014722-8>
Social Ecology: Fundamentals of a Science of Societal Nature Relations ¤ No society is to be understood without its natural environment and conversely, pristine nature is a myth, for it is always shaped by human action in every form. Social Ecology has nature and society in its sights at the same time. The concept of 'societal nature relations' expresses this inextricable link. The book provides a comprehensive overview of Social Ecology as a science, its emergence from a variety of disciplines, and its development into integrated environmental research. In addition to the theoretical and methodological foundation, current and future research fields, typical implementation problems, and concrete application cases are at the center. Social Ecology considers nature and society at the same time. This means that society can only be understood with its natural environment. Conversely, however, pristine nature is a myth, as it is always shaped by human action. With this book, a comprehensive overview of Social Ecology as a science, its emergence from several disciplines, and its development into integrated environmental research is created for the first time. Suitable for university libraries. (3)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4443807-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4192674-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043208-7>

The Cold Year : Novel ¤ The land is snowed in. A young man walks along a highway. Lonely fields, manure pits, rest stops, and windowless furniture houses are the stations of his journey. The goal is a village by the sea, on the edge of a former military area, where his parents' house stands. Tired and exhausted, he must, upon his arrival, however, find that the parents have disappeared. A mysterious boy opens the door to him. Silent and stubborn, he withdraws in the following time mostly into the children's room, where he works on a mysterious project. Over time, the two gain access to each other. What connects them are stories. Historical stories of emigrants and natural disasters. But also retold stories from television, which fascinate the boy. – At the end, a house is on fire in the middle of the ice landscape, and in the eyes of the villagers, there is more reflected than the color of the fire. Roman Ehrlich has written a novel about the loneliness of people. With enigmatic brutality, he weaves history and the present into a poetic masterpiece. A debut that leaves no one cold. "Roman Ehrlich, born in 1983 and graduate of the German Literature Institute in Leipzig, is the classic case of the unjustified dropout at the Days of German-language Literature in Klagenfurt. The excerpt from his novel presented by him this year was largely praised by the jury, he was also repeatedly in the conversation during the final vote – and he remained without an award in the end. The dark enigmatic quality of the text, which can now be held after reading the novel, does not resolve itself even after about 250 oppressive and extremely disciplined pages... But how do you approach such a book, which vehemently resists any interpretation in its closedness and also technical brilliance? The question of what it's all about is definitely the wrong one. Maybe it's all just nothing, except for simple literature: language, world design, world redesign, crisis situation turned into text. The Cold Year does not feel at home in the grandeur of a skillfully designed atmosphere of loneliness and emptiness" (Tagesspiegel) A young man leaves the city towards his hometown, which is located by the sea near a decommissioned military base. In his former room, a child is living, which in unobserved hours works on a piece, perhaps a pipe bomb. The family of the nameless narrator seems to have vanished without a trace. Without questioning the events, he takes care of the livelihood of the small community and works in the local electrical goods store. The 1983-born author, who participated in the Bachmann Competition 2013 with this debut, formulates fundamental questions about the conditions of human existence against the background of a post-civilizational subject. The first-person narrator, who has lost his sense of time, seeks to regain lost orientation through the inventory of reality fragments. He pursues this minimalist approach just as consistently as the reference to historical or television events, which serve him as identity-forming patterns. The enigmatic dystopia of a darkened world is suitable for supplementing expanded novel collections.

Trade Unions and Labor Disputes: Can the Balance of Power be Saved? ¤ Labor disputes and trade unions. What sounds like a discussion from the heyday of the industrial society is more relevant than ever today. The only thing that has shifted is the focus. It is no longer the classical industrial workers who draw attention to themselves with labor disputes, but in part highly paid specialists such as doctors, pilots, or train drivers. Which tactics do the "new" trade unions, such as the Marburger Bund, Vereinigung Cockpit, but also GDL, employ? What can the employer do against it? Does a kind of balance of power in the labor dispute still exist, and if so, how can it be protected? Ralf Vogler addresses all these questions and sheds light on the phenomenon of trade unions and their labor dispute management from a legal perspective. The author does not stop at a pure analysis, but also shows how the balance of power between employers and trade unions can be restored.

Rural Areas in Demographic Change ¤ The present online publication brings together under the title "Rural Areas in Demographic Change" the conference of the German Society for Demography (DGD) and the Federal Institute for Building, Urban and Spatial Research at the Federal Office for Building and Spatial Planning from 2008. The documented presentations discuss fundamental trends in the demographic development of rural areas and deal with the most diverse aspects of spatial challenges resulting from population decline and accelerated demographic aging, up to the development of suitable adaptation strategies and new policy concepts. The analyses and forecasts specifically related to the rural area illustrate how differently the demographic development of these areas is. So there are rural areas that show a very positive economic and social development, as well as many that are less successful. Especially strongly affected by this development are rural areas in the New Federal States. In the face of these challenges, special adaptation strategies will be required here (Source: Publisher).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034026-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006292-2>
Competence Profiles: What Professionals in Youth Work Should Be Able to Do and How They Can Learn It ¤ Professionals in youth work face a multitude of demands: they are often animators and administrative experts, point of contact and advisors in one. For such a broad profession, specific competences are required. What must a youth work professional be able to do to do their job well? In the Protestant youth work in Württemberg, around 150 full-time staff and their superiors were surveyed on which competences have particular relevance in professional practice. The empirical results focus on the outstanding importance of social and personal competences. In addition, a survey of the actually acquired skills of students at five training institutions, which train for community and youth pedagogy, was conducted. An innovative educational module shows how, through exploratory learning forms, competence development can take place in a practice-oriented and complexity-oriented manner. The authors have profound practical experience in the field of youth work and in the training of full-time staff for youth education. Coming from various disciplines, their approach enables multiple perspectives on a topic that is of great importance for the future of youth work. Content I Building professional competence.

Money : the new rules ¤ Money is a means to an end. It should serve us and make life easier. But we are far from that: state debt crisis, system banks, currency speculation, tax havens Money dominates our lives. Christian Felber, who with his 'Common Wealth Economy', an alternative economic order, is causing a stir, finds that free people should not accept this. A democratic community should determine the rules, according to which money comes into circulation and is used, anew. In his book, Christian Felber describes how we can arrive at a new monetary order through democratic processes The author, economic thinker of the ATTAC network, supplements his previous publications on alternative economics (most recently 'The Common Wealth Economy', ID-B 13/12) with this work, which interprets and fundamentally criticizes the financial economy from the perspective of money. He sets this on a broad critical foundation - comparable books often only pursue a single approach. The goals of the proposed measures are sustainability, prevention of speculation, and democratization. Questions of pension and tax policy are also addressed. Like Felber's other books, this one is also easy to read and very thought-provoking for thinking about modern self-evident truths. With the publication, so-called 'Money Conventions' are to be stimulated, which can serve the establishment of a common wealth economy. Very useful for the debate on alternatives in economic policy!

Financial Policy in the Tension Field of the European Stability and Growth Pact: Between Macroeconomic Requirements and Economic and Financial Policy Needs; Expert Opinion of the ifo Institute for Economic Research on Behalf of the Federal Ministry of Finance ¤ The consolidation of the budget has had a high priority for a long time. It is also anchored as a medium-term goal in the Stability and Growth Pact. In addition to this supply-side orientation of financial policy, however, the stabilization of the economy is also an important task. In the event of cyclical fluctuations, the so-called automatic stabilizers of the public financial system should be effective. This means that in the downturn, the cyclical increase in the state's budget deficit should be tolerated and not prevented by tax increases or expenditure cuts. Conversely, in the upswing, the cyclical improvement of the state budget should not be undone by increased expenditure or tax cuts. If, on the other hand, financial policy in the downturn were to increase taxes and/or reduce expenditure in order to prevent an increase in the deficit, the economic crisis would be exacerbated in general opinion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127795-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170174-4>

Flight, Migration and the Left in Europe ¤ How does Europe's left deal with migration? What answers do progressive parties offer to current challenges? What difficulties do they see? What role do flight, migration, and integration play for voters? What does this mean for political parties and movements? Aydan Özoguz, Wolfgang Merkel, Ahmad Mansour, David Goodhart, and many others write about this. Flight and migration have been decisive election issues at least since the refugee crisis of 2015. How does the left center of Europe discuss migration policy challenges? What role do party tactical considerations play? What about morality? What are the positions and what trends are emerging?

Future Market Solar Thermal Power Generation: Case Study Commissioned by the Federal Environment Agency within the Framework of the Research Project "Innovative Environmental Policy in Key Areas of Action" (Grant Number 206 14 132/05) ¤ At solar thermal power plants, the concentration of sunlight heats a heat transfer medium, which is then used to convert thermal energy into mechanical energy based on a steam process or using a Stirling machine. The technologies investigated include parabolic trough power plants, solar tower power plants, and dish-Stirling systems. The prospects for solar thermal power generation can be assessed as very good in the medium and long term in terms of market potential and technological development. In the context of the further development of renewable energy technologies, it will gain greater importance in the future. Germany has a good technological starting position in this regard. In particular, the experiences of central actors in key components and the achieved world market position, which were supported by the integration of these actors into related technology areas (mirrors) and by state R&D, also allow for success in the future. Further efforts are needed in technology development and, in particular, in the better use of possible synergies in the innovation system - e.g. with regard to the integration of further actors. However, there are also structural obstacles. Germany does not have its own internal market, so that no user experiences and associated user-producer interactions can develop in the country and German companies must operate on export markets from the outset. For the future, it would be particularly important to realize and financially secure a complete project by a corresponding actor. In addition to the development and production of key components, German companies should take on a stronger role in project development in order to better prevent the possible sale of the technology. From a European perspective, solar thermal power generation offers very large industrial policy opportunities, as both Germany and Spain have built up competences and thus two EU countries have taken over the global leadership in technological development and project development. Spain - and thus also the EU - benefits from the experiences with the projects carried out. In contrast, the USA - not least due to the reduction of public R&D funds compared to the second half of the 1990s - have lost ground in the meantime. With corresponding efforts, solar thermal energy offers an excellent opportunity to achieve the industrial policy goals formulated in the Lisbon Strategy on a future-oriented area.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055583-5>

Macroeconomics: Modeling, Paradigms, and Policy ¤ This textbook provides a systematic introduction to macroeconomics. Initially, macroeconomic analysis techniques and national accounting are presented, as well as elementary formal methods. Subsequently, the technique of macroeconomic modeling is conveyed. Starting from a simple goods market model, macroeconomic models are developed that increasingly comprehensively and realistically depict the economy. Within these models, the effectiveness of alternative macroeconomic policy measures is then evaluated. Additionally, it is shown where macroeconomic specializations such as business cycle, growth, money, or foreign trade theory are applied. Furthermore, the book provides an overview of the various macroeconomic schools of thought, their respective economic worldviews, and their most important representatives.

Foundations of Digital Signal Processing: A Mathematical Approach ¤ With the widespread introduction of digital signal processors and computers, a universally available means of processing signals from coffee machines to cars is now available today. The digital signal processing used in this book is presented as the processing of deterministic and also stochastic signals. Initially, physical and mathematical signals and signal parameters are described, followed by a consideration of analog continuous-time systems. Subsequently, discrete-time, linear, time-invariant systems and the processing of discrete-time signals are presented in detail. The necessary mathematical procedures for solving difference equations and the discrete Fourier transform are treated in detail. Stochastic signal processing follows. After a chapter on estimating the autocorrelation function, the book devotes itself to the increasingly used model systems. Literature references close the book. In contrast to other works, this book on digital signal processing is readable without additional mathematical reading. Necessary mathematical knowledge is presented in an understandable way and refreshed. The book is therefore aimed at students, but also practicing engineers, computer scientists, and natural scientists who want to acquire the foundations of digital signal processing independently.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113314-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4401311-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139058-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4469723-5>

The New Der Die Das : On the Modernization of the Sexual ¤ Sex researcher Schmidt (born 1938) has experienced all the waves of modern sexuality and documented and diagnosed them in his time diagnoses from "the great DER DIE DAS" (BA 7/86), then in 1994 (BA 4/94) and finally in 2004 under "The New DER DIE DAS" (BA 9/04) in a popular scientific manner. Now the 4th, "completely revised and updated" edition of the sexual water level reports. Like the predecessors, not just a remake; completely new are the chapters on "Leaving the Drive" and "Child sexuality and sexual development"; the former "Substance" was not only adopted, but also brought up to date. Schmidt varies and continues to write his core thesis: The "Disappearance of Sexual Morality" (BA 6/96), the advanced de-traditionalization of sexual, relationship, and family relationships, and as a result of this, the self-determination discourse of the 80s, would bring modern relationships further in the direction of "intimate citizenship" forward: a society in which equal people live and regulate all facets of "Intimacy" self-determined.

The Feeling of the World: On the Power of Moods ¤ How is the mood? Not so good. There's no talk of optimism. We feel threatened, want to secure what we've achieved. Who knows what the future holds? For Heinz Bude, moods are the feelings of society. He analyzes how they arise, how they can be influenced, but also how they can tip. Moods decide how we perceive the world, that's why it's so important for politicians to know the mood of the voters. Heinz Bude shows why moods often decide more in politics than arguments. Moods are vague, fleeting, and unpredictable. But whoever wants to understand how our democracy works, must know about their power over people. "The 'universal mood of self-motivation, self-examination, and self-realization', so Bude, seems to allow only two possibilities: 'acceleration or contemplation, self-overextension or self-surrender, intensification of the trend or exodus from the system'. But the attentive observer sets his hopes on a third behavioral option that does not bow to the apparent alternative. He listens – so one may say – to the grass growing and believes to sense a budding mood. Those who will be in this mood one day, Bude calls, not quite unceremoniously, 'the Futurables'. They are supposed to be those who – 'behaved and shy' – seek a 'new beginning'. This sounds not only like Heidegger, but is taken from the philosopher's ambiguous invocation of a historical event that is meant to turn everything around. Bude's translation of Heidegger is not as threatening, but it is similarly vague. The feeling of life of the Futurables, so the final point, will be determined by 'openness to the world without self-denial'	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020588-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037879-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046514-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140941-3>
The Hour of the Specialists : Novel ¤ Germany 1940: Max Koenig is a professor of antiquities research. A hereditary nervous disorder tears him out of his professional life and away from his family. He comes to the Wittenau Sanatorium and meets Sister Rosemarie, who tries to help as much as she can. Despite his frailty, Koenig becomes the center of a small group: study councilor Dr. Carl Hohein, who composes a litany on the color 'black', young pianist Elfie, whose hands tremble and speaks 'dream German', and finally Oscar, a boy with Down syndrome 21. The daily routine on the ward, the meager food rations, and the racial hygiene comments of the medical 'specialists' are only made bearable by mutual support and small joys, such as visits from his wife and sister-in-law. They hope to find themselves again in the dreamland of Italy after the war. But Max Koenig and Oscar are relocated and separated from their relatives. It is Dr. Friedel Lerbe, a doctor, SS man, and fanatical advocate of racial hygiene, who kills them. As the leader of a killing institution, he carries out the NS 'euthanasia' program with bureaucratic precision - every detail of the procedure is controlled by him. A whole staff of 'caregivers', secretaries, technicians, and cremators stand by this 'specialist' in his work. "Barbara Zoeke succeeds in telling a very good, if not well-ended (as well?), story with her language and the tone that prevails in this novel. I am impressed by this skill. Writing a novel on such a topic requires, in my opinion, a lot of courage... "The Hour of the Specialists" by Barbara Zoeke appeared as the 393rd volume of "The Other Library".

Structured Irresponsibility : Reports from the Banking World ¤ In the secretive world of banking, a kind of 'financial aristocracy' has emerged, which seems to be completely indifferent to the so-called 'real economy'. Claudia Honegger, Sighard Neckel and Chantal Magnin have entered this world with their research teams and spoken with German, Austrian and Swiss 'financial soldiers'. The sociological portraits that arose from this are the core of this book. They answer questions like: How do bankers and bank managers interpret the crisis on the financial markets? How did it come to this? Who is responsible? In addition to the portraits, there are analyses, field descriptions, essays and a glossary. The focus is on the emergence of 'mercenary armies' that fought against each other, but at the same time led a campaign against bank customers, listed companies, entire national economies and ultimately against the real world	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7635855-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143413-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004443-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120754-3>

Business Administration: Application- and Process-Oriented Foundations ¤ The present book offers a clear and application-oriented overview of the current state of business administration. The structure of the presentation is closely aligned with the flow of business processes. The company is initially integrated into the goods cycle and characterized by means of demand groups, legal forms, and goal structure. Subsequently, the different value creation processes of the company are presented and important decision-making situations in the individual phases of production and utilization are analyzed. Through a careful didactic structure, the author succeeds in always bringing the reader to the problem and its solutions. Concise overviews summarize the texts of the individual chapters and help with repetition and checking the knowledge level. Due to the strong application orientation and numerous practical examples, the book is also recommended as a reference work for practitioners.

Human Resource Management : Textbook for Bachelor and Master ¤ The textbook is aimed at students of business studies (both BA area (selected chapters) and MA area (all chapters)). The textbook prepares BA and MA students for personnel practice in companies. The focus is on one hand current, critically condensed and scientifically secured knowledge, on the other hand the immediate connection to practice. The process as well as the contents and methods of successful personnel work are presented. This process begins with important topics such as corporate strategy and marketing, before the classical topics such as personnel deployment planning, personnel selection, development, and management are addressed. As meta-topics, which run through all elements and instruments of human resource management, communication, control, organizational culture, as well as personnel-relevant characteristics of work (e.g. job analysis) and employees (e.g. stable employee characteristics) are presented. Important for the methodological competence of personnel are the topics of employee survey and statistical basics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4240300-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121465-1>
How can existing national climate policy instruments contribute to ETS development? : final report ¤ The research project “Perspectives of Linking Emission Trading Systems – Possibilities to Transition National Climate Programmes into an ETS” seeks to analyse and evaluate non-ETS climate policy instruments, such as carbon taxes or green certificate trading schemes, regarding their suitability to serve as a basis for establishing emission trading systems. The analysis proceeded in two steps: first, a generic assessment of prototypical policy instruments was made. In a second step, case studies of realworld implementation in India and Mexico were conducted. Findings from this project are meant to inform ETS development by showing how existing policy instruments could contribute to this process and by illustrating how non-ETS policy instruments could coexist with an emissions trading system, allowing for an effective policy mix. This report represents the consolidated findings of three work packages within this research project. The first chapter provides some background information while chapter 2 introduces main concepts that represent the basis for the analysis of prototypical policy instruments in chapter 3. In a brief excursus we look at policy instrument’s benefits that could represent a barrier to the introduction of an ETS (chapter 4). the findings from the case studies Mexico and India are presented in the chapters 6 and 7, respectively. In chapter 8 we look at the co-existence of climate and energy policy instruments in the European Union and how the experiences made could inform other regions in terms of operating an ETS in parallel to other policies. Section 9 summarizes the findings providing an outlook on how the development of an ETS could be supported by taking into account existing instruments and how these could synergistically be combined with an ETS allowing for a transition towards a low carbon economy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547705-1>
Design technischer Produkte, Produktprogramme und -systeme : Industrial design engineering ¤ The book is an updated and expanded version of the same professional book from 1992. Its basic approach remains unchanged. The design of a technical product is understood as the part of its value that includes its visibility and recognizability as well as its operability and usability for the customer. Only through design does the customer orientation of a technical product become complete. For a pluralistic and global clientele, different design variants of a product program result in its constructive functional forms, interface forms, and structural forms. The update first concerns the updating of the basics, such as new standards, professional books, or solution elements, and especially the examples (color part). The material is more precisely defined by definitions and a set-theoretic modeling. This is intended to be a preliminary stage and a contribution to the discussion of the use of computers. These new basics also include the research projects and dissertations conducted under the author's leadership. Design is treated integrally in product development according to VDI 2221. The scope of application concerns both single products, as well as product programs and product systems. All application cases are treated with regard to design requirements, solution elements, and solution evaluation. The ecological specifications for product development and design have also been worked out more clearly. Three large sections on interior design, program design, and system design have been newly formulated or redefined. The shape similarity has been redefined throughout and its relevance in the three application cases has been presented. The book deliberately omits design history and focuses on the design of new technical products, programs, and systems. This has been defined as new or current in the introduction and in the evaluation section. In the final chapter, new topics such as service design and multisensory design are treated.

The Morality of Society ¤ Thinking about morality is generally considered the domain of philosophy. It may therefore seem surprising that one of the most influential representatives of sociology in the 20th century, Niklas Luhmann, has been dealing with moral theoretical questions continuously since the late 1960s until shortly before his death in 1998. The present volume presents Luhmann's most important texts on a theory of morality for the first time. Luhmann's major project - a theory of society - also determines his view of morality, which he does not, as is customary in philosophy, consider substantial, but functional. From his perspective, the question always arises in an individualized society of how action coordinations are possible on the level of interactions. Here, moral, but also legal rules and conventions gain importance. In order to grasp these, Luhmann claims that a reflection theory of morality is needed, whose contours become visible in the essays collected here.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077624-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020588-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040222-8>
Screening and Selection of Amaranth Varieties and Lines as Trace Element-Rich Biogas Substrate ¤ The project aimed to evaluate various Amaranth varieties and lines in terms of their suitability for biogas use. The focus of the one-year field experiment was therefore the analysis of the yield potential of the varieties as well as the investigation of their ripening behavior as a basis for loss-free silage and the substrate quality decisive for the methane yield. With promising results, a detailed processing of selected accessions should take place within the framework of a follow-up project. Ultimately, the results should lead to practical recommendations for agriculture, promoting the cultivation of the crop and contributing to the improvement of biodiversity through the expanded species diversity of biogas crop rotations (Source: Publisher).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4473009-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4342663-3>
The Learning Society: Learning Cultures and Competence Development in the Knowledge Society ¤ Learning society and lifelong learning are recurring topics in the educational policy, educational science, and didactic debate. The present volume shows that these are development-capable concepts whose content contours have changed and further differentiated in the already several decades-long history of these terms. The discourse on learning society and lifelong learning has been conducted to a high degree in the environment of international institutions, both concepts are discussed worldwide in terms of their consequences for national education policy. The volume contains contributions that primarily pursue the importance of these concepts for various fields of action and institutions with a national perspective. Learning society no longer restricts itself to childhood, youth, and perhaps early adulthood, but in connection with lifelong learning, all generations and life cycles are included. The volume makes it clear to what extent modern societies have developed into actually existing learning societies through the continuous expansion of the formal and informal learning opportunities contained in them and the perception of learning opportunities, but also where there are still limits, barriers, and restrictions for the comprehensive realization of these guiding ideas.

Refugees in Germany : Perspectives - Alliances - Catalysts ¤ Refugees in Germany - with it is connected the current biggest societal challenge. In the context of the current situation, different facets of the complex topic are brought to the fore: basic connections and positions, stories of refugees and examples of support in practice, dilemmas and perspectives, experiences and impulses for action. The book wants to contribute to a possibly accurate empathetic look and to sensitize for responsible action. The target groups are mainly voluntary and full-time employees in refugee aid, responsible persons in municipalities and parties, churches and welfare associations, companies and associations	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4154680-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071042-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017604-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128300-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020588-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015833-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077570-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012046-6>
E-Learning in School Life: A Study on the Use of Modern Information and Communication Technologies in the Classroom ¤ The new information and communication technologies (ICT) have contributed to a societal transformation process that also affects the school. Knowledge becomes freely available and accessible, which means that teachers are increasingly losing their role as sole knowledge transmitters. The traditional place- and time-bound teaching is opened up by asynchronous learning phases that dissolve the spatial and temporal binding of common learning. For the educators, teaching with new ICT is therefore a great challenge. In addition to the necessary technical knowledge, it requires special didactic and pedagogical competences. Preparing lessons in an electronic landscape is time-consuming, requires good media knowledge, and demands methodically didactic creativity. This book provides insights into a research project that analyzes the experiences of schools on how all teachers of a school can be won over to experiment with new information technologies in the classroom. Five case studies provide detailed insights into how teachers acquire the necessary technical knowledge and special didactic and pedagogical competences in dealing with new information and communication technologies in daily teaching. Furthermore, the relevant findings are highlighted that go beyond the individual case, as well as recommendations for the introduction of e-learning in school life are derived.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062005-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001307-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4727098-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074659-8>

Sectoral Innovation Processes and the Discussion of German Innovation Weaknesses ¤ In the "Location Debate", Germany is often attributed innovation weaknesses in a general manner. In the discussion of varieties of capitalism, the view is represented that "liberal market economies" like the USA favor radical innovations more than "coordinated market economies" like Germany. A more detailed analysis of sectoral innovation processes in the pharmaceutical industry, the telecommunications industry, and the automotive industry, however, shows that reality is more complex: The juxtaposition of "radical" and "incremental" innovations is just as problematic as their identification with specific industries and institutional systems. National innovation systems are not closed units, but condition each other in their strengths and weaknesses. State regulation plays a central role in innovation processes everywhere, albeit in different ways. A historical analysis is indispensable to understand changes in innovation conditions. In the German pharmaceutical industry and telecommunications industry, a relative decline is to be recorded, which, however, has very different reasons that cannot be subsumed under a simple explanation schema. The German innovation debate is still too focused on technology promotion and largely ignores questions of the social and ecological quality of innovations and their diffusion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4711541-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045696-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4345404-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032690-1>

The World Chronicle of John Malalas: Author - Work - Tradition ¤ The 18-book chronicle of John Malalas is the oldest surviving example of a Byzantine world chronicle and offers unique insights into the early phase of a literary genre that held central importance for the Byzantine Middle Ages. Modern research considers the work an important historical source for the 5th and 6th centuries AD, also allowing for insights into cultural and mental historical aspects. Despite increasing research interest, many fundamental questions remain open: What education did Malalas undergo, what did he believe in? To which genre does his work, commonly referred to as a chronicle, belong? Can the lost original text of Malalas be reconstructed using other textual witnesses? The first volume of the Malalas Studies, which presents the results of the inaugural conference of the Tübingen project for the historical and philological commentary on the chronicle, focuses on three main topics: the question of the author's person, the transmission of his chronicle, and the medieval (multilingual) Malalas tradition, as well as the question of the genre of the chronicle and its historical and intellectual anchorage I.

Neuromarketing : Insights from Brain Research for Brand Management, Advertising, and Sales ¤ The Diplom-Psychologe and successful Keynote-Speaker Hans-Georg Häusel has compiled contributions from renowned experts and scientists on the topic of Neuromarketing, which transfers insights from brain research to questions of consumer behavior and marketing. (Sabine Roeske) The Diplom-Psychologe and Keynote-Speaker Hans-Georg Häusel (lastly BA 6/08, BA 2/10) has already published several successful and well-received titles, which have transferred insights from brain research to questions of consumer behavior and marketing. This time, Häusel has compiled contributions from renowned experts and scientists on the topic of Neuromarketing, which has meanwhile established itself firmly in science, as editor and partly as author.

Making the Invisible Visible: Educational Processes and Subject Genesis through Images and Stories ¤ Bilder are omnipresent, they have played a central role in human life since time immemorial. Images and narrative images reveal our understanding of reality, just as they shape our self-image. People are confronted with images from the beginning of their existence, as visually perceived, as conceptions, as fantasies, as memories. They act immediately and bring entire traditions of perception and experience forms to the fore. The introduction to the respective image world of a culture is a central moment of human education. The concern of this book is to ask what can be made visible through these images and also through stories. What can we learn from images and stories? What do they tell us? How do they tell it? And how can their language be understood? This volume brings together contributions from a psychoanalytic and anthropological perspective to outline the broad spectrum of educationally relevant questions. On the one hand, this can make it clear to what extent images can make the inner and inner developments visible, on the other hand, it opens up a view of the culturally historical embeddedness of images and their effect. The confrontation with these questions allows a look at the elementary prerequisites and conditions of educational processes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006568-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059596-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164480-3>

The Carousel - Deception, Exchange, and Deception: Scenes of a Media Philosophy ¤ The Carousel is a machine in which the exchange parameters of sense and sensibility are tested in the scenic arrangement. From the 19th century, the extraction of scientific-media deception machines from the laboratories of psychophysics becomes part of a psychological festival culture that separates itself from the physically oriented fairground world. Ralf Bohn reads media scenes of the carousel in literature, film, architecture, photography, and painting as illustrations of physical deception, economic exchange, and medial deception. With this, he shows how, through legitimate sites of transgression, the exchange economy is tested beyond morality and on this side of pathological abysses.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4712994-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033422-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4211353-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4433627-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053994-5>

The History of Germans in America: From 1680 to the Present ¤ 20 % of the US population claim to be of German descent. Since colonial times, Germans have been involved in the settlement of the continent. Whether it's explorations, technical achievements (Zeppelin, Boeing, space travel), ketchup and cuisine, entertainment and culture (Hollywood, Mickey Mouse, Steinway pianos), fashion (Levi Strauss jeans), politics, sports, gold rush and civil war, to name a few examples - German immigrants were significantly involved in the rise of the US to world power. Even the first American millionaire, John J. Astor, embodiment of luxury and elegance, came from Germany. The author, historian, and profound expert in the field (most recently: "The Wild West", BA 11/09), offers an extremely informative, clear, entertaining, and richly illustrated insight into the German part of the US-American success story since 1680.

Technical Acoustics ¤ This classic introduction is unique in its subject selection and structure, and has proven itself, its thematic selection is dedicated to engineering education. Above all, emphasis is placed on the most important measures to calm the acoustic environment. All chapters have the question directly and indirectly as the subject, how the loudness can be reduced in the most practically important acoustic environments (in buildings and outdoors). The so-called measures chapters are preceded by the media chapters, which convey the required basic knowledge about the nature of sound and vibrations. Compared to the previous edition, the scope has increased by a fifth. Noteworthy is a new chapter on the fundamental questions and facts of "active noise control". The following have been added, among other things: - the consideration of wave propagation has been extended to moving media - when discussing sound absorption, the oblique sound incidence is also discussed - the references to standardization have been updated - a brief and concise summary of the essential facts has been added at the end of each chapter.

Child and Youth Welfare: Introduction to History and Fields of Action, Organizational Forms, and Societal Problem Situations ¤ Child and Youth Welfare is a significant field of social pedagogical work with children, young people, and their families. It encompasses tasks of general promotion - for example, kindergarten and youth work - as well as counseling, support, and crisis intervention, as well as services for upbringing outside the family, in connection with juvenile justice and guardianship. In societal crisis situations, in the case of unemployment, poverty, or general lack of perspective, these tasks become even more significant. They include structural criticism, political representation of interests, and cross-border offers. In this fundamental representation, an orienting insight is given into this field of action, its history, its organizational forms, and the triggering societal problem situations. The field-related reports and overviews provide well-founded factual information, illuminate trends of development, mark boundaries, and show contradictions between claim and reality.

Cooperation of Central Places in Shrinking Regions: Practical Experience Study; a Project of the Research Program "Aufbau Ost" of the Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development (BMVBS) and the Federal Office for Building and Regional Planning (BBR) ¤ The practical experience study "Cooperation of Central Places in Shrinking Regions" addresses the question of how functional divisions in the central urban system (city associations) and other forms of cooperation are suitable for contributing to the security of basic supply in shrinking regions. The publication is directed as a compact action guide both at municipalities and at state and regional planners. From the comparative examination of ten case studies from the new federal states, which take over a pioneering role due to their early exposure to the effects of demographic change, targeted action recommendations for the successful implementation of central urban city associations in various cooperation phases can be derived. The results of the investigation provide insight into which fields a center cooperation is sensible, which factors are decisive for the successful implementation of the cooperation and which obstacles exist. City associations represent an important instrument in the sense of the guiding image "Securing Basic Supply" of the new guiding images for regional development adopted by the MKRO in the summer of 2006. The results and the derived action recommendations form a basis for information for the further development of central places concepts in the state plans and provide important pointers for the implementation of new or existing central urban cooperation in the partner municipalities (Source: BBR).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067619-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032386-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194892-0>

Social Services on the Labor Market: Social Work between Labor Market and Social Policy ¤ The relationship between the professionalism of social work and politics/law undergoes a new dynamic in the wake of the Hartz legislation. The laws for modern services on the labor market do not point in a fundamentally new direction, but rather strengthen tendencies that have been in place at least by the end of the 1990s. In addition to labor market policy, administrative organizational, financial, or social security law approaches, they explicitly deal with the establishment of services and enter the narrow field in which law becomes particularly relevant for the profession of social work. Initially, it is shown which marked historical milestones the relationship between social work and the labor market/social policy in Germany has gone through. The practice-oriented contributions start with youth employment assistance and then enter the general field of labor promotion, which is again more strongly in the focus of attention of social work due to the current development. They present model projects of integrated and complex help to work, compare job centers in Great Britain with the model of the job center Cologne, or deal with qualification and employment societies. The book concludes with contributions that analyze the social and political development and venture a socio-pedagogical access to labor market and employment policy. The book thus offers a current orientation on the field of youth employment assistance and labor promotion. With contributions from Lothar Böhnisch, Heinz Burghardt, Lars Czommer, Claudia Dellori, Ruth Enggruber, Michael Galuske, Birgit Grosch, Matthias Knuth, Claus Reis, Wolfgang Schröer, Gabriele Schünemann, Oliver Schweer, Edeltraud Vomberg, Lutz Wende and Christian Wiglow	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162823-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055676-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002663-2>
Homeland, Craftsmanship, and the Utopia of the Everyday ¤ "Homeland" as a theme of architecture is a topos of the beginning of the twentieth century: reform movements turned against conditions and forms of industrialization as well as against the destruction of landscapes, village and city images. The time "around 1800" and rural building became examples of a new building in simple pre-industrial forms. The concepts of the home movement were followed in national socialism under a völkisch-ideologische Vorzeichen, regional building tradition is mediated in the sense of simplified patterns as exemplary.

Excitation energies and properties of open-shell singlet molecules : applications to a new class of molecules for nonlinear optics and singlet fission ¤ This brief investigates the diradical character, which is one of the ground-state chemical indices for "bond weakness" or "electron correlation" and which allows researchers to explore the origins of the electron-correlation-driven physico-chemical phenomena concerned with electronic, optical and magnetic properties as well as to control them in the broad fields of physics and chemistry. It then provides the theoretical fundamentals of ground and excited electronic structures of symmetric and asymmetric open-shell molecular systems by using model molecular systems. Moreover, it presents the theoretical design guidelines for a new class of open-shell singlet molecular systems for nonlinear optics (NLO) and singlet fission.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145676-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4310962-7>

Pattern matching for an object-oriented and dynamically typed programming language ¤ Pattern matching is a well-established concept in the functional programming community. It provides the means for concisely identifying and destructuring values of interest. This enables a clean separation of data structures and respective functionality, as well as dispatching functionality based on more than a single value. Unfortunately, expressive pattern matching facilities are seldomly incorporated in present object-oriented programming languages. We present a seamless integration of pattern matching facilities in an object-oriented and dynamically typed programming language: Newspeak. We describe language extensions to improve the practicability and integrate our additions with the existing programming environment for Newspeak. This report is based on the first author&rsquo;s master&rsquo;s thesis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4233947-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4307192-2>

Pro-poor macroeconomics : potential and limitations ¤ Economists increasingly agree on the nature of the development and social policies needed to halve poverty over the next ten years. A similar convergence is nowhere in sight in the case of macroeconomic policies. Disagreements in this area remain significant, exacerbated by rising financial instability and a string of banking and currency crises that impacted negatively on poverty, growing macro imbalances in some industrialized countries and the rapid development of difficult-to-regulate international financial markets. This volume presents a pro-poor macroeconomic policy allowing countries to recapture policy space, help promote growth, reduce inequality and diminish poverty in a sustainable way.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002963-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112701-8>

Plasma physics and controlled nuclear fusion ¤ The primary objectives of this book are, firstly, to present the essential theoretical background needed to understand recent fusion research and, secondly, to describe the current status of fusion research for graduate students and senior undergraduates. It will also serve as a useful reference for scientists and engineers working in the related fields. In Part I, Plasma Physics, the author explains the basics of magneto-hydrodynamics and kinetic theory in a simple and compact way and, at the same time, covers important new topics for fusion studies such as the ballooning representation, instabilities driven by energetic particles and various plasma models for computer simulations. Part II, Controlled Nuclear Fusion, attempts to review the "big picture" in fusion research. Mathematical derivations are comprehensively explained to better enable readers to later concentrate on the physics. All important phenomena and technologies are addressed, with a particular emphasis on the topics of most concern in current research.

Space, difference, everyday life : reading Henri Lefebvre ¤ In the past fifteen years, Henri Lefebvre's reputation has catapulted into the stratosphere, and he is now considered an equal to some of the greats of European social theory (Bourdieu, Deleuze, Harvey). In particular, his work has revitalized urban studies, geography and planning via concepts like; the social production of space, the right to the city, everyday life, and global urbanization. Lefebvre's massive body of work has generated two main schools of thought: one that is political economic, and another that is more culturally oriented and poststructuralist in tone. Space, Difference, and Everyday Life merges these two schools of thought into a unified Lefebvrian approach to contemporary urban issues and the nature of our spatialized social structures	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077811-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037764-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056754-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063234-9>

Investigation of TMP Fiber Quality for MDF Production: Final Report on the FNR Project "Fiber-Impact" (FKZ: 22013211) ¤ Project description: Despite its importance for the production process and properties of fiberboard, the quality of thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP) is principally determined with a haptic and visual inspection by skilled personnel, as adequate measurement systems are currently not available. This approach depends greatly on the person testing the material, and the results obtained are only quantifiable to a limited extent. Results are therefore unsuitable for objective product and process optimization. While the hardware and software of the automated image-based fiber analysis system applied were developed in the context of two previous projects, the current project aimed to investigate the influence of fiber composition and process parameters, particularly the refining parameters, on the fiber quality and the impact of the fiber quality on the properties of medium-density fiberboard (MDF). With this objective, characteristic values have been developed in order to quantify the fiber quality. Various fibers were produced and characterized. The obtained results were correlated with the parameters of the fiber production process as well as the mechanical properties of MDF made from these fibers. The scientific-technical results were verified in industrial trials when the measuring device was installed in the production process of an MDF manufacturer ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4560637-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047968-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4255886-4>

Industrial case study on the integration of SysML and AUTOSAR with triple graph grammars ¤ During the overall development of complex engineering systems different modeling notations are employed. For example, in the domain of automotive systems system engineering models are employed quite early to capture the requirements and basic structuring of the entire system, while software engineering models are used later on to describe the concrete software architecture. Each model helps in addressing the specific design issue with appropriate notations and at a suitable level of abstraction. However, when we step forward from system design to the software design, the engineers have to ensure that all decisions captured in the system design model are correctly transferred to the software engineering model. Even worse, when changes occur later on in either model, today the consistency has to be reestablished in a cumbersome manual step. In this report, we present in an extended version of [Holger Giese, Stefan Neumann, and Stephan Hildebrandt. Model Synchronization at Work: Keeping SysML and AUTOSAR Models Consistent. In Gregor Engels, Claus Lewerentz, Wilhelm Schäfer, Andy Schürr, and B. Westfechtel, editors, Graph Transformations and Model Driven Enginering - Essays Dedicated to Manfred Nagl on the Occasion of his 65th Birthday, volume 5765 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 555–579. Springer Berlin / Heidelberg, 2010.] how model synchronization and consistency rules can be applied to automate this task and ensure that the different models are kept consistent. We also introduce a general approach for model synchronization. Besides synchronization, the approach consists of tool adapters as well as consistency rules covering the overlap between the synchronized parts of a model and the rest. We present the model synchronization algorithm based on triple graph grammars in detail and further exemplify the general approach by means of a model synchronization solution between system engineering models in SysML and software engineering models in AUTOSAR which has been developed for an industrial partner. In the appendix as extension to [19] the meta-models and all TGG rules for the SysML to AUTOSAR model synchronization are documented.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7537632-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7616754-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132847-4>

A sharp interface finite volume method for elliptic equations on Cartesian grids ¤ We present a second order sharp interface finite volume method for the solution of the three-dimensional elliptic equation ... with variable coefficients on Cartesian grids. In particular, we focus on interface problems with discontinuities in the coefficient, the source term, the solution, and the fluxes across the interface. The method uses standard piecewise trilinear finite elements for normal cells and a double piecewise trilinear ansatz for the solution on cells intersected by the interface resulting always in a compact 27-point stencil. Singularities associated with vanishing partial volumes of intersected grid cells are removed by a two-term asymptotic approach. In contrast to the 2D method presented by two of the authors in [M. Oevermann, R. Klein: A Cartesian grid finite volume method for elliptic equations with variable coefficients and embedded interfaces, J. Comp. Phys. 219 (2006)] we use a minimization technique to determine the unknown coefficients of the double trilinear ansatz. This simplifies the treatment of the different cut-cell types and avoids additional special operations for degenerated interface topologies. The resulting set of linear equations has been solved with a BiCGSTAB solver preconditioned with an algebraic multigrid. In various testcases - including large [beta]-ratios and non-smooth interfaces - the method achieves second order of accuracy in the L∞ and L2 norm.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017233-8>

Investigating the impact of smart energy management system on the residential electricity consumption in Austria ¤ This paper addresses the following question: How can smart energy management system (SEMS) influence the residential electricity consumption at both individual household and national level? First, we developed an hourly optimization model for individual households. The energy cost of an individual household is minimized under given assumptions on outside temperature, radiation, (dynamic) electricity price, and feed-in tariff. By comparing the optimization to the reference scenario, we show the impact of SEMS on grid-electricity consumption and photovoltaic (PV) selfconsumption at the individual household level. Second, to aggregate the results to the national level, we constructed a detailed building stock taking Austria as an example. By aggregating the results of 2112 representative households, we investigate the impact of SEMS in the residential building stock on the national electricity system. As a result, we found that for individual single-family-houses (SFHs) with PV (no battery) and heat pump adoption, SEMS can significantly reduce the grid-electricity consumption up to 40.7% for a well-insulated building. At the national level we found that, for the buildings with 5 kWp PV but without hot water tank or battery storage, SEMS can still reduce the grid-electricity consumption by 7.4% by using the building mass as thermal storage.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1262853362> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136749-2>

Contrails : observations, formation mechanisms, atmospheric impacts, uncertainties ¤ Rez.: Aviation emissions represent one particular source sector that may contribute to climate change via contrail formation and increased cirrus cloudiness. However, these factors - aviation particulates and their impact on aerosols and clouds - are among those with the largest uncertainty. In terms of reducing these uncertainties, contrails and contrail-induced cirrus represent a scientific research priority area. This contribution reviews the current knowledge of contrail formation mechanisms, microphysical properties of contrails, potential atmospheric impacts, and major uncertainties, addressing observations and theory. This review has been written in cooperation with colleagues from the UK Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, the Hadly Centre for Climate Prediction, and the UK Meteorological Office.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4474072-4>

High-frequency averaging in semi-classical Hartree-type equations ¤ We investigate the asymptotic behavior of solutions to semi-classical Schröodinger equations with nonlinearities of Hartree type. For a weakly nonlinear scaling, we show the validity of an asymptotic superposition principle for slowly modulated highly oscillatory pulses. The result is based on a high-frequency averaging effect due to the nonlocal nature of the Hartree potential, which inhibits the creation of new resonant waves. In the proof we make use of the framework of Wiener algebras.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4278277-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190133-2>

Market competition in the nuclear industry ¤ Nuclear power plants require a wide variety of specialised equipment, materials and services for their construction, operation and fuelling. There has been much consolidation and retrenchment in the nuclear industry since the 1980s, with the emergence of some large global nuclear companies. Electricity market liberalisation in many OECD countries has meanwhile placed nuclear plant operators under increased competitive pressure.These structural changes in both the producer and consumer sides of the nuclear industry have had implications for the level of competition in the nuclear engineering and fuel cycle markets. With renewed expansion of nuclear power now anticipated, this study examines competition in the major nuclear industry sectors at present, and how this may change with a significant upturn in demand.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030318-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058136-6>
Fault-tolerant and decentralized lease coordination in distributed systems ¤ Applications which need exclusive access to a shared resource in distributed systems require a fault-tolerant and scalable mechanism to coordinate this exclusive access. Examples of such applications include distributed file systems and master/slave data replication. We present Flease, an algorithm for decentralized and fault-tolerant lease coordination in distributed systems. Our algorithm allows the processes competing for a resource to coordinate exclusive access through leases among themselves without a central component. The resulting system easily scales with an increasing number of nodes and resources. We prove that Flease ensures exclusive access, i.e. guarantees that there is at most one valid lease at any time.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4294597-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123192-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4742677-9>

Regulatory mechanisms of intracellular membrane transport ¤ This book deals with the molecular mechanisms of membrane trafficking, a central eukaryotic cell biological process. In the post-genomic era many essential molecules involved in intracellular membrane/protein transport are emerging. A huge task now is to compile the molecular networks that govern these processes. Understanding of regulatory processes and participating molecules are likely to reveal global cellular regulatory circuits that couple membrane trafficking with other cellular functions. Such cell biological features are only starting to emerge. This book puts special emphasis on such mechanisms and processes. The contents discusses the role of coat proteins, tethering complexes, small rab GTPases, Sec1-family proteins and SNARE molecule phosphorylation in exocytosis, endocytosis and membrane fusion. In addition, the role of lipids in vesicle formation and membrane fusion, and some specialized cell biological de novo membrane generation processes are discussed.

Rethinking 'identities' : cultural articulations of alterity and resistance in the new millennium ¤ This volume sets out to re-imagine the theoretical and epistemological presuppositions of existing scholarship on identities. Despite a well-established body of scholarly texts that examine the concept from a wide range of perspectives, there is a surprising dearth of work on multiple, heterogeneous forms of identity. Numerous studies of ethnic, linguistic, regional and religious identities have appeared, but largely in isolation from one another. Rethinking 'Identities' is a multi-authored project that is original in providing - in distributed and granular mode - a hyper-contemporary and wide-ranging applied analysis that questions notions of identity based on nation and region, language, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion or even 'the human'. The volume achieves this by mobilizing various contexts of identity (gender, ethnicity, sexuality, nation) and medium (art, cinema, literature, music, theatre, video). Emphasizing the extreme contemporary (the twenty-first century) and the challenges posed by an increasingly global society, this collection of essays builds upon existing intellectual investigations of identity with the aim of offering a fresh perspective that transcends cognitive and geographical frontiers	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4311101-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035964-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026482-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017102-4>

Guidance for packing, shipping, holding and release of sterile flies in area-wide fruit fly control programmes : Joint FAO/IAEA Programme of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture ¤ The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) is the international treaty under which the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) are adopted. ISPMs enable the development of technically justified measures for imported plants and plant products, and are intended to harmonize phytosanitary measures applied in international trade. These standards are the accepted reference under the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement). The use and transboundary shipment of sterile insects was not part of ISPM No. 3, "Code of Conduct for the Import and Release of Exotic Biological Control Agents" adopted in 1995, because biological control agents had been defined as self-replicating organisms. Since the implementation of the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) has largely been dominated by the public sector, this did not represent a problem for the transboundary shipment of sterile insects. However, the lack of regulatory framework did discourage private investment in the production and shipment of sterile insects.Over the last three years (2002-2005) ISPM No. 3 has undergone a major revision to update and broaden its scope. In particular, we have been involved in explicitly including sterile insects as beneficials in the revised standard. The revised ISPM No.3 "Guidelines for the Export, Shipment, Import, and Release of Biological Control Agents and Other Beneficial Organisms" was drafted in 2004 and submitted for country consultation. The revised ISPM No. 3 was adopted by the governing body of the IPPC, the Interim Commission for Phytosanitary Measures (ICPM), in April 2005 at FAO headquarters in Rome. Thus sterile insects are considered in parallel to other beneficial organisms by the IPPC through the adoption of the revised ISPM No. 3 and this should facilitate their use, especially in terms of commercialization of the SIT and international trade of sterile insects.--Publisher's description	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071480-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057338-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063118-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155333-0>

Filming the Gods : religion and Indian cinema ¤ Filming the Gods examines the role and depiction of religion in Indian cinema, showing that the relationship between the modern and the traditional in contemporary India is not exotic, but part of everyday life. Concentrating mainly on the Hindi cinema of Mumbai, Bollywood, it also discusses India's other cinemas. Rachel Dwyer's lively discussion encompasses the mythological genre which continues India's long tradition of retelling Hindu myths and legends, drawing on sources such as the national epics of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana; the devotional genre, which flourished at the height of the nationalist movement in the 1930s and 40s; and the films made in Bombay that depict India's Islamicate culture, including the historical, the courtesan film and the 'Muslim social' genre. Filming the Gods also examines the presence of the religious across other genres and how cinema represents religious communities and their beliefs and practices. It draws on interviews with film stars, directors and producers as well as popular fiction, fan magazines and the films themselves. As a result, Filming the Gods is a both a guide to the study of film in religious culture as well as a historical overview of Indian religious film 1. The mythological genre -- 2.

Magnificent buildings, splendid gardens ¤ Magnificent Buildings, Splendid Gardens returns to print some of the most important works of David Coffin, a leading authority on Renaissance architecture who, as one of the first scholars to apply the tools of art history to the study of gardens, became a founder of the discipline of garden and landscape studies. These essays span the wide range of Coffin's work, from Italian Renaissance architecture, garden design, sculpture, and drawings to English gardens and landscape designers of the seventeenth to early nineteenth centuries. Coffin's approaches are as varied as his subject matter. Some of these essays present the results of his archival research, including his discovery of crucial documents on the Emilian architect Giovan Battista Aleotti and the only documentary evidence identifying Vignola as the architect of the Villa Lante at Bagnaia. Other essays take a much broader cultural view, investigating, for example, the phenomenon of public access to private Renaissance gardens, elucidating the evolving meaning of images of the goddess Venus in English gardens, and identifying the significance of the decorative programs of monuments as diverse as the Villa Belvedere in Rome and the eighteenth-century gardens at Rousham in Oxfordshire.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044394-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138356-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019311-1>

Decreasing costs of renewables : insights on energy sector planning and climate policy from three country case studies ¤ This study builds on three case studies in Argentina, Indonesia and Mexico which analyse the implications of falling costs for renewable energy systems on the countries' energy sector planning and climate policy. Each case study consists of two country specific reports. The first report analyses how falling costs of renewable energy could impact country specific power sector development. The second report analyses the process of climate and renewable energy target setting, as well as the prevalent narrative around renewable energy integration. Finally, the present report provides a cross-country synthesis of all case studies, providing insights into the question of how falling costs of renewable energy systems might support the achievement of the goals of the Paris Agreement. Globally falling cost figures for solar PV and wind energy do not naturally translate into increased ambition in planning. The integration of these technologies to the energy system still face substantial barriers in our case study countries: The integration of higher shares of renewable energy goes along with investments into transmission and distribution network modernisation, network expansion and interconnections between power grids. Though an important element, falling costs for renewable energy projects alone do not necessarily translate into overall reduced power system costs. While globally falling costs for wind and solar PV are indicative for learning curve effects in the manufacturing of these technologies, the LCOE of renewable projects is highly sensitive to financing costs. These are largely determined by the local political and regulatory framework and remain high in our case countries, representing a barrier. We find that a number of regulatory and administrative barriers hinder higher integration of solar PV and wind. Frequently changing regulations and ill-designed support schemes often prevail over welldesigned renewable energy auction schemes that are followed over several years. We find the political economy fossil fuels to be pivotal in the energy sector and climate planning and target setting processes. Fossil fuel endowments and a long history of natural resource exploitation lead to strong vested interests towards sustaining the use of fossil fuels to satisfy a growing electricity demand...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032594-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068598-6>
Nonholonomic manipulators ¤ This focused monograph on nonholonomic manipulators builds upon an increasing interest in nonholonomic mechanical systems in robotics and control engineering. The scope of this book is the definition and development of new nonholonomic machines which are designed on the basis of nonlinear control theory for nonholonomic mechanical systems. A key feature of the work is the possibility to exploit nonholonomic theory to design innovative mechanical systems with a reduced number of actuators without reducing the size of their controllable space.

Magnetic particle imaging : an introduction to imaging principles and scanner instrumentation ¤ This volume provides a comprehensive overview of recent developments in magnetic particle imaging (MPI), a novel imaging modality. Using various static and oscillating magnetic fields, and tracer materials made from iron oxide nanoparticles, MPI can perform background-free measurements of the particles{u2019} local concentration. The method exploits the nonlinear remagnetization behavior of the particles and has the potential to surpass current methods for the detection of iron oxide in terms of sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution. Starting from an introduction to the technology, the topics addressed include setting up an imaging device, assessment of image quality, development of new MPI tracer materials, and the first preclinical results. This is the first book to be published on magnetic particle imaging, and it will be an invaluable source of information for everyone with an interest in this exciting new modality.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1023179504> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121550-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145435-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7704418-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4468562-2>

Rhetoric : an historical introduction ¤ This introduction to the art of rhetoric argues that knowledge of rhetoric improves deliberation about particular issues and problems. By mastering rhetorical concepts and modes of argument, readers can address the sometimes turbulent circumstances in their own lives, times, and fields of study. But because rhetoric speaks to the demands of the moment, it must be practiced with an understanding of its historical context. The author provides an intellectual frame for understanding the history and conceptual foundations of rhetoric and gives a strong sense of the ways classic rhetorical texts continue to influence us by providing contexts and resources for contemporary debates. The texts, which range from Aristotle's Rhetoric to Edward H. Levi's An Introduction to Legal Reasoning and Danielle S. Allen's Talking to Strangers serve simultaneously as models of persuasion and as thoughtful considerations of how rhetoric works.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076704-8>

Bubbles and crashes in experimental asset markets ¤ This book describes a laboratory experiment designed to test the causes and properties of bubbles in financial markets and explores the question whether it is possible to design markets which avoid such bubbles and crashes. In the experiment, subjects were given the opportunity to trade in a stock market modeled after the seminal work of Smith et al, (1988). To account for the increasing importance of online betting sites, subjects were also allowed to trade in a digital option market. The outcomes shed new light on how subjects form and update their expectations placing special emphasis on the bounded rationality of investors. Various analytical bubble measures found in the literature are collected, calculated, classified and presented for the first time. The very interesting new bubble measures 'Dispersion Ratio': 'Overpriced Transactions': 'Underpriced Transactions' are developed, making the book an important step towards the research goal of preventing bubbles and crashes in financial markets. In addition, the book formulates concrete new research hypotheses for future studies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195388-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4403080-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4450213-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130931-5>

Improving efficiency of coupled schemes for Navier-Stokes equations by a connection to grad-div stabilitzed projection methods ¤ We prove that in finite element settings where the divergence-free subspace of the velocity space has optimal approximation properties, the solution of Chorin/Temam projection methods for Navier-Stokes equations equipped with grad-div stabilization with parameter , converge to the associated coupled method solution with rate gamma as gamma -> ?. We prove this first for backward Euler schemes, and then extend the results to BDF2 schemes, and finally to schemes with outflow boundary conditions. Several numerical experiments are given which verify the convergence rate, and show how using projection methods in this setting with large grad-div stabilization parameters can dramatically improve accuracy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041456-5>

The surprising extent of both made Aceh, home to a long-standing independence movement, the next potential candidate after East Timor to break away from Indonesia, and led to harsh repressive measures by the military. The tsunami of December 2004 brought incalculable destruction and loss to Aceh. At the same time, it brought international sympathy and aid on an unprecedented scale, along with new pressures for peace. In August 2005 Indonesia and Aceh signed a peace agreement designed to put an end to the conflict. This book offers a guide to the complexities of modern Aceh as it moves toward peace and reconstruction. The balanced coverage by leading authorities, historians and political scientists as well as journalists, probes the underlying causes of the conflict that has pitted Aceh against Jakarta. It shows why the Acehnese entered the Indonesian republic in 1945 with an unparalleled determination to resist outside domination, and how these attitudes have shaped Aceh's relations with Indonesia.

Equation of state of uranium dioxide : data collection ¤ The monograph deals with the thermodynamic properties of fluid uranium dioxide, one of the most investigated materials of the last century, up to its critical point. It presents an exhaustive theoretical introduction to 'quasi-chemical' models of liquids, as well as their behaviour under non-congruent vaporisation conditions. Particular emphasis is given to the properties of pure Coulombic systems and to the pseudoparticle approach, which enables the partition function to be expressed in a simple, but physically rigorous formulation. The construction of the equation of state of stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric uranium dioxide is described in distinct steps, from a critical assessment of the theoretical fundamentals to a thorough review of the pertinent thermochemical and thermophysical data. Calculations of the thermodynamic properties of UO2+x are performed for temperatures up to 11,000 K both for the condensed and gas phase. More than one hundred tables are collected in the Appendix containing all relevant thermodynamic data	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068158-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017690-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187163-7>

An introduction to Buddhist ethics : foundations, values and issues ¤ This systematic introduction to Buddhist ethics is aimed at anyone interested in Buddhism, including students, scholars and general readers. Peter Harvey is the author of the acclaimed Introduction to Buddhism (Cambridge, 1990), and his new book is written in a clear style, assuming no prior knowledge. At the same time it develops a careful, probing analysis of the nature and practical dynamics of Buddhist ethics in both its unifying themes and in the particularities of different Buddhist traditions. The book applies Buddhist ethics to a range of issues of contemporary concern: humanity's relationship with the rest of nature; economics; war and peace; euthanasia; abortion; the status of women; and homosexuality. Professor Harvey draws on texts of the main Buddhist traditions, and on historical and contemporary accounts of the behaviour of Buddhists, to describe existing Buddhist ethics, to assess different views within it, and to extend its application into new areas.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015602-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008690-2>

The Environmental Protection Economy in Germany: Production, Sales, and Foreign Trade ¤ Environmental and, in particular, climate protection are increasingly becoming the focus of political and public debate worldwide. This development is not only reflected in rising costs and investments for environmental purposes but also in a growing economic relevance of environmental protection. This study examines the German environmental industry using various indicators on the development of production and sales as well as on international competitiveness. While the production of potential environmental goods grew at an above-average rate between 2013 and 2016, this trend reversed in 2017. This is due primarily to massive drops in the production of wind energy goods. In addition to the increased price and competitive pressure in the wind industry, this also reflects the transition to competitive tendering procedures. This confirms that the markets for environmental protection goods, particularly those for renewable energies, are still strongly influenced by national regulations and promotion policies. In foreign trade with potential environmental goods, Germany still depicts clear specialisation advantages in all environmental areas and almost all world regions, even if the advantages for climate protection goods have declined somewhat as a result of the unfavourable development in renewable energies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4318475-3>

The evolution of automotive technology : a handbook ¤ This book covers one and a quarter century of the automobile, conceived as a cultural history of its technology, aimed at engineering students and all those who wish to have a concise introduction into the basics of automotive technology and its long-term development. Its approach is systemic and includes the behavior of drivers, producers, nonusers, victims, and other "stakeholders" as well as the discourse around mobility. Nowadays, students of innovation prefer the term co-evolution, emphasizing the parallel and mutually dependent development of technology and society. This acknowledges the importance of contingency and of the impact of the past upon the present, the very reason why The Evolution of Automotive Technology: A Handbook looks at car technology from a long-term perspective. Often we will conclude that the innovation was in the (re)arrangement of existing technologies. Since its beginnings, car manufacturers have brought a total of 1 billion automobiles to the market. We are currently witnessing an explosion toward the second billion. Looking back, we can see this history evolve through five distinctive phases: Emergence (1880-1917), Persistence (1917-1940), Exuberance (1945-1973), Doom (1973-2000), Confusion (2001-present). The Evolution of Automotive Technology: A Handbook helps us understand how these phases impacted society and, in turn, shows us how car technology was influenced by car users themselves.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165423-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165441-9>

It will be demonstrated that 'humanitarian intervention' and R2P are evoked in the news media if so called 'enemy' countries of Western states conduct human rights violations. The Western news media shows far less concern for human rights violations if they are conducted by Western states and their 'allies'. The news media is supposed to scrutinize governments particularly during times of war. Yet, this study demonstrates that the news media plays a crucial role in facilitating a selective process of shaming during the build-up towards military interventions. This process has led to an erosion of internationally agreed norms of non-intervention, as enshrined in the UN Charter".--Provided by publisher	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169187-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033114-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4547508-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4731075-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4276272-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033120-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067510-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005709-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7849660-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1041651422> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137568-3>
Automotive production systems and standardisation : from Ford to the case of Mercedes-Benz ¤ The introduction of the Mercedes-Benz Production System (MPS) is exemplary of a trend within the automotive industry: the creation and introduction of company-specific standardised production systems. This book contributes to the debate about production systems by examining the social and economic implications of the role of standardisation in production systems. In this context it addresses three core issues: First, the driving forces behind the changing forms and functions of standardisation and the role of institutions therein. Second, the impact of standardisation on the evolution of automotive production systems. Third, based on the author's own empirical research conducted over a three year period at the Mercedes-Benz plant Stuttgart-Untertürkheim/Germany, the book examines the influence of standardisation on the work of actors on the shop floor in terms of organisational learning processes and the regulation of work.

Trauma and survival in contemporary fiction ¤ In an exploration of how contemporary fiction narratives represent trauma―that response to events so overwhelmingly intense that normal responses become impaired―Laurie Vickroy engages a wealth of the twentieth century’s most striking literature. Toni Morrison’s Beloved and Jazz, Marguerite Duras’s The Lover, Dorothy Allison’s Bastard out of Carolina, Jamaica Kincaid’s The Autobiography of My Mother, and Larry Heinemann’s Paco’s Story, among others, are the source of Vickroy’s study investigating the complex relationship between sociocultural influences and intimate personal relations portrayed in trauma fiction and how those portrayals direct this difficult material to readers. Vickroy’s study is unique in its use of trauma, postcolonial, and object relations theories to illuminate the cultural aspects of traumatic experience that shape relationships, identity formation, and the possibilities for symbolization. Vickroy argues that contemporary trauma narratives are indeed personalized responses to this century’s emerging awareness of the catastrophic effects on the individual psyche of wars, poverty, colonization, and domestic abuse. She examines these texts as postcolonial attempts to rearticulate the lives and voices of marginalized people, to reject Western conceptions of the autonomous subject, and to recognize the complex negotiations of multicultural social relations. Trauma is a compelling and evocative topic in the contemporary world and as reflected in its literature.

Industrial case study on the integration of SysML and AUTOSAR with triple graph grammars ¤ During the overall development of complex engineering systems different modeling notations are employed. For example, in the domain of automotive systems system engineering models are employed quite early to capture the requirements and basic structuring of the entire system, while software engineering models are used later on to describe the concrete software architecture. Each model helps in addressing the specific design issue with appropriate notations and at a suitable level of abstraction. However, when we step forward from system design to the software design, the engineers have to ensure that all decisions captured in the system design model are correctly transferred to the software engineering model. Even worse, when changes occur later on in either model, today the consistency has to be reestablished in a cumbersome manual step. In this report, we present in an extended version of [Holger Giese, Stefan Neumann, and Stephan Hildebrandt. Model Synchronization at Work: Keeping SysML and AUTOSAR Models Consistent. In Gregor Engels, Claus Lewerentz, Wilhelm Schäfer, Andy Schürr, and B. Westfechtel, editors, Graph Transformations and Model Driven Enginering - Essays Dedicated to Manfred Nagl on the Occasion of his 65th Birthday, volume 5765 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 555–579. Springer Berlin / Heidelberg, 2010.] how model synchronization and consistency rules can be applied to automate this task and ensure that the different models are kept consistent. We also introduce a general approach for model synchronization. Besides synchronization, the approach consists of tool adapters as well as consistency rules covering the overlap between the synchronized parts of a model and the rest. We present the model synchronization algorithm based on triple graph grammars in detail and further exemplify the general approach by means of a model synchronization solution between system engineering models in SysML and software engineering models in AUTOSAR which has been developed for an industrial partner. In the appendix as extension to [19] the meta-models and all TGG rules for the SysML to AUTOSAR model synchronization are documented.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7616754-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7537632-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132847-4>

Analyzing uncertainty in civil engineering : with 23 tables ¤ This volume comprehensively addresses the issue of uncertainty in civil engineering, from design to construction. Current engineering practice often leaves uncertainty issues aside, despite the fact that new scientific tools have been developed in the past decades that allow a rational description of uncertainties of all kinds, from model uncertainty to data uncertainty. It is the aim of this volume to take a critical look at current engineering risk concepts in order to raise awareness of uncertainty in numerical computations, shortcomings of a strictly probabilistic safety concept, geotechnical models of failure and their construction implications, actual construction, and legal responsibility. In addition, a number of the new procedures for modelling uncertainty are explained. The book is a result of a collaborate effort of mathematicians, engineers and construction managers who met regularly in a post-graduate seminar at the University of Innsbruck during the past years	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4273405-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004955-3>

High-frequency averaging in semi-classical Hartree-type equations ¤ We investigate the asymptotic behavior of solutions to semi-classical Schröodinger equations with nonlinearities of Hartree type. For a weakly nonlinear scaling, we show the validity of an asymptotic superposition principle for slowly modulated highly oscillatory pulses. The result is based on a high-frequency averaging effect due to the nonlocal nature of the Hartree potential, which inhibits the creation of new resonant waves. In the proof we make use of the framework of Wiener algebras.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4278277-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190133-2>

A new fictitious domain method in shape optimization ¤ The present paper is concerned with investigating the capability of the smoothness preserving fictitious domain method from [22] to shape optimization problems. We consider the problem of maximizing the Dirichlet energy functional in the class of all simply connected domains with fixed volume, where the state equation involves an elliptic second order differential operator with non-constant coefficients. Numerical experiments in two dimensions validate that we arrive at a fast and robust algorithm for the solution of the considered class of problems. The proposed method keeps applicable for three dimensional shape optimization problems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4329076-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1103156357> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1148581448>

Beyond the Bubble : the new Japanese architecture ¤ Beyond the Bubble examines two contrasting, but equally extraordinary, phases in the recent history of Japanese architecture: the explosive 'Bubble' era of the 1980s and early 1990s, and the post-Bubble years leading up to the present day. The first period - often referred to as the 'new golden age of Japanese architecture' - witnessed a spectacular proliferation of unusual buildings and urban complexes in Japan's major cities, while the latter has seen work demonstrating a sense of modesty, restraint and environmental innovation. Botond Bognar's fascinating study of this remarkable period is divided into two parts. The first section, an essay entitled 'The Bubble Years: The Epitome of Japanese Postmodernism' discusses and illustrates the elaborate architectural projects produced during the 1980s and 90s. More recent projects, mainly from the twenty-first century, are introduced in the second part - 'After the Bubble: New Realities, New Priorities' - as detailed individual studies, accompanied by a wide range of plans, drawings and photographs.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>

Partial differential equations ¤ This self-contained text offers an elementary introduction to partial differential equations (pdes), primarily focusing on linear equations, but also providing some perspective on nonlinear equations. The classical treatment is mathematically rigorous with a generally theoretical layout, though indications to some of the physical origins of pdes are made throughout in references to potential theory, similarity solutions for the porous medium equation, generalized Riemann problems, and others. The material begins with a focus on the Cauchy-Kowalewski theorem, discussing the notion of characteristic surfaces to classify pdes. Next, the Laplace equation and connected elliptic theory are treated, as well as integral equations and solutions to eigenvalue problems. The heat equation and related parabolic theory are then presented, followed by the wave equation in its basic aspects. An introduction to conservation laws, the uniqueness theorem, viscosity solutions, ill-posed problems, and nonlinear equations of first order round out the key subject matter. Large parts of this revised second edition have been streamlined and rewritten to incorporate years of classroom feedback, correct errors, and improve clarity. Most of the necessary background material has been incorporated into the complements and certain nonessential topics have been given reduced attention (noticeably, numerical methods) to improve the flow of presentation. The exposition is replete with examples, problems and solutions that complement the material to enhance understanding and solidify comprehension. The only prerequisites are advanced differential calculus and some basic Lp theory. The work can serve as a text for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics, physics, engineering, and the natural sciences, as well as an excellent reference for applied mathematicians and mathematical physicists.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044779-0>

Making Mental Health Count : The Social and Economic Costs of Neglecting Mental Health Care ¤ Despite the enormous burden that mental ill-health imposes on individuals, their families, society, health systems and the economy, mental health care remains a neglected area of health policy in too many countries. Mental disorders represent a considerable disease burden, and have a significant impact on the lives of the OECD population, and account for considerable direct and indirect costs. This report argues that even in those OECD countries with a long history of deinstitutionalisation, there is still a long way to go to make community-based mental health care that achieves good outcomes for people with severe mental illness a reality. The disproportionate focus on severe mental illness has meant that mild-to-moderate mental illnesses, which makes up the largest burden of disease, have remained overwhelmingly neglected. This book addresses the high cost of mental illness, weaknesses and innovative developments in the organisation of care, changes and future directions for the mental health workforce, the need to develop better indicators for mental health care and quality, and tools for better governance of the mental health system. The high burden of mental ill health and the accompanying costs in terms of reduced quality of life, loss of productivity, and premature mortality, mean that making mental health count for all OECD countries is a priority.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055720-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047686-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187104-2>
A quasilinear differential inclusion for viscous and rate-independent damage systems in non-smooth domains ¤ This paper focuses on rate-independent damage in elastic bodies. Since the driving energy is nonconvex, solutions may have jumps as a function of time, and in this situation it is known that the classical concept of energetic solutions for rate-independent systems may fail to accurately describe the behavior of the system at jumps. Therefore, we resort to the (by now well-established) vanishing viscosity approach to rate-independent modeling and approximate the model by its viscous regularization. In fact, the analysis of the latter PDE system presents remarkable difficulties, due to its highly nonlinear character. We tackle it by combining a variational approach to a class of abstract doubly nonlinear evolution equations, with careful regularity estimates tailored to this specific system relying on a q-Laplacian type gradient regularization of the damage variable. Hence, for the viscous problem we conclude the existence of weak solutions satisfying a suitable energy-dissipation inequality that is the starting point for the vanishing viscosity analysis. The latter leads to the notion of (weak) parameterized solution to our rate-independent system, which encompasses the in uence of viscosity in the description of the jump regime.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128900-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193856-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4221363-0>
Dissipative phenomena in condensed matter : some applications ¤ From the field of nonequilibrium statistical physics, this graduate- and research-level volume treats the modeling and characterization of dissipative phenomena. A variety of examples from diverse disciplines like condensed matter physics, materials science, metallurgy, chemical physics etc. are discussed. Dattagupta employs the broad framework of stochastic processes and master equation techniques to obtain models for a wide range of experimentally relevant phenomena such as classical and quantum Brownian motion, spin dynamics, kinetics of phase ordering, relaxation in glasses, dissipative tunneling. It provides a pedagogical exposition of current research material and will be useful to experimentalists, computational physicists and theorists.

Metamorphoses of Hamiltonian systems with symmetries ¤ Modern notions and important tools of classical mechanics are used in the study of concrete examples that model physically significant molecular and atomic systems. The parametric nature of these examples leads naturally to the study of the major qualitative changes of such systems (metamorphoses) as the parameters are varied. The symmetries of these systems, discrete or continuous, exact or approximate, are used to simplify the problem through a number of mathematical tools and techniques like normalization and reduction. The book moves gradually from finding relative equilibria using symmetry, to the Hamiltonian Hopf bifurcation and its relation to monodromy and, finally, to generalizations of monodromy.

An abstraction for version control systems ¤ Version Control Systems (VCS) allow developers to manage changes to software artifacts. Developers interact with VCSs through a variety of client programs, such as graphical front-ends or command line tools. It is desirable to use the same version control client program against different VCSs. Unfortunately, no established abstraction over VCS concepts exists. Instead, VCS client programs implement ad-hoc solutions to support interaction with multiple VCSs. This thesis presents Pur, an abstraction over version control concepts that allows building rich client programs that can interact with multiple VCSs. We provide an implementation of this abstraction and validate it by implementing a client application.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4520996-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4254804-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4303846-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4202033-5>

Laser sintering with plastics : technology, processes, and materials ¤ Laser Sintering (LS) with plastics is one of the most promising additive manufacturing technologies: it is currently regarded as the process most likely in the future to permanently cross the border between prototyping and the production of functional parts. This step is challenging because it means that the technology must meet certain requirements that are also valid for traditional and established production processes. Only by succeeding at this step can a wide industry acceptance of LS be expected in the future. In this context, this book covers all levels of the LS process chain, including: - Current state of the machine technology - Essential process steps, both before and during sintering - Specific demands of the materials, powder production methods, and evaluation of powder properties - Mechanical properties and density of the parts produced by LS Examples of LS-produced parts are given, including those with special design features, to illustrate the characteristics and also the limitations of the LS method. In particular, the distinct advantages of LS parts over parts produced with other plastics processing methods (e.g., injection molding) are discussed--	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166071-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4803022-3>
Geometric optics on phase space ¤ Symplectic geometry, well known as the basic structure of Hamiltonian mechanics, is also the foundation of optics. In fact, optical systems (geometric or wave) have an even richer symmetry structure than mechanical ones (classical or quantum). The symmetries underlying the geometric model of light are based on the symplectic group. Geometric Optics on Phase Space develops both geometric optics and group theory from first principles in their Hamiltonian formulation on phase space. This treatise provides the mathematical background and also collects a host of useful methods of practical importance, particularly the fractional Fourier transform currently used for image processing. The reader will appreciate the beautiful similarities between Hamilton's mechanics and this approach to optics. The appendices link the geometry thus introduced to wave optics through Lie methods.

Decreasing costs of renewables : implications for Indonesia's climate targets ¤ The unconditional target of Indonesia's NDC foresees a reduction of GHG emissions of 29% relative to a Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario, to reach 2034 MtCO2eq in 2030. It further specifies that the energy sector shall take a share of 37.6% of this mitigation effort to reduce emissions by 18.8% relative to BAU, reaching 1355 MtCO2eq emissions in 2030. This study analyses how falling cost projections of renewable energy technologies (solar PV and wind energy) could inform energy sector and climate change mitigation plans of Indonesia. We show that cost projections valid for Indonesia for renewable energies have dramatically fallen over the past years. Costs projected for 2030 a couple of years ago are well undercut by more recent projections for 2030. Recent cost projections for 2030 for wind energy are 31% lower than projections dating from 2015, solar PV cost projections have fallen by 49% on average. If falling costs for renewables are considered, the renewable capacities given in RUEN (the National Energy Master Plan) could be revised at constant investments. The overall renewable energy capacity given in RUEN for 2030 could be increased from 70 GW to 85 GW. Solar PV would become the dominant source of renewable energy, wind energy would slightly surpass geothermal power generation. This increase in renewable capacities could inform the revision of Indonesia's NDC. If falling cost projections of renewables are considered, the unconditional target could be reduced from 2034 MtCO2eq to 2005 MtCO2eq at constant costs. This corresponds an increase from 29% to 30.1% reduction and presents a 9.1% increase in the ambition of the energy sector.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032594-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068598-6>

The Renaissance of Jewish Culture in Weimar Germany ¤ Verlagsinfo: Although Jewish participation in German society increased after World War I, Jews did not completely assimilate into that society. In fact, says Michael Brenner in this intriguing book, the Jewish population of Weimar Germany became more aware of its Jewishness and created new forms of German-Jewish culture in literature, music, fine arts, education, and scholarship. Brenner presents the first in-depth study of this culture, drawing a fascinating portrait of people in the midst of redefining themselves. The Weimar Jews chose neither a radical break with the past nor a return to the past but instead dressed Jewish traditions in the garb of modern forms of cultural expression. Brenner describes, for example, how modern translations made classic Jewish texts accessible, Jewish museums displayed ceremonial artifacts in a secular framework, musical arrangements transformed synagogue liturgy for concert audiences, and popular novels recalled aspects of the Jewish past. Brenner's work, while bringing this significant historical period to life, illuminates contemporary Jewish issues. The preservation and even enhancement of Jewish distinctiveness, combined with the seemingly successful participation of Jews in a secular, non-Jewish society, offer fresh insight into modern questions of Jewish existence, identity, and integration into other cultures.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065109-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125698-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028808-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033542-2>

Between Babel and Pentecost : transnational Pentecostalism in Africa and Latin America ¤ Over the past two decades, Latin American and African countries have experienced a phenomenal growth of Pentecostal movements. This form of Christianity, only marginally present in these areas in the middle of the 20th century, is now embraced by more than a hundred million faithful across two continents and continues to grow at an astonishing rate. Despite the enormous differences which separate these lands and the individual societies within them, one is struck by the similarity of Pentecostal manifestations in these diverse cultures. Contemporary Pentecostalism provides a striking example of the paradox of difference and uniformity, of flow and closure, that seems to be at the heart of processes of transnationalism and globalization. The rapid growth of Pentecostal movements in the urban centers of the developing world has captured the attention of many scholars in the fields of Latin American and African studies. However, much of the literature focuses on individual areas and countries, and there has been relatively little comparative or cross-cultural study of these movements. This book considers the important transnational character of such movements and their tendency to foster identities that transcend national and cultural contexts. Researchers from various disciplines describe Pentecostal movements in Latin America and Africa from different perspectives.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136841-1>

Reading the everyday ¤ Drawing on the work of continental theorists such as Henri Lefebvre, Michel de Certeau, Marc Auge and Siegfried Kracauer, Joe Moran explores the concrete sites and routines of everyday life and their representation in political debate, news media, material culture, sitcoms, reality TV shows, photography, CCTV and webcams. Moran aims to rethink notions of everyday life within cultural studies, which have traditionally focused on questions of popular culture, consumption and lifestyle. He investigates some of the most under-explored, banal aspects of quotidian culture, such as office life, commuting, car parking, motorways, new towns and mass housing. Reading the Everyday shows that analysing supposedly 'boring' phenomena can help us to make sense of cultural and social change; and it argues that the everyday has become a space for a new kind of 'post-political' politics which has obscured profound changes in work, domestic and public space.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001307-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125858-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4424590-7>

Photovoltaic Solar Energy Generation ¤ This book provides a comprehensive description of photovoltaics (PV). The presentation is not at an advanced technical level and will be accessible to any interested academic person. Starting with the history of PV, the text outlines its relevance today and in the future. Then follows an introduction to the physical background of solar cells and the most important materials and technologies. Particular emphasis is placed on future developments and prospects from the viewpoint of a well-informed observer. The book goes beyond technology by also describing the path from the cell to the module to the system. It proceeds to the most important present and future applications, such as grid-connected and stand-alone systems. The composition and development of the markets and the role of PV in future energy systems will be considered. Finally, the discussion turns to the future energy supply structure, expected to move towards more distributed generation, and addresses synergies and possible competition from other carbon-free energy sources.

Sequential disaster forensics : an application to floods in the city of Grimma ¤ Disaster risk and losses have been steadily rising in the past decades, highlighting the need to learn from past events. Only a better understanding of the fundamental causes of natural disasters and its impacts on societies can lead to an effective prevention and reduction of disaster risk. In this context, disaster forensics focuses on the analysis and interaction of risk factors (i.e. hazard, exposure, vulnerability and coping capacity) and the identification of underlying risk drivers, in order to tackle them through dedicated action. Results from forensic analysis are twofold: On the one hand, context-specific knowledge to decide on appropriate and evidence-based Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) measures to mitigate current risk and prevent future one. On the other hand, more generalizable knowledge and evidence on how disaster risk is generated and on the effectiveness of applied DRR measures. In this work, we explore results of disaster forensics through a case study of subsequent floods in 2002 and 2013 in the city of Grimma, Saxony, in Germany. Risk factors are investigated to identify their contribution in increasing or reducing disaster damage, in conjunction with socio-economic impacts on age structure and migration in the mostly affected inner city of Grimma. In particular, we analyse: (i) How much the sequential application of disaster forensics contributes to a better understanding of risk and the identification of the causes of disasters impacts; and (ii) what data are required for performing a disaster forensic analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4202680-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137042-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186634-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124897-1>

Patron-driven acquisitions : history and best practices ¤ About 40 percent of the books academic libraries purchase in traditional ways never circulate and another 40 percent circulate fewer than three times. By contrast, patron-driven acquisition allows a library to borrow or buy books only when a patron needs them. In a typical workflow, the library imports bibliographic records into its catalogue at no cost. When a patron finds a patron-driven record in the course of research, a short-term loan can allow him to borrow the book, and the transaction charge to the library will be a small percentage of list price. Typically a library will automatically buy a book on a third or fourth use. The contributions in this volume, written by experts, describe the genesis and brief history of patron-driven acquisitions, its current status, and its promise. --- David A.

Dynamic optimization and differential games ¤ DYNAMIC OPTIMIZATION AND DIFFERENTIAL GAMES has been written to address the increasing number of Operations Research and Management Science problems (that is, applications) that involve the explicit consideration of time and of gaming among multiple agents. It is a book that will be used both as a textbook and as a reference and guide to engineers, operation researchers, applied mathematicians and social scientists whose work involves the theoretical aspects of dynamic optimization and differential games. Included throughout the text are detailed explanations of several original dynamic and game-theoretic mathematical models, which are of particular relevance in today's technologically-driven-global economy: revenue management, supply chain management, electric power systems, urban freight systems, dynamic congestion pricing, dynamic traffic assignment, electronic commerce and the Internet. In addition, there will be some more traditional applications with useful pedagogical content included in Chapter 1. The book combines an emphasis on deterministic models and methods along with an introduction to stochastic optimal control and stochastic differential games. And most important, the book covers both theory and applications. It develops the key results of deterministic, continuous time, optimal control theory from both the classical calculus of variations perspectives and the more modern approach of infinite dimensional mathematical programming. Infinite dimensional mathematical programming provides greater utility for solving continuous-time-differential-game problems	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125677-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012253-0>

Econocide : British slavery in the era of abolition ¤ Cliff notes of the 2nd edition: In this classic analysis and refutation of Eric Williams's 1944 thesis, Seymour Drescher argues that Britain's abolition of the slave trade in 1807 resulted not from the diminishing value of slavery for Great Britain but instead from the British public's mobilization against the slave trade, which forced London to commit what Drescher terms "econocide." This action, he argues, was detrimental to Britain's economic interests at a time when British slavery was actually at the height of its potential. Originally published in 1977, Drescher's work was instrumental in undermining the economic determinist interpretation of abolitionism that had dominated historical discourse for decades following World War II. For this second edition, which includes a foreword by David Brion Davis, Drescher has written a new preface, reflecting on the historiography of the British slave trade since this book's original publication.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055260-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200586-3>

Metric temporal graph logic over typed attributed graphs ¤ BEGIN Various kinds of typed attributed graphs are used to represent states of systems from a broad range of domains. For dynamic systems, established formalisms such as graph transformations provide a formal model for defining state sequences. We consider the extended case where time elapses between states and introduce a logic to reason about these sequences. With this logic we express properties on the structure and attributes of states as well as on the temporal occurrence of states that are related by their inner structure, which no formal logic over graphs accomplishes concisely so far. Firstly, we introduce graphs with history by equipping every graph element with the timestamp of its creation and, if applicable, its deletion. Secondly, we define a logic on graphs by integrating the temporal operator until into the well-established logic of nested graph conditions. Thirdly, we prove that our logic is equally expressive to nested graph conditions by providing a suitable reduction. Finally, the implementation of this reduction allows for the tool-based analysis of metric temporal properties for state sequences. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4021842-9>

Modeling spatial and economic impacts of disasters : with ... 40 tables ¤ This book brings together a collection of innovative papers on strategies for analyzing the spatial and economic impacts of disasters. Natural and human-induced disasters pose several challenges for conventional modeling. For example, disasters entail complex linkages between the natural, built, and socio-economic environments. They often create chaos and economic disequilibrium, and can also cause unexpected long-term, structural changes. Dynamic interactions among agents and behavioral adjustments in a disaster become complicated. The papers in this volume make notable progress in tackling these challenges through refinements of conventional methods, as well as new modeling frameworks and multidisciplinary, integrative strategies. The papers also provide case study applications that afford new insights on disaster processes and loss reduction strategies	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029929-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043212-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121557-6>
Multiscale analysis and nonlinear dynamics : from genes to the brain ¤ Since modeling multiscale phenomena in systems biology and neuroscience is a highly interdisciplinary task, the editor of the book invited experts in bio-engineering, chemistry, cardiology, neuroscience, computer science, and applied mathematics, to provide their perspectives. Each chapter is a window into the current state of the art in the areas of research discussed and the book is intended for advanced researchers interested in recent developments in these fields. While multiscale analysis is the major integrating theme of the book, its subtitle does not call for bridging the scales from genes to behavior, but rather stresses the unifying perspective offered by the concepts referred to in the title. It is believed that the interdisciplinary approach adopted here will be beneficial for all the above mentioned fields	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4809615-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7555119-6>

Enhancing the Performance of the Services Sector ¤ The services sector now accounts for over 70% of employment and value added in OECD economies. It also accounts for almost all employment growth in the OECD area. But despite its growing weight in OECD economies, productivity growth and employment rates in services remain low in many OECD countries. This report provides an overview of the role of services in economic performance, and the factors that affect services sector performance. This includes the role of labour and product markets, the impact of barriers to trade in services, the role of innovation in services and the impacts of information and communications technology (ICT) on the services sector. The report also includes a paper presenting case studies of successful services firms, which help illustrate the broader analysis from OECD data.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012183-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058136-6>

Control of violence : historical and international perspectives on violence in modern societies ¤ Modern societies are increasingly confronted with forms of violence that appear unpredictable and uncontrollable. Are the existing control regimes such as police, state surveillance institutions, and legal systems able to effectively contain phenomena such as school shootings, terrorism, or violence in fragile states, and what would help them become more effective? What is the relationship between state rule and self-control in limiting violence? Taking an historically and internationally comparative perspective, the contributors to this innovative book examine these violent phenomena as well as the preconditions and mechanisms of their control. Taking into consideration the fundamentally ambivalent character of control, they explore how institutions and strategies of control retroact on and thus re-shape societies. Moreover, they address general aspects of violence control in modern societies such as the concept of individual self-control, the impact of changing social institutions and the role of religion. The contributions to this volume explore violence on the micro-, meso-, and macro-levels of social organization, creating a cohesive theoretical framework for understanding violence on each of these levels. Control of Violence in Modern Sociations will be of great interest to researchers studying violence, particularly to those studying the phenomenon in a global context, be it from a criminological, a sociological or from a public health perspective. -- From the Back Cover	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055719-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112701-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020832-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020588-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157237-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056648-1>

A charging infrastructure network for battery electric trucks in Europe ¤ Facing climate change, The European Union has set ambitious greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets. Within Europe, heavy-duty vehicles (HDV) account for a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector and therefore plays a central role in achieving the climate targets. A potential solution to reduce GHG emissions is the use of battery electric vehicles (BEV). However, the limited range of BEV requires a European public fast-charging network to ensure widespread deployment of BEV. Here, European road freight transport flows are modelled based on the publicly available European Transport policy Information System (ETISplus) dataset. The resulting truck flows serve as input for a charging infrastructure network model. Potential charging stations are located using a coverage-oriented approach and sized according to a queuing model such that an average waiting time of five minutes is guaranteed at each location. Our results show that for a share of 15% BEV in HDV stock and a dense network with charging locations every 50 km, a total of 4,067 charging points at 1,640 locations are required by 2030. In contrast, with a share of 5% BEV and charging locations every 100 km, 1,715 charging points are needed at 812 locations. Our findings provide insights for the design of a public fastcharging network in Europe and thus supports the planning of future infrastructure projects.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062953-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1023745712> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151795-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022492-2>

Parts without a whole? : the current state of Design Thinking practice in organizations ¤ This explorative study gives a descriptive overview of what organizations do and experience when they say they practice design thinking. It looks at how the concept has been appropriated in organizations and also describes patterns of design thinking adoption. The authors use a mixed-method research design fed by two sources: questionnaire data and semi-structured personal expert interviews. The study proceeds in six parts: (1) design thinking¹s entry points into organizations; (2) understandings of the descriptor; (3) its fields of application and organizational localization; (4) its perceived impact; (5) reasons for its discontinuation or failure; and (6) attempts to measure its success. In conclusion the report challenges managers to be more conscious of their current design thinking practice. The authors suggest a co-evolution of the concept¹s introduction with innovation capability building and the respective changes in leadership approaches. It is argued that this might help in unfolding design thinking¹s hidden potentials as well as preventing unintended side-effects such as discontented teams or the dwindling authority of managers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165549-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1052824455> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027089-0>

Oral poetry : its nature, significance and social context ¤ Oral poetry is a wide subject that ranges from American 'folk-songs', Eskimo lyrics or popular songs, to the heroic poems of Homer and distinct epic composers in Asia and the Pacific. Unlike previous works, this book takes a broad comparative view and considers oral poetry from Africa, Asia and Oceania as well as Europe and America. Dr Finnegan includes in her argument the results of topical research from all over the world, thus illuminating and suggesting fresh conclusions to many controversies: the nature of 'oral tradition'; possible connections between types of poetry and types of society; the differences between oral and written communication; and the role of poets in non-literate societies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077624-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040600-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015025-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036774-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135284-1>
Engaged scholarship : a guide for organizational and social research ¤ The relationship between theory and practice, research and action, is fundamental to all fields of applied social science. Should research findings and knowledge be useful for science, practice, and policy? If so, how should such research be designed, carried out and disseminated to achieve the twin goals of rigor and relevance? These challenges are particularly relevant in the applied areas of management and organization studies where there is a distinct responsibility for researchers to engage with the 'real world'. In this carefully crafted and thoughtful book, leading management researcher Andrew Van de Ven both presents the broad intellectual challenge of 'engaged scholarship', and also sets out a clear framework and guidelines for carrying out soundly based and useful research for advancing both science and practice. At a time when some may question the value and status of academic knowledge; and others, contrastingly, urge a closer relationship between researchers and research users - be they businesses, governments or other institutions - the challenge of engaged scholarship is as relevant as ever, and there is a real need for the thoughtful and considered approach offered by Van de Ven. The book both provides a manifesto for engaged scholarship in the social sciences, and clear framework for research design and methodology. It will be an invaluable reference point and guide for academics, researchers and graduate students across the social sciences concerned with rigorous and relevant research in the contemporary world.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>

Inhibitory rules in data analysis : a rough set approach ¤ This monograph is devoted to theoretical and experimental study of inhibitory decision and association rules. Inhibitory rules contain on the right-hand side a relation of the kind "attribut does not equal value." The use of inhibitory rules instead of deterministic (standard) ones allows us to describe more completely information encoded in decision or information systems and to design classifiers of high quality. The most important feature of this monograph is that it includes an advanced mathematical analysis of problems on inhibitory rules. We consider algorithms for construction of inhibitory rules, bounds on minimal complexity of inhibitory rules, and algorithms for construction of the set of all minimal inhibitory rules. We also discuss results of experiments with standard and lazy classifiers based on inhibitory rules. These results show that inhibitory decision and association rules can be used in data mining and knowledge discovery both for knowledge representation and for prediction. Inhibitory rules can also be used under the analysis and design of concurrent systems. These results obtained in the monograph can be useful for researchers in such areas as machine learning, data mining and knowledge discovery, especially for those who are working in rough set theory, test theory, and logical analysis of data (LAD. The monograph can be used under the creation of courses for graduate students and for Ph.D. studies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4738328-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4024371-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072806-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152406-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4362502-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4428654-5>

Practical hydroinformatics : computational intelligence and technological developments in water applications ¤ Hydroinformatics has emerged over the last decade to become a recognised and established field of independent research activities within the hydrological and environmental science communities. Hydroinformatics is not just an application of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) to water resources, hydraulics, hydrology or environment. It strives to provide an amalgamation of water science with modern technologies for the purposes of satisfying social requirements. The European Geosciences Union (EGU) held its first dedicated session on Hydroinformatics in 2005 at the Vienna Meeting; that same meeting voted to establish the Hydroinformatics Sub-Division and Technical Committee (part of the Hydrological Sciences Division). The aim of that original session was to provide an active forum in which to demonstrate and discuss the integration and appropriate application of emergent computational technologies in a water modelling context. The initial proposal for this book arose at that meeting out of a desire to collect together a range of different contributions from academics and practitioners working in various sectors across the field; there were no other published compendiums at that point which attempted to span the latest set of methods or topics of hydrological interest that were presented at our meeting. The starting point for the selection of authors was the session itself. Further contributors were invited to submit papers in order to bolster particular sections and provide a representative selection of research across the main thematic areas: neural networks, fuzzy logic, global and evolutionary optimisation, emerging technologies and model integration. This book is aimed at hydrologists, scientists, students and practitioners interested in a set of techniques derived largely from artificial and computational intelligence to solve a range of problems in hydrology. We hope that this book will promote the field of Hydroinformatics and bridge the gap between theory and practice. We would like to thank the chapter authors for their interesting contributions and the many reviewers who have helped to make this a useful and high-quality publication. We would also like to thank the publication team at Springer for their efficient services.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4455833-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026309-5>

Evaluation of design flood frequency methods for Iowa streams ¤ The objective of this project was to assess the predictive accuracy of flood frequency estimation for small Iowa streams based on the Rational Method, the NRCS curve number approach, and the Iowa Runoff Chart. The evaluation was based on comparisons of flood frequency estimates at sites with sufficiently long streamgage records in the Midwest, and selected urban sites throughout the United States. The predictive accuracy and systematic biases (under- or over-estimation) of the approaches was evaluated based on forty-six Midwest sites and twenty-one urban sites. The sensitivity of several watershed characteristics such as soil properties, slope, and land use classification was also explored. Recommendations on needed changes or refinements for applications to Iowa Streams are made	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4220751-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4481448-3>

Gender and language learning : research and practice ¤ Although Gender Studies have found their way into most domains of academic research and teaching, they are not directly in the spotlight of foreign Language teaching pedagogy and research. However, teachers are confronted with gender issues in the Language classroom everyday. By the use of Language alone, they construct or deconstruct gender roles; with the choice of topics they shape gender identities in the classroom; and their ways of approaching pupils clearly mirrors their gender sensitivity. The book "Gender and Language Learning" aims at raising awareness towards gender issues in different areas of foreign Language teaching and learning. The primary objective of the book is to spark university students', trainee teachers' and in-service teachers' analysis and reflection of gender relations in the foreign Language learning and teaching section.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018428-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071776-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014801-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020548-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4482930-9>

Classical circuit theory ¤ Classical Circuit Theory provides readers with the fundamental, analytic properties of linear circuits that are important to the design of conventional and non-conventional circuits in modern communication systems. These properties include the relations between phase and gain, between the real and imaginary parts, and between phase and group delay. They also include the fundamental limitations on gain and bandwidth, which are important in broadband matching in amplifier design. The idea that an impedance function is a positive real function and that a transfer function is bounded-real, forms the basis for analytic design of all conventional filters. At the same time, mathematical programming tools are now widely available so that design of non-conventional circuits by optimization is but a few mouse clicks away. Every new concept within the material is illustrated with one or more examples. There are exercises and problems at the end of the chapters. Some may be suitable for term projects. The design techniques presented are also illustrated step by step with easy-to-follow examples.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041066-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179392-4>

A tangential regularization method for backflow stabilization in hemodynamics ¤ In computational simulations of fluid flows, instabilities at the Neumann boundaries may appear during backflow regime. It is widely accepted that this is due to the incoming energy at the boundary, coming from the convection term, which cannot be controlled when the velocity field is unknown. We propose a stabilized formulation based on a local regularization of the fluid velocity along the tangential directions on the Neumann boundaries. The stabilization term is proportional to the amount of backflow, and does not require any further assumption on the velocity profile. The perfomance of the method is assessed on a twoand three-dimensional Womersley flows, as well as considering a hemodynamic physiological regime in a patient-specific aortic geometry.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4024665-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4690080-9>

Adaptive smoothing as inference strategy : more specificity for unequally sized or neighboring regions ¤ Although spatial smoothing of fMRI data can serve multiple purposes, increasing the sensitivity of activation detection is probably its greatest benefit. However, this increased detection power comes with a loss of specificity when non-adaptive smoothing (i.e. the standard in most software packages) is used. Simulation studies and analysis of experimental data was performed using the R packages neu-Rosim and fmri. In these studies, we systematically investigated the effect of spatial smoothing on the power and number of false positives in two particular cases that are often encountered in fMRI research: (1) Single condition activation detection for regions that differ in size, and (2) multiple condition activation detection for neighbouring regions. Our results demonstrate that adaptive smoothing is superior in both cases because less false positives are introduced by the spatial smoothing process compared to standard Gaussian smoothing or FDR inference of unsmoothed data	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157404-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7618675-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006684-8>
Concepts, techniques, and models of computer programming ¤ This innovative text presents computer programming as a unified discipline in a way that is both practical and scientifically sound. It presents all major programming paradigms in a uniform framework that shows their deep relationships and how and where to use them together. Each model has its own set of techniques and each is included on the basis of its usefulness in practice. The general models include declarative programming, declarative concurrency, message-passing concurrency, explicit state, object-oriented programming, shared-state concurrency and relational programming. Specialised models include graphical user interface programming, distributed programming and constraint programming. Each model is based on its kernel language - a simple core language that consists of a small number of programmer-significant elements. The kernel languages are introduced progressively, adding concepts one by one.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076370-5>

Social choice and strategic decisions : essays in honor of Jeffrey S. Banks ; with 17 tables ¤ Social choices, about expenditures on government programs, or about public policy more broadly, or indeed from any conceivable set of alternatives, are determined by politics. This book is a collection of essays that tie together the fields spanned by Jeffrey S. Banks' research on this subject. It examines the strategic aspects of political decision-making, including the choices of voters in committees, the positioning of candidates in electoral campaigns, and the behavior of parties in legislatures. The chapters of this book contribute to the theory of voting with incomplete information, to the literature on Downsian and probabilistic voting models of elections, to the theory of social choice in distributive environments, and to the theory of optimal dynamic decision-making. The essays employ a spectrum of research methods, from game-theoretic analysis, to empirical investigation, to experimental testing	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4233109-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066735-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071234-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022393-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4390843-3>

Growth and empowerment : making development happen ¤ Despite significant gains in promoting economic growth and living conditions (or "human progress") globally over the last twenty-five years, much of the developing world remains plagued by poverty and its attendant problems, including high rates of child mortality, illiteracy, environmental degradation, and war. In Growth and Empowerment, Nicholas Stern, Jean-Jacques Dethier, and F. Halsey Rogers propose a new strategy for development. Drawing on many years of work in development economics -- in academia, in the field, and at international institutions such as the World Bank -- the authors base their strategy on two interrelated approaches: building a climate that encourages investment and growth and at the same time empowering poor people to participate in that growth. This plan differs from other models for development, including the dogmatic approach of market fundamentalism popular in the 1980s and 1990s. Stern, Dethier, and Rogers see economic development as a dynamic process of continuous change in which entrepreneurship, innovation, flexibility, and mobility are crucial components and the idea of empowerment, as both a goal and a driver of development, is central. The book points to the unique opportunity today -- after 50 years of successes and failures, and with a growing body of analytical work to draw on -- to pursue new development strategies in both research and action.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066527-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7>

Handbook Language in Organizations ¤ This handbook systematically addresses the topic of organizational communication, which occupies a middle level between the "micro-level" of language interaction and the "macro-level" of collective linguistic-communicative practices and structures. The handbook aims to provide broad survey of organizational communication in German, English, French, and Spanish while giving due attention to the cultures of each language. Between the "micro-level" of language interaction and the "macro-level" of collective linguistic-communicative practices and structures, the intermediate level of organizational communication is systematically to be taken into account: Across various social institutions, fields of knowledge, and fields of action, organization-specific rationalizations impose specific conditions on language use, whether in the form of standardization or a normative and calculated handling of linguistic and cultural diversity. We start from the observation that the multilingual, intercultural, and professionally highly differentiated communicative practice in today's organization has become the norm. With the aim of a broad coverage, the Handbook Language in Organizations includes the object languages German, English, French, and Spanish and the cultures of the respective language spaces.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043774-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4203966-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129721-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031883-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191506-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194747-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061963-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4201794-4>

African climate and climate change : physical, social and political perspectives ¤ African Climate and Climate Change, use different case studies on climate change and variability in Africa to illustrate different approaches to the study of climate change in Africa from across the spectrum of physical, social and political sciences. In doing so we attempt to highlight a toolboox of methodologies (along with their limitatiosn and advantages) that may be used to further the understanding of the impacts of climate change in Africa and thus help form the basis for strategies to negate the negative implications of climate change on society. --Book Jacket Research on the subject of African climate change requires an interdisciplinary approach linking studies of environmental, political and socio-economic spheres -- Compared to many other regions of the world, Africa is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and variability. Widespread poverty, an extensive disease burden, and pockets of political instability across the continent has resulted in a low resilience and limited adaptive capacity of African society to climate related shocks and stresses. To compound this vulnerability, there remains large knowledge gaps on African climate, manifestations of future climate change and variability for the region and the associated problems of climate change impacts --	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1>

Expert forecast on emerging chemical risks related to occupational safety and health ¤ INTRODUCTION -- Methodology -- Expert participation -- Main emerging chemical risks identified -- Complete results of the survey -- Conclusion It is estimated that about 74,000 work-related deaths may be linked to hazardous substances at work each year in the EU - about 10 times more than workplace accidents. About 15% of European workers report handling chemical products for a quarter of their working time and 19% report breathing in dust, fumes and smoke in their workplaces. The 49 experts from 21 European countries who participated in this forecast highlighted particles and dusts as major emerging concerns and put nanoparticles at the top of the list of emerging risks. Other main groups of emerging risks identified were carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances, and the increasing use of allergenic and sensitizing substances. Specific occupations of emerging concerns were also highlighted and include the increasing waste management industry, construction, and service activities such as cleaning or home nursing. In addition, there is a growing number of workers in SMEs and sub-contracted jobs, where the management of chemical risks is generally poorer. Concern about multiple exposures is increasing as it was also shown in the three other forecasts on emerging biological, physical and psychosocial emerging risks.--Publisher's description	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4009833-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002741-7>

Analytical ultracentrifugation of polymers and nanoparticles : 5 tables ¤ Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) is a powerful method for the characterization of polymers, biopolymers, polyelectrolytes, nanoparticles, dispersions, and other colloidal systems. The method is able to determine the molar mass, the particle size, the particle density and interaction parameters like virial coefficients and association constants. Because AUC is also a fractionation method, the determination of the molar mass distribution, the particle size distribution, and the particle density distribution is possible. A special technique, the density gradient method, allows fractionating heterogeneous samples according to their chemical nature that means being able to detect chemical heterogeneity. The book is divided into chapters concerning instrumentation, sedimentation velocity runs, density gradient runs, application examples and future developments. In particular, the detailed application chapter demonstrates the versatility and power of AUC by means of many interesting and important industrial examples. Thus the book concentrates on practical aspects rather than details of centrifugation theory. Both authors have many years of experience in an industrial AUC research laboratory of a world leading chemical company.

Edible coatings and films to improve food quality ¤ Many interesting and exciting developments have occurred since the publication of the first edition in 1994. These developments result from the ever-increasing quality of coatings research, and make it timely to prepare this updated and completely revised 2nd edition, designed for the benefit of all involved in buying, selling, regulating, developing or using coatings to improve the quality and safety of foods. This book is a study of the coatings, films, wraps and surface treatments used for foods. Specifically, it covers coating ingredients and additives (Chapters 2, 3, 4 & 6), their permeability properties (Chapter 5), coatings for specific applications (Chapters 7, 8, 9 &12), the technology of coatings (Chapters 10 & 11), and regulatory aspects (Chapter 13). But of course the world of coatings could not be so neatly divided so some overlap between chapters in inevitable and desirable. For example, in the discussion of a coating made with a certain ingredient, the author might include information on additives used or allowed, and/or how the coating was applied, and/or what foods it is best used for, and so on. Therefore, in researching any topic it is best to cross-search other chapters-- The second edition of Edible Coatings and Films to Improve Food Quality presents the latest research in coating materials, permeability properties, and measurement techniques. Updated chapters provide new information on the main materials used as film formers in coatings, including proteins, lipids, resins, and polysaccharides. The text covers the permeability properties of coatings and techniques to measure permeability. Additional chapters discuss the use and function of additives as well as experimental and commercial coatings for various types of foods. A new chapter focuses on regulatory aspects. With expanded application areas, this book also discusses special types of coatings for encapsulation and pharmaceuticals	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4343361-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117356-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7601940-8>

Invariant manifolds for physical and chemical kinetics ¤ By bringing together various ideas and methods for extracting the slow manifolds, the authors show that it is possible to establish a more macroscopic description in nonequilibrium systems. The book treats slowness as stability. A unifying geometrical viewpoint of the thermodynamics of slow and fast motion enables the development of reduction techniques, both analytical and numerical. Examples considered in the book range from the Boltzmann kinetic equation and hydrodynamics to the Fokker-Planck equations of polymer dynamics and models of chemical kinetics describing oxidation reactions. Special chapters are devoted to model reduction in classical statistical dynamics, natural selection, and exact solutions for slow hydrodynamic manifolds. The book will be a major reference source for both theoretical and applied model reduction. Intended primarily as a postgraduate-level text in nonequilibrium kinetics and model reduction, it will also be valuable to PhD students and researchers in applied mathematics, physics and various fields of engineering.

An economic theorist's book of tales: essays that entertain the consequences of new assumptions in economic theory ¤ These essays explore what happens when a skilled economist makes unconventional assumptions. Economic theory has traditionally relied upon a tacit and classical set of assumptions that have gradually acquired a life of their own in defining how economists write and how they justify economic models. Similarly, these assumptions have acquired an autonomous character: they guide the way economists think about the world. In consequence, consideration of alternative assumptions has become taboo. These essays are substantively and stylistically novel because they break these taboos and bring new assumptions into economic theory. The papers apply this adventurous approach to a wide range of issues - from insurance markets and trade in underdeveloped countries to unemployment and discrimination. Some of the essays derive the implications for economic markets of costly asymmetric information. Others explore the findings of other social sciences such as anthropology, psychology and sociology.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2>

Loose space : possibility and diversity in urban life ¤ Public space is a frequent theme in writing about cities, describing the ways in which urban activities, histories and identities are prescribed, controlled and homogenized. This text explores the concept of 'loose spaces', physical areas that are used in different ways "In cities around the world people use a variety of public spaces to relax, to protest, to buy and sell, to experiment and to celebrate. Loose Space explores the many ways that urban residents, with creativity and determination, appropriate public space to meet their own needs and desires. Familiar or unexpected, spontaneous or planned, momentary or long-lasting, the activities that make urban space loose continue to give cities life and vitality. The book examines physical spaces and how people use them. Contributors discuss a wide range of recreational, commercial and political activities; some are conventional, others are more experimental. Some of the activities occur alongside the intended uses of planned public spaces, such as sidewalks and plazas; other activities replace former uses, as in abandoned warehouses and industrial sites. The thirteen case studies, international in scope, demonstrate the continuing richness of urban public life that is created and sustained by urbanites themselves.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172385-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077811-3>

Policy vision for sustainable rural economies in an enlarged Europe ¤ Implemented by a joint initiative of ARL and DATAR (Délégation à l'Aménagement du Territoire et à l'Action Régionale) an international group of experts elaborated the Vision encompassing the shift from a sectoral, i.e. pure agricultural policy of today, to a territorial policy for rural regions to be implemented over a 25 year time horizon. This policy constitutes a desired vision for Europe's rural areas which requires: (1) appropriate institutions, (2) diversifying the economic activities in rural areas, and (3) integrating agricultural and rural policy. To achieve that shift to an integrated policy we need - new institutional frameworks, both on European and national levels, - effective instruments to guarantee the sustainable use of natural resources in agriculture, - the care for the rural population as a whole not only for farmers, - the improvement of quality products and production processes meeting the required environmental and animal welfare standards guaranteeing international competitiveness, - compatibility of the single European market for agricultural products with respect to prices and safety standards with commitments under the WTO, - a policy design and implementation at a decentralised level, and - a coordination of that policy at European and national levels for the benefit to implement the principles of solidarity and cohesion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034450-2>

Blockchain: Hype or Innovation ¤ The term blockchain has recently become a buzzword, but only few know what exactly lies behind this approach. According to a survey, issued in the first quarter of 2017, the term is only known by 35 percent of German medium-sized enterprise representatives. However, the blockchain technology is very interesting for the mass media because of its rapid development and global capturing of different markets. For example, many see blockchain technology either as an all-purpose weapon— which only a few have access to—or as a hacker technology for secret deals in the darknet. The innovation of blockchain technology is found in its successful combination of already existing approaches: such as decentralized networks, cryptography, and consensus models. This innovative concept makes it possible to exchange values in a decentralized system. At the same time, there is no requirement for trust between its nodes (e.g. users). With this study the Hasso Plattner Institute would like to help readers form their own opinion about blockchain technology, and to distinguish between truly innovative properties and hype. The authors of the present study analyze the positive and negative properties of the blockchain architecture and suggest possible solutions, which can contribute to the efficient use of the technology. We recommend that every company define a clear target for the intended application, which is achievable with a reasonable cost-benefit ration, before deciding on this technology. Both the possibilities and the limitations of blockchain technology need to be considered. The relevant steps that must be taken in this respect are summarized /summed up for the reader in this study.Furthermore, this study elaborates on urgent problems such as the scalability of the blockchain, appropriate consensus algorithm and security, including various types of possible attacks and their countermeasures. New blockchains, for example, run the risk of reducing security, as changes to existing technology can lead to lacks in the security and failures. After discussing the innovative properties and problems of the blockchain technology, its implementation is discussed. There are a lot of implementation opportunities for companies available who are interested in the blockchain realization. The numerous applications have either their own blockchain as a basis or use existing and widespread blockchain systems. Various consortia and projects offer	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1124028595>

Capacitated network design using general flow-cutset inequalities ¤ This paper deals with directed, bidirected, and undirected capacitated network design problems. Using mixed integer rounding (MIR), we generalize flow-cutset inequalities to these three link types and to an arbitrary modular link capacity structure, and propose a generic separation algorithm. In an extensive computational study on 54 instances from the Survivable Network Design Library (SNDlib), we show that the performance of cplex can significantly be enhanced by this class of cutting planes. The computations reveal the particular importance of the subclass of cutset-inequalities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043586-6>
Dynamic general equilibrium modelling : computational methods and applications; with 24 tables ¤ Modern business cycle theory and growth theory uses stochastic dynamic general equilibrium models. Many mathematical tools are needed to solve these models. The book presents various methods for computing the dynamics of general equilibrium models. In part I, the representative-agent stochastic growth model is solved with the help of value function iteration, linear and linear quadratic approximation methods, parameterised expectations and projection methods. In order to apply these methods, fundamentals from numerical analysis are reviewed in detail. Part II discusses methods for solving heterogeneous-agent economies. In such economies, the distribution of the individual state variables is endogenous. This part of the book also serves as an introduction to the modern theory of distribution economics. Applications include the dynamics of the income distribution over the business cycle or the overlapping-generations model. Through an accompanying home page to this book, computer codes to all applications can be downloaded.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210294-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200428-7>

Matrix operations for engineers and scientists : an essential guide in linear algebra ¤ Engineers and scientists need to have an introduction to the basics of linear algebra in a context they understand. Computer algebra systems make the manipulation of matrices and the determination of their properties a simple matter, and in practical applications such software is often essential. However, using this tool when learning about matrices, without first gaining a proper understanding of the underlying theory, limits the ability to use matrices and to apply them to new problems. This book explains matrices in the detail required by engineering or science students, and it discusses linear systems of ordinary differential equations. These students require a straightforward introduction to linear algebra illustrated by applications to which they can relate. It caters of the needs of undergraduate engineers in all disciplines, and provides considerable detail where it is likely to be helpful. According to the author the best way to understand the theory of matrices is by working simple exercises designed to emphasize the theory, that at the same time avoid distractions caused by unnecessary numerical calculations. Hence, examples and exercises in this book have been constructed in such a way that wherever calculations are necessary they are straightforward. For example, when a characteristic equation occurs, its roots (the eigenvalues of a matrix) can be found by inspection. The author of this book is Alan Jeffrey, Emeritus Professor of mathematics at the Univesity of Newcastle upon Tyne. He has given courses on engineering mathematics in UK and US Universities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126963-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4452554-0>

Numerical analysis of Monte Carlo finite difference evaluation of Greeks ¤ An error analysis of approximation of derivatives of the solution to the Cauchy problem for parabolic equations by finite differences is given taking into account that the solution itself is evaluated using weak-sense numerical integration of the corresponding system of stochastic differential equations together with the Monte Carlo technique. It is shown that finite differences are effective when the method of dependent realizations is exploited in the Monte Carlo simulations. This technique is applicable to evaluation of Greeks. In particular, it turns out that it is possible to evaluate both the option price and deltas by a single simulation run that reduces the computational costs.

Economics of knowledge ¤ The book, which alternates between analysis of the economic transformation and examination of the tools and concepts of the discipline, begins by discussing "knowledge" as an economic good and the historical development of the knowledge-based economies. It then develops a conceptual framework for considering the issues raised. Topics considered in the remaining chapters include forms of knowledge production, codification and infusion, incentives and institutions for the efficient production of knowledge (including discussions of private markets and "open" sources), and knowledge management as a new organizational capability. Finally, the book addresses policy concerns suggested by the uneven development of knowledge across different sectors and by the need to find ways of reclaiming the public dimension of knowledge from an essentially privatized knowledge revolution.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4660420-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049538-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043179-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4561842-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136832-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066559-8>

Metric structures in differential geometry ¤ This text is an elementary introduction to differential geometry. The only prerequisites are a solid background in Calculus, linear algebra, and basic point-set topology. The first chapter covers the fundamentals of differentiable manifolds that are the bread and butter of differential geometry. All the usual topics are covered, culminating in Stokes? theorem together with some applications. The following chapters are devoted to fiber bundles, homotopy theory of fibrations, vector bundles, Euclidean bundles and Riemannian connections, and then a brief excursion into the realm of Riemannian geometry. The final chapter concludes with Chern-Weil theory, introducing the Pontrjagin, Euler, and Chern characteristic classes of a vector bundle. This book can be used for a one-semester course on manifolds or bundles, or a two-semester course in differential geometry.

Global warming - myth or reality? : the erring ways of climatology ¤ In the global-warming debate, definitive answers to questions about ultimate causes and effects remain elusive. In Global Warming: Myth or Reality?, Marcel Leroux seeks to separate fact from fiction in this critical debate from a climatological perspective. Beginning with a review of the dire hypotheses for climate trends, the author describes the history of the 1998 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and many subsequent conferences. He discusses the main conclusions of the three IPCC reports and the predicted impact on global temperatures, rainfall, weather and climate, while highlighting the mounting confusion and sensationalism of reports in the media. After taking a hard look at the reality of the greenhouse effect, the 'evidence' from climate models, and the models' limitations, Leroux postulates alternate causes of climate change and analyzes the trends for global temperatures, rainfall patterns, and sea level. He poses the 'heretical' question if warming may be considered a benefit in some regions. Finally Leroux suggests a number of priorities for climatologists to better understand processes of climate change, to integrate them into climate models, and to predict accurately future changes in climate. This timely and controversial book lays out the scientific case of the sizable skeptical scientific community who challenge the accepted wisdom	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4344515-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1>

A direct simulation Monte Carlo method for the Uehling-Uhlenbeck-Boltzmann equation ¤ In this paper we describe a DSMC algorithm for the Uehling-Uhlenbeck-Boltzmann equation in terms of Markov processes. This provides a unifying framework for both the classical Boltzmann case as well as the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein cases. We establish the foundation of the algorithm by demonstrating its link to the kinetic equation. By numerical experiments we study its sensitivity to the number of simulation particles and to the discretization of the velocity space, when approximating the steady state distribution.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1150802073>

Climate confusion : how global warming hysteria leads to bad science, pandering politicians, and misquided policies that hurt the poor ¤ If you listen to the media, you would think that man-made environmental catastrophe was about to engulf the world and imperil civilization. From Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth to nightly jeremiads about CO2 emissions and carbon footprints, we are bombarded around the clock with alarmist reports that disasterous global warming is on the rise and that it's our fault. In Climate Confusion, noted climatologist Roy Spencer shows that fears about global warming are vastly exaggerated and are driven by politics, not truth. He shows that a global superstorm has already arrived--but it is a storm of hype and hysteria. Climate Confusion is a ground-breaking book that combines impeccable scientific authority with great wit and literary panache to expose the hysteria surrounding the myths of global warming and climate change. Spencer shows that the earth is far more resilient than exopessimists pretend and that increasing wealth and technology ingenuity, far from being the enemies of the environment, are the only means we possess to solve environmental problems as they arise.--Provided by the publisher	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1>

Web-based development in the lively kernel ¤ The World Wide Web as an application platform becomes increasingly important. However, the development of Web applications is often more complex than for the desktop. Web-based development environments like Lively Webwerkstatt can mitigate this problem by making the development process more interactive and direct. By moving the development environment into the Web, applications can be developed collaboratively in a Wiki-like manner. This report documents the results of the project seminar on Web-based Development Environments 2010. In this seminar, participants extended the Web-based development environment Lively Webwerkstatt. They worked in small teams on current research topics from the field of Web-development and tool support for programmers and implemented their results in the Webwerkstatt environment.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1026205387> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139375-2>
Dynamics of contention ¤ Over the past two decades the study of social movements, revolution, democratization and other non-routine politics has flourished. And yet research on the topic remains highly fragmented, reflecting the influence of at least three traditional divisions. The first of these reflects the view that various forms of contention are distinct and should be studied independent of others. Separate literatures have developed around the study of social movements, revolutions and industrial conflict. A second approach to the study of political contention denies the possibility of general theory in deference to a grounding in the temporal and spatial particulars of any given episode of contention. The study of contentious politics are left to 'area specialists' and/or historians with a thorough knowledge of the time and place in question. Finally, overlaid on these two divisions are stylized theoretical traditions - structuralist, culturalist, and rationalist - that have developed largely in isolation from one another.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130047-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055707-8>
Brownian hard balls submitted to an infinite range interaction with slow decay ¤ We consider an infinite system of hard balls in Rd undergoing Brownian motions and submitted to a pair potential with infinite range and quasi polynomial decay. It is modelized by an infinite-dimensional Stochastic Differential Equation with an infinite-dimensional local time term. Existence and uniqueness of a strong solution is proven for such an equation with deterministic initial condition. We also show that the set of all equilibrium measures, solution of a Detailed Balance Equation, coincides with the set of canonical Gibbs measures associated to the hard core potential.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128328-4>

FS Poseidon Fahrtbericht/Cruise report POS316 : Carbonate mounds and aphotic corals in the NE-Atlantic ; Reykjavik - Lisbon 03.08. - 17.08.04 ¤ POSEIDON No 316 was a multidisciplinary cruise addressing biological, geological and hydrographical scientific objectives in the carbonate mound and aphotic coral province west of Ireland in the eastern Porcupine Seabight and at the western Rockall Bank. The main objective was to investigate the interrelation between the rich aphotic coral ecosystems found in these regions and diurnal and seasonal processes in the ambient hydro-dynamical and depositional regime as these factors seem to bias the conditions of coral growth and reproduction. The cruise started in Reykjavik and ended in Lisbon and continued the 2004 investigations in the Irish carbonate mound province with FS METEOR (M61 leg 1, 20040418 - 20040505). The scientific work is embedded in the "ESF-DFG" Moundforce project of the EUROMARGINS Programme. Together with the previous M61 cruise, the POSEIDON activities document Germany's strong scientific and logistic support for the success of this challenging programme. Investigations are also designed as a preparatory cruise for the EU-project HERMES (Hotspot Ecosystem Research on the Margins of European Seas; start 20050401). The institutions participating in POSEIDON 316 are partners in HERMES Work Package 2 "Coral Reef and Carbonate Mound Systems".

Modular and incremental global model management with extended generalized discrimination networks ¤ Complex projects developed under the model-driven engineering paradigm nowadays often involve several interrelated models, which are automatically processed via a multitude of model operations. Modular and incremental construction and execution of such networks of models and model operations are required to accommodate efficient development with potentially large-scale models. The underlying problem is also called Global Model Management. In this report, we propose an approach to modular and incremental Global Model Management via an extension to the existing technique of Generalized Discrimination Networks (GDNs). In addition to further generalizing the notion of query operations employed in GDNs, we adapt the previously query-only mechanism to operations with side effects to integrate model transformation and model synchronization. We provide incremental algorithms for the execution of the resulting extended Generalized Discrimination Networks (eGDNs), as well as a prototypical implementation for a number of example eGDN operations. Based on this prototypical implementation, we experiment with an application scenario from the software development domain to empirically evaluate our approach with respect to scalability and conceptually demonstrate its applicability in a typical scenario. Initial results confirm that the presented approach can indeed be employed to realize efficient Global Model Management in the considered scenario.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4300400-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4832365-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4367653-4>

Light in architecture: the intangible material ¤ Light in Architecture explores the role and use of light in and around buildings from the time that Stonehenge was built through to the present day, illustrating how a greater understanding of this intangible and free material will lead us to better architecture and, ultimately, improve our quality of life. Translated and carefully updated from the best-selling Spanish book, La Materia Intangible, this full colour edition explains why light is so fundamental to human perception, how its nature and use are influenced by time and place, and how it has come to be used as a tool for abstract architectural design. Drawing on centuries of thinking and over 40 real-life, international exemplars, the book explores the different ways that light can be harnessed and manipulated to achieve particular objectives, emotions or experiences, as well as how the technologies and techniques for doing so have developed over time. Importantly for today's cities, Light in Architecture also looks at what happens when we build in, on or around our pre-existing architecture, identifying how we can improve, restore or even destroy light in the process.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035596-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>

The dynamics of language obsolescence in a divided speech community : the case of the German Wischau/Vyškov enclave (Czech Republic) ¤ Using the Wischau/Vyškov speech enclave (Czech Republic) as a case study, this book considers the impact of the highly controversial population transfers of ethnic Germans at the end of World War II. Particular attention is paid to processes of identification amongst community members, the post-war sociolinguistic context, and aspects of the language variety itself, which has remained structurally intact. Importantly, the study reveals the stories and experiences of forced migration and integration from the perspective of both stayers, who until 1989/90 lived under communism, and expellees, who started new lives in the capitalist Federal Republic of Germany. Methodologically, the study is based on data elicited chiefly from participant observations of, and unstructured interviews with the last remaining witnesses of the 1945/46 population transfers. As such, this is the first and probably last detailed study of this small, rural German enclave community. From a theoretical perspective, it draws heavily on Sasse's (1992) framework on language death	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1114895571> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077623-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132313-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4233286-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4222015-4>

The Sentimental Education of the Novel ¤ The nineteenth-century French novel has long been seen as the heroic production of great men, who confronted in their works the social consequences of the French Revolution. And it is true that French realism, especially as developed by Balzac and Stendhal, was one of the most influential novelistic forms ever invented. Margaret Cohen, however, challenges the traditional account of the genesis of realism by returning Balzac and Stendhal to the forgotten novelistic contexts of their time. Reconstructing a key formative period for the novel, she shows how realist codes emerged in a 'hostile take-over' of a prestigious contemporary sentimental practice of the novel, which was almost completely dominated by women writers. Cohen draws on impressive archival research, resurrecting scores of forgotten nineteenth-century novels, to demonstrate that the codes most closely identified with realism were actually the invention of sentimentality, a powerful aesthetic of emerging liberal-democratic society, although Balzac and Stendhal trivialized sentimental works by associating them with 'frivolous' women writers and readers. Attention to these gendered struggles over genre explains why women were not pioneers of realism in France during the nineteenth century, a situation that contrasts with England, where women writers played a formative role in inventing the modern realist novel. Cohen argues that to understand how literary codes respond to material factors, it is imperative to see how such factors take shape within the literary field as well as within society as a whole. The book also proposes that attention to literature as a social institution will help critics resolve the current, vital question of how to practice literary history in the wake of poststructuralism.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113615-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4152096-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050479-7>

Applied Reliability ¤ It's been over 15 years since the publication of the 2nd edition of Applied Reliability. We continue to receive positive feedback from old users, and each year hundreds of engineers, quality specialists, and statisticians discover the book for the first time and become new fans. So why a 3rd edition? There are always new methods and techniques that update and improve upon older methods, but that was not the primary reason we felt the need to write a new edition. In the last 15 years, the ready availability of relatively inexpensive, powerful, statistical software has changed the way statisticians and engineers look at and analyze all kinds of data. Problems in reliability that were once difficult and time consuming for even experts now can be solved with a few well-chosen clicks of a mouse. Additionally, with the quantitative solution often comes a plethora of graphics that aid in understanding and presenting the results. All this power comes with a price, however. Software documentation has had difficulty keeping up with the enhanced functionality added to new releases, especially in specialized areas such as reliability analysis. Also, in some cases different well-known software packages use different methods and output different answers. An analyst needs to know how to use these programs effectively and which methods are the most highly recommended. This information is hard to find for industrial reliability problems. This popular book is an easy-to-use guide that addresses basic descriptive statistics, reliability concepts, the exponential distribution, the Weibull distribution, the lognormal distribution, reliability data plotting, acceleration models, life test data analysis and systems models, and much more. The third edition includes a new chapter on Bayesian reliability analysis and expanded, updated coverage of repairable system modeling. Taking a practical and example-oriented approach to reliability analysis, it also provides detailed illustrations of software implementation throughout using several widely available software packages.

Towards successful bottom-up transitions : conceptualizing transformative capacities of individuals in social innovations ¤ In socio-technical transitions research, capacities relevant for transformations have primarily been assessed at systemic or niche levels, with capacities of individual actors to engage in transformative activities not yet well-conceptualized. This paper draws on theories of power in transitions, transformative social innovation and social practice theory to develop a conceptual framework for transformative capacities at the level of the individual citizen. We argue that in order to change social practices and foster successful bottom-up transitions, different forms of capacities - with regards to the elements of a social practice (meanings, competences and materials/resources) - are required. As a next step, the framework developed based on different literatures from transitions research and sociology will be tested empirically in an online-survey targeted at individuals engaged in social innovation. The objective is to better understand social processes of change and the conditions for them, in order to support the development of participatory governance models.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4681060-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4181997-4>

Soil heavy metals ¤ Human activities have dramatically changed the composition and organisation of soils. Industrial and urban wastes, agricultural application and also mining activities resulted in an increased concentration of heavy metals in soils. How plants and soil microorganisms cope with this situation and the sophisticated techniques developed for survival in contaminated soils is discussed in this volume. The topics presented include: the general role of heavy metals in biological soil systems; the relation of inorganic and organic pollutions; heavy metal, salt tolerance and combined effects with salinity; effects on abuscular mycorrhizal and on saprophytic soil fungi; heavy metal resistance by streptomycetes; trace element determination of environmental samples; the use of microbiological communities as indicators; phytostabilization of lead polluted sites by native plants; effects of soil earthworms on removal of heavy metals and the remediation of heavy metal contaminated tropical land.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4206275-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053963-5>

The author argues that after 9/11 we have not seen a new phase in a long running confrontation between Islam and the West, but that such categories have collapsed. The West is no longer a unified actor and Islam is ideologically exhausted in its confrontation with colonialism. Rather we are seeing the emergence of the US as a lone superpower, and a confrontation between a form of imperial globalized capital and a new Islamic theodicy.

Effective field theories in flavour physics ¤ The book constitutes a compact review of the applications of effective field theory methods in flavour physics, with emphasis on heavy quark physics. Some of the relevant applications are discussed to illustrate the method. It covers the full range of theoretical tools related to the application of the effective field theory idea: Starting from the weak interactions as an effective theory derived from the standard model, well-established methods such as heavy quark effective theory, the heavy quark mass expansion and chiral perturbation theory are addressed. Also more recent ideas such as QCD factorization and soft collinear effective theory are outlined. Finally the standard model itself is viewed as an effective theory, allowing a model-independent look at the results of the new physics. The book should be useful for the advanced graduate student as well as for scientists who are interested in the theoretical toolkit used in the context of flavour physics. It is not meant as a complete review of the subject, rather it should be useful as an introduction to the basic ideas.

Spatially structured evolutionary algorithms : artificial evolution in space and time ; with 21 tables ¤ Evolutionary algorithms (EA) today are a mature problem-solving family of heuristics that has found its way into many practical important real-life problems and into leading-edge scientific research. Spatially structured EA have different properties than standard mixing EA. By virtue of the structured disposition of the population members they bring about new dynamical features that can be harnessed to solve difficult problems faster and more efficiently. This book describes the state of the art in spatially structured EA by using graph concepts as a unifying theme. The models, their analysis, and their empirical behavior are presented in detail. Moreover, there is new material on non-standard networked population structures such as small-world networks. The book should be of interest to advanced undergraduate and graduate students working in evolutionary computation, machine learning, and optimization. It should also be useful to researchers and professionals working in fields where the topological structure of populations and their evolution plays a role	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4366912-8>

Computational methods for physicists : compendium for students ¤ This book helps advanced undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students in their daily work by offering them a compendium of numerical methods. The choice of methods pays significant attention to error estimates, stability and convergence issues as well as to the ways to optimize program execution speeds. Many examples are given throughout the chapters, and each chapter is followed by at least a handful of more comprehensive problems which may be dealt with, for example, on a weekly basis in a one- or two-semester course. In these end-of-chapter problems the physics background is pronounced, and the main text preceding them is intended as an introduction or as a later reference. Less stress is given to the explanation of individual algorithms. It is tried to induce in the reader an own independent thinking and a certain amount of scepticism [skepticism] and scrutiny instead of blindly following readily available commercial tools. --	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4273564-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037952-8>

An introduction to the confinement problem ¤ This book addresses the confinement problem, which quite generally deals with the behavior of non-abelian gauge theories, and the force which is mediated by gauge fields, at large distances. The word 'confinement' in the context of hadronic physics originally referred to the fact that quarks and gluons appear to be trapped inside mesons and baryons, from which they cannot escape. There are other, and possibly deeper meanings that can be attached to the term, and these will be explored in this book. Although the confinement problem is far from solved, much is now known about the general features of the confining force, and there are a number of very well motivated theories of confinement which are under active investigation. This volume gives a both pedagogical and concise introduction and overview of the main ideas in this field, their attractive features, and, as appropriate, their shortcomings.--P. 4 of cover	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122125-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4176611-8>

Principles of soil conservation and management ¤ “Principles of Soil Management and Conservation” comprehensively reviews the state-of-knowledge on soil erosion and management. It discusses in detail soil conservation topics in relation to soil productivity, environment quality, and agronomic production. It addresses the implications of soil erosion with emphasis on global hotspots and synthesizes available from developed and developing countries. It also critically reviews information on no-till management, organic farming, crop residue management for industrial uses, conservation buffers (e.g., grass buffers, agroforestry systems), and the problem of hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico and in other regions. This book uniquely addresses the global issues including carbon sequestration, net emissions of CO2, and erosion as a sink or source of C under different scenarios of soil management. It also deliberates the implications of the projected global warming on soil erosion and vice versa. The concern about global food security in relation to soil erosion and strategies for confronting the remaining problems in soil management and conservation are specifically addressed. This volume is suitable for both undergraduate and graduate students interested in understanding the principles of soil conservation and management. The book is also useful for practitioners, extension agents, soil conservationists, and policymakers as an important reference material.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069568-2>

Sociobiology : the new synthesis ¤ When this classic work was first published in 1975, it created a new discipline and started a tumultuous round in the age-old nature versus nurture debate. Although voted by officers and fellows of the international Animal Behavior Society the most important book on animal behavior of all time, Sociobiology is probably more widely known as the object of bitter attacks by social scientists and other scholars who opposed its claim that human social behavior, indeed human nature, has a biological foundation. The controversy surrounding the publication of the book reverberates to the present day. In the introduction to this edition, Edward O. Wilson shows how research in human genetics and neuroscience has strengthened the case for a biological understanding of human nature. Human sociobiology, now often called evolutionary psychology, has in the last quarter of a century emerged as its own field of study, drawing on theory and data from both biology and the social sciences. For its still fresh and beautifully illustrated descriptions of animal societies, and its importance as a crucial step forward in the understanding of human beings, this anniversary edition of Sociobiology: the new synthesis will be welcomed by a new generation of students and scholars in all branches of learning	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069490-2>

Blockchain : hype or innovation ¤ The term blockchain has recently become a buzzword, but only few know what exactly lies behind this approach. According to a survey, issued in the first quarter of 2017, the term is only known by 35 percent of German medium-sized enterprise representatives. However, the blockchain technology is very interesting for the mass media because of its rapid development and global capturing of different markets. For example, many see blockchain technology either as an all-purpose weapon— which only a few have access to—or as a hacker technology for secret deals in the darknet. The innovation of blockchain technology is found in its successful combination of already existing approaches: such as decentralized networks, cryptography, and consensus models. This innovative concept makes it possible to exchange values in a decentralized system. At the same time, there is no requirement for trust between its nodes (e.g. users). With this study the Hasso Plattner Institute would like to help readers form their own opinion about blockchain technology, and to distinguish between truly innovative properties and hype. The authors of the present study analyze the positive and negative properties of the blockchain architecture and suggest possible solutions, which can contribute to the efficient use of the technology. We recommend that every company define a clear target for the intended application, which is achievable with a reasonable cost-benefit ration, before deciding on this technology. Both the possibilities and the limitations of blockchain technology need to be considered. The relevant steps that must be taken in this respect are summarized /summed up for the reader in this study. Furthermore, this study elaborates on urgent problems such as the scalability of the blockchain, appropriate consensus algorithm and security, including various types of possible attacks and their countermeasures. New blockchains, for example, run the risk of reducing security, as changes to existing technology can lead to lacks in the security and failures. After discussing the innovative properties and problems of the blockchain technology, its implementation is discussed. There are a lot of implementation opportunities for companies available who are interested in the blockchain realization. The numerous applications have either their own blockchain as a basis or use existing and widespread blockchain systems. Various consortia and projects offer	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1124028595>

Angle and spin resolved Auger emission : theory and applications to atoms and molecules ¤ The Auger effect must be interpreted as the radiationless counterpart of photoionization and is usually described within a two-step model. Angle and spin resolved Auger emission physics deals with the theoretical and numerical description, analysis and interpretation of such types of experiments on free atoms and molecules. This monograph derives the general theory applying the density matrix formalism and, in terms of irreducible tensorial sets, so called state multipoles and order parameters, for parameterizing the atomic and molecular systems, respectively. Propensity rules and non-linear dependencies between the angular distribution and spin polarization parameters are included in the discussion. The numerical approaches utilizing relativistic distorted wave (RDWA), multiconfigurational Dirac-Fock (MCDF), and Greens operator methods are described. These methods are discussed and applied to theoretical predictions, numerical results and experimental data for a variety of atomic systems, especially the rare gases, and to simple molecules. The book was written for graduate and post-graduate students and researchers working in this field and/or trying to get a closer insight into the theoretical description of multistep scattering processes in atomic and molecular physics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143465-1>

Due to their very large length-to-diameter ratio together with perfect crystallographic structure and chemical homogeneity, such fibers have mechanical and physical properties that approach the theoretical values. Fukuda explains how their ultra-high strength enables their application as reinforcing agents in structural components. And he elucidates how and why fiber crystals are particularly well suited for wave guiding, tunable narrow-band filters and nonlinear optics and for the generation of green, blue and violet wavelenghts, and also as micro lasers and laser modulators. The book is suitable for specialists and students in the fields of materials science, crystal growth, physics, chemistry, crystallography, optics, mechanics and engineering.

Triple graph grammars for multi-version models ¤ BEGIN: Like conventional software projects, projects in model-driven software engineering require adequate management of multiple versions of development artifacts, importantly allowing living with temporary inconsistencies. In the case of model-driven software engineering, employed versioning approaches also have to handle situations where different artifacts, that is, different models, are linked via automatic model transformations. In this report, we propose a technique for jointly handling the transformation of multiple versions of a source model into corresponding versions of a target model, which enables the use of a more compact representation that may afford improved execution time of both the transformation and further analysis operations. Our approach is based on the well-known formalism of triple graph grammars and a previously introduced encoding of model version histories called multi-version models. In addition to showing the correctness of our approach with respect to the standard semantics of triple graph grammars, we conduct an empirical evaluation that demonstrates the potential benefit regarding execution time performance.

Alleviating urban traffic congestion ¤ In 2000, the average driver in US metropolitan areas endured 27 hours of traffic delays, a rise from 7 hours in 1980. In many other countries, traffic delays are considerably worse than in the United States, and in developing countries urban traffic congestion is increasing with alarming rapidity. For fifty years, economists have been advocating congestion pricing as the way to deal with urban traffic congestion; but today, even after some successes, congestion pricing is encountering considerable political resistance. The authors of Alleviating Urban Traffic Congestion advocate active consideration of more microscopic policies that attack the problem at the scale at which actual policy decisions are made. Microscopic models, rather than macroscopic models that are too simplified and too aggregated, they argue, will lead to the analysis of a wider and more creative range of policies, at least some of which should work well and be politically acceptable. After developing the themes of the book, the authors illustrate them by examining some areas of urban transport policy that have been neglected by the macroscopic approach. These include downtown parking policy, the encouragement of bicycling, the staggering of work hours by dominant employers, and the use by medium-sized cities of a "multimode" ticket that charges cars entering the city center a toll equal to the transit fare. The reorientation of urban transport analysis that they advocate will by no means eliminate traffic delays but should speed up the adoption of a richer, more flexible, and ultimately more effective set of policies to alleviate urban traffic congestion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056783-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4272352-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062955-7>

Practicing history : new directions in historical writing after the linguistic turn ¤ Gabrielle Spiegel presents an essential new collection of key articles that examine the current status of the debate over the 'linguistic turn', and attempt to rethink the practice of history in light of its implications. These are writings that operate within the framework of the linguistic turn, yet seek to move beyond its initial formulation and reception. The volume offers a synoptic overview of the last twenty-five years of theoretical analysis of historical writing, with a critical examination of the key concepts and positions that have been in debate. This collection delineates the emergence of a new 'practice theory' as a possible paradigm for future historical interpretation concerned with questions of agency, experience and the subject. Articles drawn from a mix of critical thinkers and practicing historians are drawn together along with clear and thorough editorial material. Complex ideas at the forefront of historical practice are revealed and made accessible to students, while for their teachers and other historians this new survey is an indispensable and timely read--Provided by publisher	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132931-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4713421-5>

A constitution for the European Union ¤ The leaders of European Union member states have declared that a European constitution should take "a clear, open, effective, democratically controlled Community approach." Their goal that within the Union, "European institutions should be brought closer to its citizens" raises many questions about implementation. What is the most effective procedure for connecting citizens' preferences to political action and policy choices at the EU level? The contributors to this CESifo volume, internationally prominent economists and other scholars, address the major issues that arise in the writing of a constitution. They do so with the underlying assumption that individuals are rational actors and the goal of the state is to advance their collective interests. The ten chapters consider such topics as how a constitution might be designed to prevent military conflict, whether the EU will evolve "by default" into a federal state, the apparent contradiction between the evolutionary development of the EU and the static structure of the constitution, the definition of citizenship and rights, the division and distribution of power, the budgetary deadlock on the provision of public goods and the redistribution of resources, coordinating policy, alternative methods for choosing an EU president, and the role of such direct democracy institutions as referenda and initiatives. The editors conclude by summing up the main arguments advanced to offer a unified approach to these issues. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062787-1>

The Oxford handbook of the Victorian novel ¤ Much has been written about the Victorian novel, and for good reason. The cultural power it exerted (and, to some extent, still exerts) is beyond question. 'The Oxford Handbook of the Victorian Novel' contributes substantially to this thriving scholarly field by offering new approaches to familiar topics (the novel and science, the Victorian Bildungroman) as well as essays on topics often overlooked (the novel and classics, the novel and the OED, the novel, and allusion). Manifesting the increasing interdisciplinarity of Victorian studies, its essays situate the novel within a complex network of relations (among, for instance, readers, editors, reviewers, and the novelists themselves; or among different cultural pressures - the religious, the commercial, the legal). The handbook's essays also build on recent bibliographic work of remarkable scope and detail, responding to the growing attention to print culture	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014777-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050479-7>

ReORIENT : global economy in the Asian age ¤ Andre Gunder Frank asks us to ReOrient our views away from Eurocentrism to see the rise of the West as a mere blip in what was, and is again becoming, an Asia-centered world. In a challenge to received historiography and social theory he turns on its head the world according to Marx, Weber, and other theorists, including Polanyi, Rostow, Braudel, and Wallerstein. Frank explains the Rise of the West in world economic and demographic terms that relate it in a single historical sweep to the decline of the East around 1800. European states, he says, used the silver extracted from the American colonies to buy entry into an expanding Asian market that already flourished in the global economy. Resorting to import substitution and export promotion in the world market, they became Newly Industrializing Economies and tipped the global economic balance to the West. That is precisely what East Asia is doing today, Frank points out, to recover its traditional dominance. As a result, the "center" of the world economy is once again moving to the "Middle Kingdom" of China	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068297-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029577-1>

Extending a Java virtual machine to dynamic object-oriented languages ¤ There are two common approaches to implement a virtual machine (VM) for a dynamic object-oriented language. On the one hand, it can be implemented in a C-like language for best performance and maximum control over the resulting executable. On the other hand, it can be implemented in a language such as Java that allows for higher-level abstractions. These abstractions, such as proper object-oriented modularization, automatic memory management, or interfaces, are missing in C-like languages but they can simplify the implementation of prevalent but complex concepts in VMs, such as garbage collectors (GCs) or just-in-time compilers (JITs). Yet, the implementation of a dynamic object-oriented language in Java eventually results in two VMs on top of each other (double stack), which impedes performance. For statically typed languages, the Maxine VM solves this problem; it is written in Java but can be executed without a Java virtual machine (JVM). However, it is currently not possible to execute dynamic object-oriented languages in Maxine. This work presents an approach to bringing object models and execution models of dynamic object-oriented languages to the Maxine VM and the application of this approach to Squeak/Smalltalk. The representation of objects in and the execution of dynamic object-oriented languages pose certain challenges to the Maxine VM that lacks certain variation points necessary to enable an effortless and straightforward implementation of dynamic object-oriented languages' execution models. The implementation of Squeak/Smalltalk in Maxine as a feasibility study is to unveil such missing variation points.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4541748-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125677-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172311-9>
Stability and transition: theory and application : efficient numerical methods with computer programs ; with 14 tables and a CD-ROM ¤ This book addresses transition from laminar to turbulent flows and considers solutions, mainly with the help of the linear stability theory and the ways in which it can be implemented accurately by numerical procedures. The main concern is transition of wall boundary layers, although one chapter is devoted to an approach based on the Navier-Stokes equations. The first three chapters summarize physical knowledge of the transition process, consider the stability equations and methods for predicting transition by linear stability theory, and describe efficient and accurate numerical methods for the solution of stability equations. Chapters 4 to 7 describe computer programs based on stability-theory approach to identify the location of transition in two- and three-dimensional incompressible and compressible flows, respectively, and Chapter 7 describes a computer program within the framework of parabolized stability equations. These programs are provided on a CD-ROM.

The expected audience for this book includes undergraduate students in computer science, IT&C, mathematics, business, medicine, etc., graduates, specialists and researchers in these fields. The subjects treated in the book include expert systems, knowledge representation, reasoning under knowledge Imperfection (Probability Theory, Possibility Theory, Belief Theory, and Approximate Reasoning). Most of the examples discussed in details throughout the book are from the medical domain.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4286963-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113491-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4728095-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4251178-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140474-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4273403-4>
Peacemakers in action : profiles of religion in conflict resolution ¤ Across the globe, there are more than 50 armed conflicts, many of which are being perpetrated in the name of religion. In these zones of violence, there are brave men and women who, motivated by their religious beliefs, are working to create and sustain peace and reconciliation. Yet their stories are unknown. This book explores the conflicts and the stories of 15 remarkable individuals identified and studied by the Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding from regions as far-flung as West Papua, Indonesia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Nigeria, El Salvador and South Africa. The book also captures important lessons learned when these peacemakers convened in Amman, Jordan for the 2004 Peacemakers in Action Retreat and discussed their best techniques and greatest obstacles in creating peace on the ground. Peacemakers in Action provides guidance to students of religion and future peacemakers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162071-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4662870-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137178-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020832-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039409-8>

Science studies as naturalized philosophy ¤ This book approaches its subject matter in a way that combines a strong analytical and critical perspective with a historical and sociological framework for the understanding of the emergence of Science Studies. This is a novelty, since extant literature on this topic tends either to narrate the history of the field, with little criticism, or to criticize Science Studies from a philosophical platform but with little interest in its historical and social context. The book provides a critical review of the most prominent figures in Science Studies (also known as Science and Technology Studies) and traces the historical roots of the discipline back to developments emerging after World War II. It also presents it as an heir to a long trend in Western thought towards the naturalization of philosophy, where a priori modes of thought are replaced by empirical ones. Finally, it points to ways for Science Studies to proceed in the future	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066562-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045791-6>

Structure formation in solution : ionic polymers and colloidal particles ¤ This book is designed to critically review experimental findings on ionic polymers and colloidal particles and to prove a theoretical framework based on the Poisson-Boltzmann approach. Structure formation in ionic polymer solutions has attracted attention since the days of H. Staudinger and J. D. Bernal. An independent study on ionic colloidal dispersions with microscopy provided a compelling evidence of structure formation. Recent technical developments have made it possible to accumulate relevant information for both ionic polymers and colloidal particles in dilute systems. The outstanding phenomenon experimentally found is microscopic inhomogeneity in the solute distribution in macroscopically homogeneous systems.To account for the observation, the present authors have invoked the existence of the counterion-mediated attraction between similarly charged solute species, in addition to the widely accepted electrostatic repulsion.

Feminism, capitalism, and critique : essays in honor of Nancy Fraser ¤ This edited collection examines the relationship between three central terms-capitalism, feminism, and critique-while critically celebrating the work and life of a thinker who has done the most to address this nexus: Nancy Fraser. In honor of her seventieth birthday, and in the spirit of her work in the tradition of critical theory, this collection brings together scholars from different disciplines and theoretical approaches to address this conjunction and evaluate Fraser’s lifelong contributions to theorizing it. Scholars from philosophy, political science, sociology, gender studies, race theory and economics come together to think through the vicissitudes of capitalism and feminism while also responding to different elements of Nancy Fraser’s work, which weaves together a strong feminist standpoint with a vibrant and complex critique of capitalism. Going beyond conventional disciplinary distinctions and narrow debates, all the contributors to this project share a commitment to critically understanding the connection between capitalism, exploitation, and the viable roads for emancipation. They recover insights provided by classical traditions of political and social thought, but they also open new research directions adapted to the global challenges of our time	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073840-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4222126-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029577-1>

Tauberian theory : a century of developments ¤ Tauberian theory compares summability methods for series and integrals, helps to decide when there is convergence, and provides asymptotic and remainder estimates. The author shows the development of the theory from the beginning and his expert commentary evokes the excitement surrounding the early results. He shows the fascination of the difficult Hardy-Littlewood theorems and of an unexpected simple proof, and extolls Wiener's breakthrough based on Fourier theory. There are the spectacular 'high-indices' theorems and Karamata's 'regular variation', which permeates probability theory. The author presents Gelfand's elegant algebraic treatment of Wiener theory and his own distributional approach. There is also a new unified theory for Borel and 'circle' methods. The text describes many Tauberian ways to the prime number theorem. A large bibliography and a substantial index round out the book.

Energy release rate for cracks in finite-strain elasticity ¤ Griffith's fracture criterion describes in a quasistatic setting whether or not a pre-existing crack in an elastic body is stationary for given external forces. In terms of the energy release rate (ERR), which is the derivative of the deformation energy of the body with respect to a virtual crack extension, this criterion reads: If the ERR is less than a specific constant, then the crack is stationary, otherwise it will grow. In this paper, we consider geometrically nonlinear elastic models with polyconvex energy densities and prove that the ERR is well defined. Moreover, without making any assumption on the smoothness of minimizers, we derive rigorously the well-known Griffith formula and the $J$-integral, from which the ERR can be calculated. The proofs are based on a weak convergence result for Eshelby tensors.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1120622891> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4204381-5>

Strategy, economic organization, and the knowledge economy : the coordination of firms and resources ¤ The rise of the knowledge economy has far-reaching implications for the nature of economic organization as well as firm strategy. Not surprisingly, thinking in management studies as well as in economies has been profoundly affected by these changes. Thus, management thinking in particular has been increasingly characterized by a schism between those who advocate 'knowledge' or 'capabilities-based' approaches in the strategy and organization fields and those who adopt more economies-influenced approaches, notably the economics of organization. This book is a sustained attempt to overcome this schism. Its basic argument is that knowledge-based and organizational economics approaches are not substitutes but complements. In particular, organizational economics has much to contribute with respect to furthering the understanding of efficient organization and strategy in the emerging knowledge economy. This theme is taken through several theroretical as well as empirical variations. Themes such as the incentive liabilities of flat, 'knowledge-based' organizations, the role of complementary HRM practices for fostering knowledge sharing and creation, and the role of organizational instruments in the knowledge management activities of the multinational corporate are extensively treated. The book thus contains important implications for knowledge management, organizational design and international management. The book encompasses nine chapters which critically examine current thinking on strategy, and organization. The reasoning is non-technical. While primarily aimed at a management studies audience, economists and other social scientists will also benefit from it, including Advanced Students, Academics and Researchers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4561842-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124261-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043774-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061963-1>
A dynamic material flow model for the European steel cycle ¤ Steel is of extraordinary importance for the European economy as well as society, but is responsible for enormous energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, steel flows are an obvious subject for the European climate protection. The quantification of steel stocks and flows is useful to be included in discussions regarding Circular Economy, energy system transformation and resource efficiency. Therefore, we developed a retrospective and dynamic material flow model covering the entire European steel and iron cycle from 2002 to 2019. Based on data by Worldsteel and assumptions mainly adopted by Cullen et al. (2012), the value and production chain of steel and iron products is covered by the model. It appears that the European steel and iron use reached a saturation from 2007 on, where the stock of steel in anthropogenic use phase reached around 5,600 Mt. In 2019, around 140 Mt of steel left the use phase, of which circa 6 Mt dissipated or are abandoned in place. Out of the remaining scrap, 110 Mt were collected as secondary raw materials for recycling. Recycling of steel in Europe reached a peak of approx. 140 Mt in 2007, from where on recycling declined equally to overall steel production leading to an almost constant recycling input rate of 57 %. The decline of steel recycling did not significantly affect the collection of steel scrap, but led to an increase of iron and steel scrap export. In 2019, 110 Mt of steel and iron were recycled in Europe, 65 % via EAF, 25 % via BOF and the remaining via ironmaking. Post-consumer waste is by mass more important than new scraps from production and manufacturing as evident in an old scrap ratio of 73 %. Further research could examine the effect of steel scrap prices on their use, further trace these export flows or analyse the potentials of secondary steel production for industry decarbonisation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056834-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014002-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4451877-8>

The European Central Bank : credibility, transparency, and centralization ¤ The adoption of the euro in 1999 by 11 member states of the European Union created a single currency area second in economic size only to the United States. The euro zone's monetary policy is now set by the European Central Bank (ECB) and its Governing Council rather than by individual national central banks. This CESifo volume examines issues that have arisen in the first years of ECB monetary policy and analyzes the effect that current ECB policy strategy and structures may have in the future. After a detailed description and assessment of ECB monetary policy making that focuses on such issues as price stability and the predictability of policy decisions, the book turns to two important issues faced by European central bankers: the transparency and credibility of decision making and the ECB's decentralized structure. After showing that transparency in decision making enhances credibility, the book discusses the ECB's efforts at openness, its political independence as guaranteed by law, and its ultimate accountability. The book then considers the effects of the decentralized ECB structure, focusing on business cycle synchronization, inflation differentials, and differences in monetary policy transmission in light of the enlargement of the monetary union. The book also discusses options for ECB institutional reforms, including centralization, vote weighting, and cross-border regional banks.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2>

Foundations of rule learning ¤ Rules -- the clearest, most explored and best understood form of knowledge representation -- are particularly important for data mining, as they offer the best tradeoff between human and machine understandability. This book presents the fundamentals of rule learning as investigated in classical machine learning and modern data mining. It introduces a feature-based view, as a unifying framework for propositional and relational rule learning, thus bridging the gap between attribute-value learning and inductive logic programming, and providing complete coverage of most important elements of rule learning.The book can be used as a textbook for teaching machine learning, as well as a comprehensive reference to research in the field of inductive rule learning. As such, it targets students, researchers and developers of rule learning algorithms, presenting the fundamental rule learning concepts in sufficient breadth and depth to enable the reader to understand, develop and apply rule learning techniques to real-world data. --	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4040936-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4428654-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033447-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4389503-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193754-5>

The Central and Eastern European countries and the European Union ¤ The accession of ten new members to the European Union on May 1st 2004 is among the most significant developments in the history of European integration. Based upon studies conducted by the European Forecasting Network, this book analyses key aspects of the impact of this recent enlargement with reference to eight of the ten new Member States, namely the Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs). It demonstrates that the enlargement could have profound consequences on both the new Member States and on the pre-accession members of the Union, given the unparalleled magnitude of the enlargement, the fact that the CEECs have levels of prosperity and economic development well below the Union average, and their history of participation in centrally planned regimes. The contributions examine regional policy, the debate about accession to the EMU, the macroeconomic trajectories of the Central and Eastern European economies to date and their likely future development.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170174-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071013-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128080-5>
Sovereignty and revolution in the Iberian Atlantic ¤ This book takes a bold new look at both Spain's and Portugal's New World empires in a trans-Atlantic context. It argues that modern notions of sovereignty in the Atlantic world have been unstable, contested, and equivocal from the start. It shows how much contemporary notions of sovereignty emerged in the Americas as a response to European imperial crises in the age of revolutions. Jeremy Adelman reveals how many modernday uncertainties about property, citizenship, and human rights were forged in an epic contest over the very nature of state power in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Sovereignty and Revolution in the Iberian Atlantic offers a new understanding of Latin American and Atlantic history, one the blurs traditional distinctions between the "imperial" and the "colonial." It shows how the Spanish and Portuguese empires responded to the pressures of rival states and merchant capitalism in the eighteenth century. As empires adapted, the ties between colonies and mother countries transformed, recreating trans-Atlantic bonds of loyalty and interests. In the end, colonies repudiated their Iberian loyalties not so much because they sought independent nationhood. Rather, as European conflicts and revolutions swept across the Atlantic, empires were no longer viable models of sovereignty-and there was less to be loyal to. The Old Regimes collapsed before subjects began to imagine new ones in their place. The emergence of Latin American nations - indeed many of our contemporary notions of sovereignty - was the effect, and not the cause, of the breakdown of European empires Empires that bleed -- Capitalism, slavery on imperial hinterlands -- Between war and peace -- The wealth of empires -- Spanish secessions -- Brazilian counterpoints -- Dissolutions of the Spanish Atlantic -- Crossing the Rubicon -- Revolution and sovereignty	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026651-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121814-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031790-0>

Model-based engineering of an automotive adaptive exterior lighting system : realistic example specifications of behavioral requirements and functional design ¤ Model-based engineering is a well-established approach to cope with the complexity of today's embedded systems. Furthermore, model-based engineering can address industry needs for highly automated development solutions to foster correctness of safety-critical systems. In contrast, there is a vital lack of accessible specification documents for researchers for evaluation purposes. Evaluation of proposed engineering methods often relies on academic examples, automatically created unrealistic artificial models, or simple industrial specification excerpts. This research report aims at supporting researchers with model-based specifications of a real-world system on a competitive level of complexity. Therefore, a model-based specification of an Adaptive Exterior Lighting System (ELS) is presented that is part of an Automotive System Cluster (ASC). An ELS provides fundamental and additional functionalities for the well-known turn signal and low / high beam headlights. The specification documents the behavioral requirements and the functional design of the ELS, which are important artifacts in function-centered engineering. As modeling languages ITU Message Sequence Charts, Function Network, and Function Behavior Diagrams are used.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4832365-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140467-1>

Container terminals and automated transport systems : logistics control issues and quantitative decision support ¤ Container transportation is the predominant mode of inter-continental cargo traffic. Since container ships and port terminals involve a huge capital investment and significant daily operating costs, it is of crucial importance to efficiently utilize the internal resources of container terminals and transportation systems. Today there is an ongoing trend to use automated container handling and transportation technology, in particular, in countries with high labour costs. This in turn requires highly sophisticated control strategies in order to meet the desired performance measures. The primary objective of this book is to reflect these recent developments and to present new insights and successful solutions to operational problems of automated container terminals and transportation systems. It comprises reports on the state of the art, applications of quantitative methods, as well as case studies and simulation results.

No education without relation ¤ This book is a collective statement about a new approach to education - the pedagogy of relation. After revisiting a number of existing conversations, the authors bring together several theoretical traditions under the umbrella of the pedagogy of relation. This book is an appeal to develop a common frame of reference for educational approaches based on the primacy of relations in education. The authors try to understand human relations rather than educational processes, behaviors, methods, curriculum, etc. The authors also examine the dangers that a pedagogy of relations may present, and the implications such a pedagogy may have for curriculum and educational policy. The promise of the pedagogy of relation is to offer a viable alternative to dominating trends in educational thinking - trends that emphasize control over teacher and student behavior as the main way of achieving excellence	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173087-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035088-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053369-4>

The MeDUSA reference manual, second edition ¤ BEGIN MeDUSA (Method for UML2-based Construction of Embedded & Real-Time Software) is a model-based software construction method targeting the domain of small embedded & real-time software. MeDUSA was developed by the Research Group Software Construction of the RWTH Aachen University in close cooperation with the German ABB Corporate Research Centre. It incorporates various practical experiences gained during the industrial development of embedded software in ABB Business Unit Instrumentation. Being Use Case-driven, MeDUSA systematically covers the software construction lifecycle phase from the early requirements up to implementation. Models are successively developed and employed throughout all activities. By enforcing a class-based rather than an object-oriented design, a smooth transition of the resulting design model towards an implementation in a procedural programming language is facilitated. This is essential, as procedural programming languages as the C language are still state-of-the-art in the domain of small embedded & real-time software.

Survey on healthcare IT systems : standards, regulations and security ¤ IT systems for healthcare are a complex and exciting field. One the one hand, there is a vast number of improvements and work alleviations that computers can bring to everyday healthcare. Some ways of treatment, diagnoses and organisational tasks were even made possible by computer usage in the first place. On the other hand, there are many factors that encumber computer usage and make development of IT systems for healthcare a challenging, sometimes even frustrating task. These factors are not solely technology-related, but just as well social or economical conditions. This report describes some of the idiosyncrasies of IT systems in the healthcare domain, with a special focus on legal regulations, standards and security.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7542254-2>

Addressing the gaps in market diffusion modeling of electrical vehicles : a case study from Germany for the integration of environmental policy measures ¤ Electric vehicles (EVs) can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of the transportation sector. Therefore, the German government has defined various measures and targets to promote the diffusion of EVs. However, factors influencing the market diffusion of EVs as well as interdependencies between policy measures and vehicle diffusion are often unclear and hence, diffusion simulations are probably inaccurate. At the same time, a precise simulation of EV diffusion is a relevant parameter in travel demand models building the base for transportation planning. This paper addresses the gaps in current market diffusion models for EVs with a particular focus on environmental effects as additional influencing factors of the market diffusion. Results will be drawn for the German car market with a market diffusion simulation until 2050. The market diffusion model ALADIN is applied and energy prices are extended by a CO2 price to improve the consideration of environmental factors in the market diffusion modelling. The effectiveness of environmental policy measures is assessed in scenarios with three different CO2 prices and their impact on the diffusion of EVs. The results show that the market diffusion is highly dependent on the evolution of external factors. A CO2 price of at least 150 €/t of CO2 by 2030 can have a significant impact on the market diffusion of EVs and may as well lead to changes in the drive mix for both, electric and conventional drives within the German passenger car fleet. The German government’s target of seven to ten million EVs registered by 2030 seems in general achievable, if currently adopted purchase bonuses and expected cost degression for EVs also take effect. Until 2050, we find large effects with CO2 prices up to 500 €/t, yet limited growth in market share above that threshold.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161820-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055072-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059277-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062954-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151795-7>

Location theory : a unified approach ; with 36 tables ¤ Although modern location theory is now more than 90 years old, the focus of researchers in this area has been mainly problem oriented. However, a common theory, which keeps the essential characteristics of classical location models, is still missing. This monograph addresses this issue. A flexible location problem called the Ordered Median Problem (OMP) is introduced. For all three main subareas of location theory (continuous, network and discrete location) structural properties of the OMP are presented and solution approaches provided. Numerous illustrations and examples help the reader to become familiar with this new location model. By Using OMP classical results of location theory can be reproved in a more general and sometimes even simpler way. Algorithms enable the reader to solve very flexible location models with a single implementation. In addition, the code of some algorithms is available for download.

Infinite-horizon optimal control in the discrete-time framework ¤ In this book the authors take a rigorous look at the infinite-horizon discrete-time optimal control theory from the viewpoint of Pontryagin's principles. Several Pontryagin principles are described which govern systems and various criteria which define the notions of optimality, along with a detailed analysis of how each Pontryagin principle relate to each other. The Pontryagin principle is examined in a stochastic setting and results are given which generalize Pontryagin's principles to multi-criteria problems. Infinite-Horizon Optimal Control in the Discrete-Time Framework is aimed toward researchers and PhD students in various scientific fields such as mathematics, applied mathematics, economics, management, sustainable development (such as, of fisheries and of forests), and Bio-medical sciences who are drawn to infinite-horizon discrete-time optimal control problems	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121428-6>

Hartree-Fock-Slater method for materials science : the DV-X [Alpha] method for design and characterization of materials ; with 33 tables ¤ Molecular-orbital calculations for materials design such as alloys, ceramics, and coordination compounds are now possible for experimentalists. Molecuar-orbital calculations for the interpretation of chemical effect of spectra are also possible for experimentalists. The most suitable molecular-orbital calculation method for these purpose is the DV-Xa method, which is robust in such a way that the calculation converges to a result even if the structure of the molecule or solid is impossible&nbsp;in the pressure and temperature ranges on earth. This book specially addresses the methods to design novel materials and to predict the spectrallline shape of unknown materials using the DV-Xa molecular-orbital method, but is also useful for those who want to calculate electronic structures of materials using any kinds of method.

Topology of singular fibers of differentiable maps ¤ The volume develops a thorough theory of singular fibers of generic differentiable maps. This is the first work that establishes the foundational framework of the global study of singular differentiable maps of negative codimension from the viewpoint of differential topology. The book contains not only a general theory, but also some explicit examples together with a number of very concrete applications. This is a very interesting subject in differential topology, since it shows a beautiful interplay between the usual theory of singularities of differentiable maps and the geometric topology of manifolds.

Stochastic optimization methods ¤ Optimization problems arising in practice involve random model parameters. For the computation of robust optimal solutions, i.e., optimal solutions being insensitive with respect to random parameter variations, appropriate deterministic substitute problems are needed. Based on the probability distribution of the random data, and using decision theoretical concepts, optimisation problems under stochastic uncertainty are converted into appropriate deterministic substitute problems. Due to the occurring probabilities and expectations, hence, multiple integrals, approximative solution techniques must be applied. Several deterministic and stochastic approximation methods are provided: Taylor expansion methods, regression and response surface methods (RSM), probability inequalities, First order reliability methods (FORM), convex approximation/deterministic descent directions/efficient points, stochastic gradient methods, stochastic approximation procedures, differentiation formulas for probabilities and expectations. The mathematical properties of the approximative problems and iterative solution procedures (e.g. rate of convergence) are described.

Electric vehicles from life cycle and circular economy perspective ¤ Electric vehicles are anticipated to be a key future component of Europe's mobility system, helping reduce impacts on climate change and air quality. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) comprised around 0.6 % of all new car registrations in the EU in 2017 (EEA, 2018a). By 2030, BEVs could be between 3.9 % and 13.0 % of new car registrations, depending on the EU-wide fleet average CO2 target levels set for passenger cars in the future (EC, 2017a). There is, therefore, an increasing need to understand BEVs from a systems perspective. This involves an in-depth consideration of the environmental impact of the product using life cycle assessment (LCA) as well as taking a broader 'circular economy' approach. On the one hand, LCA is a means of assessing the environmental impact associated with all stages of a product's life from cradle to grave: from raw material extraction and processing to the product's manufacture to its use in everyday life and finally to its end of life. On the other hand, the concept of a circular economy considers impacts and in turn solutions across the whole societal system. In a traditional linear economy products are made, used and then disposed of, whereas in a circular economy the value of materials and products is kept as high as possible for as long as possible (EEA, 2017b). This, in turn, helps reduce requirements for new materials and energy needs, ameliorating environmental pressures. Additional aspects that can be considered within the circular economy concept (e.g. Jackson, 2017; Kopnina, 2017; Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2018) include the use of renewable energy and sustainable consumption, e.g. through the shared ownership of goods. Reflecting their relevance to BEVs, these additional aspects are also considered in this report. The aims of this report are to: - bring together existing evidence on the environmental impact of BEVs across the stages of their life cycle, undertaking where possible comparison with internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs); - consider how a move to a circular economy could reduce these impacts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039785-3>

Innovation, industrial dynamics and structural transformation : Schumpeterian legacies ; with 45 tables ¤ This book provides a account of work in the Schumpeterian and evolutionary tradition of industrial dynamics and the evolution of industries. It is shown that over time industries evolve and change their structure. In this dynamic process change is affected and sometimes constraint by many factors: knowledge and technologies, the capabilities and incentives of actors, new products and processes, and institutions. All these elements and their relations drive innovative activities and affect economic performance in an industry. Investigations into these complex phenomena show a deep interdependence between empirical work delivering a rich account of regularities and stylized facts in the structure of industries and their change, and theoretical analyses ranging from theoretical work to formal modeling.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027089-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061949-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058136-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4431027-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133311-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032134-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026822-6>

People and motion : tips and techniques for drawing on location ¤ Award-winning illustrator Gabriel Campanario first introduced his approach to drawing in The Art of Urban Sketching, a showcase of more than 500 sketches and drawing tips shared by more than 100 urban sketchers around the world. Now, he drills down into specific challenges of making sketches on location, rain or shine, quickly or slowly, and the most suitable techniques for every situation, in The Urban Sketching Handbook series. It's easy to overlook that ample variety of characters that walk the streets everyday. From neighbors, dog walkers and shoppers to dancers and joggers, the people that move through the cities and towns are fascinating subjects to study and sketch. In The Urban Sketching Handbook: People and Motion Gabriel lays out keys to help make the experience of drawing humans and movements fun and rewarding. Using composition, depth, scale, contrast, line and creativity, sketching out citizens and the way they move has never been more inspirational and entertaining. This guide will help you to develop your own creative approach, no matter what your skill level may be today. As much as The Urban Sketching Handbook: People and Motion may inspire you to draw more individuals, it can also help to increase your appreciation of the folks around you.

openHPI : the MOOC offer at Hasso Plattner Institute ¤ The new interactive online educational platform openHPI, (https://openHPI.de) from Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI), offers freely accessible courses at no charge for all who are interested in subjects in the field of information technology and computer science. Since 2011, “Massive Open Online Courses,” called MOOCs for short, have been offered, first at Stanford University and then later at other U.S. elite universities. Following suit, openHPI provides instructional videos on the Internet and further reading material, combined with learning-supportive self-tests, homework and a social discussion forum. Education is further stimulated by the support of a virtual learning community. In contrast to “traditional” lecture platforms, such as the tele-TASK portal (http://www.tele-task.de) where multimedia recorded lectures are available on demand, openHPI offers didactic online courses. The courses have a fixed start date and offer a balanced schedule of six consecutive weeks presented in multimedia and, whenever possible, interactive learning material. Each week, one chapter of the course subject is treated. In addition, a series of learning videos, texts, self-tests and homework exercises are provided to course participants at the beginning of the week. The course offering is combined with a social discussion platform where participants have the opportunity to enter into an exchange with course instructors and fellow participants. Here, for example, they can get answers to questions and discuss the topics in depth. The participants naturally decide themselves about the type and range of their learning activities. They can make personal contributions to the course, for example, in blog posts or tweets, which they can refer to in the forum. In turn, other participants have the chance to comment on, discuss or expand on what has been said. In this way, the learners become the teachers and the subject matter offered to a virtual community is linked to a social learning network.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4727098-6>
Successful test management : an integral approach ; with 44 tables ¤ For change projects to succeed, organizations must carry out targeted risk management. This certainly applies to the complex IT projects that are taking place under current market conditions! An important success factor in this is the continuous involvement of the client and other stakeholders. This is often entirely lacking or inadequate. However, a sound test management approach based on Risk & Requirement Based Testing helps to increase that involvement. It is aimed at identifying risks in connection with the development and implementation of an IT system, such as the loss of market share, compensation claims, damage to reputation or high maintenance costs. Test Management is not something that a Project Leader does 'on top of everything else'. There are countless activities that the Test Manager has to carry out. To provide insight into these activities and their relationship with each other, LogicaCMG has developed the Test Management Model. This model describes the Test Manager's activities from the start of a test project up to the moment of the information system's implementation, thus creating an integral whole. On the principle of Test Management = Risk Management, this book equips the reader to set up test projects, to manage them and to communicate with the stakeholders. Besides a description of the theory of each activity, the chapters provide as many hints and tips as possible: what works best in the Test Manager's working practice and what he should guard against. The appendices contain checklists and templates that support the chapters, and with these, the reader is able to set to work immediately. TOC:1. Testing and Test Management 2.

A comparison of the Bayesian and frequentist approaches to estimation ¤ This monograph contributes to the area of comparative statistical inference. Attention is restricted to the important subfield of statistical estimation. The book is intended for an audience having a solid grounding in probability and statistics at the level of the year-long undergraduate course taken by statistics and mathematics majors. The necessary background on decision theory and the frequentist and Bayesian approaches to estimation is presented and carefully discussed in Chapters 1-3. The 'threshold problem'--identifying the boundary between Bayes estimators which tend to outperform standard frequentist estimators and Bayes estimators which don't--is formulated in an analytically tractable way in Chapter 4. The formulation includes a specific (decision-theory based) criterion for comparing estimators. The centerpiece of the monograph is Chapter 5, in which, under quite general conditions, an explicit solution to the threshold is obtained for the problem of estimating a scalar parameter under squared error loss. The six chapters that follow address a variety of other contexts in which the threshold problem can be productively treated. Included are treatments of the Bayesian consensus problem, the threshold problem for estimation problems involving of multidimensional parameters and/or asymmetric loss, the estimation of nonidentifiable parameters, empirical Bayes methods for combining data from 'similar' experiments, and linear Bayes methods for combining data from 'related' experiments. The final chapter provides an overview of the monograph's highlights and a discussion of areas and problems in need of further research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182963-3>

Thermodynamics, Gibbs method and statistical physics of electron gases ¤ This book deals with theoretical thermodynamics and the statistical physics of electron and particle gases. While treating the laws of thermodynamics from both classical and quantum theoretical viewpoints, it posits that the basis of the statistical theory of macroscopic properties of a system is the microcanonical distribution of isolated systems, from which all canonical distributions stem. To calculate the free energy, the Gibbs method is applied to ideal and non-ideal gases, and also to a crystalline solid. Considerable attention is paid to the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein quantum statistics and its application to different quantum gases, and electron gas in both metals and semiconductors is considered in a nonequilibrium state. A separate chapter treats the statistical theory of thermodynamic properties of an electron gas in a quantizing magnetic field.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057000-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059827-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151870-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4755839-8>

Developments in collectively agreed pay 2000-2017 ¤ This report examines the development of collectively agreed pay in conjunction with the development of actual compensation (‘wages’) and labour productivity in real terms. It applies both a longer-term perspective (the early 2000s to 2017) and a short-term perspective, with a focus on the outcomes of the most recent bargaining rounds in 2016–2017 as well as on the development of public sector negotiated pay. In most countries with available data (14 EU Member States), there has been a positive wage drift since the early 2000s, indicating that actual wages have grown more than collectively agreed pay. While growth in collectively agreed pay has, by and large, gained momentum in 2017, this has often not translated into growth in real terms due to inflation rates. In fact, 6 out of these 14 countries even saw a decline in collectively agreed pay in real terms.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138425-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002641-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013887-2>

Fuzzy statistics ¤ This monograph introduces elementary fuzzy statistics based on crisp (non-fuzzy) data. In the introductory chapters the book presents a very readable survey of fuzzy sets including fuzzy arithmetic and fuzzy functions. The book develops fuzzy estimation and demonstrates the construction of fuzzy estimators for various important and special cases of variance, mean and distribution functions. It is shown how to use fuzzy estimators in hypothesis testing and regression, which leads to a comprehensive presentation of fuzzy hypothesis testing and fuzzy regression as well as fuzzy prediction.

In black and white : race and sports in America ¤ In this compact volume, Kenneth L. Shropshire confronts prominent racial myths head-on, offering both a descriptive history of and prescriptive solutions for the most pressing problems currently affecting sports. Interestingly, Shropshire reveals how sports were once much less segregated than they later became - after white players and owners felt threatened by the presence and abilities of black competitors. [...] In the insular world of sport, characterized by a feeder system through which former players often move up to become coaches, managers, executives, and owners, blacks are eminently qualified. For example, after decades of active involvement with their sport, they often bring to the table experiences more relevant to the black players who make up the majority of professional athletes. Given the centrality of sport in American life, it is imperative that the industry be a leader, not a laggard, in the arena of racial equality. Informed by Frederick Douglass's belief that 'power concedes nothing without a demand,' In Black and White casts its net widely, dissecting claims of colorblindness and reverse racism as self-serving, rhetorical camouflage and scrutinizing professional and collegiate sports, sports agents, and owners alike. No mere polemic, however, the volume looks optimistically forward, outlining strategies of interest to all those who have a stake, professional or otherwise, in sports and racial equality	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048442-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056366-2>

Wassily Leontief and input-output economics ¤ Wassily Leontief (1905-1999) was the founding father of input-output economics, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1973. This book offers a collection of papers in memory of Leontief by his students and close colleagues. The first part, 'Reflections on Input-Output Economics', focuses upon Leontief as a person and scholar as well as his personal contributions to economics. It includes contributions by Nobel Laureate Paul A. Samuelson who shares his memories of a young Professor Leontief at Harvard and ends with the last joint interview with Wassily and his wife, to date previously unpublished. The second part, 'Perspectives of Input-Output Economics', includes new theoretical and empirical research inspired by Leontief's work and offers a wide-ranging sample of the current state of interindustry economics, a field Leontief founded. This is a strong collection likely to appeal to a wide range of professionals in universities, government, industry and international organizations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027105-5>
Thomas Paine and the literature of revolution ¤ The American School of Empire considers how an American idea of empire evolved in the 1790s and would shape and be shaped by the literature and art of the early US. Hamilton's introductory essay suggests that empire was as important to the foundation of the US as concepts like democracy, freedom, nation, and republic. This book thus begins from the premise that the history of empire in the United States can be traced back to the inception of the country, if not earlier. It contends that the United States was conceived as an empire, culturally, politically, and legally. Empire, as a broad theory for organizing not only the state but also the understanding of difference and the relationship to space, in other words, was a crucial conceptual frame shaping the culture of the early US -- Provided by publisher Inventing an American public : the Pennsylvania Magazine and revolutionary American political discourse -- 'Could the wolf bleat like the lamb' : Paine's critique of the early American public sphere -- Writing revolutionary history -- The science of revolution : technological metaphors and scientific methodology in Rights of man and the Age of reason -- 'Strong friends and violent enemies' : the historical construction of Thomas Paine through the nineteenth century -- Paine and nineteenth century American literary history	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035964-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049680-6>
Inductive invariant checking with partial negative application conditions ¤ Graph transformation systems are a powerful formal model to capture model transformations or systems with infinite state space, among others. However, this expressive power comes at the cost of rather limited automated analysis capabilities. The general case of unbounded many initial graphs or infinite state spaces is only supported by approaches with rather limited scalability or expressiveness. In this report we improve an existing approach for the automated verification of inductive invariants for graph transformation systems. By employing partial negative application conditions to represent and check many alternative conditions in a more compact manner, we can check examples with rules and constraints of substantially higher complexity. We also substantially extend the expressive power by supporting more complex negative application conditions and provide higher accuracy by employing advanced implication checks. The improvements are evaluated and compared with another applicable tool by considering three case studies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274073-3>

Cultures merging : a historical and economic critique of culture ¤ Economists agree about many things--contrary to popular opinion--but the majority agree about culture only in the sense that they no longer give it much thought. So begins the first chapter of Cultures Merging, in which Eric Jones--one of the world's leading economic historians--takes an eloquent, pointed, and personal look at the question of whether culture determines economics or is instead determined by it. Bringing immense learning and originality to the issue of cultural change over the long-term course of global economic history, Jones questions cultural explanations of much social behavior in Europe, East Asia, the United States, Australia, and the Middle East. He also examines contemporary globalization, arguing that while centuries of economic competition have resulted in the merging of cultures into fewer and larger units, these changes have led to exciting new syntheses. Culture matters to economic outcomes, Jones argues, but cultures in turn never stop responding to market forces, even if some elements of culture stubbornly persist beyond the time when they can be explained by current economic pressures. In the longer run, however, cultures show a fluidity that will astonish some cultural determinists. Jones concludes that culture's 'ghostly transit through history' is much less powerful than noneconomists often claim, yet it has a greater influence than economists usually admit. The product of a lifetime of reading and thinking on culture and economics, a work of history and an analysis of the contemporary world, Cultures Merging will be essential reading for anyone concerned about the interaction of cultures and markets around the world.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037653-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120627-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125698-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4114036-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033572-0>
Clays ¤ This monograph presents the fundamentals of the mineralogy and geology of clays. The chemical or isotopic composition and the crystalline structure of clays is based on some relatively simple laws. Abundant illustrations help to understand the subject and can be used in courses. The organization of the book follows a logical structure. From the representation of the structure of minerals, the determination of their crystalline state by using X-ray diffractometer measurements (and other techniques) the thermodynamic and kinematic conditions of their formation is reconstructed. Then the genesis and alteration of the clays at their natural occurrences is discussed. In the last chapter it is stressed that clay minerals can form in variety of different environments: meteorites, lavas, subduction zones for example. The book is aimed for graduate students and scientists (geologists, geographers, engineers, environmental and soil scientist) who want to get a comprehensive introduction in the topic	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130684-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121648-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185646-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039457-8>

Legal Action Requirement for Adapting to the Consequences of Climate Change: Analysis, Further and New Development of Legal Instruments ¤ In Europe and in Germany, climate change will bring about additional environmental risks against which precautionary measures will have to be taken. Against this backdrop, it is analyzed whether existing environmental and planning laws are providing for sufficient precautionary action or in how far they ought to be adapted to the impacts of climate change. The first part of the study explores the strategic challenges and basic constitutional conditions of such regulatory adaptation. The second part then focuses on those fields of environmental and planning law that are probably most affected by the impacts of climate change, i.e., flood protection, coastal protection, water quality, water availability, soil protection, plant safety, spatial planning, environmental impact assessment and monitoring	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061643-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1>

Modeling solvent environments : applications to simulations of biomolecules ¤ While much attention has been given to the development of realistic macromolecular models, this book focuses on latest advances in modeling the equally important solvent environment in an accurate and efficient manner. A comprehensive view of the current methods for modeling solvent environments is presented in contributions from the leading researchers in the field. Throughout, the emphasis is placed on the application of such models in simulation studies of biological processes, although the coverage is sufficiently broad to extend to other systems as well. The book presents a comprehensive account of the many recently developed new methods and contrasts their different strengths. As such, this monograph treats a full range of topics, from statistical mechanics-based approaches to popular mean field formalisms, coarse-grained solvent models, more established explicit, fully atomic solvent models, and recent advances in applying ab initio methods for modeling solvent properties.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4168032-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4265444-0>

Global existence results for viscoplasticity at finite strain ¤ We study a model for rate-dependent gradient plasticity at finite strain based on the multiplicative decomposition of the strain tensor, and investigate the existence of global-in-time solutions to the related PDE system. We reveal its underlying structure as a generalized gradient system, where the driving energy functional is highly nonconvex and features the geometric nonlinearities related to finite-strain elasticity as well as the multiplicative decomposition of finite-strain plasticity. Moreover, the dissipation potential depends on the left-invariant plastic rate and thus, depends on the plastic state variable. The existence theory is developed for a class of abstract, nonsmooth, and nonconvex gradient systems, for which we introduce suitable notions of solutions, namely energy-dissipation-balance (EDB) and energy-dissipation-inequality (EDI) solutions. Hence, we resort to the toolbox of the direct method of the calculus of variations to check that the specific energy and dissipation functionals for our viscoplastic models comply with the conditions of the general theory.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032296-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136051-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1120622891>

Red scare or red menace? : American communism and anticommunism in the Cold War era ¤ Anticommunism was a pervasive force in America during the cold war years, influencing domestic politics, the conduct of foreign policy, the nuclear arms race, and a myriad of social and economic circumstances. In this succinct survey, John E. Haynes traces the origins of American attitudes toward communism in the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of a full-blown cause in the years following World War II, and the relative decline of anticommunism as a political issue in the sixties and seventies. As one of a handful of American scholars allowed to review documents in newly opened archives once held by the Soviet Union, Mr. Haynes uses fresh evidence throughout in shedding new light on the U.S. confrontation with communism at home. After describing the buildup of the American Communist party in the twenties and thirties, he focuses on the heyday of popular anticommunism from 1945 to 1960. Along the way he touches on the chief episodes, personalities, and institutions of cold war anticommunism, showing how earlier campaigns against domestic fascists and right-wingers provided most all of anticommunism's tactics and weapons. And he dissects the various anti-Communist constituencies, analyzing their origins, motives, and activities. From the Soviet archives, Mr. Haynes draws on new and indisputable evidence that the Soviet Union heavily subsidized the American Communist party from its earliest days; maintained an underground organization in Washington in the 1930s that reported to American party leaders and in turn to Moscow on U.S. government activities; and placed American party members in the wartime Office of Strategic Services and Office of War Information, the government's chief intelligence and propaganda agencies. He also confirms much of Elizabeth Bentley's 1940s accusations of Communist infiltration in government	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4168413-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002291-2>

Adiabatic perturbation theory in quantum dynamics ¤ Separation of scales plays a fundamental role in the understanding of the dynamical behaviour of complex systems in physics and other natural sciences. A prominent example is the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in molecular dynamics. This book focuses on a recent approach to adiabatic perturbation theory, which emphasizes the role of effective equations of motion and the separation of the adiabatic limit from the semiclassical limit. A detailed introduction gives an overview of the subject and makes the later chapters accessible also to readers less familiar with the material. Although the general mathematical theory based on pseudodifferential calculus is presented in detail, there is an emphasis on concrete and relevant examples from physics. Applications range from molecular dynamics to the dynamics of electrons in a crystal and from the quantum mechanics of partially confined systems to Dirac particles and nonrelativistic QED.

Measuring vulnerability to natural hazards : towards disaster resilient societies ¤ “Climate change adaptation”, “building resilience” and “vulnerability and risk reduction” are noble words, but do we really know what is meant by these terms and how to assess their respective progress? This book seeks to address these questions. The world has recently experienced disasters of a magnitude rarely seen before: the cascading disaster in Japan, the earthquake in Haiti, and floods in Pakistan and Australia are a few prominent examples. These major disasters underline the fact that many communities and world regions are still vulnerable to extreme events and natural hazards. Additionally, creeping changes, such as sea level rise, are emerging pressures in the context of climate change. These changes are very likely to seriously affect livelihoods in many regions. The dynamic and complex interaction between vulnerable communities, and climate- and non-climate-related, sudden-onset and creeping hazards will most likely increase the risk of crises and disasters in the future. Following the popularity of the first edition, this volume has been completely revised and fully updated. This new edition includes the dimension of adaptation to climate change and new risks resulting from climate change. It combines practical examples from Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe with theoretical and conceptual frameworks. It is key reading for all those interested in improving risk reduction and adaptation strategies to extreme events and gradual changes in the context of climate change and natural hazards.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041387-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029932-6>

Social costs of energy consumption : external effects of electricity generation in the Federal Republic of Germany; [a report prep. under contract for the Comm. of the European Communities, Directorate General for Science, Research and Development by Fraunhofer-Inst. für Systemtechnik u. Innovationsforschung] ¤ This report systemically compares all kinds of external costs and benefits of different electricity generating technologies. Environmental effects, employment and production effects, the depletion of natural resources and different kinds of public subsidies are all considered. Electricity production based on fossil fuels and nuclear energy is compared to electricity production with wind energy and photovoltaic systems. The impact of including the substantial external effects in the electricity prices on the competitive position of different energy technologies is analyzed. It is shown that the present allocation process is seriously distorted resulting in sub-optimal investment decisions concerning competing energy technologies. For the first time this book carries through the theoretically discussed idea of external effects of energy systems not only to the quantification of different kinds of external effects but analyzes the consequences for the choice of competing electricity generating technologies. The analysis shows that renewable energy sources are at a serious competitive disadvantage as long as external costs are not taken into consideration. The introduction of wind energy systems on a broad scale may be delayed up to fifteen years. This results in considerable costs to society. The book suggests possible corrective actions	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055720-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014736-8>

Low thermal expansion glass ceramics : with 21 tables ¤ This book appears in the authoritative series reporting the international research and development activities conducted by the Schott group of companies. This series provides an overview of Schott's activities for scientists, engineers, and managers from all branches of industry worldwide in which glasses and glass ceramics are of interest. Each volume begins with a chapter providing a general idea of the current problems, results, and trends relating to the subjects treated. This new extended edition describes the fundamental principles, the manufacturing process, and applications of low thermal expansion glass ceramics. The composition, structure, and stability of polycrystalline materials with a low thermal expansion are described, and it is shown how low thermal expansion glass ceramics can be manufactured from appropriately chosen glass compositions. Examples illustrate the formation of this type of glass ceramic by utilizing normal production processes together with controlled crystallization. Thus glass ceramics with thermal coefficients of expansion of less than 0.3 x 10^(-6)K^(-1) can be obtained. Even for the mass production of high-quality cooktop panels (Ceran (R)), oven windows, and other household appliances, a high reproducibility of the properties is achieved. Special glass ceramics (Zerodur (R)) for technological and scientific applications such as high-precision optics or large astronomical mirrors are also discussed. The completely revised edition also features new sections on glass-ceramic applications, with details on their performance, CDC-grinding, and laser gyroscopes containing Zerodur (R).

Considering timescales in the post-closure safety of geological disposal of radioactive waste ¤ A key challenge in the development of safety cases for the deep geological disposal of radioactive waste is handling the long time frame over which the radioactive waste remains hazardous. The intrinsic hazard of the waste decreases with time, but some hazard remains for extremely long periods. This report reviews the current status and ongoing discussions of this issue, addressing such issues as ethical principles, the evolution of the hazard over time, uncertainties in the evolution of the disposal system (and how these uncertainties themselves evolve), the stability and predictability of the system, and other topics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123143-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120653-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054790-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048190-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322950-5>

Fuzzy mathematical programming and fuzzy matrix games ¤ This book presents a systematic and focused study of the application of fuzzy sets to two basic areas of decision theory, namely Mathematical Programming and Matrix Game Theory. Apart from presenting most of the basic results available in the literature on these topics, the emphasis is on understanding their natural relationship in a fuzzy environment. The study of duality theory for fuzzy mathematical programming problem plays a key role in understanding this interrelationship. For this, a theoretical framework of duality in fuzzy mathematical programming and conceptualization of the solution of a fuzzy game is created on the lines of their crisp counterparts. Most of the theoretical results and associated algorithms are illustrated through small numerical examples from actual applications.

Engineering thermofluids : thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer ¤ The "Engineering Thermofluids" is a unique textbook, which brings the three pillars of thermal sciences; thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer under one umbrella. These three distinct, yet intertwined subjects are treated in an integrated manner. The primary audiences for this book are senior undergraduate, graduate, and practicing engineers in the fields of aeronautical, chemical industrial, mechanical, and nuclear engineering. Topics are discussed in detail while still using a simple and easy to follow approach. Numerous walk-through examples are solved and illustrations are provided to guide the reader through more subtle topics. Each chapter starts with a section for the introduction of various terminologies used. The chapter on thermodynamics covers the first law, the second law, the power cycles, and the mixture of gases. The chapter on fluid mechanics covers both steady-state and transient single phase-flow as well as two-phase flow. The chapter on heat transfer covers conduction, convection, radiation, boiling, and condensation. These chapters are followed by the chapter on applications of the engineering thermofluid, which covers the design and operations of various heat exchangers, turbomachines, and flowmeters. Many practical design problems are either solved or provided as homework. Practicing engineers will find this book a useful text to have around for the many practical problems and solutions, illustrations, definitions, methods, tables, and figures provided. The preference throughout the text is on obtaining analytical solutions of a closed form. Numerical solutions as well as experimental results are presented when analytical solutions cannot be found.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133173-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064211-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059827-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077970-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017621-6>

Mapping varieties of industrial relations : Eurofound's analytical framework applied ¤ The 2016 Eurofound report "Mapping key dimensions of industrial relations" defines industrial relations as the collective and individual governance of work and employment. It identifies four key dimensions. Industrial democracy, based on the direct and indirect participation rights of employers and employees in the governance of the employment relationship, the autonomy of both sides of industry as collective organisations and their collective capacity to influence decision-making. Industrial competitiveness, based on an economy with a consistently high rate of productivity growth and good performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). To be competitive, it is essential to promote research and innovation, information and communication technologies, entrepreneurship, competition, and education and training. Industrial competitiveness, based on an economy with a consistently high rate of productivity growth and good performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). To be competitive, it is essential to promote research and innovation, information and communication technologies, entrepreneurship, competition, and education and training. Quality of work and employment, based on career and employment security, health and well-being, the ability to reconcile working and non-working life, and the opportunity to develop skills over the life course. However, the interpretation, application and implementation of these key dimensions depend on the stakeholders’ affiliation and their national industrial relations system. Therefore, the report stresses the usefulness of further developing this conceptual framework, especially for cross-country comparisons and mutual learning processes. To this end, a first assessment of existing data sources and indicators was carried out. The current study is a continuation of this work, with the aim of further fine-tuning the set of indicators. It also assesses how and to what extent the conceptual framework of the key dimensions of industrial relations can be applied to the national level.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002617-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026860-3>
Models in cooperative game theory : crisp, fuzzy, and multi-choice games ¤ This book investigates models in cooperative game theory in which the players have the possibility to cooperate partially. In a crisp game the agents are either fully involved or not involved at all in coperation with some other agents, while in a fuzzy game players are allowed to cooperate with infinite many different participation levels, varying from non-cooperation to full cooperation. A multi-choice game describes the intermediate case in which each player may have a fixed number of activity levels. Different set and one-point solution concepts for these games are presented. The properties of these solution concepts and their interrelations on several classes of crisp, fuzzy, and multi-choice games are studied. Applications of the investigated models to many economic situations are indicated as well.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043586-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4728168-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120603-4>

Specialty construction techniques for dam and levee remediation ¤ Dams and levees provide huge support or protection for infrastructure. They may be expensive to maintain but the cost of ignoring them can be vastly greater, as the aftermath of the 2005 Hurricane Katrina showed. System design flaws necessitate a major programme of renewal and remediation, which for Katrina alone is expected to cost around eighty billion dollars. Various specialty geotechnical processes are currently being used for dam and levee remediation. Speciality Construction Techniques for Dam and Levee Remediation deals with the construction of hydraulic cut-offs in fill, soil and rock; mainly, but not exclusively, applicable to embankment dams and levees. It then outlines how to use of prestressed rock anchors to stabilize existing concrete dams and appurtenant structures. The first main chapters follow a similar format, with an outline of the means, methods, materials and properties; illustration with case histories; quality assurance and control and verification; and then a summary of lessons learned and recommendations. The remaining main chapters are more generic and provide insight on background issues, instrumentation, specifications and contracts, and overall lessons learned.

International migration : a very short introduction ¤ Looks at the global phenomenon of human migration--both legal and illegal-revealing how migration actually presents opportunities that must be taken advantage of in light of the current economic climate. The author debunks myths such as the claim that migrants take jobs away from local workers, or that they take advantage of health care systems. He reveals why society as we now know it could not function without them. Using interviews with migrants from around the world, the author presents the human side of topics such as asylum and refugees, human trafficking, migrant smuggling, development, and the international labor force. His goal throughout is to allow readers to see beyond the negative spin usually given the subject by the media and politicians, and come to their own conclusions on the current international migration situation	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017604-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4162051-3>

Classical topics in discrete geometry ¤ This multipurpose book can serve as a textbook for a semester long graduate level course giving a brief introduction to Discrete Geometry. It also can serve as a research monograph that leads the reader to the frontiers of the most recent research developments in the classical core part of discrete geometry. Finally, the forty-some selected research problems offer a great chance to use the book as a short problem book aimed at advanced undergraduate and graduate students as well as researchers. The text is centered around four major and by now classical problems in discrete geometry. The first is the problem of densest sphere packings, which has more than 100 years of mathematically rich history. The second major problem is typically quoted under the approximately 50 years old illumination conjecture of V. Boltyanski and H. Hadwiger. The third topic is on covering by planks and cylinders with emphasis on the affine invariant version of Tarski's plank problem, which was raised by T. Bang more than 50 years ago. The fourth topic is centered around the Kneser-Poulsen Conjecture, which also is approximately 50 years old. All four topics witnessed very recent breakthrough results, explaining their major role in this book.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130271-0>

On the strength of cut-based inequalities for capacitated network design polyhedra ¤ In this paper we study capacitated network design problems, differentiating directed, bidirected and undirected link capacity models. We complement existing polyhedral results for the three variants by new classes of facet-defining valid inequalities and unified lifting results. For this, we study the restriction of the problems to a cut of the network. First, we show that facets of the resulting cutset polyhedra translate into facets of the original network design polyhedra if the two subgraphs defined by the network cut are (strongly) connected. Second, we provide an analysis of the facial structure of cutset polyhedra, elaborating the differences caused by the three different types of capacity constraints. We present flow-cutset inequalities for all three models and show under which conditions these are facet-defining. We also state a new class of facets for the bidirected and undirected case and it is shown how to handle multiple capacity modules by Mixed Integer Rounding (MIR).

Hardy operators, function spaces and embeddings ¤ Classical Sobolev spaces, based on Lebesgue spaces on an underlying domain with smooth boundary, are not only of considerable intrinsic interest but have for many years proved to be indispensible in the study of partial differential equations and variational problems. Many developments of the basic theory since its inception arise in response to concrete problems, for example, with the (ubiquitous) sets with fractal boundaries. The theory will probably enjoy substantial further growth, but even now a connected account of the mature parts of it makes a useful addition to the literature. Accordingly, the main themes of this book are Banach spaces and spaces of Sobolev type based on them; integral operators of Hardy type on intervals and on trees; and the distribution of the approximation numbers (singular numbers in the Hilbert space case) of embeddings of Sobolev spaces based on generalised ridged domains. This timely book will be of interest to all those concerned with the partial differential equations and their ramifications. A prerequisite for reading it is a good graduate course in real analysis.

Lower central and dimension series of groups ¤ A fundamental object of study in group theory is the lower central series of groups. Understanding its relationship with the dimension series, which consists of the sub-groups determined by the augmentation powers, is a challenging task. This monograph presents an exposition of different methods for investigating this relationship. In addition to group theorists, the results are also of interest to topologists and number theorists. The approach is mainly combinatorial and homological. A novel feature is an exposition of simplicial methods for the study of problems in group theory.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7635869-0>
