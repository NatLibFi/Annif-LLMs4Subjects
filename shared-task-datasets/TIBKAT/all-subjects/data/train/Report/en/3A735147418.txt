Multiscale analysis and nonlinear dynamics : from genes to the brain
Since modeling multiscale phenomena in systems biology and neuroscience is a highly interdisciplinary task, the editor of the book invited experts in bio-engineering, chemistry, cardiology, neuroscience, computer science, and applied mathematics, to provide their perspectives. Each chapter is a window into the current state of the art in the areas of research discussed and the book is intended for advanced researchers interested in recent developments in these fields. While multiscale analysis is the major integrating theme of the book, its subtitle does not call for bridging the scales from genes to behavior, but rather stresses the unifying perspective offered by the concepts referred to in the title. It is believed that the interdisciplinary approach adopted here will be beneficial for all the above mentioned fields
