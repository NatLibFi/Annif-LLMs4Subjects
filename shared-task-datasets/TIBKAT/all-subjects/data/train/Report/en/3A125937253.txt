An introduction to genetic engineering
"The author presents a basic introduction to the world of genetic engineering. Some twenty years have passed since the first recombinant DNA molecules were constructed at Stanford University. Genetic engineering is now a reality and this book simply and concisely describes to the student the full range of enabling technologies available. The book takes the reader from basic molecular biology through to chapters dealing with the principles behind working with nucleic acids, together with cloning strategies and the tools of the trade. The author discusses the applications of genetic engineering in a clear and engaging manner." "The book is essential reading for first and second year undergraduates, as well as being of interest to sixth form students and their teachers. Medical students and general practitioners will also find this book useful for background information."--BOOK JACKET
