Digital communication over fading channels : a unified approach to performance analysis
Digital Communication over Fading Channels discusses in detail coherent, differentially coherent, and noncoherent communication systems as well as a large variety of fading channel models typical of communication links found in the real world. Coverage also includes single- and multichannel reception and, in the case of the latter, a large variety of diversity types. For each combination of communication type, channel fading model, and diversity type, the average bit error rate and/or symbol error rate is expressed in an easy-to-evaluate form.
