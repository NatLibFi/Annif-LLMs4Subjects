Institutional change and globalization
Problems of institutional analysis -- The problem of change -- The problem of mechanisms -- The problem of ideas -- The problem of globalization -- Where do we go from here?
Institutional change, recognizing the different types and understanding the mechanisms that cause it, are the topics discussed. The arguments are then applied to globalization, correcting some serious misunderstandings. The author also develops a new theory of institutional change that advances the 'new institutional analysis'
