Image fusion : theories, techniques and applications
"This textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to the theories, techniques and applications of image fusion. It is aimed at advanced undergraduate and first-year graduate students in electrical engineering and computer science. It should also be useful to practicing engineers who wish to learn the concepts of image fusion and use them in real-life applications." "The book is intended to be self-contained. No previous knowledge of image fusion is assumed, although some familiarity with elementary image processing and the basic tools of linear algebra is recommended. The book may also be used as a supplementary text for a course on advanced image processing." --Book Jacket
