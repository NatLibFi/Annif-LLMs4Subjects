Optimization techniques for solving complex problems
"Here, a team of international experts brings together core ideas for solving complex problems in optimization across a wide variety of real-world settings, including computer science, engineering, transportation, telecommunications, and bioinformatics. Part One: Covers methodologies for complex problem solving including genetic programming, neural networks, genetic algorithms, hybrid evolutionary algorithms, and more. Part Two: Delves into applications including DNA sequencing and reconstruction, location of antennae in telecommunication networks, metaheuristics, FPGAs, problems arising in telecommunication networks, image processing, time series prediction, and more. All chapters contain examples that illustrate the applications themselves as well as the actual performance of the algorithms. Optimization Techniques for Solving Complex Problems is a valuable resource for practitioners and researchers who work with optimization in real-world settings."--Publisher's description
