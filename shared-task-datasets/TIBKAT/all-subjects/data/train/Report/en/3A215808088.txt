International handbook of labour market policy and evaluation
Verlagsinfo: This major new Handbook is a detailed, up-to-date guide to different national labour markets and policies to combat unemployment and their outcomes. It will become established as a standard reference book – the first of its kind – providing an authoritative account of the rapidly growing field of labour market policy in a coherent and systematic framework. A group of internationally renowned researchers provides a state-of-the-art account of research on three levels; an evaluation of the methods available, an evaluation of policies and policy regimes and an evaluation of institutional frameworks and monitoring systems. Unique features of this reference book include the presentation of a ‘Target-Oriented Approach’ to evaluating labour market policy. The Handbook is international in its approach – all chapters apply an international comparative framework in assessing contemporary developments in the field. International Handbook of Labour Market Policy and Evaluation will be an indispensable source of reference for policymakers, social scientists and academics interested in labour market policy and policy evaluation.
