Fractals and universal spaces in dimension theory : with 91 illustrations and 10 tables
Historically, for metric spaces the quest for universal spaces in dimension theory spanned approximately a century of mathematical research. The history breaks naturally into two periods - the classical and the modern (not-necessarily separable metric). The current volume unifies the modern theory from 1960 to 2007.--
