Adversarial reasoning : computational approaches to reading the opponent's mind
Featuring approaches that draw from disciplines such as artificial intelligence and cognitive modeling, this book describes technologies and applications that address a broad range of practical problems, including military planning and command, military and foreign intelligence, antiterrorism and domestic security, as well as simulation and training systems. The authors present an overview of each problem and then discuss approaches and applications, combining theoretical rigor with accessibility. This comprehensive volume covers intent and plan recognition, deception discovery, and strategy formulation
