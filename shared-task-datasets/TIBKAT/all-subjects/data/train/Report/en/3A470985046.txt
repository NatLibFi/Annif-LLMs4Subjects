Introduction to social research : quantitative and qualitative approaches
'This book offers an excellent description of quantitative and qualitative design and analysis taught in the context of three inquiry pathways: knowledge development, social inquiry, and social research. Furthermore, it provides an excellent overview of both quantitative and qualitative methods with regard to their different epistemologies, methods and techniques. Additionally, Punch provides information guiding students in the use of computers for quantitative and qualitative analysis; and a wide range of illustrative examples to give the book a practical flavour...I would not hesitate to recommend it to my undergraduate students' - "Forum: Qualitative Social Research".'A carefully crafted introduction to social research methodology.
