Systems biology : properties of reconstructed networks
Genome sequences are now available that enable us to determine the biological components that make up a cell or an organism. The new discipline of systems biology examines how these components interact and form networks, and how the networks generate whole cell functions corresponding to observable phenotypes. This textbook, the first devoted to systems biology, describes how to model networks, how to determine their properties, and how to relate these to phenotypic functions. ...
