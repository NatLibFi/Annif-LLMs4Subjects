Brownian hard balls submitted to an infinite range interaction with slow decay
We consider an infinite system of hard balls in Rd undergoing Brownian motions and submitted to a pair potential with infinite range and quasi polynomial decay. It is modelized by an infinite-dimensional Stochastic Differential Equation with an infinite-dimensional local time term. Existence and uniqueness of a strong solution is proven for such an equation with deterministic initial condition. We also show that the set of all equilibrium measures, solution of a Detailed Balance Equation, coincides with the set of canonical Gibbs measures associated to the hard core potential.
