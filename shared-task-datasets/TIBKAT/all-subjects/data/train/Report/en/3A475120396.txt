Mind, matter and the implicate order
Pylkkänen uses concepts such as "implicate order," "active information," and "soma-significance" as tools to tackle well-known problems in the philosophy of mind such as mental causation, the hard problem of consciousness, time consciousness, and virtual reality. Pylkkänen's eclectic approach combines new physics-based insights with those of analytical philosophy, phenomenology, cognitive science and neuroscience and proposes a view in which the mechanistic framework of classical physics and neuroscience is complemented by a more holistic underlying framework in which conscious experience finds its place more naturally.
