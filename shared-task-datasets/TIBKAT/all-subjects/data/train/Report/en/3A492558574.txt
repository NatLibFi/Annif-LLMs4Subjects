Research methods in anthropology : qualitative and quantitative approaches
Research Methods in Anthropology is the standard textbook for methods classes in anthropology programs. Over the past 13 years, it has launched tens of thousands of students into the field with its combination of rigorous methodological advice, wry humor, common sense advice, and numerous examples from actual field projects. Now the third edition of this classic textbook is ready, written in Bernard's unmistakable conversational style. RMA 3 contains all the useful methodological advice of previous editions and more: additional material on text analysis, an expanded section on sampling in field settings, the use of computers for fieldwork and analysis, the pros and cons of rapid assessment techniques in anthropology, and dozens of new examples. "Methods belong to all of us" is the watchword of this book. Whether you are coming from a scientific, interpretive, or applied anthropological tradition, your students should learn field methods from the best guide around.
