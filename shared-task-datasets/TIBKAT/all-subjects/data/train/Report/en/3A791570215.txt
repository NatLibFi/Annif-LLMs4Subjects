Application of modified atmosphere packaging on quality of selected vegetables
"MAP is a storage technique that has already proven to be effective in extending the shelf life of the product by reducing respiration rate and preserving all its quality characteristics. Due to many physiological factors that affect the shelf life of minimally processed vegetables (respiration rate, ethylene production, maturation and ripening) the selection of the ideal storage parameters (gas mixture, storage temperature, packaging film, and treatments prior to packaging) of MAP is a challenging procedure and must be planned carefully."--
