Canadian politics
This book offers a comprehensive introduction to Canadian government and politics by a widely recognized and highly respected group of political scientists writing about subjects on which they are acknowledged experts. For this edition, the editors have organized the book into four sections: Part I: Citizenship, Identities, and Values; Part II: Institutions; Part III: Democracy and Representation; and Part IV: Canada in the World. The fourth section develops a focus on the diverse and increasingly important influences of globalization on the Canadian polity, the environment, and the role of Canada in the world. Of the eighteen chapters, nine are completely new, and six new authors appear, including Martin Papillon on Aboriginal governments, Peter J. Stoett on Canadian international environmental policy, and Andrew F. Cooper on Afghanistan and Canadian foreign policy. The remaining chapters have been thoroughly revised and updated.
