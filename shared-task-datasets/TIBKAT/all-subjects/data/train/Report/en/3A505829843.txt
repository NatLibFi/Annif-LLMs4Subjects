Islamic thought : an introduction
"Islamic Thought" is a fresh and contemporary introduction to the philosophies and doctrines of Islam. Abdullah Saeed, a distinguished modernist Muslim scholar, traces the development of religious knowledge in Islam, from the pre-modern to the modern period. Exploring the influences of Islamic Art and Culture, and the Islamic texts of the Qur'an, and hadith, as well as Sufism, Islamic laws, and politics, "Islamic Thought" is ideal for anyone who wants to understand more about Muslims and the Islamic faith.
