Management of knowledge imperfection in building intelligent systems
"There are many good AI books. Usually they consecrate at most one or two chapters to the imprecision knowledge processing. This book is among the few books to be entirely dedicated to the treatment of knowledge imperfection when building intelligent systems. We consider that an entire book should be focused on this important aspect of knowledge processing. The expected audience for this book includes undergraduate students in computer science, IT&C, mathematics, business, medicine, etc., graduates, specialists and researchers in these fields. The subjects treated in the book include expert systems, knowledge representation, reasoning under knowledge Imperfection (Probability Theory, Possibility Theory, Belief Theory, and Approximate Reasoning). Most of the examples discussed in details throughout the book are from the medical domain."--BOOK JACKET
