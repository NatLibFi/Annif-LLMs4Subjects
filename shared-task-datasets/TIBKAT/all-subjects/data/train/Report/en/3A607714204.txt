Factory planning manual : situation-driven production facility planning
This book describes the factory planning process with its manifold practical characteristics. Previous planning approaches only emanate from the product model. Future plannings need to allow for dissimilarity of an individual factory more strongly, i.e. the factory will feature even more individual characteristics according to its position in the value-added chain. With the methodology presented in the book new factory types can be realized according to the respective requirements. The described methodology has been developed by the authors. Being an extendible concept, it is very useful for the permanent excess planning, rescheduling and replanning of factories. -- From the Back Cover
