Measuring varieties of industrial relations in Europe : a quantitative analysis
Previous Eurofound research has identified four key dimensions of industrial relations: industrial democracy, industrial competitiveness, social justice, and quality of work and employment. This report seeks to build a set of indicators to measure country performance in industrial relations in terms of these four dimensions and to develop a typology of industrial relations systems, enabling a cross-country analysis of trends. The report focuses particularly on industrial democracy, seen in this context as the core dimension of industrial relations and the most desirable model of work and employment governance.
