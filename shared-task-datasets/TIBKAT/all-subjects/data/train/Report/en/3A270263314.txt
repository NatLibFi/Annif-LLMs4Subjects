The Waldensian dissent : persecution and survival, c. 1170-c. 1570
The Waldensians constituted the only heretical group to have survived to the dawn of the so-called 'modern' period. Emerging first in around 1170 they were condemned as heretics, yet they survived across Europe until the sixteenth century. This book tells their unique story of quiet separateness, fear and persecution.
