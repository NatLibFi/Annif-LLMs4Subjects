Simulating fuzzy systems
"Simulating Fuzzy systems" demonstrates how many systems naturally become fuzzy systems and shows how regular (crisp) simulation can be used to estimate the alpha-cuts of the fuzzy numbers used to analyze the behavior of the fuzzy system. This monograph presents a concise introduction to fuzzy sets, fuzzy logic, fuzzy estimation, fuzzy probabilities, fuzzy systems theory and fuzzy computation. It also presents a wide selection of simulation applications ranging from emergency rooms to machine shops to project scheduling showing the varieties of fuzzy systems.
