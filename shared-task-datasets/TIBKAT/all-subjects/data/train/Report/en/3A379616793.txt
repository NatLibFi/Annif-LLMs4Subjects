Lie groups
This book is intended for a one year graduate course on Lie groups. Rather than providing a comprehensive treatment, the author emphasizes the beautiful representation theory of compact groups. However, this book also discusses important topics such as the Bruhat decomposition and the theory of symmetric spaces.
