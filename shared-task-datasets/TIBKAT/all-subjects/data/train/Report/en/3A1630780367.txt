"This study investigates US, UK and German news media coverage of a range of cases that involved human rights violations during military operations including Kosovo, Iraq, Libya, Syria and Egypt. It will be demonstrated that 'humanitarian intervention' and R2P are evoked in the news media if so called 'enemy' countries of Western states conduct human rights violations. The Western news media shows far less concern for human rights violations if they are conducted by Western states and their 'allies'. The news media is supposed to scrutinize governments particularly during times of war. Yet, this study demonstrates that the news media plays a crucial role in facilitating a selective process of shaming during the build-up towards military interventions. This process has led to an erosion of internationally agreed norms of non-intervention, as enshrined in the UN Charter".--Provided by publisher
