Weak links : the universal key to the stability of networks and complex systems
How can our societies be stabilized in a crisis?  Why do we enjoy and understand Shakespeare?  Why are fruitflies uniform?  How do omnivorous eating habits aid our survival?  What makes the Mona Lisa's smile beautiful?  How do women keep their social structures intact? -- Could there possibly be a single answer to all these questions?  This book shows that the statement 'weak links stabilize complex systems' provides the key to understanding each of these intriguing puzzles, and many others too.  The author...uses weak (low affinity, low probability) interactions as a thread to introduce a vast variety of networks from proteins to economics and ecosystems. --From publisher description
