Optimization of polymer nanocomposite properties
"Nanocomposites are organic inorganic hybrid materials where the inorganic filler has at least one dimension in the nanometer scale. By varying the materials used in the process can open a whole wealth ofproperties which are adaptable and amendable for a wide range of applications. This one-stop resource for researchers and developers covers a plethora of polymer properties and their enhancement mechanisms." "With contributors from industry as well as academia, each chapter elucidates in detail the mechanisms to achieve a certain functionality of the polymer nanocomposite, such as improved biodegradability, increased chemical resistance and tribological performance. Special emphasis is laid on the interdependence of the factors affecting the nanocomposite properties such that readers obtain the information necessary to tailor the polymer materials according to their respective application requirements."--BOOK JACKET
