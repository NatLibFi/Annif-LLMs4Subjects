Best practices in software measurement : how to use metrics to improve project and process performance ; with 37 tables
The software business is challenging enough without having to contend with recurring errors. One way repeating errors can be avoided is through effective software measurement. In this volume, Ebert and his co-authors offer practical guidance built upon insight and experience. They detail knowledge and experiences about software measurement in an easily understood, hands-on presentation and explain such current standards as: ISO 15939 (the general measurement standard), ISO 19761 (the COSMIC Full Function Points standard), and CMMI (the Capability Maturity Model). Coverage also includes several case studies, from Global 100 companies such as Alcatel, Deutsche Telekom, and Siemens. This combination of methodologies and applications makes the book ideally suited for professionals in the software industry. Besides the many practical hints and checklists readers will also appreciate the large reference list, which includes links to metrics communities where project experiences are shared.
