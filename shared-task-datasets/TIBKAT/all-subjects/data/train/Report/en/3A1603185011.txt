Digital processing of synthetic aperture radar data : algorithms and implementation
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is of major interest to radar professionals because it allows them to obtain high-resolution images with unsurpassed clarity from satellites that take pictures of the earth's surface in all weather conditions. This cutting-edge resource offers complete "how to" guidance on digital processing of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Professionals discover precisely how this radar system works and gain an in-depth understanding of the properties of SAR data. The book explains how digital computers are used to form the focused image and provides practitioners with state-of-the-art processing algorithms that they can use for their projects. Written from a signal processing point of view, this authoritative volume can be fully understood by professionals and students with a general electrical engineering background.
