Low thermal expansion glass ceramics : with 21 tables
This book appears in the authoritative series reporting the international research and development activities conducted by the Schott group of companies. This series provides an overview of Schott's activities for scientists, engineers, and managers from all branches of industry worldwide in which glasses and glass ceramics are of interest. Each volume begins with a chapter providing a general idea of the current problems, results, and trends relating to the subjects treated. This new extended edition describes the fundamental principles, the manufacturing process, and applications of low thermal expansion glass ceramics. The composition, structure, and stability of polycrystalline materials with a low thermal expansion are described, and it is shown how low thermal expansion glass ceramics can be manufactured from appropriately chosen glass compositions. Examples illustrate the formation of this type of glass ceramic by utilizing normal production processes together with controlled crystallization. Thus glass ceramics with thermal coefficients of expansion of less than 0.3 x 10(-6)K(-1) can be obtained. Even for the mass production of high-quality cooktop panels (Ceran (R)), oven windows, and other household appliances, a high reproducibility of the properties is achieved. Special glass ceramics (Zerodur (R)) for technological and scientific applications such as high-precision optics or large astronomical mirrors are also discussed. The completely revised edition also features new sections on glass-ceramic applications, with details on their performance, CDC-grinding, and laser gyroscopes containing Zerodur (R).
