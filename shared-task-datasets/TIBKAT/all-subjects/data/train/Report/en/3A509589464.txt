Pro-poor macroeconomics : potential and limitations
Economists increasingly agree on the nature of the development and social policies needed to halve poverty over the next ten years. A similar convergence is nowhere in sight in the case of macroeconomic policies. Disagreements in this area remain significant, exacerbated by rising financial instability and a string of banking and currency crises that impacted negatively on poverty, growing macro imbalances in some industrialized countries and the rapid development of difficult-to-regulate international financial markets. This volume presents a pro-poor macroeconomic policy allowing countries to recapture policy space, help promote growth, reduce inequality and diminish poverty in a sustainable way.
