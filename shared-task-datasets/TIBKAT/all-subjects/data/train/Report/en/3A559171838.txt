Postcolonial literature
This Guide analyzes the criticism of English-language literature from the major regions and countries of the postcolonial world. Criticism on works by key writers, such as Jean Rhys, V.S. Naipaul, Salman Rushdie and Jamaica Kincaid, is discussed throughout the volume to illustrate the themes and concepts that are essential to an understanding of postcolonial literature and the development of criticism in the field. Criticism and theoretical approaches are discussed in relation to analyses of literary works from South Africa, Nigeria, Jamaica, Antigua, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India and Sri Lanka. Criticism on Native American writing, African American literature, as well as Irish, Scottish and Welsh liberationist texts are also mentioned throughout. The book concludes with a discussion of the theoretical debates surrounding neocolonialism, globalization and what has been referred to as and the rise of a "new world" economic empire in the West that has accelerated since the dismantling of the Soviet Union.
