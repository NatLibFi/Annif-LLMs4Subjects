Geometric function theory : explorations in complex analysis
Complex variables is a precise, elegant, and captivating subject. Presented from a geometric analytical viewpoint, this work addresses advanced topics in complex analysis that verge on modern areas of research, including: invariant geometry, the Bergman metric, the automorphism groups of domains, extremal length, harmonic measure, boundary regularity of conformal maps, the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations, and the corona problem. The author adroitly weaves these varied topics to reveal a number of delightful interactions. Perhaps more importantly, they are presented with an understanding and explanation of their interrelations with other important parts of mathematics: harmonic analysis, differential geometry, partial differential equations, potential theory, abstract algebra, and invariant theory. Containing an extensive bibliography of both monographs and research papers and a thorough index, the book is methodically designed with individualchapters containing a rich collection of exercises, examples, and illustrations.Seeking to capture the imagination of both advancedundergraduate and graduate students with a basic background in complex analysis,the book impartsa solid educationboth in complex analysis and in how modern mathematics works.
