Wood production, wood technology, and biotechnological impacts
In the year 2001, Prof. Dr. Ursula Kües was appointed at the Faculty of Forest Sciences and Forest Ecology of the Georg-August-University Göttingen to the chair Molecular Wood Biotechnology endowed by the Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt (DBU). Her group studies higher fungi in basic and applied research. Research foci are on mushroom development and on fungal enzymes degrading wood and their applications in wood biotechnology.This book has been edited to thank the DBU for all support given to the chair Molecular Wood Biotechnology. Contributions to the book are from scientists from Göttingen recognised in different fields of forestry and wood science. Chapters presented by members of the group Molecular Wood Biotechnology introduces into their areas of research. The book is designed for interested students of wood biology and wood technology but will also address scientists in the field.
