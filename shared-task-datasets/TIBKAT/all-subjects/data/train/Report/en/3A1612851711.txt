"Supplemented with summaries and references in each chapter, as well as more than 450 drawings and 100 tables, this volume remains the leading resource in isotope geoscience. Broad applications in many other areas - including geochemistry, geology, meteoritics, physics, chemistry, and biology - make it indispensable throughout the natural sciences."--BOOK JACKET
