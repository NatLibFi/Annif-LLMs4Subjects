Ensuring control accuracy
This monograph presents original methods of analysis and synthesis for a wide class of control systems with required accuracy. The direct interaction between those methods and classical frequency domain methods is demonstrated as well as its importance for the investigation of automatic control systems quality. This clearly and thoughtful written book is aimed at control engineers, practitioners such as system designers or designers of automatic control devices, as well as researchers in control theory. Ensuring Control Accuracy is also a useful textbook for graduate students, carefully simplifying the understanding of the field including instructive questions at the end of each chapter.
