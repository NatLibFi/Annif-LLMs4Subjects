Noise theory and application to physics : from fluctuations to information
This is a unique approach to noise theory and its application to physical measurements that will find its place among the graduate course books. In a very systematic way, the foundations are laid and applied in a way that the book will also be useful to those not focusing on optics. Exercises and solutions help students to deepen their knowledge TOC:Introduction - Fluctuations and Covariance - Limit Theorem and Fluctuations - Information and Fluctuations - Thermodynamic Fluctuations - Classical Statistics Estimation - Estimation Examples in Physics - Bibliography - Index
