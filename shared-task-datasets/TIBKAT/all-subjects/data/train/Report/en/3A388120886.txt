Solid state theory : an introduction
"Solid-State Theory - An Introduction" is a textbook for graduate students of physics and material sciences. Whilst covering the traditional topics of older textbooks, it also takes up new developments in theoretical concepts and materials that are connected with suchbreakthroughs as the quantum-Hall effects, the high-Tc superconductors, and the low-dimensional systems realized in solids. Thus besides providing the fundamental concepts to describe the physics of the electrons and ions comprising the solid, including their interactions, the book casts a bridge to the experimental facts and gives the reader an excellent insight into current research fields. A compilation of problems and solutions make the book especially valuable to both students and teachers. TOC:Introduction.- The Solid as a Many-Particle Problem.- Lattice Dynamics: Phonons.- The Free Electron Gas.- Electrons in a Periodic Potential.- Spin Waves: Magnons.- Correlated Electrons.- Electron-Phonon Interaction.- Defects, Disorder and Localization.- Appendices.- Solutions to Problems
