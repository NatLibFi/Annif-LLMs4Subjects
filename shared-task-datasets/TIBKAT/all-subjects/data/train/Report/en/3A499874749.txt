A team of Microsoft insiders shows programmers how to use Visual Studio 2005 Team System, the suite of products that can be used for software modeling, design, testing, and deployment. The book focuses on practical application of the tools on code samples, development scenarios, and automation scripting. It serves as both as a step-by-step guide and as a reference for modeling, designing, and coordinating enterprise solutions at every level using Team System. The book begins with an overview of Team System and then offers nuts-and-bolts guidance on practical implementation. Code examples are provided in both VB.NET and C/C++
