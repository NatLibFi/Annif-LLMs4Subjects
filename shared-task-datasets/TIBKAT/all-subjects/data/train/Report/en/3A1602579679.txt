The price of liberty : personality and politics in colonial Nigeria
Klappentext: This is an account of de-colonisation in Nigeria as seen through the eyes of a Nigerian political leader who was closely involved in the process. This book is therefore partly a biography of a man, Adegoke Adelabu; much more though, it tells in a highly personal and intriguing way how a Nigerian politician operated in the last years of colonial rule.
