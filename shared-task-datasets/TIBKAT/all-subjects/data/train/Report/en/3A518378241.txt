Peacemakers in action : profiles of religion in conflict resolution
Across the globe, there are more than 50 armed conflicts, many of which are being perpetrated in the name of religion. In these zones of violence, there are brave men and women who, motivated by their religious beliefs, are working to create and sustain peace and reconciliation. Yet their stories are unknown. This book explores the conflicts and the stories of 15 remarkable individuals identified and studied by the Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding from regions as far-flung as West Papua, Indonesia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Nigeria, El Salvador and South Africa. The book also captures important lessons learned when these peacemakers convened in Amman, Jordan for the 2004 Peacemakers in Action Retreat and discussed their best techniques and greatest obstacles in creating peace on the ground. Peacemakers in Action provides guidance to students of religion and future peacemakers.
