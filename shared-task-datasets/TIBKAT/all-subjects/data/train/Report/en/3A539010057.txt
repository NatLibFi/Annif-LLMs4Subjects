Thermodynamics and fluctuations far from equilibrium
This work deals with the formulation of the thermodynamics of chemical and other systems far from equilibrium, including connections to fluctuations. It contains applications to non-equilibrium stationary states and approaches to such states, systems with multiple stationary states, reaction diffusion systems, and more.--
