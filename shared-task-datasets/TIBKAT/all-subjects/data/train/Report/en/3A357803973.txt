Automatic sequences : theory, applications, generalizations
"The authors develop the theory of automatic sequences and their generalizations, such as Sturmian words and [kappa]-regular sequences. Further, they discuss applications to number theory (particularly formal power series and transcendence in finite characteristic), physics, computer graphics, and music." "Results are presented from first principles wherever feasible, and the book is supplemented by a collection of 460 exercises, 85 open problems, and more than 1600 citations to the literature. Thus, this book is suitable for graduate students or advanced undergraduates, as well as for mature researchers wishing to know more about this subject."--BOOK JACKET
