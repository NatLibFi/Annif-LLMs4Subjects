Capacitated network design using general flow-cutset inequalities
This paper deals with directed, bidirected, and undirected capacitated network design problems. Using mixed integer rounding (MIR), we generalize flow-cutset inequalities to these three link types and to an arbitrary modular link capacity structure, and propose a generic separation algorithm. In an extensive computational study on 54 instances from the Survivable Network Design Library (SNDlib), we show that the performance of cplex can significantly be enhanced by this class of cutting planes. The computations reveal the particular importance of the subclass of cutset-inequalities.
