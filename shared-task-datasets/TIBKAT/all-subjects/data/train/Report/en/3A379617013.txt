TTF chemistry : fundamentals and applications of tetrathiafulvalene ; with 47 tables
The interest in tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) chemistry has grown tremendously since the first successful synthesis of TTF in 1970. This is because TTFs serve as potent electron donors to obtain organic metals and organic superconductors. They continue to show great promise of development in molecular, supramolecular and materials chemistry in the future. This is the first book covering almost all the TTFs and related analogues so far synthesized by researchers worldwide. The volume comprises 17 chapters, each with the synthetic methods, structural characteristics, physical properties and applications of various TTFs. TOC:1. Synthetic Approaches to Unsymmetrical, Dimeric and Oligomeric TTFs 2. Tetrachalcogenafulvalenes with Four Additional Heteroatoms 3. Halogenated TTFs 4. Oxygen Analogues of TTFs 5. Selenium Analogues of TTFs 6. TTFs with Organic Stable Radicals 7. TTFs as Ligands of Metal Complexes 8. Bi- and Bis-TTFs 9. Cyclophane-type TTFs and TSFs 10. Bis-fused TTFs - Tetrathiapentalene Donors 11. Dihydro- TTFs and Bis-fused 1,3-Dithiol-2-ylidene Donors 12. Bis(1,3- dithiol-2-ylidene) Donors with Conjugated Spacer Groups 13. Bis(1,3-dithiol-2-ylidene)Donors with a Heteroquinonoid-Spacer Group 14. Donor Systems with Multi-1,3-dithiol-2-ylidene Units 15. Macrocyclic, Molecular and Supramolecular TTF Systems 16. TTF- Acceptor Type Molecules 17. TTF Polymers and Dendritic TTFs
