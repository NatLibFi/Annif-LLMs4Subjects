Credit: Some Macroeconomic, Market and Consumer Implications
Financial consumers are facing paradoxical situations. On the one hand, they are overly solicited to use credits on various forms. On the other hand, segments of the population do not have access to credit. In this paper, we examine some emerging issues regarding consumer protection and information in four OECD countries: Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. These four countries have much in common but nevertheless develop their own specific experience. By comparing their recent experience we identify some questions of emerging importance.
