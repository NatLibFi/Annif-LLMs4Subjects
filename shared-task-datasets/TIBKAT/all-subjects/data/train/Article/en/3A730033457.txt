This paper reviews the content of bilateral investment treaties listed in Annex 6 of the CEFTA 2006 with a view to identifying commonalities and potential gaps. The paper examines provisions on admission and treatment (i.e., national treatment and mostfavoured nation); transfers, expropriation, and dispute settlement (i.e., state-to-state and investor-to-state).
