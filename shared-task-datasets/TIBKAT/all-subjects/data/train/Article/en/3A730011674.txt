Improving Competition in Real Estate Transactions
The OECD Competition Committee debated improving competition in real estate transactions in February 2007. Real estate transactions are subject to a variety of potential limitation of competition that can have significant effects on ordinary consumers. In fact, because of the annual volume of transactions and the fact that real estate expenses (mortgage payments and rent) constitute a significant portion of spending out of available revenue to spend (often exceeding 25%), the impacts of anti-competitive action i this sector may have larger financial value than in most other sectors. Practices of real estate agents vary significantly across countries, but a common trend appears to be the introduction of listing services that may provide a platform for anti-competitive practices to spread, at the same time as the Internet potentially provides improved opportunities for real estate sellers to reach buyers directly. In many countries, the operation of transferring legal title to properties is subject to cartel-like prices. Competitive problems have also been identified in the mortgage markets, with cartel activity having been found in a least one case and a lack of non-bank sources of finance in some countries.
