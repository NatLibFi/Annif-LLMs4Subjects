Adapted Process Model for Manufacturing Within Production Networks
The paper concentrates on the external elimination of bottlenecks by using congruent shared capacities within a non-hierarchical organized network. The study assumes that the capacity of assembly can be adapted by increasing the resources of the company. Conversely, the capacity of production is restricted by technological requirements and regulated by machine resources.To relieve capacity by external measures within a non-hierarchical organized network, an adapted process model is required. For this purpose, critical issues for the process flow within a network are identified and necessary regulations suggested.The paper presents the possibility of integrating the adapted approach into the operations management process as well as into systems of production planning and control and deduces the necessary information that is required to ensure the economic viability of bottleneck removal.
