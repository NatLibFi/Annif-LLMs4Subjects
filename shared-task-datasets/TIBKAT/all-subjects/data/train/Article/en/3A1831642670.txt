Chapter 19 An updated review of industrial organization: Applications of experimental methods
Real markets are easy to create. The difficult part is creating a market that demonstrates a point that remains valid upon replication in other subject pools and by other experimenters. Because market behavior is sensitive to both individual preferences and to the details of the structure of the institutional arrangements, the experimenter must avoid contaminating these variables with poorly developed experimental procedures. If the experimental procedures do not control these variables adequately, attempts to replicate the results may fail, because the experimenter has unknowingly failed to conduct the same experiment. The laboratory experiments in economics have been motivated by the theories of industrial organization. The chapter reviews the question regarding the relevance of laboratory methods. Several common criticisms of experimental methods are outlined in the chapter. The recent explosion of professional interest in experimental methods reflects, in part, recognition that experimental methods provide a source of shared experience for scholars who are developing and evaluating theories about complicated, naturally occurring processes. While laboratory processes are simple in comparison to naturally occurring processes, they are real processes in the sense that real people participate for real and substantial profits and follow real rules in doing so.
