OECD Statistical Yearbook on African Central Government Debt : Summary and Overview
The borrowing requirements of African governments in financing their budget deficits are increasingly met by selling marketable instruments but also by the issuance of non-marketable debt in the form of bi-lateral, multilateral and concessional loans. The second edition of the OECD Statistical Yearbook on African Central Government Debt provides comprehensive quantitative information on African central government debt instruments, including both marketable and non-marketable debt. Individual country data are presented in a comprehensive standard framework to facilitate cross-country comparison.
