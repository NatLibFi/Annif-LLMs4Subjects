Chapter 11. Cultural Innovation by Cultural Organizations
This chapter assesses the theories and related empirical evidence regarding the factors that explain cultural innovation by cultural organizations. It begins by defining key concepts, including what is meant by a cultural organization, cultural innovation, and the innovation referent. The chapter identifies two main disciplines that have been interested in cultural innovation or innovative programming by cultural organizations: sociology and economics. The focus, contributions, and overlap of these two disciplinary approaches to cultural innovation are discussed, and the chapter concludes by identifying some gaps and putting forward some suggestions for future research.
