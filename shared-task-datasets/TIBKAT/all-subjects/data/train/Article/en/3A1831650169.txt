Chapter 4. MAMS A Computable General Equilibrium Model for Developing Country Strategy Analysis
This chapter presents MAMS (Maquette for MDG Simulations), a recursive-dynamic CGE model developed at the World Bank for analysis of medium- to long-run country strategies for low- and middle-income countries, including strategies aimed at improving MDG (Millennium Development Goals) outcomes. Compared to other CGE models, MAMS offers a unique combination of new and policy-relevant features, most importantly disaggregation of the government services by function, broad and integrated coverage of MDGs and endogenous links between education and the labor market. The chapter provides a detailed description of MAMS, the policy insights that it has generated, exemplified by a case study of Yemen and the lessons learned from developing and applying MAMS to a large number of countries.
