Chapter 26. The Labor Market in Computable General Equilibrium Models
This chapter reviews options of labor market modeling in a computable general equilibrium framework. On the labor supply side, two principal modeling options are distinguished and discussed: aggregated, representative households and microsimulation based on individual household data. On the labor demand side, we focus on the substitution possibilities between different types of labor in production. With respect to labor market coordination, we discuss several wage-forming mechanisms and involuntary unemployment.
