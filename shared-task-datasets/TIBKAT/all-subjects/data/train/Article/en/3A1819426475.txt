Bourdieu on Religion: Imposing Faith and Legitimacy
Until recently Pierre Bourdieu has been known in the United States as a sociologist of culture, education, stratification, and social theoryâ€”not a sociologist of religion. But, as Erwan Dianteil and others have pointed out, Bourdieu drew extensively on the sociological classics of religion (particularly Weber, Durkheim, and Mauss) to develop his sociological framework. Though Bourdieu himself devoted little of his tremendous sociological output to religion, Terry Rey, in this important book on Bourdieu and religion, shows not only how Bourdieu drew on the classics to frame his sociology, including his thinking about religion, but also the growing influence of Bourdieu's work on the contemporary sociology of religion.
