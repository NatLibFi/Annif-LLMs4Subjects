Chapter 7. Educational Vouchers in International Contexts
International evidence on school choice largely focuses on educational voucher or voucher-like systems. The research to date primarily focuses on two complementary questions: what are the effects of school choice on students who exercise school choice? and what are the effects of school choice on the overall system that allows choice? In this chapter, we review the educational voucher focusing on these two research questions. We primarily focus on educational voucher programs in Chile, Colombia, and Sweden. We discuss each of these programs and the accompanying literature in depth. We briefly discuss research from other countries, especially ongoing research in India, which may provide key insights into voucher and school-choice debates. Although there are a number of similarities between research on school choice in the United States and abroad, research on school choice abroad presents an entirely different set of political circumstances, institutions, and funding schemes. We discuss these issues and their impact on generalizeability of international research. We also recommend future directions for voucher research, particularly, in identifying key components of voucher systems that have led to the observed effects to date.
