National Implementation and Enforcement of Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaties
The act of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone (NWFZ) by a state is a sovereign right protected by Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations and Article VII of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). It is a step towards nuclear disarmament by restricting the areas on earth and in space where such weapons may be freely produced, moved, tested, stationed and used. It is a measure of national security for states that wish to distance their territory and their populations completely from the nuclear arms race, its implications and its effects on development, health and international relations. When the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (Treaty of Pelindaba) enters into force, probably this year, over half of the earthâ€™s land mass and 119 countries will be protected in such zones.
