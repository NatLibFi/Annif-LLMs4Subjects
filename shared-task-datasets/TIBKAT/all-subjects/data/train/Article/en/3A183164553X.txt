Chapter 3 Public sector pricing
This chapter discusses public sector pricing. Prices are an excellent instrument for coordinating supply and demand, provided people who do not pay can be excluded from consumption. Hence, prices are used not only by private entrepreneurs, but also by politicians, bureaucrats, and public utility managers. Public prices can be found in almost every economic activity. However, looking across countries, there are particular areas where public pricing is more likely to be found than in others. These areas are closely associated with supplying essential goods and services, either to industries or directly to consumers. Essential means that they cannot be cut off without danger of total or partial collapse of an economy. Essential goods and services are almost the same in all industrialized countries. Hence, it is possible to present a fairly general basic catalogue of candidates for public pricing. How many of these candidates are priced publicly in any one country, depends on the prevailing degree of confidence in the efficiency of the private sector, which differs from country to country.
