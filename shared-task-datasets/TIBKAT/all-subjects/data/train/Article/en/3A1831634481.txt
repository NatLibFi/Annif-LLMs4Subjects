Chapter 4 Immigrants and Their Schooling
This chapter deals with several salient issues about immigrants to the US and their education. These issues include a comparison of the schooling accomplishments of immigrants compared to the native-born both contemporaneously as well as over time. These comparisons emphasize the considerable diversity in the schooling accomplishments among different immigrant sub-groups and between legal and undocumented migrants. Finally, the recent literature suggests than any concern that educational generational progress among Latino immigrants has lagged behind other immigrant groups is largely unfounded.
