Chapter 23 Optimal policies for natural monopolies
This chapter examines some of the optimal policies that are used to control a natural monopoly.

The chapter provides an overview of possible competitive approaches to the natural monopoly problem. It discusses some of the major concepts in optimal pricing in regulated industries. These include peak load pricing, Ramsey pricing, and nonlinear outlay schedules. The chapter reviews a set of issues related to the fairness of regulated prices is discussed in the context of cross-subsidy or interservice subsidy.
