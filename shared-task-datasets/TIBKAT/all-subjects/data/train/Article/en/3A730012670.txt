Review of Competition Law and Policy in the Czech Republic
The Czech Republic competition law is based on familiar European substantive concepts. Features that were appropriate for a transition setting are being revised in anticipation of EU accession. The enforcement body was at one time a separate Ministry; now, the Czech Office for the Protection of Economic Competition is an independent agency. Provisions for exemption are well controlled, and the processes for applying it are working well; however, stronger enforcement powers may be needed to deal with secret cartels. The major challenge of improving competitiveness by completing the reform of the inherited industrial structure requires solving problems of corporate governance and financing. The role of competition policy in that task will be modest.
