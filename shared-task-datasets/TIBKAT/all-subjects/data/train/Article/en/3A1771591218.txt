Modeling, design and prototyping of a pantograph-based compliant mechanism
The main task of the compliant mechanism synthesis is to generate a pre-defined motion path as accurately as possible. A general approach to the compliant mechanism synthesis is to develop a compliant mechanism based on the rigid-body model by replacing conventional joints with compliant joints, i.e. flexure hinges. Using the example of a mechanism producing a scissors-like motion, in this paper a more specific and iterative synthesis process is implemented for the design of a compliant path-generating mechanism. Based on two symmetric pantograph mechanisms, a kinematic analysis of the multi-link rigid-body model is performed. The final dimensions and link lengths of the rigid-body model are used to implement a compliant mechanism with different flexure hinges. Therefore, several designs are iteratively investigated by means of FEM simulations in order to improve the path accuracy and the opening angle of the scissors-like motion.
