Chapter 12 The Walrasian Auction
This chapter examines the robustness of his results in a more general multi-unit per subject setting and systematically investigates the effect of various order flow information and message restriction rules on the performance of the Walrasian auction. This experimental environment allows us to assess the performance of the Walrasian auction where participants have multiple units and where relative competitiveness is variable period to period. This chapter also presents Walrasian auction design and computerized implementation. The chapter presents the mean efficiency and competitive price deviation in the later periods of the experiments. There is no significant difference in efficiency and price between the oral and computerized treatments. The chapter show that the supply and demand match is not correct, and suggests the presence of significant underrevelation on both sides of the market: if either side underreveals to gain an advantage, the other side underreveals to neutralize that advantage.
