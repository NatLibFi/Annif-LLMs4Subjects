Reflections on Growth Theory
This note contains some general and idiosyncratic reflections on the current state of neoclassical growth theory. It expresses some surprise at the lack of attention both to multi-sector growth models and to multi-country models with trade and capital flows. It also suggests that there might be value in further analysis of some old topics like capitalâ€“labor substitution with an expanded definition of capital, and the interaction of growth and medium-run phenomena (or, to put it differently, the interaction of demand-side and supply-side variations).
