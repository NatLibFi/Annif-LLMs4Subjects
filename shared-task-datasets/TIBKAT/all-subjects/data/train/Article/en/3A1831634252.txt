Specifically the literature on the determinants of teacher recruitment, turnover, mobility and re-entry into the profession are reviewed. It reviews the empirical evidence from the US, the UK on the labor supply of teachers and assesses the variation in teacher's real pay across in aggregate across 35 countries in the world. It also provides suggests for fruitful areas of future research.
