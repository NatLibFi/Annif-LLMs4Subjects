Chapter 10 Defense expenditure and economic growth
This chapter reviews the empirical research on the relation between defense spending and economic growth. A broad flavor of the approaches adopted by different scholars is provided through a list of selected studies on the topic since 1973 and an outline of the variations over Benoit's original work that have been explored in the literature. A discussion of three major methodological issues is then undertaken. The following section summarizes the main substantive results reported in various studies, and another section contains some thoughts on the future research on the subject. The chapter ends with a few concluding and summarizing observations.
