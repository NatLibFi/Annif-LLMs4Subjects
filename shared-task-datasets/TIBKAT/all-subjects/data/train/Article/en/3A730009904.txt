Regulatory reform in road freight
This study analyses regulatory developments across OECD Member countries in the road freight industry, with a focus on how these developments have affected competition and performance. Over the past two decades, a growing number of OECD countries have recognised that regulations unduly restricting competitive developments in this industry needed to be relaxed. Still, the pace and scale of liberalisation has varied widely from one country to another. The main remaining impediment to competition is the restrictive web of bilateral international and/or multilateral agreements that continue to impose discrimination on foreign hauliers. The empirical evidence available suggests that liberalisation has promoted efficiency and consumer welfare in the countries that have implemented reforms.
