Chapter 26 Moral hazard
This chapter discusses moral hazard. The principalagent relationship embodies a special form of moral hazard, which can be called one-sided, but moral hazard can also be many-sided. The paradigmatic model of many-sided moral hazard is the partnership in which there are many agents but no principal. The output of the partnership depends jointly on the actions of the partners and on the stochastic environment; each partner observes only the output (and his or her own action) but not the actions of the other partners or the environment. This engenders a free-rider problem. As in the case of principalagent relationships, a partnership, too, may last many periods. The chapter presents the principalagent model formally and describes some salient features of optimal principalagent contracts when the relationship lasts a single period. In a large class of cases, equilibrium in the one-period game is Pareto-inefficient. This is a well-known problem in providing risk-averse agent insurance while simultaneously giving the agent the incentives to take, from the principal's perspective, appropriate actions. The chapter also discusses other properties of static contracts such as monotonicity of the agent's compensation in observed profits.
