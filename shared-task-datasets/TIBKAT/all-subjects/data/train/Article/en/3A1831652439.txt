Chapter 19. Econometric Methods for the Analysis of Assignment Problems in the Presence of Complementarity and Social Spillovers
Concern over the distributional effects of policies which induce changes in peer group structure, or associational redistributions (Durlauf, 1996c), motivates a substantial body of theoretical and empirical research in economics, sociology, psychology, and education. A growing collection of econometric methods for characterizing the effects of such policies are now available. This chapter surveys these methods. I discuss the identification and estimation of the distributional effects of partner reassignment in one-on-one matching models, the average outcome and inequality effects of segregation, and treatment response in the presence of spillovers.
