This is the long overdue second volume of the handbook, which also consists of four parts. In Part V ( Foundations ), some very basic issues in welfare economics and social choice theory are discussed. The topics covered include the initial insights behind and the basic functions of social choice theory, the informational basis of normative and positive social choice theory, the status of competitive market mechanisms as social choice procedures, and the main ingredients of nonwelfaristic approaches in welfare economics and social choice theory along the line of the theory of functioning and capabilities.
