Chapter 35 International trade and business cycles
This chapter discusses the salient features of international trade and business cycles and summarizes the contributions of a particular branch of the literature on open economy macroeconomics. Becasue many macroeconomic time series are nonstationary, the computation of moments requires that the data be transformed to remove the nonstationarity. A commonly used transformation is the linear filter advocated by Hodrick and Prescott. The important properties of this filter are the following: (1) the filter will render stationary any time series that is integrated of order four or less and (2) when applied to quarterly data, the filter acts as a reasonable approximation to a high-pass filter that passes the cycles of frequency eight years or less with the customary value of 1600 for the smoothing parameter. Recently, Baxter and King (1994) proposed a method for measuring business cycle components of models and data through the application of an approximate band-pass filter. The chapter also analyzes the effects of shocks to government spending and tax rates and reviews the literature on multi-good models of international business cycle.
