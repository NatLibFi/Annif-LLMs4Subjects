Chapter Seven. Theoretical Issues Relevant to the Economic Evaluation of Health Technologies
Medical cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is perhaps the most widely applied tool to guide policy decisions concerning the use of health care resources. This chapter first reviews the rationale for and common practice of medical cost-effectiveness analysis. It seeks to place CEA within a conventional microeconomic framework. Methodological controversies in CEA are then discussed within this framework. They include: the decision-making perspective of the analysis; incorporating equity concerns; the treatment of joint costs and benefits; and the treatment of time horizon and discounting.
