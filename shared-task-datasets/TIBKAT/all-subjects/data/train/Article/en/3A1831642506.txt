Chapter 6 Money, inflation and growth
Different long-run rates of growth of money supply are eventually reflected in different rates of inflation. Tobin studied this in a simple descriptive model with aggregate saving depending only on current income. It was found that money growth was associated with higher capital stock and output per person in the steady state. Faster inflation led savers to shift their portfolios in favor of real capital. The chapter examines Sidrauski model illustrating the central neutrality result and presents some of its variations in which neutrality with respect to output fails even though the real interest rate is not affected by inflation. It examines the Fisher relation and focuses on deviations from the one infinitely lived family models. The exact function of money and the sensitivity of the long-run inflationgrowth relation to different assumptions about the reasons why money is held are also examined.
