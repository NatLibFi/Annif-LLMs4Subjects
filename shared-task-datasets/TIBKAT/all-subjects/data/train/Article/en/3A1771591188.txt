Conceptual design of a microscale balance based on force compensation
Macroscopic electromagnetic force compensation (EMFC) balances are well established but were not yet demonstrated within microsystems. Hence, in this paper, the concept and the design of a micro fabricated force compensation balance is presented. The implemented concentrated compliance mechanism in form of flexure hinges enables motion with high precision, which is combined with a force compensation mechanism. The concept of force compensation promises a high measurement range, which is expected to be up to 0.5 mN, while still enabling a high resolution of less than 8 nN. The developed dynamic model of the miniaturized balance is used for the design of a PID-controller strategy. Here, continuous and time-discrete controller approaches are compared. The time-discrete controller with realistic delay times, leads to an accuracy of the controller, which is better than the expected accuracy of the integrated capacitive position sensor.
