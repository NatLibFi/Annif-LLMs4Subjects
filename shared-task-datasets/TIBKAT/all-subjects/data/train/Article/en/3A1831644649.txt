Chapter 18 The analysis of union behavior
There is a substantial body of economic research, largely theoretical but with a recent empirical component, on the analysis of union behavior. This chapter reviews this literature selectively to place it in perspective so that analysts may begin to answer questions raised by the descriptive research on labor unions and to understand the role that unions play in the economy. It focuses on fitting the existing work into a coherent conceptual framework and on suggesting some directions for further research. The chapter presents a working definition of a labor union and describes the economic modus operandi of labor unions in the American economy. A number of examples of unions in various industries within the United States are presented in the chapter to highlight the role that market and legal/political constraints play in determining the environment within which unions operate.
