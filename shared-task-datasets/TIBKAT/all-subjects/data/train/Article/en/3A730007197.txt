Competition Law and Policy in South East Europe
Competition policy is a strong building block foundation of market economies. Development of competition policies in South East Europe (“SEE”) aims at creating a level playing field for investment, which is of major importance for the economic progress of the countries in the region. In 2001, a comprehensive programme for building capacities of SEE competition authorities was launched as a contribution to stability, sustainable growth and welfare in the region. Funded by the South East Europe Compact for Reform, Investment, Integrity and Growth, it was organised by the OECD Competition Division in partnership with the competition authorities of Bulgaria, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Slovenia. The long-term objectives of the programme were to strengthen national competition authorities of the region as law enforcers and advocates for economic reform based on competition principles. A major objective was also to support the establishment of intra-regional co-operation in the competition policy area. This concluding report draws on the experiences and the documentation produced by the representatives of SEE competition authorities, and provides an overview of the competition regimes in the SEE countries.
