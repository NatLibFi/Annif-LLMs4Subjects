Chapter 38 International trade policy and negotiations
Trade policy has been one of the most important issues in agricultural economics for more than 200 years. Our focus here is on evaluating relatively recent contributions to the understanding of agricultural trade policy and trade agreements. We present some background concerning trade policies and agreements and then consider the economic analysis of these agreements and policies. We concentrate on recent trade agreements, especially the Uruguay Round Agreement of 1994, and on recent analyses of this agreement and other trade policies in agriculture. We conclude by discussing current issues facing trade negotiations.
