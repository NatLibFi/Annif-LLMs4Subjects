Introduction
Social choice theory is concerned with the evaluation of alternative methods of collective decision-making, as well as with the logical foundations of welfare economics. In turn, welfare economics is concerned with the critical scrutiny of the performance of actual and/or imaginary economic systems, as well as with the critique, design, and implementation of alternative economic policies. This being the case, the origin of social choice theory can be traced back all the way to antiquity. Indeed, as soon as multiple individuals are involved in making decisions for their common cause, one or other method of collective decision-making cannot but be invoked. As a reflection of this obvious fact, there are numerous examples in classic writings on the use and usefulness of alternative methods of collective decision-making. Without denying the importance of those pioneering contributions made by many precursors, it seems fair to say that Kenneth Arrow's Social Choice and Individual Values elevated social choice theory to a stage which is qualitatively different altogether.
