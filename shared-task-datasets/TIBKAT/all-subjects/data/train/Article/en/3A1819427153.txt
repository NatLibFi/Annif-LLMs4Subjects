To Change the World: The Irony, Tragedy, and Possibility of Christianity in the Late Modern World
The structure of this book is quite simple. Hunter creates a three-part typology of ways in which Christians have attempted to change the world; he then systematically argues for the inadequacy of each strategy; and, finally, he proposes a fourth alternative that he says fits his theory of power and cultural change. To give away the ending of this review, I found his three-fold typology to be useful at a descriptive level, but I was dissatisfied with the solution that he proposes., The first type he labels “defensive against” and includes fundamentalists, many mainstream evangelicals, and some conservative Catholics. They have a mythical ideal of a rightly ordered society and believe that American culture is morally bankrupt, moving toward disorder.
