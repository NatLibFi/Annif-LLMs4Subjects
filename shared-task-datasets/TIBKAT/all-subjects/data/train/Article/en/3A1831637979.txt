Chapter 42 Policy-related developments in agricultural economics: Synthesis of handbook volume 2
Extension of factual and analytical work to policy issues has been a feature of agricultural economics from its beginnings, but only in recent decades have these efforts become part of the scientific core of what agricultural economists do. At the same time, the range of policy analysis has expanded to cover environmental economics, issues in rural economic development, and the range of market imperfections and economic analysis of politics. This chapter reviews the accomplishments and remaining tasks to be undertaken, as discussed in Volume 2 of this Handbook .
