Introduction to the series
This chapter provides an introduction to Handbook of Defense Economics. This publication provides self-contained surveys of the current state of a branch of economics in the form of chapters prepared by leading specialists on various aspects of this branch of economics. These surveys summarize not only received results but also newer developments, from recent journal articles and discussion papers. Some original material is also included, but the main goal is to provide comprehensive and accessible surveys. The Handbook is intended to provide not only useful reference volumes for professional collections but also possible supplementary readings for advanced courses for graduate students in economics.
