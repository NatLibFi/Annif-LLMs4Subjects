The continuing role of item-specific agreements in the IAEA safeguards system
The International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) “safeguards system” serves as the foundation of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime, under which the IAEA acts as an auditor, monitor and inspector of state-administered nuclear energy programmes. The system consists of agreements and practices that enable the IAEA to gain a clear picture of a state’s nuclear activities in order to provide credible assurances that nuclear energy is used for exclusively peaceful purposes.
