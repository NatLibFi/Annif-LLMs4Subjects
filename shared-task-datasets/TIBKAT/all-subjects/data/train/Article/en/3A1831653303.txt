Chapter 2. Technology Diffusion: Measurement, Causes, and Consequences
This chapter discusses different approaches pursued to explore three broad questions related to technology diffusion: what general patterns characterize the diffusion of technologies, and how have they changed over time?; what are the key drivers of technology?; and what are the macroeconomic consequences of technology? We prioritize in our discussion unified approaches to these three questions that are based on direct measures of technology.
