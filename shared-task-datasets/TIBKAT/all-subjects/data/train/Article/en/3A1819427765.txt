The Missing Martyrs: Why There Are So Few Muslim Terrorists
Rarely does a topic of controversial concern such as “Muslim terrorism” receive the attention of a seasoned specialist with decades of expertise. Such is the greatest strength of Charles Kurzman's latest monograph, The Missing Martyrs. Here, Kurzman interrogates common presumptions that permeate both academic and popular conceptions about Muslim terrorists and their relationship to the Islamic tradition. With a balanced and accessible tone, he polemically—yet empirically—answers a widely held false presumption best, captured in the question “[I]f there are more than a billion Muslims in the world, many of whom supposedly hate the West and desire martyrdom, why don't we see terrorist attacks everywhere, every day?” (7).
