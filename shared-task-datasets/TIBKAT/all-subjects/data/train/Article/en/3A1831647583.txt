Chapter 33 Empirical research on nominal exchange rates
This chapter presents a critical survey and an interpretation of recent exchange rate research. It focuses on empirical results for exchange rates among major industrialized countries. The expectations of future exchange rate changes are a key determinant of asset demands, and therefore of the current exchange rate. The expectations variable is relatively straightforward in the conventional monetary models; in theoretical terms , it is determined by the rational expectations assumption, while in empirical terms, it is typically measured by the forward discount or interest differential. The standard empirical implementation of rational expectations methodology infers ex ante expectations of investors from ex post changes in the exchange rate. Unexpected changes in monetary policy frequently cause movements in the exchange rate in the direction hypothesized by the sticky-price monetary model. The chapter presents a survey of the work on exchange rate determination in floating rate regimes. It considers evidence across exchange rate regimes and examines the issue of speculative bubbles. It also reviews some relatively new directions in exchange rate research that focus on the micro-structure of foreign exchange markets.
