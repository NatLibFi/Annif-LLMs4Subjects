Nuclear Renaissance in Italy : Maintaining Momentum
Following the adoption of Law No. 99 of 23 July 2009, Italy is on the threshold of returning to nuclear power, even though there are many more challenges yet to overcome. It should be recalled that Law No. 99/2009 includes enabling provisions empowering the Government to issue one or more implementing decrees providing rules for the siting of new nuclear power plants, the licensing process for the construction, operation and dismantling of those plants, as well as rules for interim storage and the final disposal of nuclear waste. On 15 February 2010, upon the proposal of the Ministry of Economic Development, the Italian Council of Ministers issued Legislative Decree No. 31/20102 (hereinafter “decree”) implementing the enabling provisions.
