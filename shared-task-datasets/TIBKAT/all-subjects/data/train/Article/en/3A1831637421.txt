Chapter 8 Regional, interregional and multiregional input-output analysis
This chapter focuses on regional, interregional, and multiregional input-output analysis. Unlike many other branches of regional economics and regional science, the development of regional and interregional models occurred almost contemporaneously with the growth of interest in national-level inputoutput modeling. In the book, Studies in the structure of the American economy , there is a discussion on regional models, specifically on the theory of interregional models and on some of the empirical and conceptual problems associated with regional analysis. These developments are discussed in more detail in the chapter. It presents some linkages of inputoutput analysis with other standard modeling techniques, further reinforcing the notion that the inputoutput framework has a considerable degree of flexibility in its contribution to an understanding of the structure of an economy. The chapter explores in detail the inputoutput model and its characteristics and provides several extensions of inputoutput analysis.
