Chapter 29. Intergenerational Mobility in the Labor Market
This chapter summarizes what has been learned from recent research on intergenerational transmission of earnings status. The chapter begins by using a simple theoretical model to highlight several key concepts. Then it reviews (and discusses the connections among) three related empirical literatures: on sibling correlations in earnings, on the intergenerational elasticity of offspring’s earnings with respect to parents’ earnings or income, and on neighborhood effects. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.
