Chapter 11 Mortality and morbidity among adults and the elderly
This chapter discusses the questions to be asked of the compiled mortality and morbidity data, paying particular attention to those data sources that are readily available and to those methods that have proven or may prove themselves particularly fruitful. Differential rates of infant mortality among countries may also explain differential mortality and morbidity for adults and the elderly among countries. The chapter indicates that demographic, epidemiologic, biological, and socio-economic paradigms must take in order for the study of mortality and morbidity of adults and the elderly to bear fruitful results. Central to the study of such a complex issue is the availability of data monitoring systems that provide accurate information on disease etiology and specific causes-of-death and the plethora of economic, biological, lifestyle and behavioral, and other risk factors, whose relevance to mortality and morbidity outcomes are discussed in the chapter.
