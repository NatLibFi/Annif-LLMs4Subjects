Chapter 23. Regional Studies : Latin America and the Caribbean
This chapter offers an overview of migration and remittance flows with respect to the Latin American and Caribbean region from the colonial period to the present. Themes that cross history are highlighted as are the reversals of trends. Emphasis is given to southâ€“south migration, to the factors that have motivated the out-migration of Latin Americans to the United States and Europe, and to the different attitudes concerning migratory movements that have been expressed by governments in both source and receiving nations.
