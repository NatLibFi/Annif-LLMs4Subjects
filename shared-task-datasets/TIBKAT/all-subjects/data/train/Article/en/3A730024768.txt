Review of Competition Law and Policy in Poland
Poland’s 1990 competition law, which supported its transition restructuring, now substantively follows the rules of the EU treaty. But enforcement still focuses on abuses by successors to pre-reform monopolies. Competition enforcement agency by the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (OCCP) is combined with consumer protection and monitoring state aids, while Antimonopoly Court integrates regulatory policies by deciding cases about infrastructure regulation. Clarifying the OCCP’s independence from the government will support the integrity of law enforcement as well as a more publicly visible advocacy role.
