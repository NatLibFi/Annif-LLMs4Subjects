The Löhrerhof in Hürth : Monumental Planning and Restoration ¤ The Löhrerhof is a rural farmstead from the 19th century in the Alt-Hürth district, which was mainly used as an art and culture center in the end.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042840-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011455-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136811-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004770-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027151-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004927-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049600-4>
Analysis of Closed-Cell Metal Foams Produced by Melting and Powder Metallurgy on Aluminum Basis ¤ Cellular materials exhibit properties due to their porous structure, which can open up new application areas. In addition to polymer and ceramic foams, metallic cellular materials, especially metal foams, are in the focus of research. Due to the cellular structure of these materials, relatively low specific densities can be achieved. As a result, metal foams are particularly suitable for lightweight applications with good energy absorption properties. The production of cellular metals is carried out in principle by a melting or powder metallurgical process. With these different procedures, it is possible to produce both closed-cell and open-cell metal foams. In practice, metal foams based on aluminum are currently mainly used in small series. - For reproducible mechanical and functional properties, a homogeneous distribution of pores is of particular importance. Open-cell metal foams have a homogeneous structure due to their production process compared to closed-cell metal foams. Through the production by powder metallurgy, a variety of parameters are obtained that affect the pore distribution during the foaming process. In addition to temperature control, alloy components and additives play a particularly important role. In particular, the structure-microstructure-property relationship of cellular materials is significant. In this contribution, the first micro- and macro-structures of closed-cell aluminum foams are analyzed and compared. To this end, additives (e.g. titanium from the propellant TiH2) are investigated for their distribution in the material. - The goal is to analyze the distribution and the dependence of alloy components with regard to the foaming process in order to enable a systematic optimization of the production process with regard to powder composition, powder sizes, compaction degree, pre-treatments, and temperature regimes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4169614-1>
Energy and Charging Management for a CO2-Neutral Loading of Battery-Electrically Operated Service Vehicles on the Airport Premises ¤ In the project: ALEC (Alternation * Light * Electric * Constructions) one of the objectives is to enable the realization of a CO2-neutral electric recharging of battery-electrically operated service vehicles on the airport premises. For the implementation of the above objective, the authors present their concept and the implementation status of the interaction between the local charging management system (LMS) and the superimposed energy management system (üEMS). The LMS takes over the function of data preparation and aggregation of various information of individual electric vehicles here. Using the aggregated information from the LMS and the expected energy supply from local, renewable sources, the üEMS determines the optimal, CO2-minimal electric recharging of the electric vehicle fleet on the airport premises. The fleet charging schedule generated in this way is finally disaggregated in the LMS and vehicle-specific charging schedules are generated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014736-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068598-6>
Optimization of a Parametric Fundamental Model for Power Plant Deployment Planning ¤ The electricity price forecast is an important input parameter for optimizing one's position on the electricity market. With its help, trading profits can be increased and risks minimized. For the forecast, various procedures are used. A modeling method are the so-called fundamental models (FM). In the present work, a new approach is proposed and investigated, which makes a contribution to the improvement of the forecast quality of data-sparse FM. This improvement concerns especially the quality of the power plant deployment to be forecasted, which represents a significant intermediate variable in the electricity price forecast with FM. The work is structured as follows: Section 1 provides a brief introduction and overview of the topic of electricity price forecasting. Section 2 explains the functional principle of an FM, before Section 3 describes the further developed model. In Section 4, the results of an exemplary investigation are presented and evaluated in Section 5.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068598-6>

Chapter 11 Qualitative Statistical Models for Regional Economic Analysis ¤ This chapter discusses qualitative statistical models for regional economic analysis. Traditionally, the statistical modeling conducted in regional economic research has focused on the analysis of high-level, metric, or quantitative data measured at the ratio or interval scales. The tradition has its roots in natural science where high-quality data can be obtained under experimental conditions. The chapter reviews the state-of-the-art in qualitative statistical modeling. It focuses on (a) basic model types and their integration; (b) alternative estimation procedures; (c) model assessment and selection procedures; and (d) extended and hybrid forms of the basic models. It also discusses a range of empirical examples to illustrate the current use of qualitative data models in regional economic analysis. These examples focus upon regional variations in the rates of industrial innovation in the United Kingdom, regional quality-of-life and residential preferences in the Netherlands, and a regional industrial accessibility survey conducted in Northern Ireland. The chapter provides a review of several topics that are of central importance to the future potential of qualitative statistical models in regional economic analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9>
Chapter 5. Forecasting and Policy Making ¤ Policymakers use forecasts to project the consequences of particular policy decisions for certain policy targets. This chapter investigates the use of economic forecasting in policy making by discussing practical examples, providing new empirical evidence and computing forecasts using different macroeconomic models. First, a theoretical framework is presented to differentiate the role of forecasts in simple feedback rules, optimal control policies, and forecast targeting. Then, we review institutional details of the forecasting process at fiscal authorities and central banks. We provide empirical evidence that central bank policy rate decisions in the United States and the Euro area are well described by interest rate rules responding to forecasts of inflation and economic activity rather than recent outcomes. Next, we provide a detailed exposition of methods for producing forecasts. We review forecasting models and provide practical applications. In particular, we illustrate how to use economic structure in interpreting forecasts and how to implement different conditioning assumptions regarding certain planned policy initiatives. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of central bank and expert forecasts and investigate the interaction between forecasting and policy making by evaluating the performance and robustness of forecast-based policy rules under model uncertainty.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1>
Chapter 9 Terrorism: Theory and applications ¤ This chapter reviews game-theoretic and choice-theoretic depictions of terrorist behavior. A simple game-theoretic framework is presented to ascertain under what circumstances a government would want to precommit itself to a no-negotiation strategy. In another game model, we analyze whether two governments (nations) that are targeted by the same terrorist group would overdeter or underdeter terrorist attacks. Moreover, we demonstrate that piecemeal policy, which allows the governments to share intelligence but not deterrence decisions, can be worse than no coordination. Choice-theoretic models identify substitution and complementarity possibilities among diverse modes of terrorist attacks as terrorists respond optimally to government actions. A host of time-series techniques are used to study the effectiveness of alternative antiterrorism policies. Vector-autoregression intervention procedures are particularly suited. Time-series analyses are also used to identify cycles, trends, and irregular components for forecasting purposes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132793-7>
The Ending of the Multi-Fibre Agreement and Innovation in the Sri Lankan Textile and Clothing Industry ¤ This case study analyses the effect that the end of the Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) has had on innovation in the Sri Lankan textile and clothing sector. The ending of the quota system under the MFA led to an increase in the US and EU markets which has motivated a large number of innovations in the Sri Lankan textile and clothing sector. Some large companies have become a total services provider, while others are trying to establish their own brands. Product innovations with foreign partners, process innovations such as introduction of CAD/CAM, and various marketing and organisational innovations have been implemented.

Chapter 100 The Endowment Effect: Evidence of Losses Valued More than Gains ¤ The early empirical evidence of a wide disparity between people's valuations of gains and losses appeared in results of contingent valuation studies in which respondents were asked both how much they would be willing to pay to prevent a loss of an environmental or other amenity, and what sum they would demand to accept its loss. The results of experiments testing people's valuations of gains and losses have been consistent in showing that individuals value losses far more than otherwise fully commensurate gains. This leads to smaller gains from trade and fewer voluntary market transactions than would be the case with valuation equivalence. The valuation disparity also suggests greater caution in assessing welfare losses, predicting market outcomes, and may well imply different policy designs.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
The contribution of information and communication technologies to economic growth in nine OECD countries ¤ This paper compares the impact of ICT capital accumulation on output growth in Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. The analysis uses a growth accounting framework and a newly compiled database of investment in ICT equipment and software based on the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA93). It is found that over the past two decades, ICT contributed between 0.2 and 0.5 percentage point per year to economic growth, depending on the country. During the second half of the 1990s, this contribution rose to 0.3 to 0.9 percentage point per year.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2>
Chapter 27 Off-floor Trading, Market Disintegration and Price Volatility in Bid/Ask Markets ¤ This study was commissioned by a futures market Exchange firm plagued by members' trading off-ﬂoor in strict violation of the Exchange's rules requiring transactions to be made on the Exchange ﬂoor during trading hours in the assigned trading areas. Any violation of these rules is a major offense, and penalties have been and are levied on violators. Although violators are often discovered and penalized, the prohibition itself assures that there exists no systematic field data from the Exchange that can help inform the circumstances that produce off-ﬂoor trading. Hence, experimental evidence is the only feasible source of relevant observations. Exchange officials conjectured that the bid/ask spread in pit trading was sufficiently wide to provide an incentive for both parties to trade inside the spread at savings to each that justified this risk. This would be especially applicable to traders who knew each other well, and each was comfortable with the trustworthiness of their trading partner.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2>
Chapter 7 Parallel computation ¤ Parallel computation represents not only a new mode of computation, but, a new intellectual paradigm. This chapter provides an overview of the technology of parallel computation in terms of hardware and programming languages; presents some of the fundamental classes of problems encountered in economics and the associated numerical methodologies for their solution; discusses the state-of-the-art computational techniques and focuses on parallel techniques and contrasts them with serial techniques for illumination and instructive purposes; and presents applications of the classes of problems and associated numerical methods to econometrics, microeconomics, macroeconomics, and finance. The emergence of computation as a basic scientific methodology in economics has given access to solutions of fundamental problems that pure analysis, observation, or experimentation could not have achieved. Parallel computation represents the wave of the future. It is considered to be cheaper and faster than serial computing and the only approach to faster computation currently foreseeable. Parallel computation is appealing, hence, for the economies of scale that are possible, for the potentially faster solution of large-scale problems, and also for the possibilities that it presents for imitating adjustment or tatonnement processes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011152-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5>
Chapter 6 Land institutions and land markets ¤ Assignment of land rights affects equity and efficiency, determining among other things households' ability to generate subsistence and income, their social and economic status, incentives to exert effort and make investments, and access to financial markets and consumption-smoothing mechanisms. The chapter discusses costs and benefits of the transition towards individualized land rights. It reviews how characteristics of the agricultural production process, credit access, portfolio risk, and transaction costs affect functioning of land sales and rental markets. Policy conclusions are drawn concerning the transition from communal to individualized land rights, award of formal titles, improved functioning of land sales and rental markets, and redistributive land reform.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2>
Chapter 3. Preferences for Status : Evidence and Economic Implications ¤ This chapter brings together some of the recent empirical and experimental evidence regarding preferences for social status. While briefly reviewing evidence from different literatures that is consistent with the existence of preferences for status, we pay special attention to experimental work that attempts to study status directly by inducing it in the lab. Finally, we discuss some economic implications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120990-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132883-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066514-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027266-7>
Chapter 10. Housing Valuations of School Performance ¤ In this Chapter, we critically review the sizable literature that values school quality and performance through housing valuations. While highly variable in terms of research quality, the literature consistently finds housing valuations to be significantly higher in places where measured school quality is higher. Thus parents are prepared to pay substantial amounts of money to get their children educated in better performing schools. This conclusion emerges from studies across many countries, using a variety of identification strategies, and at different levels of the education system.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2>
Capacity Building for Effective Competition Policy in Developing and Transitioning Economies ¤ This note begins by briefly addressing why competition policy is important for developing and transitioning economies. It then discusses some of the critical components of building a competition culture. Ideally, this process should begin by conducting a "needs assessment" in a number of areas. This assessment likely will lead to the identification of a list of steps that should be prioritised and undertaken. The priorities often can be grouped into three broad areas, namely, helping key constituencies to "buy in" to a competition culture, minimizing the extent to which a broad range of institutional mechanisms distort competition, and building an effective competition law enforcement regime to address private anticompetitive conduct. The note then summarizes the valuable perspectives of countries that have been providers or recipients of capacity building and technical assistance. It is based upon the responses to a questionnaire circulated in 2001 to delegates of the OECD’s Competition Committee and non-members who had been invited to participate in the second Global Forum on Competition, held in February 2002. This discussion is followed by a brief discussion of the potentially helpful roles that cooperation and peer review can play in the process of building the institutional capacity of a domestic enforcement authority. After briefly discussing the Doha Declaration, the note summarises the OECD’s capacity building activities in the competition field. Finally, in the conclusion, some suggestions are offered regarding a multi-faceted strategy for future capacity building and technical assistance activities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9>
Chapter 7. The Use of Stated Preference Methods to Value Cultural Heritage ¤ This chapter briefly defines cultural heritage, before considering the relative merits of stated preference methods in relation to revealed preference in deriving economic values for cultural goods. Section 7.2 outlines the distinction between contingent valuation (CV) and discrete choice experiment (CE) methods, before outlining some applications of CV methods in estimating consumer surplus and maximum revenue for cultural goods. Section 7.3 outlines choice experiments, experimental design, and the random utility theory underlying CEs. Section 7.4 presents the standard conditional logit and multinomial logit models, and discusses their use in valuing cultural heritage. The restrictive assumptions of these two models are described as a prelude to presentations of other choice experiment models that relax some or all of these assumptions. These models are: the nested logit, covariance-heterogeneity, heteroscedastic extreme value, mixed logit random parameter, error component, multinomial probit, and latent class or finite mixture models. Applications of each of these models to cultural heritage are provided. Section 7.5 considers how price and economic values are derived from utility estimates. It discusses values directly derived in willingness to pay space, and the importance of calculating market share and of identifying those who are willing to pay for an improvement to the status quo level of a cultural good. Section 7.6 explores how CE models can be extended or enhanced by the consideration of: interaction effects between the attributes of a cultural good; controlling for choice complexity; addressing non-attendance of attributes in respondent’s choices; considering the scale problem; asymmetry between willingness to pay and willingness to accept compensation for the equivalent loss of a cultural good; the issue of utility maximization or regret minimization; the importance of considering respondents’ attitudes in choice models; and models combining revealed and stated preference to include what people actually demand, as well as what they say they would demand, in evaluating preferences and values for cultural goods. The conclusion in Section 7.7 briefly summarizes the chapter and provides some thoughts for future research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4>
Chapter 5. Information Diffusion and Best Practice Adoption ¤ Incomplete information issues pervade health care markets, with market participants often having relatively little information, and their behavior exhibiting corresponding aberrations from classic market behavior. Consumers often have relatively little information about prices and quality offered in health care markets, leading to substantial dispersion in prices of apparently identical services. Equilibrium price dispersion increases as the demand elasticity for the product falls. Since health insurance lowers the elasticity of demand, price dispersions should occur more often (and with greater magnitude) in markets such as physician services with relatively complete insurance. Further, many insurance plans blunt incentives for search, compounding the problem. On the supply side, evidence shows that physicians behave as if they did not share the same information about the productivity of medical care. At the level of geographic regions, numerous studies show the rates at which various medical interventions are used on standardized populations differ hugely often by an order of magnitude or more from high to low and these differences in treatment rates do not converge through time as would occur in standard market learning models. Similarly, individual physicians within a given region also display differences in the propensity to use medical resources. Information from a major study of doctors styles shows large and statistically significant differences in doctors use of medical resources to treat their patients, even with strong measures of illness severity of the patients included in the models. Although requiring strong assumptions, one can estimate the welfare losses arising from incomplete information on the provider side of the market. Estimates of the upper bound of these welfare losses place the magnitude of loss in the same range on a per capita basis as the traditionally emphasized welfare losses associated with perverse incentives in health insurance. The importance of incomplete information leads to discussions of the economic and legal incentives for the production and dissemination of information. Legal incentives to produce such information for medical strategies (treatment protocols) are weak, particularly compared with the incentives in markets for specific products such as prescription drugs. The public good nature of such information and the government role in supporting its production and dissemination form the concluding parts of this chapter.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Chapter 4. Rational Inattention and Monetary Economics ¤ Rational inattention theory is economic theory that recognizes that people have finite information-processing capacity, in the sense of Shannon and engineering information theory. This approach is still in the early stages of development, but it promises to provide a unified explanation for some of the frictions and delays that are important in dynamic macroeconomics and finance. In this chapter we introduce the basic ideas of information theory, show how it can be introduced formally into dynamic optimization problems, discuss existing applications of the approach, and indicate some of its implications for macroeconomic modeling and monetary policy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Residential Energy Demand ¤ This paper provides a concise review of the empirical literature on residential energy demand. It also discusses the findings in the reviewed literature and their implications for the choice of policy instruments. While there is a plethora of studies on the technical possibilities, i.e. the potential energy savings that new technologies allow, it is plain that energy consumption also depends on our attitudes, preferences and income as well as relative prices1. Therefore, this review is based on the idea that energy demand is essentially driven by human behaviour and our main task is then to explore a range of empirical evidence that sheds useful light on our limited objective. Indeed, the literature on energy demand is impressively rich; already in the early years of the 1980s there were more than 2 500 papers available on this topic (Joerges, 1988 cited in Weber, undated). This brief review will focus mainly on the economics domain, a limitation to be true, although pointers will be given to findings in related fields.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3>
Gender and Economic Empowerment in Africa ¤ It is time to deliver for women and girls. Africa’s growth and development agenda can only succeed if the continent is able to draw on all its resources and talents, and if women are able to participate fully in economic, social and political life. This will require intensified efforts to eliminate discrimination and promote equal rights. The strong commitment which has been demonstrated by African governments needs to be complemented by strong support from the wider international community, within the framework of a clear allocation of responsibilities, and the clear mapping out of specific steps and measures.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
Chapter 14. Variable Selection in Predictive Regressions ¤ This chapter reviews methods for selecting empirically relevant predictors from a set of N potentially relevant ones for the purpose of forecasting a scalar time series. First, criterion-based procedures in the conventional case when N is small relative to the sample size, T , are reviewed. Then the large N case is covered. Regularization and dimension reduction methods are then discussed. Irrespective of the model size, there is an unavoidable tension between prediction accuracy and consistent model determination. Simulations are used to compare selected methods from the perspective of relative risk in one period ahead forecasts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047390-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8>
Chapter 31 Trade, Peace and Democracy: An Analysis of Dyadic Dispute ¤ At least since 1750 when Baron de Montesquieu declared “peace is the natural effect of trade,” a number of economists and political scientists espoused the notion that trade among nations leads to peace. Employing resources more efficiently to produce some commodities rather than others is the foundation for comparative advantage. Specialization based on comparative advantage leads to gains from trade. If political conflict leads to a diminution of trade, then at least a portion of the costs of conflict can be measured by a nation's lost gains from trade. The greater two nations' gains from trade the more costly is bilateral (dyadic) conflict. This notion forms the basis of Baron de Montesquieu's assertion regarding dyadic dispute. This chapter develops an analytical framework showing that higher gains from trade between two trading partners (dyads) lowers the level of conflict between them. It describes data necessary to test this hypothesis, and it outlines current developments and extensions taking place in the resulting trade–conflict literature. Cross-sectional evidence using various data on political interactions confirms that trading nations cooperate more and fight less. A doubling of trade leads to a 20% diminution of belligerence. This result is robust under various specifications, and it is upheld when adjusting for causality using cross-section and time-series techniques. Further, the impact of trade is strengthened when bilateral import demand elasticities are incorporated to better measure gains from trade. Because democratic dyads trade more than non-democratic dyads, democracies cooperate with each other relatively more, thereby explaining the “democratic peace” that democracies rarely fight each other. The chapter then goes on to examine further extensions of the trade–conflict model regarding specific commodity trade, foreign direct investment, tariffs, foreign aid, country contiguity, and multilateral interactions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134037-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132793-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134192-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063255-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065004-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115806-4>
Introduction ¤ Social choice theory is concerned with the evaluation of alternative methods of collective decision-making, as well as with the logical foundations of welfare economics. In turn, welfare economics is concerned with the critical scrutiny of the performance of actual and/or imaginary economic systems, as well as with the critique, design, and implementation of alternative economic policies. This being the case, the origin of social choice theory can be traced back all the way to antiquity. Indeed, as soon as multiple individuals are involved in making decisions for their common cause, one or other method of collective decision-making cannot but be invoked. As a reflection of this obvious fact, there are numerous examples in classic writings on the use and usefulness of alternative methods of collective decision-making. Without denying the importance of those pioneering contributions made by many precursors, it seems fair to say that Kenneth Arrow's Social Choice and Individual Values elevated social choice theory to a stage which is qualitatively different altogether.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143069-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166306-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022393-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5>
Chapter Seventeen. Arrovian Social Choice Theory on Economic Domains ¤ This article surveys the literature that investigates the consistency of Arrow's social choice axioms when his unrestricted domain assumptions are replaced by domain conditions that incorporate the restrictions on agendas and preferences encountered in economic environments. Both social welfare functions and social choice correspondences are considered. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066735-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022393-0>
Chapter 57 Values of perfectly competitive economies ¤ Perfectly competitive economies are economic models with many agents, each of whom is relatively insignificant. This chapter studies the relations between the basic economic concept of competitive (or Walrasian ) equilibrium , and the game-theoretic solution concept of value . It includes the classical Value Equivalence Theorem together with its many extensions and generalizations, as well as recent results.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8>
Chapter 30 Alcohol ¤ Excess drinking is associated with lost productivity, accidents, disability, early death, crime, neglect of family responsibilities, and personality deterioration. These and related concerns have justified special restrictions on alcoholic-beverage commerce and consumption. The nature and extent of government involvement in this arena vary widely over time and place, and are often controversial. Economists have contributed to the evaluation of alcohol policy through empirical work on the effects of alcohol-control measures on consumption and its consequences. Economics has also provided an accounting framework for defining and comparing costs and benefits of interventions, including excise taxes. Outside of the policy arena, economists have analyzed alcohol consumption in the context of stretching the standard model of consumer choice to include intertemporal effects and social influence. Nonetheless, perhaps the most important contribution by economists has been the repeated demonstration that there is nothing unusual about alcohol in at least one essential respect: consumers drink less ethanol (and have fewer alcohol-related problems) when alcohol-beverage prices are increased. Important econometric challenges remain, including the search for a satisfactory resolution to the conflicting results on the effect of price changes on consumption by consumers who tend to drink heavily. There are also unresolved puzzles about the relationship between drinking and productivity; even after controlling for a variety of other characteristics, drinkers tend to have higher earnings than abstainers, and women's earnings (but not men's) tend to increase with alcohol consumption.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Chapter 8 The demand for labor in the long run ¤ The chapter presents a discussion on the demand for labor in the long run, which is important to labor economists for a variety of reasons. As in the market for a commodity, similarly in the market for labor, the demand is an integral determinant of the price of what is exchanged. The purpose of studying the demand for labor is to understand the ways in which exogenous changes will affect the employment and/or wage rates of a group or groups of workers. The chapter begins by examining the theory of labor demand. The theoretical discussion is divided into two parts: demand for labor in the two-factor case, and demand in the multi-factor case. In each part, first the results are derived generally, followed by specific functional forms. The chapter presents the issues involved in estimating labor-demand relations for one type of homogeneous labor, and then summarizes the state of knowledge in this area. The focus throughout is on the relations between exogenous wage changes and the determination of employment, and between exogenous changes in inelastically supplied labor and the structure of relative wages. It is assumed throughout that employers are perfect competitors in both product and labor markets. The chapter focuses only on the long-run, or static theory of labor demand, and thus only on the long-run effects of exogenous changes in wage rates or labor supply.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9>
Guarantee Arrangements for Financial Promises : How Widely Should the Safety Net be Cast? ¤ Guarantees have become the preferred instrument to address many financial policy objectives. The incidence of financial sector guarantee arrangements that address specific policy objectives, such as supporting financial stability, protecting consumers and influencing credit allocations, has increased markedly over the past decades and additional schemes are under consideration. This report identifies considerations regarding consistency and affordability that policymakers should take into account before introducing additional guarantee arrangements. One of them is that the safety net cannot be expanded without limits. In fact, as regards the strength of the net of government-supported guarantees for financial promises, the wider that net is cast (without altering its other key parameters), the thinner it becomes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6>

Chapter 21 The computation of equilibrium prices: An exposition ¤ A demonstration of the existence of equilibrium prices for a general Walrasian model of competitive behavior necessarily makes use of some variant of Brouwer's fixed point theorem as an essential step. The strategy for calculating equilibrium prices is to render that step constructive by a numerical approximation of the fixed point implied by Brouwer's theorem or one of its alternatives. This chapter provides a brief review of the competitive model and the role of fixed point theorems. For the purpose of computing equilibrium prices, the demand functions are frequently more natural to work with than the underlying utility function or preference relationship. A general equilibrium model is fully specified to obtain a numerical solution. On the consumer side, this is typically done by providing a numerical or algebraic description of the functions. A few examples of some of the more familiar utility functions and their associated demand functions are appropriate at this point. A model of equilibrium involves a number of consuming units, individuals, aggregations of individuals, or countries involved in foreign tradeeach of whom has a stock of assets, prior to production and trade, and each of whose demands are functions of the prevailing prices. The market demand functions specify the total consumer demand, for the goods and services in the economy, as a function of all prices. The chapter also explains that market demand functions cannot be arbitrarily specified if they are derived from individual demand functions by the process of aggregation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066472-7>
Chapter 14 Altruism, exchange or indirect reciprocity: what do the data on family transfers show? ¤ Most models of family transfers consider only two generations and focus on two motives: altruism and exchange. They also assume perfect substitution between inter vivos financial transfers and bequests to children. On the contrary, this survey of recent developments in the literature emphasizes the strong heterogeneity of downward financial transfers and motives for these transfers over the life-cycle. In face of the empirical failure of standard models in developed countries (these models may perform better in less developed countries or in old Europe), it also advocates “ mixed ” motivations of transfers, such as strategic altruism, models with endogenous heterogeneous behavioral regimes (Becker, Cigno), and especially indirect reciprocities between three generations, which lead to the replication of the same type of transfer from one generation to the next. Indirect reciprocities appear able to accommodate several empirical puzzles: they are thus compatible (against altruism) with small compensatory effects of transfers both between and within generations, and (against exchange) with the lack of parents' observable counterpart to financial or time support given by their children. They also predict “3rd generation effects”—transfers between parents and children being determined by grandparents' transfers or again grandchildren's characteristics—which appear corroborated by (mainly French or U.S.) available evidence. We thus face the challenge of innovative modelling of indirect reciprocities within the framework of individual forward-looking rationality.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057542-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133536-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4302876-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197971-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184535-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129281-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020511-3>
Chapter 8 Theories of persistent inequality and intergenerational mobility ¤ This chapter reviews the existing theories of persistent inequality across generations. The chapter discusses total economic inequality both in wealth and in earnings and focuses on the intergenerational mobility dimension of total inequality. The chapter presents a nonexhaustive, nontechnical survey of existing empirical work about intergenerational mobility and persistent inequality among dynasties. The question of intergenerational mobility has always been one of the most controversial issues indeed, both in actual political conflicts and in academic writings by social scientists, and conflicting theories in this area have very often been motivated by conflicting qualitative perceptions of the extent of mobility (and conversely).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013887-2>
7. Individual Choice, Beliefs and Behavior ¤ In many experimental studies it has been found that increasing the level of rewards, while not always significantly improving average support for the predictive hypothesis, nevertheless reduces the variance of the observations around the predicted outcome. Smith and Walker model the decision as maximizing the expected utility of the reward where the subjective cognitive cost of effort is increasing in the accuracy of the decision. Consequently, increasing payoffs induces more costly effort, and reduces the error variance relative to the prediction. In a second entry, they apply this model to the first price auction decision format to examine the effect of payoff levels and experience on bidding behavior. The payoffs vary from zero to 20 times the normal amounts paid to subjects in first price auction experiments. Both payoff level and experience reduce the volatility of bids relative to assigned value: the standard error around the fitted bid function decreases with these two treatment control variables.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2>
The Electricity Sector in Russia ¤ The electricity sector plays a vital role in the economy of Russia and the well being of its citizens. Already partly privatised, reform of the structure and regulation of the sector has been on and off the political agenda for years. As part of the OECD’s long-term active support for reform efforts in the Russian Federation, a meeting was held in Moscow in May 2001 among experts from OECD member countries and Russian officials to discuss what could be learned from the experiences of reform in electricity sectors in OECD countries. Key recommendations addressed restructuring – ensuring sufficient deconcentration in generation and independent, non-discriminatory control of grid access by separate ownership of generation and transmission – transmission pricing, universal service, institutional arrangements – empowering an independent regulator with transparent objectives, powers, processes and decisions – and transitional arrangements. Russia is unique, but many of the policy considerations in Russia will also be important in many other countries.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7>
Chapter 5. Coalition Formation ¤ This chapter surveys a sizable and growing literature on coalition formation. We refer to theories in which one or more groups of agents (“coalitions”) deliberately get together to jointly determine within-group actions, while interacting noncooperatively across groups. The chapter describes a variety of solution concepts, using an umbrella model that adopts an explicit real-time approach. Players band together, perhaps disband later and re-form in shifting alliances, all the while receiving payoffs at each date according to the coalition structure prevailing at the time. We use this model to nest two broad approaches to coalition formation, one based on cooperative game theory, the other based on noncooperative bargaining. Three themes that receive explicit emphasis are agent farsightedness, the description of equilibrium coalition structures, and the efficiency implications of the various theories.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8>
Chapter 16. Growth and Ideas ¤ Ideas are different from nearly all other economic goods in that they are nonrivalrous. This nonrivalry implies that production possibilities are likely to be characterized by increasing returns to scale, an insight that has profound implications for economic growth. The purpose of this chapter is to explore these implications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3>
Chapter 7 Empirical Study of Criminal Punishment ¤ This chapter reviews empirical studies of criminal punishment and the criminal justice system by economists. Since the modern exposition of the economic model of criminal behavior, empirical economists have tested its predictions using variation in expected criminal punishments. In the past decade, empirical economists have made substantial progress in identifying the effects of punishment on crime by finding new ways to break the simultaneity of crime rates and punishments. The new empirical evidence generally supports the deterrence model but shows that incapacitation influences crime rates, too. Evidence of the crime-reducing effect of the scale of policing and incarceration is consistent across different methodological approaches. Estimates of the deterrent effect of other penalties, such as capital punishment, are less robust and suggest that claims of large effects from these policies may be spurious. More work is needed to assess the relative importance of deterrence and incapacitation. Empirical economists have made less progress in studying the criminal justice system itself. Data availability constrains the economists' ability to resolve the simultaneity of criminal justice institutions and crime rates, and this limitation hampers rigorous empirical investigation of the incentive effects of numerous criminal justice institutions and procedures. This area remains an important avenue for future empirical research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066510-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135492-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048737-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117663-7>

Chapter 15 Nonprofit Firms in the Performing Arts ¤ The nonprofit performing arts have received substantial attention in the cultural economics literature, and represent an interesting application for many areas of economic inquiry. This chapter surveys the relevant theory and the most prominent empirical studies on performing arts nonprofits. The chapter begins with a description of the nonprofit sector – and the role of the performing arts in this sector – around the world. I then ask why performing arts nonprofits exist, taking into account the objectives of both consumers and suppliers of performing arts services. Next, I study the production and cost conditions that these firms face, paying particular attention to issues such as product quality, product cross-subsidization, and the so-called “cost disease”. The issue of revenue sources and their generation follows, with a special emphasis on earned revenues, donations, and government subsidies. This discussion includes topics such as ticket pricing strategies, fundraising innovations, and the relationship between private giving and public funding. The chapter closes with suggestions for future research on the nonprofit performing arts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4>
Chapter 17. Immigration and Entrepreneurship ¤ Immigrants are widely perceived as being highly entrepreneurial and important for economic growth and innovation. This is reflected in immigration policies, and many developed countries have created special visas and entry requirements in an attempt to attract immigrant entrepreneurs. Not surprisingly, a large body of research on immigrant entrepreneurship has developed over the years. In this chapter we provide an overview of the economics literature with respect to some of the most fundamental immigrant entrepreneurship issues as well as the empirical methods and data used. The main themes we address are immigrant entrepreneurs’ contributions to the economy, entrepreneurship differences across groups, and group differences in entrepreneurial success.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4501977-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069332-6>
Chapter 8 Artificial intelligence in economics and finance: A state of the art — 1994 : The real estate price and assets and liability analysis case ¤ This chapter emphasizes specific contributions, advantages, and weaknesses of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques various purposes: (1) knowledge-based reasoning that applies heuristic knowledge to make policy search more robust, or to satisfy trading principles in a competitive economy, (2) machine learning to learn the behavior of economic agents, (3) decision rationalization in decision support systems, and case-based reasoning, and (4) integration of databases and knowledge bases via suitable knowledge representations. In the real world of economic analysis, AI approaches must be scalable and tunable to changing characteristics without having to change the underlying techniques or algorithms. In economic applications, better explanation-based interfaces are necessary between the user and the system. From the perspective of business, almost no AI research addresses economic competition theories, either with reference to game theory, or to disequilibrium theories. The strongest potential of some AI techniques lies in their data/information fusion capability, which is little explored. This holds especially for neural networks, case-based reasoning, and knowledge representation standards.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011152-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Chapter 6 Educational Wage Premiums and the U.S. Income Distribution: A Survey ¤ This chapter discusses the large literature and numerous issues regarding education-related differences in income in the U.S. Early analyses of skill-related differences compared the earnings of workers across occupations. The general consensus of these investigations was that skill premiums narrowed substantially between 1900 and 1950. The large increase in the supply of high-school graduates relative to the increased demand for skilled workers is the likely explanation. Following the 1940 Decennial Census, which collected information on educational attainment and on earned income and time worked, empirical analyses concentrated directly on education-related differences in earnings. The human capital revolution of the late 1950s/early 1960s greatly expanded the research on education and income and shifted the focus to wages. The human capital approach modeled income as endogenous and sought to understand the variation in earnings by providing a framework for estimating the returns to education and experience. Recent analyses of education and wages have built on this foundation and have been embedded in a large literature that seeks to document and understand the substantial increase in wage inequality over the last 40 years. The consensus is that increases in the demand for skill are the main culprit, though the reasons for such increases are still an open question. We use census data to document the overall increase in education-related income differences over the past 60 years for several income measures. We also document concomitant changes in enrollment and provide a preliminary analysis suggesting that enrollment has responded to the increase in educationwage premiums. We use NLSY data to document the variation in enrollment patterns for those who attend college and to show how these differences are related to pre-schooling characteristics and to post-schooling earnings. We conclude with a brief discussion of the main issues for future research raised throughout the chapter.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2>
Chapter 15 Intergenerational altruism and neoclassical growth models ¤ This chapter surveys intergenerational altruism in neoclassical growth models. It first examines Barro's approach to intergenerational altruism, whereby successive generations are linked by recursive altruistic preferences. Individuals have an altruistic concern only for their children, who in turn also have altruistic feelings for their own children. Through such a recursive relation all generations of a single family (a dynasty) are linked together by a chain of private intergenerational transfers, countervailing any attempt by the government to redistribute resources across generations. This offsetting of public by private transfers operates only if bequests are positive. This is an important qualification to Barro's debt neutrality result. The conditions under which the Ricardian equivalence (debt neutrality) theorem applies are specified. The effectiveness of fiscal policy is further analysed in the context of an economy populated by heterogeneous families differing with respect to their degree of intergenerational altruism. We also examine other forms of dynastic altruism consistent with Barro's recursive definition of altruism, ascending altruism and two-sided altruism. These forms could be expected to deliver debt neutrality unconditionally, as families leaving zero bequests could be families characterised by child-to-parent gift under ascending altruism. We find that this is not the case and no form of dynastic altruism therefore ensures debt neutrality without condition. Even under two-sided altruism there are cases, in which both bequests and gifts are constrained and fiscal policy remains effective. We then review ad hoc forms of altruism and their implications for the debt neutrality results. Only one specific form of ad hoc altruism always guarantees debt neutrality; this form departs from the recursive approach underpinning dynastic altruism, with its objective function being formally equivalent to that of the social planner. Extensions to the fields of education and environmental are presented in a final section.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184535-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129281-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020511-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057542-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197971-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133536-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4302876-7>
Chapter 14. Investment Performance: A Review and Synthesis ¤ This chapter provides a perspective on the rapidly developing literature on investment performance evaluation. I use the stochastic discount factor approach to present and critique current performance measurement techniques in a unified setting. I offer a number of suggestions to improve performance measurement in future research. I also review recent research on the performance of mutual funds, hedge funds, pension funds, and other investment vehicles.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4508395-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269795-5>
Chapter 29 The economics of smoking ¤ While the tobacco industry ranks among the most substantial and successful of economic enterprises, tobacco consumption is associated with more deaths than any other product. Economic analysis of the markets for tobacco products, particularly cigarettes, has contributed considerable insight to debates about the importance of the industry and the appropriate roles of public policy in grappling with the health consequences of tobacco. Certainly the most significant example of this phenomenon has been the rapidly expanding and increasingly sophisticated body of research on the effects of price increases on cigarette consumption. Because excise tax comprises an important component of price, the resultant literature has played a prominent role in legislative debates about using taxation as a principal tool to discourage smoking. In addition to informing legislative debates, this literature has contributed both theory and empirical evidence to the growing interest in modeling the demand for addictive products. This chapter examines this body of research in detail, as well as a variety of equity and efficiency concerns accompanying debates about cigarette taxation. Coverage also includes economic analysis of the role of other tobacco control policies, such as restrictions on advertising, of special interest due to their prominence in debates about tobacco control. The chapter concludes with consideration of research addressing the validity of the tobacco industry's argument that its contributions to employment, tax revenues, and trade balances are vital to the economic health of states and nations. This argument is one of the industry's principal weapons in its battle against policy measures intended to reduce tobacco product consumption.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Chapter 4. Empirical search and consideration sets ¤ This chapter provides an overview of the recent and growing econometric literature studying how consumers search for products. We begin with a brief review of theoretical models of search that have been influential in guiding empirical work. We then discuss the marketing literature on consideration sets and early econometric literature on consumer search, leading up to more recent work that combines the two approaches by formulating search as the process through which consumers form consideration sets. The recent literature also offers econometric tests between search methods. We conclude with a discussion of current and potential future directions for work in this area, which we expect to be greatly enriched by the availability of large data sets containing granular information on consumer search behavior across a variety of online and offline contexts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037589-4>

Chapter 2. The MONASH Style of Computable General Equilibrium Modeling: A Framework for Practical Policy Analysis ¤ MONASH models are descended from Johansen's 1960 model of Norway. The first MONASH model was ORANI, used in Australia's tariff debate of the 1970s. Johansen's influence combined with institutional arrangements in their development gave MONASH models distinctive characteristics, facilitating a broad range of policy-relevant applications. MONASH models currently operate in numerous countries to provide insights on a variety of questions including: the effects on: macro, industry, regional, labor market, distributional and environmental variables of changes in: taxes, public consumption, environmental policies, technologies, commodity prices, interest rates, wage-setting arrangements, infrastructure and major-project expenditures, and known levels and exploitability of mineral deposits (the Dutch disease). MONASH models are also used for explaining periods of history, estimating changes in technologies and preferences and generating baseline forecasts. Creation of MONASH models involved a series of enhancements to Johansen's model, including: (i) a computational procedure that eliminated Johansen's linearization errors without sacrificing simplicity; (ii) endogenization of trade flows by introducing into computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling imperfect substitution between imported and domestic varieties (the Armington assumption); (iii) increased dimensionality allowing for policy-relevant detail such as transport margins; (iv) flexible closures; and (v) complex functional forms to specify production technologies. As well as broad theoretical issues, this chapter covers data preparation and introduces the GEMPACK purpose-built CGE software. MONASH modelers have responded to client demands by developing four modes of analysis: historical, decomposition, forecast and policy. Historical simulations produce up-to-date data, and estimate trends in technologies, preferences and other naturally exogenous but unobservable variables. Decomposition simulations explain historical episodes and place policy effects in historical context. Forecast simulations provide baselines using extrapolated trends from historical simulations together with specialist forecasts. Policy simulations generate effects of policies as deviations from baselines. To emphasize the practical orientation of MONASH models, the chapter starts with a MONASH-style policy story.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065341-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224214-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210294-7>
Chapter 34 Information, incentives, and the design of agricultural policies ¤ This chapter surveys studies that have used the methods of mechanism design, optimal taxation, nonlinear pricing, and principal-agent analyses in the analysis of agricultural policy. The optimal design and reform of agricultural policy are studied under the presumption that agricultural producers are better informed about their technology or their actions than agricultural policy makers. The existence of these information asymmetries creates incentive problems that must be tackled in the design of an optimal agricultural policy. Two basic types of information asymmetries are studied, those associated with hidden knowledge and those with hidden action. Hidden knowledge occurs when the farmer has exact information about his technology, but the regulator does not. Hidden action occurs when only the farmer has exact information on the conditions, including the state of Nature and the farmer's actions, under which production takes place.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6>

The surge in borrowing needs of OECD governments : Revised estimates for 2009 and 2010 Outlook ¤ OECD governments are facing ongoing, unprecedented challenges in raising smoothly large volumes of funds at lowest possible cost, while balancing refinancing-, repricing- and interest rate risks. Amidst continued uncertainty about the pace of recovery as well as the timing and sequencing of the steps of the exit strategy, gross borrowing needs of OECD governments are expected to reach almost USD 16 trillion in 2009, up from an earlier estimate of around USD 12 trillion. The tentative outlook for 2010 shows a stabilising borrowing picture at around the level of USD 16 trillion. A looming additional challenge is the risk that when the recovery gains traction, yields will start to rise. Although there are signs that issuance conditions are becoming tougher, most OECD debt managers have been successful in financing the surge in funding needs. Less successful auctions can therefore best be interpreted as “single market events” and not as unambiguous evidence of systemic market absorption problems. The future could become more challenging though, given that rising issuance is occurring in tandem with increasing overall debt levels and debt service costs. In response, sovereign debt managers, with the essential support of the fiscal authorities, need to implement a timely and credible medium-term exit strategy to avoid future	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Chapter 9. Physician Agency ¤ This chapter reviews the theory and empirical literature on physician market power, behavior, and motives, referred to collectively as the issue of physician agency. The chapter is organized around an increasingly complex view of the demand conditions facing a physician, beginning with the most simple conception associated with demand and supply, and building through monopolistic competition models with complete information, and finally models with asymmetric information. Institutional features such as insurance, price regulation, managed care networks and noncontractible elements of quality of care are incorporated in turn. The review reveals three mechanisms physicians may use to influence quantity of care provided to patients: quantity setting of a nonretradable service, influencing demand by setting the level of a noncontractible input (quality), and, in an asymmetric-information context, taking an action to influence patient preferences. The third mechanism is known as physician-induced demand. The empirical literature on this topic is reviewed. Theories based on alternatives to profit-maximization as objectives of physicians are also reviewed, including ethics and concern for patients, and the target-income hypothesis. The target-income hypothesis can be rejected, although there is empirical support for non-profit maximizing behavior.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Chapter 1 Computable general equilibrium modelling for policy analysis and forecasting ¤ This chapter describes computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling and the history of its development. The chapter illustrates the computation of solutions for CGE models and reviews its achievements, failures, and potential. The model illustrated in the chapter can be used in two ways: as a single-period model suitable for comparative static analyses; and as a model for multi-period forecasting. Before CGE models, there were input-output models that emphasized input-output linkages among industries. CGE models go beyond input-output models by linking industries via economy-wide constraints including constraints on the size of government budget deficits; constraints on deficits in the balance of trade; constraints on the availability of labor, capital, and land; and constraints arising from environmental considerations, such as air and water quality. Much of CGE modeling has been concerned with the welfare implications of proposed policy changesfor example, changes in protection, changes in taxes, and changes in environmental regulations. Many interesting welfare results have been obtained, especially in the analysis of tax changes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011152-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5>
Chapter 14 Survey Expectations ¤ This paper focuses on survey expectations and discusses their uses for testing and modelling of expectations. Alternative models of expectations formation are reviewed and the importance of allowing for heterogeneity of expectations is emphasized. A weak form of the rational expectations hypothesis which focuses on average expectations rather than individual expectations is advanced. Other models of expectations formation, such as the adaptive expectations hypothesis, are briefly discussed. Testable implications of rational and extrapolative models of expectations are reviewed and the importance of the loss function for the interpretation of the test results is discussed. The paper then provides an account of the various surveys of expectations, reviews alternative methods of quantifying the qualitative surveys, and discusses the use of aggregate and individual survey responses in the analysis of expectations and for forecasting.

Chapter 16 Inter-industry studies of structure and performance ¤ This chapter discusses inter-industry studies of the relations among various measures of market structure, conduct, and performance. It discusses that tradition has indeed uncovered many stable, robust, and empirical regularities. Inter-industry research has taught much about the way markets look, especially within the manufacturing sector in developed economies, even if it has not shown exactly the way markets work. Work in some areas has produced no clear picture of the important patterns in the data, and non-manufacturing industries have not received attention commensurate with their importance. But cross-section studies are limited by serious problems of interpretation and measurement. Future inter-industry research should adopt a modest, descriptive orientation and aim to complement case studies by uncovering robust empirical regularities that can be used to evaluate and develop theoretical tools. Much of the most persuasive recent work relies on nonstandard data sources, particularly panel data that can be used to deal with disequilibrium problems and industry-specific data, which mitigate the problem of unobservable industry-specific variables.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133311-1>
Chapter 4. Assessment and Estimation of Risk Preferences ¤ This chapter surveys the rapidly growing literature in which risk preferences are measured and manipulated in laboratory and field experiments. The most commonly used measurement instruments are: an investment task for allocations between a safe and risky asset, a choice menu task for eliciting probability indifference points, and a pricing task for eliciting certainty equivalents of a lottery. These methods are compared in a manner that will help the practitioner decide which one to use, and how to deal with methodological issues associated with incentives, stakes, and the structure of choice menus. Applications involve using inferred risk preferences to document demographic effects, e.g. gender, and to explain the effects of risk aversion on observed behavior in economic in settings, e.g. bargaining, auctions, and contests. Some suggestions for evaluating the separate effects of utility curvature and probability weighting are provided.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070864-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135592-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186957-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050133-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120934-5>
Chapter 15. Poverty and Aging ¤ This chapter explores the relationship between poverty and aging, in terms of its measurement and trends, as well as its alleviation, with particular attention to the most vulnerable individuals at each end of the age distribution. The measurement addresses both the definition of poverty and its aggregation over various age groups. The trends highlight a significant reduction in poverty among the elderly and a gradual increase in poverty among children and working age individuals, both in the United from dependence as a child to independence as a young adult, from being 50 years. Two important secular changes are also detected: a college spike and a retirement dip in poverty across the age distribution. The alleviation of poverty is then attributed to working in the labor market and to social expenditure and its associated policies, which have been especially effective for the elderly. A summary and a discussion follow that set forth an agenda for further research and policy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006294-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4334479-3>
Chapter 1 The positive theory of international trade ¤ The theory of international trade is one of the oldest subfields of economics. This chapter provides an overview of the present state of positive trade theory, concentrating on developments, at the same time it draws attention to the continuity in the development of the subject. It discusses the classical paradigm as a set of assumptions under which trade is limited to final commodities and markets are undistorted and characterized by constant returns to scale and perfect competition. Nowadays theories are motivated by certain key features of real-world trade: the vast exchange of raw materials and commodities that require further processing before being consumed, the large volume of intra-industry trade, and the importance of the size of markets. These extensions in analysis have been generally made without throwing away building blocks found in the earlier literature. Extensions of the simple models of production within the classical paradigm have broken out of the traditional two-by-two mold to analyze the importance of joint production, complementarity among factors, and general properties in higher dimensions. Earlier work on simpler trade models has proved of value in all these extensions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1>
Peace and Security in Africa ¤ More action is needed, by both Africa and the wider international community. Building peace and security is essential, both for economic development and for poverty reduction. Leadership is being taken by Africa itself. The number of conflicts has fallen. But even so, one-fifth of the population of Africa still live in conflict zones. More action is needed both to strengthen and support Africa’s own efforts to bring peace to the continent, and to tackle the wider global drivers of conflict, including the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, and the trade in conflict resources.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
Chapter Fourteen. The Informational Basis of Social Choice ¤ Any procedure of social choice makes use of some types of information and ignores others. For example, the method of majority decision concentrates on people's votes, but pays no direct attention to, say, their social standings, or their prosperity or penury, or even the intensities of their preferences. The differences between distinct procedures lie, to a substantial extent, on the kind of information that each procedure uses and what it has to ignore. The informational bases of the different social choice procedures tell us a great deal about how they respectively work and what they can or cannot achieve.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022393-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066735-2>
Chapter 4 Analytics of development: Dualism ¤ The concept of dualism discussed in this chapter is both more narrowly economic and dynamic. It focuses on the coexistence of two sectors that are asymmetrical and thus dualistic in terms of both product and organizational characteristics. The production asymmetry relevant here is that while traditional agriculture disposes over something approaching fixed inputs of land, very little capital, with large pre-existing inputs of labor, the modernizing manufacturing sector requires virtually no land, while capital can be accumulated and labor absorbed as needed. The concept of dualism discussed is intrinsically dynamic, because the interactions between the two sectors over time in the closed economy context and, ultimately, with each other and the rest of the world, in the open economy context is discussed. The chapter reviews in brief the place of dualism in economic history and in the history of economic thought. The chapter presents an examination of modern day dualism in the closed economy, focusing on the main elements of linkage between the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors as well as on the normative problem of defining developmental success and non-success with the help of the concept of dualism in its dynamic version. The chapter also discusses open dualism, focusing on the triangular relationships between domestic agriculture, domestic non-agriculture, and the rest of the world, distinguishing between dualism in a colonial context from dualism in a developmental context.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213090-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7>
Chapter 10. Marketing and public policy ¤ Historically, quantitative marketers have largely left public policy and social consideration to economists. This has started to change, and there is considerable potential for marketing to impact policy debates in important ways. We focus on two policy areas – competition policy and nutrition policy – and discuss how quantitative market has and can continue to impact policy decision making. In competition policy economists have been using the models and methods of quant marketing and IO to influence actual policy. The effect, at least up to now, has been smaller in nutrition policy. However, in both areas there is scope for great impact from recent research. Marketers should need to pay more attention to the policy debates because: (i) a proper discussion of firm and consumer interaction, which is at the heart of marketing, cannot be complete without accounting for the regulatory, legal, and policy environment, and (ii) a greater involvement with policy will help marketers shape their research in relevant and interesting directions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037589-4>
The Second Corporate Governance Wave in the Middle East and North Africa ¤ Ten years ago, corporate governance was a nascent concept in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). This article charts the evolution of corporate governance across the MENA region over the past decade – as a concept and in practice – and proposes potential avenues for future work in this area. Initial interest in corporate governance in the region was propelled by the drive to attract foreign investment and the increasing development of local capital markets. A second wave now appears to be forming and its results will depend largely on the capacity of national regulators to enforce existing corporate governance provisions.

Chapter 25 Income Contingent Loans for Higher Education: International Reforms ¤ It is well known that higher education financing involves uncertainty and risk with respect to students' future economic fortunes, and an unwillingness of banks to provide loans because of the absence of collateral. It follows that without government intervention there will be both socially sub-optimal and regressive outcomes with respect to the provision of higher education. The historically most common response to this market failure – a government guarantee to repay student loans to banks in the event of default – is associated with significant problems. Income contingent loans offer a possible solution. Since the late 1980s ICLs have been adopted in, or recommended for, a significant and growing number of countries, and it is this important international policy reform that has motivated the chapter. An ICL provides students with finance for tuition and/or income support, its critical and defining characteristic being that the collection of the debt depends on the borrowers' future capacity to pay. ICL have two major insurance advantages for borrowers over more typical arrangements: default protection and consumption smoothing. With reference to countries with both successful and unsuccessful ICL, the chapter illustrates that the operational and design features of such schemes are of fundamental importance with respect to their potential efficacy. It also seems to be the case that in many institutional and political environments there is not yet the administrative sophistication to make ICLs viable, although for reasons documented this is unlikely to be the case for the vast majority of OECD countries. For one country, Australia, there is now a significant amount of research into the consequences of an ICL, and the evidence is explored in some detail. The investigation into the Australian experience helps in the development of a research agenda.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2>
Chapter 51 Efficiency and Equity Effects of Land Markets ¤ It is widely believed that land markets, including both land sales and tenancy markets, are neither efficient nor conducive to social equity. It is often argued that tenants, particularly share tenants, do not have proper incentives to work and invest, partly because of the disincentive effects of output sharing and partly because of the tenure insecurity. It is also widely accepted that land sales transactions tend to exacerbate the social equity and rural poverty by facilitating the concentration of land ownership by hands of a few wealthy landlords. Based on these presumptions, land reform programs have been implemented in a number of developing countries. This article critically reviews these presumptions both theoretically and empirically. Firstly, we identify why land tenancy transaction is more common than land sales transactions and why share tenancy is more common than leasehold tenancy. Secondly, we critically review the theories of share tenancy, tenure security, and adjustment costs of farm size. Thirdly, we empirically review the efficiency and equity effects of land markets as well as the impacts of conventional land reform programs. It has become clear from the literature review that land reform polices have generally failed to improve land use efficiency and social equity. It is also found that tenancy contracts, including share tenancy, are generally efficient and conducive to social justice. In conclusion, we propose to encourage tenancy transactions, in general, and share tenancy, in particular.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4704302-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6>
Retail Instruments in Public Funding Strategies ¤ Retail borrowing programmes are one component of government debt issuance in both OECD and non-OECD countries. These programmes take a variety of forms and often exist to satisfy a number of objectives. In some jurisdictions, they play a significant funding role. Even in countries where retail borrowing programmes play a small role, they are in many cases politically important because they satisfy primarily social objectives. In recent years, some OECD countries have begun to reconsider their retail borrowing programmes. Shrinking borrowing requirements in a number of countries have led to priority being put on maintaining liquid wholesale markets. Other countries continue to see benefits from their retail borrowing programmes and use them as a significant and stable source of funding. These governments are often innovative at finding ways to drive down administration costs, such as through the use of new electronic distribution channels and total dematerialisation of securities.

Chapter 3. Do Taxes Affect Corporate Decisions? A Review ¤ This chapter reviews tax research related to whether corporate and personal taxes affect domestic and multinational capital structure, debt maturity, payout policy, compensation policy, risk management, earnings management, leasing, pensions, R&amp;D partnerships, tax shelters, transfer pricing, repatriation of foreign profits, and organizational form. For each topic, theory related to how taxes can affect corporate decision making and firm value is reviewed, followed by a summary of the related empirical evidence and a discussion of unresolved issues. Tax research generally supports the hypothesis that high-tax rate firms make policy choices in response to tax incentives. Many issues remain unresolved, however, including understanding whether tax effects are of first-order importance, why firms do not pursue tax benefits more aggressively, and measuring the effect of investor-level taxes on corporate actions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4508395-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269795-5>
Chapter 15 The specification and influence of asset markets ¤ This chapter discusses portfolio balance models with postulated asset demands, asset demands broadly consistent with but not directly implied by microeconomic theory. The demand for the sum of assets denominated in each currency is homogeneous of degree one in nominal wealth, and the demand for money in each country depends on the return on the security denominated in that country's currency but not on the return on securities denominated in other currencies. However, under these same assumptions the demand for money depends on real wealth. Because the conclusions of macroeconomic analysis often depend crucially on the form of asset demand functions, it is important to continue to explore the implications of the microeconomic theory and other microeconomic approaches. The chapter discusses that the consumer arrives at his or her asset demands by maximizing his or her utility given interest rates and the parameters of the distributions of prices and exchange rates. The distributions of prices and exchange rates are not invariant to changes in the distributions of policy variables and stochastic components of tastes and technology. It has been recognized that a very important item on the research agenda is imbedding consumer's asset demands based on utility maximization in a general equilibrium model in which the distributions of prices and exchange rates are determined endogenously.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1>
Chapter 73 Energy, Reserve and Adjustment Market Behavior With Industry Network, Demand and Generator Parameters ¤ This chapter summarizes results from various experiments that uses a complex 9-node network market with parameters supplied by the electric utility industry. In the experiments conducted, the chapter uses a DC model with quadratic line losses to compute the real power flows in the aggregated network. The chapter concludes that with intensive training and screening, subjects can handle very complex and demanding environments when assisted by local expert system algorithms similar to the support needed by practitioners in the field. Moreover, they engage in extensive, successful manipulation attempts to take advantage of the regulatory must-serve restrictions on the ability of the local distribution monopoly to interrupt demand to discipline seller withholding of supply. Sellers, however, are much more consistently successful in this respect under the CDA trading rule condition. These findings contrast sharply with those of other experimental studies in which modest proportions of peak consumer demand could be interrupted by wholesale buyers, enabling the latter to discipline seller attempts to raise clearing prices.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2>
Chapter 7 Patterns of structural change ¤ This chapter presents a discussion on the patterns of structural transformation during the transition from a low income, agrarian rural economy to an industrial urban economy with substantially higher per capita income. The chapter presents a review on the basic concepts of the empirical research program into the economic structure of developing countries during the transition process, which originated with the monumental work of Simon Kuznets. The chapter discusses methodological issues of empirical research on structural transformation. A summary of the main stylized facts of development, with emphasis on growth, accumulation, and sector proportions is presented. Attempts to model and explain the transformation are also presented. The chapter also discusses relative prices and the role of the state in facilitating, fostering, or at times hampering, an efficient transformation. Development economics can be characterized as dealing with issues of structure and growth in less developed countries. Analysis of structure appears in two variants. The first, and more recent, is concerned with the functioning of economies, their markets, institutions, mechanisms for allocating resources, income generation and its distribution, and so on. In the second variant, economic development is seen as an interrelated set of long-run processes of structural transformation that accompany growth. The central features of this approach are economy-wide phenomena such as industrialization, urbanization, and agricultural transformation, regarded as elements of what Kuznets identified as modern economic growth.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213090-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7>
Chapter 23. Empirical Strategies in Labor Economics ¤ This chapter provides an overview of the methodological and practical issues that arise when estimating causal relationships that are of interest to labor economists. The subject matter includes identification, data collection, and measurement problems. Four identification strategies are discussed, and five empirical examples – the effects of schooling, unions, immigration, military service, and class size – illustrate the methodological points. In discussing each example, we adopt an experimentalist perspective that emphasizes the distinction between variables that have causal effects, control variables, and outcome variables. The chapter also discusses secondary datasets, primary data collection strategies, and administrative data. The section on measurement issues focuses on recent empirical examples, presents a summary of empirical findings on the reliability of key labor market data, and briefly reviews the role of survey sampling weights and the allocation of missing values in empirical research. 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Chapter 36 The operation and collapse of fixed exchange rate regimes ¤ This chapter discusses the operation and collapse of fixed exchange rate regimes. It reports recent research contributions to the understanding of the dynamics of a fixed exchange rate system. These contributions can be placed readily into two categories research on target zones and research on speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate regimes. The chapter briefly discusses the various rationales for selecting a fixed exchange rate system over a floating exchange rate regime. The focus, however, is on the positive economics of fixed exchange rates. This focus is consistent with most of the research in the past decade; given that a target zone or fixed exchange rate system is chosen, researchers have concentrated mainly on determining its dynamic development. Although, as the chapter reports, much empirical research has been done to examine theoretical models, the recent literature is primarily a theoretical one. Most research in this area is based on the simple monetary model of the exchange rate, which does not perform well empirically in the short run. Nevertheless, this literature has had great influence in central banks, given the background of the existence of important target zone systems and of major exchange rate crises in the past decade.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1>
Chapter 5. The Industrial Revolution ¤ The Industrial Revolution decisively changed economywide productivity growth rates. For successful economies, measured efficiency growth rates increased from close to zero to close to 1% per year in the blink of an eye, in terms of the long history of humanity, seemingly within 50 years of 1800 in England. Yet the Industrial Revolution has defied simple economic explanations or modeling. This paper seeks to set out the empirical parameters of the Industrial Revolution that any economic theory must encompass, and illustrate why this makes explaining the Industrial Revolution so difficult within the context of standard economic models and narratives.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3>
Chapter 12. Skills, Tasks and Technologies: Implications for Employment and Earnings ¤ A central organizing framework of the voluminous recent literature studying changes in the returns to skills and the evolution of earnings inequality is what we refer to as the canonical model, which elegantly and powerfully operationalizes the supply and demand for skills by assuming two distinct skill groups that perform two different and imperfectly substitutable tasks or produce two imperfectly substitutable goods. Technology is assumed to take a factor-augmenting form, which, by complementing either high or low skill workers, can generate skill biased demand shifts. In this paper, we argue that despite its notable successes, the canonical model is largely silent on a number of central empirical developments of the last three decades, including: ( 1 ) significant declines in real wages of low skill workers, particularly low skill males; ( 2 ) non-monotone changes in wages at different parts of the earnings distribution during different decades; ( 3 ) broad-based increases in employment in high skill and low skill occupations relative to middle skilled occupations (i.e., job polarization); ( 4 ) rapid diffusion of new technologies that directly substitute capital for labor in tasks previously performed by moderately skilled workers; and ( 5 ) expanding offshoring in opportunities, enabled by technology, which allow foreign labor to substitute for domestic workers specific tasks. Motivated by these patterns, we argue that it is valuable to consider a richer framework for analyzing how recent changes in the earnings and employment distribution in the United States and other advanced economies are shaped by the interactions among worker skills, job tasks, evolving technologies, and shifting trading opportunities. We propose a tractable task-based model in which the assignment of skills to tasks is endogenous and technical change may involve the substitution of machines for certain tasks previously performed by labor. We further consider how the evolution of technology in this task-based setting may be endogenized. We show how such a framework can be used to interpret several central recent trends, and we also suggest further directions for empirical exploration.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127364-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8>
Chapter 3. Spatial Methods ¤ This chapter is concerned with methods for analyzing spatial data. After initial discussion of the nature of spatial data, including the concept of randomness, we focus most of our attention on linear regression models that involve interactions between agents across space. The introduction of spatial variables into standard linear regression provides a flexible way of characterizing these interactions, but complicates both interpretation and estimation of parameters of interest. The estimation of these models leads to three fundamental challenges: the “reflection problem,” the presence of omitted variables, and problems caused by sorting. We consider possible solutions to these problems, with a particular focus on restrictions on the nature of interactions. We show that similar assumptions are implicit in the empirical strategies—fixed effects or spatial differencing—used to address these problems in reduced form estimation. These general lessons carry over to the policy evaluation literature.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4239568-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1>
Review of Sectoral Reforms in the Czech Republic : Energy and Transportation Sectors ¤ Since its creation in 1993, the Czech Republic has experienced a period of broad and deep changes to the legal structure and institutional frameworks that were necessary to ensure transition to a market economy. This chapter focuses on energy (gas and electricity) and transportation (road and rail freight) sectors, which are important in final consumption expenditure, and as inputs to other sectors, impact on overall economic competitiveness. Substantial progresses have been made over the past decade, the regulatory environment has been liberalised and some competition emerged. Reform, however, remains incomplete with the state still significantly involved in these sectors. Also, improvements are needed in the regulatory framework to build market confidence by improving clarity and transparency in the regulatory process. It is expected that prospects for Czech accession to the EU will encourage the authorities to establish such a framework in accordance with the relevant EU directives.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9>
Chapter 20 Fixed-income pricing ¤ This chapter surveys the literature on fixed-income pricing models, including dynamic term-structure models, and interest-rate sensitive, derivative pricing models. Our overview of conceptual approaches highlights the tradeoffs that have emerged between the complexity of the probability model for the “risk factors”, data availability, the pricing objective, and the tractability of the resulting pricing model. Initially, we examine term-structure models that price both bonds (default-free and defaultable) and fixed-income derivatives with payoffs in terms of prices or yields on these bonds. These include affine, quadratic-Gaussian, and various stochastic volatility models of the term structure. Then we turn to models designed to price fixed-income derivatives, taking the current yield curve as an input into the pricing framework. These include models based on forward rates and the LIBOR and Swaption Market models.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269795-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4508395-2>
Chapter 61 Intertemporal Substitution and Risk Aversion ¤ We study structural models of stochastic discount factors and explore alternative methods of estimating such models using data on macroeconomic risk and asset returns. Particular attention is devoted to recursive utility models in which risk aversion can be modified without altering intertemporal substitution. We characterize the impact of changing the intertemporal substitution and risk aversion parameters on equilibrium short-run and long-run risk prices and on equilibrium wealth.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Preface ¤ The series Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare presents, in two volumes, essays on past and ongoing work in social choice theory and welfare economics. The first volume, which consists of twelve chapters in four partsPart I ( Arrovian Impossibility Theorems ), Part II ( Voting Schemes and Mechanisms ), Part III ( Structure of Social Choice Rules ), and Part IV ( Welfare, Justice, and Poverty )was published in 2002. This is the long overdue second volume of the handbook, which also consists of four parts. In Part V ( Foundations ), some very basic issues in welfare economics and social choice theory are discussed. The topics covered include the initial insights behind and the basic functions of social choice theory, the informational basis of normative and positive social choice theory, the status of competitive market mechanisms as social choice procedures, and the main ingredients of nonwelfaristic approaches in welfare economics and social choice theory along the line of the theory of functioning and capabilities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066735-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022393-0>
OECD Productivity Growth in the 2000s: A Descriptive Analysis of the Impact of Sectoral Effects and Innovation ¤ This paper brings together the latest data and OECD productivity indicators in different areas with the aim of reviewing the main productivity trends over the past decade, comparing the United States, Europe and to some extent Japan. Concerning economy wide indicators of productivity, the slowdown appears to be due to a significant slowdown in investment in information and communication technologies (ICT) followed by a decrease in multi-factor productivity (MFP). However, a new set of indicators of MFP growth by industry shows that the decline of productivity is particularly marked in sectors such as construction and market services. Looking for possible explanations of the decline, a marked slowdown in innovation emerged as the most likely cause. It concludes that, if no new wave of innovation materialises, comparable in size to the one of the late 1990s (around notably the Internet), the OECD trend productivity growth is not likely to resume at its end-1990s level. Only a recovery in innovation itself could trigger a sustainable recovery in productivity in the major OECD countries.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
Towards More Harmonised Estimates of Investment in Software ¤ The latest system of national accounts (SNA93) recommended that purchases of software (and any own-account production) should be treated as investment as long as the acquisition satisfied conventional asset requirements. This change added about 1 per cent to GDP in most OECD economies in the mid-1990s. However, the range of the revision has been significantly different across countries, leading many observers to question the comparability of these statistics. An OECD task force has formulated a set of recommendations describing a harmonised method for estimating software and this paper provides estimates of changes to GDP levels and growth that might be expected if the OECD recommendations were applied. Estimates of changes are also presented using an alternative harmonised method. Whichever harmonised method is applied, the impact on GDP levels is likely to be significant, and in some countries about 1 per cent of GDP ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2>
Chapter 2. Technology Diffusion: Measurement, Causes, and Consequences ¤ This chapter discusses different approaches pursued to explore three broad questions related to technology diffusion: what general patterns characterize the diffusion of technologies, and how have they changed over time?; what are the key drivers of technology?; and what are the macroeconomic consequences of technology? We prioritize in our discussion unified approaches to these three questions that are based on direct measures of technology.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3>
Chapter 55: Values of non-transferable utility games ¤ This chapter surveys a class of solution concepts for n-person games without transferable utility — NTU games for short — that are based on varying notions of “fair division”. An NTU game is a specification of payoffs attainable by members of each coalition through some joint course of action. The players confront the problem of choosing a payoff or solution that is feasible for the group as a whole. This is a bargaining problem and its solution may be reasonably required to satisfy various criteria, and different sets of rules or axioms will characterize different solutions or classes of solutions. For transferable utility games, the main axiomatic solution is the Shapley Value and this chapter deals with values of NTU games , i.e., solutions for NTU games that coincide with the Shapley value in the transferable utility case. We survey axiomatic characterizations of the Shapley NTU value, the Harsanyi solution, the Egalitarian solution and the non-symmetric generalizations of each. In addition, we discuss approaches to some of these solutions using the notions of potential and consistency for NTU games with finitely many as well as infinitely many players.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Fukushima : liability and compensation ¤ On 11 March 2011, Japan endured one of the worst natural disasters in its history when a massive earthquake struck the Pacific coast of the country and was followed by a tsunami which led to considerable loss of lives. It also led to a major accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Soon afterwards, the operator of the plant, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), assumed responsibility and liability for the nuclear accident. On 28 April 2011, TEPCO established a dedicated contact line to provide consulting services for financial compensation related to the damage caused.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068925-6>
Chapter 5. Behavioral Corporate Finance: An Updated Survey ¤ We survey the theory and evidence of behavioral corporate finance, which generally takes one of two approaches. The market timing and catering approach views managerial financing and investment decisions as rational managerial responses to securities mispricing. The managerial biases approach studies the direct effects of managers’ biases and nonstandard preferences on their decisions. We review relevant psychology, economic theory and predictions, empirical challenges, empirical evidence, new directions such as behavioral signaling, and open questions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269795-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4508395-2>
Chapter 12 Economic approaches to population growth ¤ This chapter presents a discussion on economic approaches to population growth. This chapter reviews the principal analytical approaches of the past several decades to the study of the relationship between population growth and economic development. Migration and urbanization are treated only insofar as necessary for a coherent treatment of population growth itself. The chapter describes demographic change in developing countries over the past three decades. It also reviews the macroeconomic literature on the consequences of high population growth rates in developing countries, covering both partial and general equilibrium approaches. Economists have proferred two rationales for a public policy to influence private fertility behavior .The first is externalitiesthat the social costs of children may exceed their private costs. The second rationale is the proposition that the market for contraceptive information, and possibly for certain contraceptive services, is poor, especially in developing countries. This second rationale is important in justifying family planning programs, irrespective of any consensus on the economic consequences of population growth.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213090-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7>
Chapter 2. Education Research and Administrative Data ¤ Thanks to extraordinary and exponential improvements in data storage and computing capacities, it is now possible to collect, manage, and analyze data in magnitudes and in manners that would have been inconceivable just a short time ago. As the world has developed this remarkable capacity to store and analyze data, so have the world's governments developed large-scale, comprehensive data files on tax programs, workforce information, benefit programs, health, and education. While these data are collected for purely administrative purposes, they represent remarkable new opportunities for expanding our knowledge. This chapter describes some of the benefits and challenges associated with the use of administrative data in education research. We also offer specific case studies of data that have been developed in both the Nordic countries and the United States, and offer an (incomplete) inventory of data sets used by social scientists to study education questions on every inhabited continent on earth.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2>
Chapter 9. Assessing International Efficiency ¤ This chapter is structured in three parts. The first part outlines the methodological steps, involving both theoretical and empirical work, for assessing whether an observed allocation of resources across countries is efficient. The second part applies the methodology to the long-run allocation of capital and consumption in a large cross section of countries. We find that countries that grow faster in the long run also tend to save more both domestically and internationally. These facts suggest that either the long-run allocation of resources across countries is inefficient, or that there is a systematic relation between fast growth and preference for delayed consumption. The third part applies the methodology to the allocation of resources across developed countries at the business cycle frequency. Here we discuss how evidence on international quantity comovement, exchange rates, asset prices, and international portfolio holdings can be used to assess efficiency. Overall, quantities and portfolios appear consistent with efficiency, while evidence from prices is difficult to interpret using standard models. The welfare costs associated with an inefficient allocation of resources over the business cycle can be significant if shocks to relative country permanent income are large. In those cases partial financial liberalization can lower welfare.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0>
Expanded government guarantees for bank liabilities : Selected issues ¤ Government provision of a safety net for financial institutions has been a key element of the policy response to the current crisis. In the process, existing guarantees have been expanded and new ones introduced, including, in particular, in relation to bank liabilities. Among other things, such guarantees create costs that arise as a result of potential distortions of incentives and competition. To limit such distortions it is important to specify risk-based premiums for additional government-provided guarantees, and to the extent that guarantees are priced appropriately potential distortions also should be limited. The evidence however has been mixed in this regard. The present article discusses pricing and some other selected issues related to the recent expansion of guarantees for bank liabilities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Chapter 2 Forecasting and Decision Theory ¤ When forecasts of the future value of some variable, or the probability of some event, are used for purposes of ex ante planning or decision making, then the preferences, opportunities and constraints of the decision maker will all enter into the ex post evaluation of a forecast, and the ex post comparison of alternative forecasts. After a presenting a brief review of early work in the area of forecasting and decision theory, this chapter formally examines the manner in which the features of an agent's decision problem combine to generate an appropriate decision-based loss function for that agent's use in forecast evaluation. Decision-based loss functions are shown to exhibit certain necessary properties, and the relationship between the functional form of a decision-based loss function and the functional form of the agent's underlying utility function is characterized. In particular, the standard squared-error loss function is shown to imply highly restrictive and not particularly realistic properties on underlying preferences, which are not justified by the use of a standard local quadratic approximation. A class of more realistic loss functions (“location-dependent loss functions”) is proposed.

Chapter 11 Mortality and morbidity among adults and the elderly ¤ This chapter discusses the questions to be asked of the compiled mortality and morbidity data, paying particular attention to those data sources that are readily available and to those methods that have proven or may prove themselves particularly fruitful. Differential rates of infant mortality among countries may also explain differential mortality and morbidity for adults and the elderly among countries. The chapter indicates that demographic, epidemiologic, biological, and socio-economic paradigms must take in order for the study of mortality and morbidity of adults and the elderly to bear fruitful results. Central to the study of such a complex issue is the availability of data monitoring systems that provide accurate information on disease etiology and specific causes-of-death and the plethora of economic, biological, lifestyle and behavioral, and other risk factors, whose relevance to mortality and morbidity outcomes are discussed in the chapter.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006294-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123185-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006292-2>
Chapter 10 Determinants and consequences of the mortality and health of infants and children ¤ This chapter provides an overview of the literature pertaining to two central issues in population studies related to infant and child mortality; the first issue concerns the extent to which human fertility is affected by the existence of (and changes in) infant and child mortality, while the second issue is concerned with the determinants of infant and child mortality. The assumption that infant and child mortality is uncontrollable at the individual level may have a considerable impact on the way the response of fertility to mortality is estimated. To the extent that behavior can affect infant and child mortality, correlations between fertility and mortality may reflect underlying household preferences. Thus, disentangling the reasons that lie behind the correlation between fertility and offspring mortality requires that the mortality technology is understood. Some researchers, therefore, have attempted to recover exogenous components of mortality by estimating the technology of infant and child survival.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006294-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123185-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006292-2>
Chapter 1. Corporate Governance and Control ¤ Corporate governance is concerned with the resolution of collective action problems among dispersed investors and the reconciliation of conflicts of interest between various corporate claimholders. In this survey we review the theoretical and empirical research on the main mechanisms of corporate control, discuss the main legal and regulatory institutions in different countries, and examine the comparative corporate governance literature. A fundamental dilemma of corporate governance emerges from this overview: regulation of large shareholder intervention may provide better protection to small shareholders; but such regulations may increase managerial discretion and scope for abuse.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4508395-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269795-5>
Chapter 12 Specification and estimation of intertemporal asset pricing models ¤ This chapter discusses recent econometric work on dynamic, equilibrium asset-pricing models, reviews the specifications of econometric models of asset price determination, and explores the properties of several extensions of these models. It focuses on the tradeoffs involved in achieving econometric identification, both in terms of the economic and statistical assumptions, which must be made, and the limitations of the requisite data, which are used in implementing alternative models. The increased interest in the econometric implications of intertemporal asset pricing relations is traced to several important developments in economic theory and econometric method. The chapter discusses the relation between consumption and asset returns implied by the representative agent models. It describes the representation of asset prices in terms of a linear functional on a space of random payoffs. When agents can trade a complete set of contingent claims to goods in the future, the benchmark payoff that defines this function can be identified with the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution of a numeraire good.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Chapter 98 Intertemporal Choice under Habit Formation ¤ The fundamental question addressed in this research is the degree to which models of optimal intertemporal choice are good descriptions of non-interactive individual intertemporal behavior in the presence of habit formation. The existence of loss avoidance does, however, not explain why subjects consume too much in the first few periods. This chapter conjecture that overconsumption during the first periods is driven by cognitive limitations. If subjects are unable to compute the aggregate present value of future costs which is associated with each level of consumption, they face a form of subjective uncertainty. Hence, psychologically relevant features of the decision problem play an important role. This chapter also presents the fact that the present benefits of consumption are relatively large, immediately available, and thus unambiguously given is likely to be of psychological relevance because it renders present benefits highly salient.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1>
Chapter 35 International trade and business cycles ¤ This chapter discusses the salient features of international trade and business cycles and summarizes the contributions of a particular branch of the literature on open economy macroeconomics. Becasue many macroeconomic time series are nonstationary, the computation of moments requires that the data be transformed to remove the nonstationarity. A commonly used transformation is the linear filter advocated by Hodrick and Prescott. The important properties of this filter are the following: (1) the filter will render stationary any time series that is integrated of order four or less and (2) when applied to quarterly data, the filter acts as a reasonable approximation to a high-pass filter that passes the cycles of frequency eight years or less with the customary value of 1600 for the smoothing parameter. Recently, Baxter and King (1994) proposed a method for measuring business cycle components of models and data through the application of an approximate band-pass filter. The chapter also analyzes the effects of shocks to government spending and tax rates and reviews the literature on multi-good models of international business cycle.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0>
Chapter 7. The Analysis of Field Choice in College and Graduate School : Determinants and Wage Effects ¤ As the workforce has become more educated, educational decisions are about what type of education to pursue as well as how much to pursue. In college, individuals somewhat specialize through their choice of college major. Further specialization occurs in graduate school. This chapter investigates how majors and graduate school affect labor market outcomes, as well as how individuals make these potentially important decisions. To do so, we develop a dynamic model of educational decision-making. In light of the model, we examine the estimation issues associated with obtaining causal effects of educational choices on earnings. We then examine ways that authors have overcome the selection problem, as well as the approaches authors have taken to estimate the process by which these educational decisions are made.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2>
Chapter 15 Volatility and Correlation Forecasting ¤ Volatility has been one of the most active and successful areas of research in time series econometrics and economic forecasting in recent decades. This chapter provides a selective survey of the most important theoretical developments and empirical insights to emerge from this burgeoning literature, with a distinct focus on forecasting applications. Volatility is inherently latent, and Section 1 begins with a brief intuitive account of various key volatility concepts. Section 2 then discusses a series of different economic situations in which volatility plays a crucial role, ranging from the use of volatility forecasts in portfolio allocation to density forecasting in risk management. Sections 3–5 present a variety of alternative procedures for univariate volatility modeling and forecasting based on the GARCH, stochastic volatility and realized volatility paradigms, respectively. Section 6 extends the discussion to the multivariate problem of forecasting conditional covariances and correlations, and Section 7 discusses volatility forecast evaluation methods in both univariate and multivariate cases. Section 8 concludes briefly.

Chapter 62 International Trade Policies Affecting Agricultural Incentives in Developing Countries ¤ For decades, earnings from farming in many developing countries have been depressed by a pro-urban bias in own-country policies as well as by governments of richer countries favoring their farmers with import barriers and subsidies. Both sets of policies reduce national and global economic welfare and inhibit economic growth. In particular, they add to inequality and poverty in developing countries, since three quarters of the world's billion poorest people depend directly or indirectly on farming for their livelihood. During the past two decades, however, numerous developing-country governments have reduced their sectoral and trade policy distortions, while some high-income countries have also begun reforming their protectionist farm policies. This chapter surveys the changing extent of policy distortions to prices faced by developing-country farmers. After outlining the basic measurement theory, the chapter provides a brief history of policies of advanced and developing economies and then surveys empirical studies that document the changing extent of price distortions over the past half century. It reviews the economic effects of policy reforms since the early 1980s and of interventions remaining in the early part of the present century, according to global economywide modeling results. The chapter concludes by pointing to the scope and prospects for further pro-poor policy reform at home and abroad.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4704302-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2>
Chapter 58 The Economics of Water, Irrigation, and Development ¤ The post-World War II era has witnessed a drastic increase in irrigation activities that have contributed substantially to the massive growth in agricultural production that enables humanity to feed its doubling population. However, a distinction has to be made between the overall positive contribution of irrigation to agricultural productivity and economic welfare and the significant amount of misallocation and mismanagement of resources that have accompanied the expansion of irrigation. In many cases, water resources have been overdeveloped; there has been overspending on capital; and significant costs in terms of loss of ecosystems, extinction of fish species, and contamination of water sources. This chapter provides an economic perspective on the contribution of irrigation and water resources to past agricultural development and future water resource management. The efficiency of water use is affected by decisions made at many levels. The inefficiencies that can occur at different levels of water management are discussed in this chapter. The analysis first considers irrigation water use by an individual, and then moves to the importance of regional management. The importance of dynamic considerations about the future, and the role of interregional management are then covered. Together, these sections present an economic framework for designing water institutions and policies to improve water resource allocation and prevent some of the current inefficiency in water resource systems. The second part of the chapter provides an overview of the benefits and costs that have been realized through agricultural water and irrigation projects in developing countries. There is a paucity of ex-post integrated assessments of these projects, so the chapter puts the pieces together, combining data with conceptual arguments.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4704302-7>
Chapter 43 Urbanization in transforming economies ¤ The past half-century has witnessed a dramatic change in the way in which people live. Fifty years ago, only a small proportion of the less developed world lived in cities, and world poverty was overwhelmingly rural. In 1950, less than one-fifth of the population of the “third world” was urban; in the next five years or so, a majority of developing countries' populations will be urban. This dramatic social change has captured the attention of development economists and, to a lesser degree, urban economists. This chapter examines what has been learned in a variety of areas. Section 1 discusses the stylized patterns of urbanization in the developing world, while Section 2 turns to models of third world city growth and their empirical estimates, discussing partial equilibrium models, general equilibrium models, economy-wide computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, demographic-economic perspectives, and household migration modeling. Section 3 considers the impact of government policies on urbanization. Particular attention is devoted to structural adjustment policies, urban biases in public expenditures, and issues unique to (ex)-socialist economies. Section 4 examines structural impediments to urban development, including labor and land markets, transportation issues, public finance and social infrastructure concerns, and urban spatial structure. The final section looks at the macroeconomic impacts of urbanization—on wage gaps and income distribution, demand patterns and economic efficiency. 1 1 This survey should be regarded as a complement to Lucas' (1997) survey of internal migration in developing countries for the Handbook of Population and Family Economics .	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1>
Chapter 16. Intrahousehold Inequality ¤ Studies of inequality often ignore resource allocation within the household. In doing so they miss an important element of the distribution of welfare that can vary dramatically depending on overall environmental and economic factors. Thus, measures of inequality that ignore intrahousehold allocations are both incomplete and misleading. We discuss determinants of intrahousehold allocation of resources and welfare. We show how the sharing rule, which characterizes the within-household allocations, can be identified from data on household consumption and labor supply. We also argue that a measure based on estimates of the sharing rule is inadequate as an approach that seeks to understand how welfare is distributed in the population because it ignores public goods and the allocation of time to market work, leisure, and household production. We discuss a money metric alternative, that fully characterizes the utility level reached by the agent. We then review the current literature on the estimation of the sharing rule based on a number of approaches, including the use of distribution factors as well as preference restrictions.

Chapter 13. Electric Power Markets in Transition: Agent-Based Modeling Tools for Transactive Energy Support ¤ Electric power systems consist of large numbers of heterogeneous participants interacting within an intricate layered network of economic and operational relationships. Decision-making in these systems has been extensively decentralized in many industrialized countries over the past twenty years in an attempt to increase their reliability and efficiency. Given the high negative impact of power disruptions, these decentralization efforts have typically been preceded by extensive sensitivity studies with empirically-based computational models. This chapter discusses the current and potential use of agent-based computational modeling to develop novel transactive energy system (TES) designs for electric power systems. TES designs are decentralized market-based designs that permit electric power systems to operate more fully in accordance with basic economic principles while maintaining overall system reliability and efficiency.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
The Objectives of Competition Law and Policy and the Optimal Design of a Competition Agency ¤ This article comprises two notes by the Secretariat, one on the Objectives of Competition Law and Policy and the other one on the Optimal Design of a Competition Agency. Both notes were prepared to provide a framework for discussion at the meeting of the Global Forum on Competition (GFC) held on 10-11 February 2003. It was decided to link these topics together in the GFC's agenda after it was recognised that the objectives of competition law and policy can have an important bearing on the optimal design of a competition institution. However, it was agreed that the treatment of objectives should be oriented primarily towards a discussion of how they relate, or may relate, to the design of competition enforcement institutions within the broader government. Accordingly, the note on objectives does not fully explore the pros and cons of specific objectives that may be included in the competition law and policy objectives of one or more jurisdictions, although this topic is discussed to a degree. The principal focus of the two notes is to provide an analysis and synthesis of the responses to two questionnaires that were sent in advance to GFC meeting participants in respect of the respective topics. In addition, the objectives note incorporates some of the additional information provided by participants in their separate written contributions prepared for circulation at the GFC meeting. The most important themes emerging from the questionnaires and written contributions on Objectives were i) among OECD countries, there appears to be a shift away from use of competition laws to promote what might be characterised as broad public interest objectives; ii) there does not appear to be a strong correlation between competition law and policy objectives (broadly defined) and the design of the competition agency; iii) greater independence also was the step/measure most frequently identified as being likely to lead to better promotion/attainment of the articulated objectives. Turning to the note on Optimal Design, the key themes emerging from the responses to the questionnaire were i) there is a broad variety of different models and approaches to the design of competition agencies within the overall apparatus of government (broadly defined); ii) despite the institutional variety, there is a core of common tasks assigned to most competition agencies. Specifically, these agencies normally investigate, take at least certain kinds of decisions on competition cases and engage in competition advocacy; iii) around half the respondents reported having medium influence on their governments, legislative bodies, and other bodies of public administration through advocacy initiatives.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7>
Chapter 15. Cultural Products in the International Trading System ¤ The debate about the linkages between globalization and cultural diversity is not limited to the well-known dispute about the effects of international economic integration in promoting or reducing the plurality of cultural expressions, but extends to the possible role of cultural diversity in explaining comparative advantage and trade or in generating market access barriers that can reduce the intensity of bilateral economic interactions. This chapter presents an overview of recent theoretical contributions, aimed at better understanding the linkages between trade and culture. The main common insight is that imperfect competition and network externalities in consumption define a framework in which international economic integration can lead to market concentration and cultural homogenization. In some cases, and under specific qualifications, some forms of ‘efficient protection’ of the cultural sector may increase economic welfare. In other cases, free trade remains the optimal policy, even if it entails some costs in terms of cultural diversity. Heterogeneous cultural preferences may be considered among the exogenously defined determinants of market equilibrium. Alternatively, their evolution may be modeled as the endogenous result of market adjustment to trade liberalization. The normative sections of this chapter discuss from different perspectives the options faced by the international community to improve the governance of cultural policies. Although bilateral and regional preferential trade agreements are becoming more relevant, a comprehensive and consistent solution of the trade-and-culture controversy is needed at the multilateral level. The 2005 UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention on Cultural Diversity is an important achievement, but cannot solve this problem. A coherent and credible balance between the different positions can only be found by improving the World Trade Organization (WTO) regime. In the context of the digital revolution, the complementarity between the two global public goods of cultural plurality and international economic integration, and their role in sustaining the progress of societies, is hopefully becoming more evident.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1>
Chapter 14 Storage and price stabilization ¤ Commodity storage models, developed first within agricultural economics in the tradition of Gustafson (1958) , are valuable in helping us understand how prices of storable commodity markets behave, and how they respond to policy interventions. They show that the policy-relevant dynamic effects of storage-increasing policies are quite different from comparative statics, and generally less favorable to consumers. They help us understand the implications of price controls, price supports, buffer stocks, speculative attack, and “convenience yield,” and have great potential for assessing various econometric methodologies used for studying market efficiency and bias, and supply response. However, more attention should be paid to appropriate commodity market interventions in times of rapid productivity change, and in extremely depressed markets such as those of the 1930s, that influenced the course of agricultural policy in the United States over the next half-century.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6>
Kluwer-EZUL-Test dataset (2) : Monte Carlo Simulations of Adsorbed Solutions in Heterogeneous Porous Materials ¤ We present results of a Monte Carlo simulation study of binary mixtures of ethane and methane in silica gel. The molecular model treats the adsorbent as a matrix of silica microspheres. The adsorption isotherms, adsorption selectivities and isosteric heats of adsorption have been determined for these systems. The results are compared with predictions from the ideal adsorbed solution (IAS) theory and with experiment. The heats of adsorption are accurately described by the IAS theory. The adsorption isotherms are accurately described by the IAS theory at low bulk pressure but the IAS theory overpredicts the density at high bulk pressure. This latter effect is opposite to that observed in bulk mixtures of this type where nonidealities generally lead to a density increase on mixing. The pressure dependence of the selectivity does not exhibit a maximum at low pressure. We discuss this effect in terms of the adsorbent microstructure.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000536-7>
Chapter 4. MAMS A Computable General Equilibrium Model for Developing Country Strategy Analysis ¤ This chapter presents MAMS (Maquette for MDG Simulations), a recursive-dynamic CGE model developed at the World Bank for analysis of medium- to long-run country strategies for low- and middle-income countries, including strategies aimed at improving MDG (Millennium Development Goals) outcomes. Compared to other CGE models, MAMS offers a unique combination of new and policy-relevant features, most importantly disaggregation of the government services by function, broad and integrated coverage of MDGs and endogenous links between education and the labor market. The chapter provides a detailed description of MAMS, the policy insights that it has generated, exemplified by a case study of Yemen and the lessons learned from developing and applying MAMS to a large number of countries.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210294-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224214-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065341-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6>
Chapter 10. Environmental Risk and Uncertainty ¤ Environmental risks may comprise the most important policy-related application of the economics of risk and uncertainty. Many biases in risk assessment and regulation, such as the conservatism bias in risk assessment and the stringent regulation of synthetic chemicals, reflect a form of ambiguity aversion. Nevertheless, there is evidence that people can learn from warnings and risk information, such as Toxics Release Inventory data, consistent with Bayesian models. The fundamental uncertainties with respect to environmental risks are coupled with irreversibilities, making sequential decisions and adaptive behavior desirable. Uncertainties over the benefits and costs of mitigating environmental risks pose challenges for any regulator, but insights drawn from the instrument choice literature can inform the design and implementation of welfare-maximizing environmental pollution control policies. The problem of mitigating climate change risks motivates a series of illustrations of how uncertainty affects policy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186957-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050133-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135592-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070864-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120934-5>

Chapter 26. Social Capital ¤ This chapter surveys research on social capital. We explore the concepts that motivate the social capital literature, efforts to formally model social capital using economic theory, the econometrics of social capital, and empirical studies of the role of social capital in various socioeconomic outcomes. While our focus is primarily on the place of social capital in economics, we do consider its broader social science context. We argue that while the social capital literature has produced many insights, a number of conceptual and statistical problems exist with the current use of social capital by social scientists. We propose some ways to strengthen the social capital literature.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3>
Retirement Behaviour in OECD Countries : Impact of Old-Age Pension Schemes and other Social Transfer Programmes ¤ This paper examines the impact of old-age pension systems and other social transfer programmes on the retirement decision of older males in OECD countries. For each of the 55-59, 60-64 and 65+ age groups, a new panel dataset of retirement incentives embedded in those schemes is constructed, focusing mainly on the implicit tax rate on continued work. These currently differ widely across OECD countries: they are high in most Continental European Countries, compared with Japan, Korea, English-speaking and Nordic countries. Simple cross-country correlations and panel data econometric estimates both show that implicit taxes on continued work have sizeable effects on the departure of older male workers from the labour force ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>

The wage gap due to firm size of 35% is comparable to the gender wage gap of 36% for men over women and greater than the wage gap of 14% for whites over black employees. The size-wage premium is larger for men and varies across industries. It is larger in the US than in other industrialized countries. Large firms demand a higher quality of labor defined by such observable characteristics as education, job tenure, and a higher fraction of full-time workers. Part 3 examines three behavioral explanations. (1) Productive employees are matched with able entrepreneurs to minimize the sum of wages and monitoring costs. (2) Big firms pay efficiency wages to deter shirking. (3) Big firms adopt a discretionary wage policy to share rents, or in Slichter's words, “Wages over a considerable range reflect managerial discretion. When management can easily afford to pay high wages, they tend to do so.” We advance a productivity hypothesis. A large organization sets a higher performance standard that raises labor productivity but has to be supported by a compensating wage difference. In the service industries, the pace of work depends on the customer arrival rate. The economies of massed reserves generates a positive wage-size profile. The capital/labor ratio is higher in bigger firms which also are early in adopting new technologies. Both forces raise the demand for skilled labor where skill and productivity are often unobservable traits. Production organized around teams calls for conformance to common work rules which result in paying rents to infra-marginal team members. The odds of survival are higher for big firms which enable them to “produce” more durable employees who are more productive because they get more training. Firm size is a function of external market forces, technology, managerial decisions, and luck. The surplus of revenues over labor costs per employee is positively related to firm size for three reasons, lower prices for non-labor inputs, possibly greater market power, or larger overhead costs to amortize the sunk costs for capital and firm -specific work force. Rent sharing cannot be dismissed as an explanation for the wage-size premium. Taxation and regulation can also affect the size distribution of firms. The organization of work and the selection of employees (whose productive traits are not always observable) are responsible for the positive relation between wages and employer size.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127364-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8>
Chapter 5. Contribution of Computable General Equilibrium Modeling to Policy Formulation in Developing Countries ¤ This chapter reviews the experience of computable general equilibrium (CGE) models from the perspective of how they have, or have not, influenced public policy in developing countries. The paper describes different classes of empirical models from small, stylized to large, multisectoral applied models; from static equilibrium models to dynamic, perfect-foresight models and identifies the characteristics of models best suited to address different policy problems in developing countries. The paper then discusses the different ways CGE models have been and are being used in policy formulation, the types of questions they have addressed, and the lessons learned from past experience. Finally, the paper suggests that, in light of the changing nature of policy making in developing countries, in the future CGE models should be used differently, moving from a purely technocratic exercise used by policy makers to providing an accessible empirical framework that can contribute to a widespread public debate.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210294-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065341-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224214-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6>
Chapter 21 Altruism, reciprocity and cooperation in the workplace ¤ This paper surveys economic models where cooperation arises in the workplace because individuals' utility functions involve a concern for others (altruism) or a desire to respond to like with like (reciprocity). It also discusses empirical evidence which bears on the relevance of these theories. The paper considers separately the feelings employees have for their employers or their supervisors, those that employees have for others that occupy similar positions as themselves and the feelings of supervisors towards their subordinates. Altruism appears to play a role in the last two settings while reciprocity seems useful to explain the way employees react to employer actions which the employees regard as unfair.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129281-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4302876-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057542-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184535-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197971-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133536-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020511-3>
Chapter 4 Economics of nature preservation ¤ This chapter develops some of the economic theory relevant to decisions about nature preservation. The theory is motivated by a discussion of current issues: the disposition of wilderness lands and the protection of endangered species. It discusses two key concepts: uncertainty and irreversibility. Uncertainty is pervasive economic life, of course. But more than the usual degree of uncertainty surrounds the potential future benefits from conserving ecosystems. Irreversibility is clearly central to thinking about endangered species or ecosystems because extinction or loss of wildlands is indeed irreversible. The chapter develops a model of decision-making under uncertainty and irreversibility. The model proves that the optimal use of a natural environment is more likely to be continued preservation where the passage of time brings information about potential future benefits of preservation than where it does not. A related result is that the fraction of the area optimally preserved is larger. Finally, it presents applications of the concepts and models developed for terrestrial ecosystems. It has relevance to hydrospheric and atmospheric environments as well.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075236-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014743-5>

Chapter 8. Combinatorial Auctions ¤ Many auctions involve the sale of heterogenous indivisible objects. Examples are wireless spectrum, delivery routes and airport time slots. Because of complementarities or substitution effects between the objects, bidders have preferences not just over individual items but over subsets of them. For this reason, economic efficiency is enhanced if bidders are allowed to bid on bundles or combinations of different assets. This chapter surveys the state of knowledge about combinatorial auctions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Environmental Law Developments in Nuclear Energy ¤ Climate change, the world’s unquenchable thirst for power and the geopolitical tensions and price instability associated with oil have combined to spark a renewed interest in nuclear energy. None of these factors would mean much if the nuclear industry had been plagued with significant safety concerns, but it has been 28 years since the Three Mile Island incident and 21 years since Chernobyl. In the interim, nuclear energy has provided a reliable source of base-load electricity to the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.1 As of July 2007, over three-quarters of the operating nuclear reactor units in the U.S. have renewed or are seeking renewal of their operating licences for extended periods of up to 20 years.2 There are 19 separate locations at existing plants in the south eastern and north eastern United States, as well as Texas, which are currently considering constructing new nuclear reactors...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068925-6>
Chapter 11. Technological change and the Environment ¤ Environmental policy discussions increasingly focus on issues related to technological change. This is partly because the environmental consequences of social activity are frequently affected by the rate and direction of technological change, and partly because environmental policy interventions can themselves create constraints and incentives that have significant effects on the path of technological progress. This chapter summarizes current thinking on technological change in the broader economics literature, surveys the growing economic literature on the interaction between technology and the environment, and explores the normative implications of these analyses. We begin with a brief overview of the economics of technological change, and then examine theory and empirical evidence on invention, innovation, and diffusion and the related literature on the effects of environmental policy on the creation of new, environmentally friendly technology. We conclude with suggestions for further research on technological change and the environment.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061619-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075236-7>
Chapter 18. General Purpose Technologies ¤ A general purpose technology or GPT is a term coined to describe a new method of producing and inventing that is important enough to have a protracted aggregate impact. Electricity and information technology (IT) probably are the two most important GPTs so far. We analyze how the U.S. economy reacted to them. We date the Electrification era from 1894 until 1930, and the IT era from 1971 until the present. While we document some differences between the two technologies, we follow David [In: Technology and Productivity: The Challenge for Economic Policy (1991) 315–347] and emphasize their similarities. Our main findings are: 1. Productivity growth in the two GPT eras tended to be lower than it was in other periods, with productivity slowdowns taking place at the start of the two eras and the IT era slowdown stronger than that seen during Electrification. 2. Both GPTs were widely adopted, but electricity’s adoption was faster and more uniform over sectors. 3. Both improved as they were adopted, but measured by its relative price decline, IT has shown a much faster improvement than Electricity did. 4. Both have spawned innovation, but here, too, IT dominates Electricity in terms of the number of patents and trademarks issued. 5. Both were accompanied by a rise in “creative destruction” and turbulence as measured by the entry and exit of firms, by mergers and takeovers, and by changing valuations on the stock exchange. In sum, Electrification spread faster than IT has been spreading, and it did so more evenly and broadly over sectors. Also, IT comprises a smaller fraction of the physical capital stock than electrified machinery did at its corresponding stage. On the other hand, IT seems to be technologically more dynamic; the ongoing spread of IT and its continuing precipitous price decline are reasons for optimism about productivity growth in the 21st century.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3>

R\(D and Productivity Growth : Panel Data Analysis of 16 OECD Countries ¤ This study investigates the long-term effects of various types of R\(D on multi-factor productivity growth, which are the spillover effects of R\(D activities. Econometric estimates are conducted on a panel of 16 OECD countries, over the period 1980-98. All results are averages over countries and time, and little can be said about country specificities. Major results are as follows: an increase of 1 per cent in business R\(D generates 0.13 per cent in productivity growth. The effect is larger in countries that are intensive in business R\(D, and in countries where the share of defence-related government funding is lower; a 1 per cent increase in foreign R\(D generates 0.46 per cent in productivity growth, and the effect is larger in countries intensive in business R\(D; 1 per cent more in public R\(D generates 0.17 per cent in productivity growth. The effect is larger in countries where the share of universities (as opposed to government labs) is higher, in countries where the share of defence R\(D is lower, and in countries which are intensive in business R\(D.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
Fostering Long-term Investment and Economic Growth Summary of a High-Level OECD Financial Roundtable ¤ As the OECD is celebrating its 50th anniversary, member countries are exiting from the biggest post-war financial and economic crisis and are trying to put their economies back onto strong, sustainable footing. While financial reforms should provide for a better, more sustainable balance between stability and growth, measures to strengthen the savings-investment channel should foster sustainable growth and development. These issues were explored at a High-Level OECD Financial Roundtable and are summarised in this article. Covered are the topics of financial reform to foster stability and long-term growth, the contribution of institutional investors to long-term growth, and creating a better environment for the financing of business innovation and green growth. With strained public sector finances, private capital needs to fill the funding gap for infrastructure and other long-term projects. Appropriate regulatory incentives to overcome short-termism, as well as risk-sharing arrangements e.g. via publicprivate partnerships, are needed in order to encourage market-based, long-term investment and risk capital financing. Better transparency, information and investor education can also play a role in enhancing long-term savings and investment.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Chapter 3 Alternative approaches to development economics ¤ This chapter presents a discussion on alternative approaches to development economics and focuses on the three major approaches that can be classified as neoclassical, Marxist, and structuralist-institutionalist. The chapter focuses on a few, highly selective, areas of enquiry with a brief, impressionistic, comparative assessment of some major contributions in each area. The chapter discusses five such distinct, but not entirely unrelated areas: (1) theory of the household; (2) institutions and resource allocation; (3) income distribution and growth; (4) trade and development; and (5) economic policy and the state. While these five involve some of the core issues of development economics and may represent a fair cross-section of some of the active disputes. Some of the neo-neoclassical models now fully recognize the crucial dependence of efficiency of resource allocation on asset ownership structures and property relations. Similarly, some of these non-Walrasian models have given up on market-clearing factor prices and explored the microeconomics of equilibria with involuntary unemployment and rationing. Similar bridge building between the alternative approaches has been attempted by rational-choice Marxists in tracing the micro foundations of class analysis in postulates of individual behavior and in general in using the techniques of game theory in understanding social interaction and historical change in situations of interest conflicts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213090-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7>
Chapter 20 The Economics of organ transplantation ¤ In the U.S. and Europe, a ban on a market in human organs has been in place since 1984. The system of organ procurement, therefore, relies on altruistic donation from stranger to stranger. The principle intellectual and policy issues surrounding organ procurement concern the question of whether, in banning the market to further ethical objectives, efficiency must inevitably be sacrificed. In the 1970s, Titmuss questioned whether a market could supply high quality blood in sufficient quantity, and this issue attracted the attention of some of the best minds in economics, such as Arrow and Solow. Since then, a large-scale industry relying on human tissue as a basic resource has emerged. In 2000, nearly 50 000 organs were transplanted. Remarkably, all of them were procured without providing financial incentives to suppliers. Despite the large number of donations, many more are needed. Today, more than 95 000 people are waiting for kidneys alone, and it is estimated that, in 2001, over 6000 Americans died waiting for an organ. Many believe that a market in organs would yield a greater supply and they hold the policy of banning an organ market responsible for the current tragic shortages. This chapter reviews the economic theory and evidence regarding market bans and considers them in the context of organ procurement.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020511-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133536-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197971-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4302876-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057542-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184535-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129281-9>

Chapter 28 Political economy of trade policy ¤ This chapter discusses the political economy of trade policy. In principle, a political-economy model of trade policy must have four elements. Much of the trade theory is devoted to analyzing the consequences of trade policy for individuals who derive their incomes from different factors of production or sectors. First, it must contain a description of individual preferences over the domain of policy choices available to policymakers. Given an underlying economic model of the HeckscherOhlin or RicardoViner type and the presumption that preferences for policy depend only on self-interest, individuals' policy rankings can be deuced on the basis of their factor endowments or sector-specific skills. Second, the model must contain a description of the way these individual preferences are aggregated and channeled, through pressure groups, political parties, or grass-roots movements, into political demands for a particular policy or another. This step involves a characterization of the modes of political organization, as well as of the forms that political influence takes. The chapter also reviews the choice among alternative trade policy instruments and elaborates the consequences of viewing trade policy from political-economy lenses.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1>

Chapter 6. Statistical Methods for Distributional Analysis ¤ This chapter discusses the formal and informal techniques that are commonly used to give quantitative answers in the field of distributional analysis. To this end, it covers subjects including inequality, poverty, and the modeling of income distributions. It also deals with parametric and nonparametric approaches and the way in which imperfections in data may be handled in practice.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7>
Chapter 42 Foundations of strategic equilibrium ¤ This chapter examines the conceptual foundations of the concept of strategic equilibrium and its various variants and refinements. The emphasis is very much on the underlying ideas rather than on any technical details. After an examination of some pre-equilibrium ideas, in particular the concept of rationalizability, the concept of strategic (or Nash) equilibrium is introduced. Various interpretations of this concept are discussed and a proof of the existence of such equilibria is sketched. Next, the concept of correlated equilibrium is introduced. This concept can be thought of as retaining the self-enforcing aspect of the idea of equilibrium while relaxing the independence assumption. Most of the remainder of the chapter is concerned with the ideas underlying the refinement of equilibrium: admissibility and iterated dominance; backward induction; forward induction; and ordinality and various invariances to changes in the player set. This leads to a consideration of the concept of strategic stability, a strong refinement satisfying these various ideas. Finally there is a brief examination of the epistemic approach to equilibrium and the relation between strategic equilibrium and correlated equilibrium.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8>

Chapter 48: Prompting Strategic Reasoning Increases Other-regarding Behavior ¤ The current cultural norms with regard to sharing, cooperation, trust, and punishment are the result of 23 million years of evolution and adaptation. During most of those 23 million years, humans lived in small interactive groups and developed behaviors and strategies to promote cooperation and social exchange within the group. Within such groups, humans were expected to share with one another and to cooperate to advance the group. This is clear in contemporary studies of extant hunter-gatherer societies. Today, experimental subjects bring many of the same behaviors and strategies to the laboratories. This results in far more cooperative and sharing behavior in first-time decisions than standard game theory would predict. Prompting not only does not help; it makes the results once again like what are observed in the random/divide treatment, the treatment that started so many psychologists and economists wondering about the standard economics rationality assumption.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Chapter 59 Land Use: Forest, Agriculture, and Biodiversity Competition ¤ Since at least the time of von Thünen's contributions to the subject, economists have been interested in explaining land use in the hinterlands. This interest has grown with increasing societal demands on remaining forested areas and concern for the nonmarket resources generated by such habitats. However, the situation is not nearly as dire as one might expect based on the more alarming pronouncements. Despite both economic and population growth, forest areas in much of the developed world have been increasing, not declining. Improvements in growing and processing technology, in combination with increased concern for forest resources, have enabled increases in productivity that have largely offset growth in demand. While the record has not been quite as good in the developing countries, productivity growth and a slowing in the rate of population increase are also reducing pressures on forests in poorer nations. While these trends are promising, concern remains with the decline in natural habitats, particularly in moist tropical forests, where biological diversity is most concentrated. Biologists and conservation advocates have advanced a number of arguments both that “biodiversity” is imperiled as forests are felled and that the values of the services generated by such systems justify their preservation. While often plausible, these arguments remain largely unproved. It seems unlikely that prospects for commercializing the products and services of forest ecosystems will prove sufficient to motivate their conservation on a large scale. Other instruments for conservation must, then, be employed if areas under intense pressure for conversion are to be preserved.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4704302-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5>
Chapter 13 Consumption-based asset pricing ¤ This chapter reviews the behavior of financial asset prices in relation to consumption. The chapter lists some important stylized facts that characterize U.S. data, and relates them to recent developments in equilibrium asset pricing theory. Data from other countries are examined to see which features of the U.S. experience apply more generally. The chapter argues that to make sense of asset market behavior one needs a model in which the market price of risk is high, time-varying, and correlated with the state of the economy. Models that have this feature, including models with habit-formation in utility, heterogeneous investors, and irrational expectations, are discussed. The main focus is on stock returns and short-term real interest rates, but bond returns are also considered. BEGIN END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269795-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4508395-2>
Chapter 7. International Prices and Exchange Rates ¤ We survey the recent empirical and theoretical developments in the literature on the relation between prices and exchange rates. After updating some of the major findings in the empirical literature, we present a simple framework to interpret this evidence. We review theoretical models that generate insensitivity of prices to exchange rate changes through variable markups, both under flexible prices and nominal rigidities, first in partial equilibrium and then in general equilibrium.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1>
Chapter 16. Optimal Monetary Policy in Open Economies ¤ This chapter studies optimal monetary stabilization policy in interdependent open economies, by proposing a unified analytical framework systematizing the existing literature. In the model, the combination of complete exchange-rate pass-through (producer currency pricing) and frictionless asset markets ensuring efficient risk sharing, results in a form of openeconomy divine coincidence: in line with the prescriptions in the baseline New-Keynesian setting, the optimal monetary policy under cooperation is characterized by exclusively inward-looking targeting rules in domestic output gaps and GDP-deflator inflation. The chapter then examines deviations from this benchmark, when cross-country strategic policy interactions, incomplete exchange-rate pass-through (local currency pricing) and asset market imperfections are accounted for. Namely, failure to internalize international monetary spillovers results in attempts to manipulate international relative prices to raise national welfare, causing inefficient real exchange rate fluctuations. Local currency pricing and incomplete asset markets (preventing efficient risk sharing) shift the focus of monetary stabilization to redressing domestic as well as external distortions: the targeting rules characterizing the optimal policy are not only in domestic output gaps and inflation, but also in misalignments in the terms of trade and real exchange rates, and cross-country demand imbalances.

Chapter 22 Differential games ¤ This chapter discusses differential games. In control theory, a certain evolutionary process (typically given by a time-dependent system of differential equations) depends on a control variable. A certain cost is associated with the control variable and with the corresponding evolutionary process. The goal is to choose the best controlthat is, the control for which the cost is minimized. A similar evolutionary process is used in differential games, but it depends on two (or more) controls. Each player is in charge of one of the controls. Each player wishes to minimize its own cost (the cost functions of the different players may be related). However, at each time t , a player must decide on its control without knowing what the other (usually opposing) players intend to do. The strategy of each player at time t depends only on whatever information the player was able to gain by observing the evolving process up to time t only.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8>

Chapter 26. Neoclassical Models in Macroeconomics ¤ This chapter develops a toolkit of neoclassical macroeconomic models, and applies these models to the US economy from 1929 to 2014. We first filter macroeconomic time series into business cycle and long-run components, and show that the long-run component is typically much larger than the business cycle component. We argue that this empirical feature is naturally addressed within neoclassical models with long-run changes in technologies and government policies. We construct two classes of models that we compare to raw data, and also to the filtered data: simple neoclassical models , which feature standard preferences and technologies, rational expectations, and a unique, Pareto optimal equilibrium, and extended neoclassical models , which build in government policies and market imperfections. We focus on models with multiple sources of technological change, and models with distortions arising from regulatory, labor, and fiscal policies. The models account for much of the relatively stable postwar US economy, and also for the Great Depression and World War II. The models presented in this chapter can be extended and applied more broadly to other settings. We close by identifying several avenues for future research in neoclassical macroeconomics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8>
Chapter 24 US Higher Education Finance ¤ We review basic facts about higher education finance in the United States and analytical, empirical and policy issues in that realm. Examining trends in higher education finance, we demonstrate growth in the share of revenues provided by government up to about 1980, with a steady decline thereafter. Student financial aid, a feature of growing importance, is awarded to students on the basis both of financial need and academic (and other) merit, with merit influencing not only total amounts of aid received but also the “quality” of aid packages, as indexed by the fraction of aid in the form of grants rather than loans or work. Although nearly two-thirds of American high school graduates now attend some form of post-secondary education, both whether and where they attend are importantly influenced by family background. Among students who score well on aptitude tests in high school, 95% of those from affluent family backgrounds attend college immediately following graduation, while only about 75% of those from low SES backgrounds do. High-income students are also more likely to attend private universities and colleges than are lower-income students, who are particularly likely to attend community colleges. Much more attention has been devoted to examining the demand for higher education than to explaining its supply. We review a number of topics on the supply side, including the state of evidence concerning the pricing and output levels of government financed and of nonprofit institutions as well as concerning the impact of government financial aid policies on institutional pricing and aid decisions. An important analytical and empirical challenge in studying higher education supply is the fact that institutional enrollment levels are regulated by selective admissions as well as by price.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2>
Chapter 65 Farm Size ¤ What patterns can be discerned in the distribution of farm sizes across countries and over time? How does the behavior of individual economic agents interact with the natural environment and general economic development to affect farm size? How has concerted human intervention, understood as national and supranational policy actions, altered these outcomes? We find that operated farm size rises with economic development, especially in the 20th century, with marked exceptions: large farms in Latin America and Southern Africa; small farms in parts of Northwest Europe; diminishing farm size in South Asia. Despite increased scale, in many advanced countries the family remains the main source of farm labor. Hired labor supervision costs tend to favor family farming as the equilibrium institution. Theory suggests that the family farm will typically become larger with economic development, but its efficiency advantage over the agroindustrial enterprise will decline. Sufficiently land-augmenting technical advances can upset the relationship between development and equilibrium scale, as in the Green Revolution. Concerted intervention can also cause departures from such equilibria. Colonial land grabs have led to inefficiently large farms, with market forces and land reform subsequently reducing average size after decolonization. Greater land rights have thereby raised the rural poor's income, status, and power, but farmland collectivizations, and much farm tenancy reform, have largely failed to achieve this goal. However, classic land reforms, and some decollectivizations, have proved more incentive-compatible and have distributed large land areas among many small family-managed units. Farm size is, in principle, also affected by net taxes on farm production (mostly negative in OECD, mostly positive in developing countries, though reduced), but such effects remain empirically elusive. Globalization and liberalization effects via relative prices aside have induced institutional changes that are not neutral with respect to farm size. These include supermarkets' increased role in the supply chain.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4704302-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2>
Chapter 6. Twentieth Century Growth ¤ This paper surveys the experience of economic growth in the 20th century with a focus on technological change at the frontier together with issues related to success and failure in catch-up growth. A detailed account of growth performance based on historical national accounts data is given and is accompanied by a review of growth accounting evidence on the sources of economic growth. The key features of our analysis of divergence in growth outcomes are an emphasis on the importance of “directed” technical change, of institutional quality, and of geography. We provide brief case studies of the experience of individual countries to illustrate these points.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3>
Chapter 14. Incomplete Information in Macroeconomics : Accommodating Frictions in Coordination ¤ This chapter studies how incomplete information helps accommodate frictions in coordination, leading to novel insights on the joint determination of expectations and macroeconomic outcomes. We review and synthesize recent work on global games, beauty contests, and their applications. We elaborate on the distinct effects of strategic uncertainty relative to fundamental uncertainty. We demonstrate the potential fragility of workhorse macroeconomic models to relaxations of common knowledge; the possibility of operationalizing the notions of “coordination failure” and “animal spirits” in a manner that unifies unique- and multiple-equilibrium models; and the ability of incomplete information to offer a parsimonious explanation of important empirical regularities. We provide a general treatment of these ideas, as well as specific applications in the context of business cycles, financial crises, and asset pricing.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Chapter 1 Contract Law ¤ This chapter surveys major issues arising in the economic analysis of contract law. It begins with an introductory discussion of scope and methodology, and then addresses four main topics that correspond to the major doctrinal divisions of the law of contracts. These divisions include freedom of contract (the extent of private power to create binding obligations), formation of contracts (the procedural mechanics of exchange, and the rules that govern pre-contractual behavior), contract interpretation (the consequences that follow when agreements are ambiguous or incomplete), and enforcement of contractual obligations (the choice between private and public enforcement, and the legal remedies that follow from breach of contract). In each of these sections, we provide an economic analysis of relevant legal rules and institutions, and of the connections between legal arrangements and corresponding topics in microeconomic theory, such as welfare economics and the theory of contracts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135492-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066510-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117663-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048737-4>
Chapter 14 The economics of fisheries management ¤ Fishery resources, unlike minerals and fossil fuels, are renewable in the sense that they are capable of growth. Unlike forests and most other renewable resources, fishery resources are difficult to manage effectively because they are, with few exceptions, a common property. Most fish, particularly finfish, are very mobile and are not readily observable except upon capture. Consequently, it becomes very difficult or very costly to assign rights of exclusive use to individuals or small groups. The importance of the economics of fisheries management has grown substantially over the past years as a consequence of the United Nations Third Conference on the Law of the Sea. The Conference has brought about a near revolution in the management of world fisheries. Fishery resources constitute common-property resources with the consequence that fisheries are subject to a market failure. A major development in fisheries economics is the shift away from static to dynamic or capital-theoretic analysis. Dynamic considerations, in turn, lead naturally to a consideration of problems arising from uncertainty.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075236-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014743-5>

Chapter 20 Human behavior and the efficiency of the financial system ¤ Recent literature in empirical finance is surveyed in its relation to underlying behavioral principles, principles which come primarily from psychology, sociology, and anthropology. The behavioral principles discussed are: prospect theory, regret and cognitive dissonance, anchoring, mental compartments, overconfidence, over- and under-reaction, representativeness heuristic, the disjunction effect, gambling behavior and speculation, perceived irrelevance of history, magical thinking, quasi-magical thinking, attention anomalies, the availability heuristic, culture and social contagion, and global culture.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Chapter 10 Wealth inequality, wealth constraints and economic performance ¤ Where such behaviors as risk-taking and hard work are not subject to complete contracts, some distributions of assets (for instance the widespread use of tenancy) may preclude efficient contractual arrangements. In particular, the distribution of wealth may affect: (a) residual claimancy over income streams; (b) exit options in bargaining situations; (c) the relative capacities of actors to exploit common resources; (d) the capacity to punish those who deviate from cooperative solutions; and (e) the pattern of both risk aversion and the subjective cost of capital in the population.

Chapter 6. Health Econometrics ¤ A decade ago, Newhouse (1987) assessed the balance of trade between imports from the econometrics literature into health economics, and exports from health economics to a wider audience. While it is undoubtedly true that imports of concepts and techniques still dominate the balance, the literature reviewed in this chapter shows that the range and volume of applied econometric work in health economics has increased dramatically over the past ten years. Examples of good practice in health econometrics make extensive use of tests for misspecification and explicit model selection criteria. Robust and distribution-free estimators are of increasing importance, and the chapter gives examples of nonparametric, and semiparametrische estimators applied to sample selection, simultaneous equations, count data, and survival models. Published replications of empirical results remain relatively rare. One way in which this deficit may be remedied is through the appearance of more systematic reviews of econometric studies. The use of experimental data remains an exception and most applied studies continue to rely on observational data from secondary sources. However applied work in health economics is likely to be influenced by the debate concerning the use of data from social experiments. The chapter illustrates the impressive diversity of applied econometric work over the past decade. Most of the studies reviewed here use individual level data and this has led to the use of a wide range of nonlinear models, including qualitative and limited dependent variables, along with count, survival and frontier models. Because of the widespread use of observational data, particular attention has gone into dealing with problems of self-selection and heterogeneity bias. This is likely to continue in the future, with the emphasis on robust estimators applied to longitudinal and other complex datasets.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Chapter 2 Growth with Quality-Improving Innovations: An Integrated Framework ¤ In this chapter we argue that the endogenous growth model with quality-improving innovations provides a framework for analyzing the determinants of long-run growth and convergence that is versatile, simple and empirically useful. Versatile, as the same framework can be used to analyze how growth interacts with development and cross-country convergence and divergence, how it interacts with industrial organization and in particular market structure, and how it interacts with organizations and institutional change. Simple, since all these aspects can be analyzed using the same elementary model. Empirically useful, as the framework generates a whole range of new microeconomic and macroeconomic predictions while it addresses empirical criticisms raised by other endogenous growth models in the literature.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059252-2>
Chapter 3. Medical Care Prices and Output ¤ We review in considerable detail the conceptual and measurement issues that underlie construction of medical care price indexes in the US , focusing in particular on the medical care consumer price indexes (MCPIs) and medical-related producer price indexes (MPPIs). We outline salient features of the medical care marketplace, including the impacts of insurance, moral hazard, principal-agent relationships, technological progress and organizational changes. Since observed data are unlikely to correspond with efficient outcomes, we discuss implications of the failure of transactions data in this market to reveal reliable marginal valuations, and the consequent need to augment traditional transactions data with information based on cost-effectiveness and outcomes studies. We describe procedures currently used by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics in constructing MCPIs and MPPIs, including recent revisions, and then consider alternative notions of medical care output pricing that involve the price or cost of an episode of treatment, rather than prices of fixed bundles of inputs. We outline features of a proposed new experimental price index a medical care expenditure price index that is more suitable for evaluation and analyses of medical care cost changes, than are the current MCPIs and MPPIs. We discuss the ways in which medical care transactions enter national economic accounts, including inter-industry flows and national health accounts, as well as aggregate economy implications of possible mismeasurement of prices in the medical sector. We conclude by suggesting future research and measurement issues that are most likely to be fruitful.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Chapter 25. The Staying Power of Staggered Wage and Price Setting Models in Macroeconomics ¤ After many years, many critiques, and many variations, the staggered wage and price setting model is still the most common method of incorporating nominal rigidities into empirical macroeconomic models used for policy analysis. The aim of this chapter is to examine and reassess the staggered wage and price setting model. The chapter updates and expands on my chapter in the 1999 Handbook of Macroeconomics which reviewed key papers that had already spawned a vast literature. It is meant to be both a survey and user-friendly exposition organized around a simple “canonical” model. It provides a guide to the recent explosion of microeconomic empirical research on wage and price setting, examines central controversies, and reassesses from a longer perspective the advantages and disadvantages of the model as it has been applied in practice. An important question for future research is whether staggered price and wage setting will continue to be the model of choice or whether it needs to be replaced by a new paradigm.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8>
Performance of similitude methods for structural vibration analyses of rectangular plates ¤ Engineers often use similitude analyses to design small scale models for experimental tests or to design size ranges of mechanical structures such as drive technology systems. This paper is concerned with similitude analysis methods for vibration analyses of rectangular plates. If their geometry is scaled by different factors (distorted similitude), the scaling laws approximate the actual vibration responses with a certain accuracy only. This paper introduces a performance measure that reliably assesses how well the scaling laws approximate the actual vibration responses of rectangular plates. This measure, the so-called Mahalanobis distance, applies in a-posteriori analyses, where the vibration responses obtained from the scaling laws are compared to the actual ones. Numerical and experimental investigations on vibrating rectangular plates validate that the Mahalanobis distance is suitable to assess the performance of similitude analyses. The Mahalanobis distance can be linked to the geometrical properties of the rectangular plates in order to define a maximum permissible distortion of the geometry. Scaling laws approximate the vibration responses of the rectangular plates sufficiently well up to this maximum permissible distortion. Furthermore, the performance of two different state-of-the-art similitude analysis methods is compared. Both similitude analysis methods are found to perform well up to the maximum permissible amount of geometrical distortion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054947-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4511937-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038168-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032317-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132811-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058812-9>
Chapter 14. Modeling a Heterogeneous World ¤ This chapter takes as its starting point the idea that any model of the economy must have heterogeneous agents. Such agents together form a complex adaptive system where the aggregate behavior emerges from the interaction between the individuals. Such systems do not lend themselves to being modeled analytically. We use three examples to illustrate how one is obliged to use agent based models to capture the dynamics of such systems. For our first example, the Marseille fish market, we show how to move beyond the most simplistic theoretical model we have to move to a computational approach. We then look at the effect of a potential shock to a financial market, and finally at the heterogeneity of the financial system. The last two expose the futility of trying to develop a complete analytical model. We argue for specific models for specific cases. This is a more engineering approach but perhaps a more realistic one.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Competition and regulation in retail banking ¤ The Competition Committee debated retail banking in October 2006. Competition can improve the functioning of the retail banking sector without harming prudential regulation. The efficient functioning of the sector is important for economic performance. The sector is considered special primarily because of externalities related to potential “contagion” effects stemming from (i) the withdrawal-upondemand characteristic of some bank deposits and (ii) the role banks play in the payment system, and (iii) the fact that banks are important for the funding of consumers and SMEs. Customer mobility and choice is essential to simulate retail-banking competition. An important observation is that the degree of customer mobility is low and the longevity of customer-bank relationships is long. Financial information sharing platforms should therefore be promoted and, where limited by privacy laws, privacy laws should be modified in a way that maintains the goal of protecting privacy while also allowing consumers to receive the benefits of credit ratings.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9>
Chapter 32 Sunspot equilibria in sequential markets models ¤ Equilibrium with rational expectations is a central construct of modern economic theory. The chapter studies surveys, which are primarily aimed at assessing the properties and relevance of this construct in a general equilibrium framework; in particular, they are related to the issue of multiplicity of rational expectation equilibria. The viewpoint discussed in the chapter is associated with the so-called concept of sunspot equilibrium. It focuses on aspects of general equilibrium with rational expectations that have been given a central role in recent literature. It presents the problem of sunspot equilibria in the broader perspective. It also discusses an example of sunspot equilibrium and a simple economic systemnamely, a sequential economy with infinite horizon and time independent structure. Furthermore, this economy is one step forward looking and has no predetermined variable.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066472-7>
Chapter 11 Patent licensing ¤ This chapter focuses on the patent licensing. Game-theoretic methods have made it possible to address questions with regard to patent licensing. The common modes of patent licensing are a royalty, possibly nonuniform, per unit of output produced with the patented technology, a fixed fee that is independent of the quantity produced with the patented technology, or a combination of a fixed fee plus a royalty. The patentee can choose which of these modes of licensing to employ and how to implement them. The interaction between a patentee and licensees is described in terms of a three-stage noncooperative game. The licensees are assumed to be members of an n -firm oligopoly, producing an identical product. Entry into the industry is assumed to be unprofitable, i.e., the cost of entry exceeds the profits an entrant could realize. The firms in the oligopoly can compete either through quantities or prices. The industry's aggregate output and product price is determined by the Cournot equilibrium in the former case and the Bertrnd equilibrium in the latter. In the simplest version of the game, the oligopoly faces a linear demand function for its product. The patented invention reduces the cost of production, i.e., it is a process innovation. Licensing of a product innovation can also be analyzed in this game-theoretic framework. The chapter discusses the licensing by means of an auction, fixed fee licensing of a cost-reducing innovation and then of a new product, licensing by means of a royalty, fixed fee plus royalty licensing, optimal licensing mechanism or the chutzpah mechanism, and patent licensing in the presence of Bertrand competition.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Chapter 28 The Macroeconomics of Agriculture ¤ The existence of linkages between the agricultural sector and the rest of the economy points to the specificity of that sector and justifies why we can conceive of a macroeconomics of agriculture. The primary sector is characterized by product homogeneity, a pre-condition for the absence of imperfect competition. Also, agricultural prices are subject to seasonal variations. Moreover, farming activities are often carried on by large fractions of the population and are very dispersed on the territory. Finally, production of commodities relies on an irreproducible factor of production — land — whose availability is finite and whose productivity cannot be individually infinitely increased. Given these features, we expect macroeconomic policy to affect the agricultural sector, and agricultural prices and markets to affect other sectors and the macroeconomy in a specific way (as opposed to the other sectors). In this essay, the transmission mechanisms and linkages — by which changes in one sector alter economic performance in other sectors — are described under the sub-headings of backward linkages — from agriculture to the rest of the economy — forward linkages — from the macroeconomy and the international economy to agriculture — and second-round feed-back interdependent linkages. Models and studies attempting to quantify the linkages are then discussed in terms of theoretical constructs, structural econometric models, computable general-equilibrium models, and time-series models.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4>
Chapter 36 Savings, credit and insurance ¤ This chapter surveys and synthesizes the issues for developing economies. Two features of developing economies are particularly germane to the link between savings and insurance. The absence of markets for trading in risks is particularly noticeable. Many insurance possibilities are not traded in developed countries. The fraction of the population is typically dependent on agricultural income for their livelihood. The chapter studies the life-cycle/permanent income models that incorporate precautionary savings and liquidity constraints. The huge diversity in insurance and credit arrangements in developing countries is quite bewildering. Understanding the limits and potential of these is an important step towards a better appreciation of the factors that influence financial development. The approach suggested in the chapter is two-pronged – the gains from trade exploited by a particular institutional structure can be enquired about along with the way by which trade is sustained.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213090-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7>
Chapter 1. Decomposition Methods in Economics ¤ This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of decomposition methods that have been developed since the seminal work of Oaxaca and Blinder in the early 1970s. These methods are used to decompose the difference in a distributional statistic between two groups, or its change over time, into various explanatory factors. While the original work of Oaxaca and Blinder considered the case of the mean, our main focus is on other distributional statistics besides the mean, such as quantiles, the Gini coefficient or the variance. We discuss the assumptions required for identifying the different elements of the decomposition, as well as various estimation methods proposed in the literature. We also illustrate how these methods work in practice by discussing existing applications and working through a set of empirical examples throughout the paper.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9>
Chapter 34 Equity in health care finance and delivery ¤ The paper surveys the economics literature on equity in health care financing and delivery. The focus is, for the most part, on empirical work, especially that involving international and temporal comparisons. There is, however, some discussion of the concept and definition of equity. The empirical sections cover the literature on equity in health care financing (progressivity and horizontal equity of health care financing arrangements), equity in health care delivery (horizontal equity in the sense of treating persons in equal need similarly), and equality of health.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Chapter 33 A Primer on Foreclosure ¤ This chapter analyzes the private rationale and the social costs and benefits of market foreclosure, here defined as a firm's restriction of output in one market through the use of market power in another market. The chapter first focuses on vertical foreclosure (in which full access to a bottleneck input is denied to competitors) and provides an overview of the theory of access to an essential facility in an unregulated environment. It considers a wide array of contexts: possibility of bypass of the bottleneck facility, upstream vs downstream location of this facility, and various exclusionary activities such as vertical integration and exclusive dealing. It identifies a number of robust conclusions as to the social and private costs and benefits of foreclosure. The chapter then turns to horizontal foreclosure , where the monopoly good is sold directly to the end-users, and analyzes recent theories of anti-competitive bundling aimed at reducing competition in the adjacent markets or at protecting the monopoly market. Finally, the chapter tackles exclusive customer contracts and discusses potential efficiency defenses for exclusionary behavior. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133311-1>
Employees’ Vulnerability — The Challenge When Introducing New Technologies in Local Authorities ¤ While it is well-known that the implementation of new technologies requires appropriate technical capabilities, research has for a long time almost neglected the behavioural capabilities of organisation’s employees to adopt innovative technologies. Employees have to trust new technologies and thus, to be willing to become vulnerable when they adopting it as they have to cope with something they are not familiar with. This paper highlights the challenge for local authorities to cope with employees’ unwillingness to become vulnerable when it comes to implementing new technologies in local authorities. Based on semi-structured interviews that have been conducted under the umbrella of the European project SUITS, we were able to identify two indicators for the unwillingness of employees to adopt new technologies - attribution of negative motives and incongruence of values. Furthermore, we show best practise examples how to overcome the negative consequences of the unwillingness to become vulnerable and to be able to implement new technologies successfully in the long-run. Our practical implications in the end are derived by the experiences when introducing new technologies in the partner cities of the SUITS project.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039785-3>
Chapter 11 Natural Kantian or ZOO ECONOMICUS? Evolutionary theories of selfishness and altruism among men and beasts ¤ This paper addresses the question of whether our evolutionary history suggests that humans are likely to be individually selected selfish maximizers or group selected altruists. It surveys models from the literature of evolutionary biology in which groups are formed and dissolved and where the reproductive success of individuals is determined by their payoffs in a game played within groups. We show that if groups are formed randomly and reproductive success of group founders is determined by a multi-person prisoners' dilemma game, then selfish behavior will prevail over maximization of group payoffs. However, interesting models can be found for which group selection sustains cooperative behavior. Forces that support cooperative behavior include assortative matching in groups, group longevity, and punishment-based group norms.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4302876-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057542-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020511-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184535-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129281-9>
Chapter 6. Licensure: Exploring the Value of this Gateway to the Teacher Workforce ¤ Empirical research bears out the conventional wisdom that teacher quality is the key schooling resource influencing student achievement, so it is not surprising that policy makers attempt to influence it by regulating admission into the teacher labor market through licensure systems. Most of these systems require teachers to graduate from an approved teacher training institution and pass one or more tests, the notion being that these preservice requirements ensure a basic level of teacher competence. A criticism, however, is that these requirements dissuade talented individuals from attempting to become teachers, thereby lowering the quality of teachers in the workforce. It is shocking how little we actually know about key aspects of the teacher licensure–teacher quality equation. The great majority of the empirical literature on licensure speaks to one crucial link in the teacher licensure–teacher quality equation: the correlation between licensure requirements and student achievement. In general this literature suggests only weak links between specific licensure requirements and student achievement. Far less evidence exists on the impact of licensure on the pool of potential teachers, or who school district hiring officials would employ in the face of fewer requirements, or the absence of requirements altogether.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2>
Structural indicators : A critical review ¤ This article reviews and assesses in terms of availability, reliability and transparency, existing policy and outcome indicators that have been found to be linked both directly and indirectly to economic growth and living standards. Indicators aiming at capturing the political and social situation of countries, as well as governance-related issues, are examined (e.g., political system, political stability, corruption, crime and violence). Topics also include product and labour markets, infrastructure, trade, financial indicators and composite indices of reform.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>

Chapter 18. Bubbles, Financial Crises, and Systemic Risk ¤ This chapter surveys the literature on bubbles, financial crises, and systemic risk. The first part of the chapter provides a brief historical account of bubbles and financial crisis. The second part of the chapter gives a structured overview of the literature on financial bubbles. The third part of the chapter discusses the literatures on financial crises and systemic risk, with particular emphasis on amplification and propagation mechanisms during financial crises, and the measurement of systemic risk. Finally, we point toward some questions for future research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269795-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4508395-2>
Chapter 8 The role of natural resources in trade models ¤ Much of the modern long-run theory of international trade derives from what has come to be called the 2 x 2 or HeckscherOhlin model of production; and the rest of the theory derives from straightforward extensions of that model achieved by the accommodation of additional factors and products and by the addition of more-or-less durable produced intermediate goods. In all versions of the model, final goods are produced, directly or indirectly, by two primary or nonproduced factors of production, a unit of any factor yielding its services in a given and steady flow forever. There is need of a theory of international trade that accommodates both exhaustible natural resources and the traditional Ricardian primary factors and of which the standard HeckscherOhlin theory appears as a special case. The new theory can be expected to differ in important respects from the old, for in a context of exhaustible resources there are no nontrivial steady states, only transitions. The assumption that resources can be extracted without cost simplifies the calculations and enables concentrating on the implications of exhaustibility as such. The canonical case in which the available processes of extraction display constant returns to scale and are independent of the amount already extracted, costs of extraction make no difference to qualitative conclusions. The chapter also recognizes the historical fact that the extraction and processing of some exhaustible resources have sometimes been under the control of cartels.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0>

Chapter 14 Empirical Studies of Demand for the Performing Arts ¤ While audience and participation surveys, as well as econometric demand studies, generally confirm that performing arts audiences are relatively elite, there are surprises. Education (despite conflicting causal interpretations) is a stronger determinant than income, but that evidence is more reliable from survey results than from econometric estimation, and arts training is often distinguished from formal education. The arts as luxury goods can only be confirmed by those rare studies controlling for the value of time, and price elasticities are often higher than expected, especially when more disaggregated data are examined. Price inelastic demand is more likely the result of low pricing strategies of non-profit arts managements rather than any inherent result of an acquired taste for the arts, while cross-price elasticity evidence is relatively weak, even within the performing arts. Arts demand cannot adequately be estimated without also considering “life-style” variables, or non-standard socioeconomic factors such as sexual orientation, gender and socialization processes, and even the role of age has been notably complex. Quality of arts performance or organization seems important, but the econometric results are mixed. Habit formation must be distinguished from learning-by-consuming and rational addiction in examining dynamic determinants. Sociologists, psychologists, and marketing specialists, as well as economists, have contributed to this literature, which remains unusually enigmatic despite about forty years of increasingly sophisticated analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4>
Harmonisation of Nuclear Liability in the European Union : Challenges, Options and Limits ¤ Recent discussions have identified gaps in the existing nuclear liability regimes in a more focused fashion. The so-called nuclear renaissance or nuclear new build1 cannot be limited to the mere multiplication of nuclear power plants. It must take place together with the creation and strengthening of legal frameworks for nuclear safety and radiation protection, security and safeguards. As the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD/NEA) highlights in its Nuclear Energy Outlook 2008...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068925-6>
Media Mergers: Summary of the Discussion ¤ The Chairman made three general opening points: market definition is an important issue in most jurisdictions, and seems to be fairly similar across countries; behavioural remedies are heavily used and are highly case specific; and competition authorities are wrestling with the relationship between competition and pluralism issues but generally try to avoid it. Some competition authorities believe that promoting competition in itself promotes pluralism so nothing else is needed from competition authorities. Some contributions note, however, that competition authorities are criticised for ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>

Competition and Regulation Issues in the Pharmaceutical Industry ¤ The pharmaceutical sector is a dynamic, research-intensive industry that is fundamentally influenced by a web of regulations designed to a) promote research and innovation in the design and production of drugs, b) protect consumers from potentially harmful effects of drugs, and c) to control public and private expenditure on drugs. These objectives are sometimes in conflict and may require a balancing of the interests of producers and consumers. Since most consumers have some form of health insurance, their incentives to control their purchasers of pharmaceuticals or to purchase from the most efficient pharmacist are limited. Health insurers seek to control pharmaceutial expenditure through various policies such as co-payments, lists of approved drugs and maximum reimbursement levels for different drugs. If reimbursement levels for pharmacists are set at a national or regional level, incentives for entry by new pharmacists are excessive in certain locations, typically leading to restrictions on the establishment of new pharmacies. Wellthought out reform of this industry has the potential to reduce pharmaceutical expenditures while maintaining the quality of the drugs consumed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Sovereign wealth & pension fund issues ¤ Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) are pools of assets owned and managed directly or indirectly by governments to achieve national objectives. These funds have raised concerns about: i) financial stability; ii) corporate governance and iii) political interference and protectionism. At the same time governments have formed other large pools of capital to finance public pension systems, i.e. Public Pension Reserve Funds (PPRFs). SWFs are set up to diversify and improve the return on foreign exchange reserves or commodity revenue, and to shield the domestic economy from fluctuations in commodity prices. PPRFs are set up to contribute to financing pay-as-you-go pension plans. The total of SWF pools is estimated at around USD 2.6 trillion in 2006/7, and is getting bigger rapidly, owing to current exchange rate policies and oil prices. The total amount for PPRFs is even larger, around USD 4.4 trillion in 2006/7, if the US Trust Fund is included (USD 2.2 trillion if excluded). SWFs and PPRFs share some characteristics, hence give rise to similar concerns. However, their objectives, investment strategies, sources of funding and transparency requirements differ. There is concern about strategic and political objectives of SWFs, and their impact on exchange rates and asset prices. But SWFs also provide mechanisms for breaking up concentrations of portfolios that increase risk. Enhancing governance and transparency of SWFs is important, but such considerations have to be weighed against commercial objectives.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6>
Chapter 8 Forecasting economic variables with nonlinear models ¤ The topic of this chapter is forecasting with nonlinear models. First, a number of well-known nonlinear models are introduced and their properties discussed. These include the smooth transition regression model, the switching regression model whose univariate counterpart is called threshold autoregressive model, the Markov-switching or hidden Markov regression model, the artificial neural network model, and a couple of other models. Many of these nonlinear models nest a linear model. For this reason, it is advisable to test linearity before estimating the nonlinear model one thinks will fit the data. A number of linearity tests are discussed. These form a part of model specification: the remaining steps of nonlinear model building are parameter estimation and evaluation that are also briefly considered. There are two possibilities of generating forecasts from nonlinear models. Sometimes it is possible to use analytical formulas as in linear models. In many other cases, however, forecasts more than one periods ahead have to be generated numerically. Methods for doing that are presented and compared. The accuracy of point forecasts can be compared using various criteria and statistical tests. Some of these tests have the property that they are not applicable when one of the two models under comparison nests the other one. Tests that have been developed in order to work in this situation are described. The chapter also contains a simulation study showing how, in some situations, forecasts from a correctly specified nonlinear model may be inferior to ones from a certain linear model. There exist relatively large studies in which the forecasting performance of nonlinear models is compared with that of linear models using actual macroeconomic series. Main features of some such studies are briefly presented and lessons from them described. In general, no dominant nonlinear (or linear) model has emerged.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047390-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Chapter 14 Economic impact of international migration and the economic performance of migrants ¤ This chapter describes the numbers and characteristics of international migrants to selected developed countries, explores some of the economic factors motivating international migration, examines the impact of immigration on the receiving country's labor markets, discusses the extent to which immigrants assimilate to the receiving country's labor market, and presents several studies of immigrants' effects on the social welfare system. The chapter focuses on the experiences of Australia, Canada, and the United States. Increased immigration has a modest impact on the distribution of income, and most of these adverse affects fall on immigrants themselves. These effects may be small as a result of the effects that immigrants have on local labor demand or of changes in natives' migration patterns. First, there is evidence of a significant amount of immigrant assimilation in the US data, although there is less evidence of it in Australian, Canadian, and European data. This result implies that the adverse effects that US immigrants have on wages lessen as they spend more time in the United States. Second, this assimilation does not mean that immigrants' wages approach those of the median native.

Chapter 13 On the microeconomic theory of investment under uncertainty ¤ This chapter describes investment theory as the study of the individual behavior of households and economic organizations in the allocation of their resources to the available investment opportunities. For the purposes of investment theory, economic organizations are characterized as being members of one of two groups: business firms that hold as assets the physical means of production for the economy and finance their production decisions by issuing financial claims or securities and financial intermediaries that hold financial claims as assets and finance these assets by issuing securities. Individuals or households are assumed to invest primarily in securities and, therefore, invest only indirectly in physical assets. The markets in which these securities are traded are called the capital markets. The natural starting point for the development of investment theory is to derive the investment behavior of individuals. It is traditional in economic theory to take the existence of households and their tastes as exogenous to the theory. However, this tradition does not extend to economic organizations and institutions. They are regarded as existing primarily because of the functions they serve instead of functioning primarily because they exist.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066472-7>
The International Systems of Radiological Protection : Key Structures and Current Challenges ¤ Since the realisation, at the beginning of the 1900s, that exposure to ionising radiation could cause detrimental health effects, experts in the field have worked together to establish a scientific basis for describing radiation-related risks, to recommend practical principles for protection against radiation-related risks and to develop international standards and national regulations in this area.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068925-6>
Competition Law and Policy in Mexico, 2004 ¤ This report on Mexico’s competition law and policy, which was the foundation for a peer review examination in early 2004, is a follow-up to a 1998 OECD assessment. Mexico’s competition commission (“CFC”) has become a mature and well-respected agency; however, the degree of general support for competition policy in Mexico remains an open question. The CFC has encountered problems in the courts, and its resources have declined despite an increasing workload. The 2004 report and peer review recommended a number of changes in operations and law to make enforcement and advocacy more effective. In 2006, Mexico revised its basic competition law to incorporate many of these recommendations, such as strengthening investigative powers for onsite inspections, increasing sanctions (including the possibility of orders to divest assets in case of serious, repeat violations) and providing for Senate approval of appointments to the CFC. In response to court rulings that some applications of the previous law were unconstitutional, the revised law now specifies when practices such as predatory pricing, exclusive dealing, cross subsidization and price discrimination would be violations. The merger notification system has been simplified. The amendments have also strengthened the CFC’s roles and powers of advocacy and policy advice in dealing with legislation, regulatory proceedings and other levels of government.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7>
Chapter 42 Power, distortions, revolt and reform in agricultural land relations ¤ This chapter inquires into the efficiency and equity consequences of rental and sales markets for agricultural land in the developing world. Most of the work on the relationship between farm size and productivity strongly suggests that farms that rely mostly on family labor have higher productivity levels than large farms operated primarily with hired labor. An examination of the historical evolution of land rights shows the reason for the deviations: rights over land and the concentration of ownership observed in most developing countries at the end of World War II are outgrowths of power relationships. The chapter describes the variety of land relations and their consequences for the efficiency of agricultural production. The chapter also we examines how these power relations emerged and what legal means enabled relatively few landowners to accumulate and hold on to large landholdings. The methodological epilogue examines how various strands of economic theory have contributed, or failed to contribute, to the explanation of variations in policies, distortions and land relations over space and time.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213090-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7>
Chapter 69. Governance and Development ¤ In this chapter, we discuss whether or not governance is an important source of variation in development experiences. We draw four main conclusions. First, governance is best thought of a subset of institutions and as such emphasis on governance is consistent with much recent academic work. Nevertheless, governance is a quite vague rubric which is difficult to unbundle. Second, the governance of a society is the outcome of a political process and as such is closely related to the literature on the political economy of development. Third, improving governance necessitates understanding the nature of the entire political equilibrium. Finally, an important research frontier is understanding the forces that create or impeded endogenous changes in governance. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213090-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7>
Chapter 11 Capital market theory and the pricing of financial securities ¤ The core of financial economic theory is the study of individual behavior of households in the intertemporal allocation of their resources in an environment of uncertainty and of the role of economic organizations in facilitating these allocations. The intersection between this specialized branch of microeconomics and macroeconomic monetary theory is most apparent in the theory of capital markets. The complexity of the interaction of time and uncertainty provides intrinsic excitement to study the subject. The mathematics of capital market theory contains some of the most interesting applications of probability and optimization theory. This chapter discusses necessary conditions for static financial equilibrium that are used to determine restrictions on equilibrium security prices. The combined consumptionportfolio selection problem is formulated in a more realistic and more complex dynamic setting. The chapter examines intertemporal equilibrium pricing of securities and discusses the conditions under which allocations in the continuous trading model are Pareto efficient.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Chapter 1 Introduction ¤ This chapter defines defense economics and indicates how it differs from other subfields of economics. The nature and topics of defense economics are presented. A brief history of the field is also reviewed. The current importance of defense economics in the post-cold war era is discussed.

Chapter 16. Wholesale Banking and Bank Runs in Macroeconomic Modeling of Financial Crises ¤ There has been considerable progress in developing macroeconomic models of banking crises. However, most of this literature focuses on the retail sector where banks obtain deposits from households. In fact, the recent financial crisis that triggered the Great Recession featured a disruption of wholesale funding markets, where banks lend to one another. Accordingly, to understand the financial crisis as well as to draw policy implications, it is essential to capture the role of wholesale banking. The objective of this chapter is to characterize a model that can be seen as a natural extension of the existing literature, but in which the analysis is focused on wholesale funding markets. The model accounts for both the buildup and collapse of wholesale banking and also sketches out the transmission of the crises to the real sector. We also draw out the implications of possible instability in the wholesale banking sector for lender-of-last resort policy as well as for macroprudential policy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Chapter 11. Dynamic Overlapping Generations Computable General Equilibrium Models and the Analysis of Tax Policy: The DiamondZodrow Model ¤ We examine the use of dynamic overlapping generations (OLG) computable general equilibrium (CGE) models to analyze the economic effects of tax reforms, using as a paradigm our DiamondZodrow (DZ) model. Such models are especially well-suited to analyzing both the short-run transitional and the long-run dynamic macroeconomic effects of tax reforms, including the time paths of reform-induced changes in labor supply, saving, and investment, as well as the redistributional effects of reforms across and within generations. We begin with a brief overview of the use of OLG-CGE models in the analysis of tax reform, focusing on the seminal contribution of Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987). We then consider a variety of extensions of this work, including the multiple-good, multiple-individual model constructed by Fullerton and Rogers (1993), as well as the addition of open economy factors, human capital accumulation and uncertainty. Many of the applications of these models have focused on changes in capital income taxation or, more generally, the replacement of an income tax system that fully taxes capital income with a consumption-based tax system that exempts normal returns to capital, and we focus on such reforms. We describe in considerable detail the DZ model, which is characterized by 55 cohorts, 12 income groups within each cohort, four production sectors and explicit calculation of reform-induced changes in asset values. We conclude by describing numerous applications of the DZ model, ranging from incremental reforms of the income tax system including deficit-financed tax cuts to fundamental tax reforms that involve replacing the income tax with a consumption-based tax system, to the implementation of a value-added tax imposed in addition to the income tax as a means of reducing current deficits and the national debt in the US.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065341-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224214-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210294-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5>
Chapter 2 Liquidity ¤ Liquidity and the closely related notion of flexibility are intuitively understood by economists and others. There is the ease of conversion of an asset at a particular date into something else by means of a market transaction. It is connected with the idea that liquidity increases the set of choices at some date so that the liquidity of, for instance, a portfolio depends on the date specified for conversion. This chapter explores the way purely search-theoretic approach that leads to a liquidity ordering of assets by considering differences in the expected time to sell an asset under an optimum search policy is integrated into present equilibrium theories of an economy. Liquidity considerations are used to account for missing markets, which are now known to have more serious consequences for received theory than once thought. Search theory suggests imperfect markets and so has considerable implications for competitive theory. Ideally, it is combined with the theory of bargaining, which, in turn, leads to the modification of search theory itself.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2>
Chapter 3. Economic foundations of conjoint analysis ¤ Observational data on either individual or aggregate demand is often not sufficient to identify consumer preferences due to lack of variation in prices or product features, or the desire to study product features not currently available. Choice-based conjoint analysis offers a solution to this problem by creating hypothetical product choices via experimental design and collecting demand data using survey methods. Choice-based conjoint designs can apply to a pure discrete choice model of demand in which consumers only purchase one unit from a set of products or to more general settings (termed “volumetric” conjoint analysis) in which consumers have the opportunity to purchase more than one product and to consume continuously variable quantities. This chapter provides the economic foundations for choice-based conjoint analysis along with efficient statistical methods for estimation and prediction of demand. We review the requirements that formal economic and statistical analyses impose on the design of conjoint surveys as well as the analysis of the conjoint survey data. A number of variations on conjoint analysis which appear in the literature do not conform to these requirements and, therefore, may provide erroneous inferences and predictions. We provide an example where both demand data and conjoint survey data are available for the same consumers and provide some conclusions regarding what aspects of preference estimation are consistent between actual marketplace data and conjoint survey data. All models and procedures in this chapter are available as R packages.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037589-4>
Chapter 39 Non-standard analysis with applications to economics ¤ This chapter presents an introduction to nonstandard analysis and surveys its applications in mathematical economics. Nonstandard analysis is a mathematical technique, which has been widely used in diverse areas in pure and applied mathematics, including probability theory, mathematical physics, and functional analysis. It is used to formalize most areas of modern mathematics, including real and complex analysis, measure theory, probability theory, functional analysis, and point set topology; algebra is less amenable to nonstandard treatments, but even there significant applications have been found. The primary goal is to provide a careful development of nonstandard methodology in sufficient detail to allow using it in diverse areas in mathematical economics. This requires a careful study of the nonstandard treatment of real analysis, measure theory, and topological spaces. To accommodate this extended treatment of methodology the survey of work to date using nonstandard methods in mathematical economics is briefly reviewed in the chapter.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066472-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Chapter 58 Some other economic applications of the value ¤ Selected applications of the NTU Shapley value to settings other than that of general equilibrium in perfect competition. Three models are considered: Taxation and Redistribution, Public Goods, and Fixed Prices.

Chapter 1. Axiomatic Foundations of Expected Utility and Subjective Probability ¤ This chapter provides a critical review of the theories of decision making under risk and under uncertainty and the notion of choice-based subjective probabilities.

OECD Guidelines on Pension Fund Asset Management ¤ The OECD Guidelines on Pension Fund Asset Management set out a basic framework for the regulation of pension fund investment. The Guidelines start with the basic premise that the regulatory framework should take into account the retirement income objective of a pension fund. Two other essential aspects of the regulatory framework are the prudent person standard and the statement of investment policy. Regulations may also include quantitative limits, but only as long as they are consistent with and promote the prudential principles of security, profitability and liquidity pursuant to which assets should be invested. These Guidelines were developed by the Working Party on Private Pensions and the Insurance and Private Pensions Committee and were adopted by the OECD Council on 26 January 2006. They complement the "Recommendation of the Council on Core Principles of Occupational Pension Regulation", adopted by the OECD Council in July 2004.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3>
Design Guidelines for the Simulation of the Usage Context "Station" in VR Environment. ¤ Virtual environments are best suited for developing new information concepts for public transport. The paper deals with this possibility and examines immersion and presence for the two end devices CAVE and HMD. As an example a virtual system with dynamic and interactive elements is examined. The paper shows the relevant guidelines that a virtual environment has to fulfill in order to perform a meaningful test. For a realistic virtual environment, the travel chain and the individual elements in stations were examined in advance. Thus, a virtual model was created which contained real elements such as sound, avatars, information points, trains and ticket machines. The test persons were thus able to fully immerse themselves in the station.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4039785-3>
Chapter 26 Moral hazard ¤ This chapter discusses moral hazard. The principalagent relationship embodies a special form of moral hazard, which can be called one-sided, but moral hazard can also be many-sided. The paradigmatic model of many-sided moral hazard is the partnership in which there are many agents but no principal. The output of the partnership depends jointly on the actions of the partners and on the stochastic environment; each partner observes only the output (and his or her own action) but not the actions of the other partners or the environment. This engenders a free-rider problem. As in the case of principalagent relationships, a partnership, too, may last many periods. The chapter presents the principalagent model formally and describes some salient features of optimal principalagent contracts when the relationship lasts a single period. In a large class of cases, equilibrium in the one-period game is Pareto-inefficient. This is a well-known problem in providing risk-averse agent insurance while simultaneously giving the agent the incentives to take, from the principal's perspective, appropriate actions. The chapter also discusses other properties of static contracts such as monotonicity of the agent's compensation in observed profits.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8>
Chapter 32 Power and stability in politics ¤ This chapter discusses power and stability in politics and describes the applications of cooperative game theory to political science. The focus of the chapter is on the idea of power. The use of the Shapley and Banzhaf values for simple games to measure the power of political actors in voting situations, with a number of illustrative applications, is presented in the chapter. A voting situation can be modeled as a cooperative game in characteristic function form in which the value 1 is assigned to any coalition which can pass a bill and 0 to any coalition that cannot. The resulting game is known as a simple game. The coalitions that can pass bills are called winning coalitions, and the game is completely determined by its set of winning coalitions. If politics is the shaping of power, political actors might act to increase their power, and the rational choice assumption that they do so might have some explanatory efficacy in political dynamics. The chapter describes three possible situations of this type. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8>
Regulation, industry structure and performance in the electricity supply industry ¤ This article seeks to assess the impact of liberalisation and privatisation on performance in the generation segment of the electricity supply industry. Regulatory indicators for a panel of 19 OECD countries over a 10 year time period were constructed to examine the influence of regulatory reform on efficiency and price, and to assess the relative efficacy of different reform strategies. The presence of data with both cross-country and time-series dimensions allows separate identification of country specific and regulatory effects. The primary findings are that while changes in legal rules may be slow to translate into changes in conduct, unbundling of generation, private ownership, expanded access to transmission networks, and the introduction of electricity markets impact various aspects of performance in a statistically significant way.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2>
Review essay : Want not, waste not: the environmental impact of two generations of WMD proliferation and the implications for Asia ¤ Over the past fifty years the development and testing of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) have caused tremendous environmental, health and social damage to various parts of the planet. Six books dealing with various aspects of WMD are reviewed here, with the goal of broader conclusions about the relationships between political systems, culture, and environment. The requirements of local culture have strongly influenced decisions to acquire WMD, and the manners in which these weapons have been developed, tested and used. The Former Soviet Union is highlighted, since in that closed society WMD development and testing have been especially devastating. States considering WMD must be made aware of the true costs, and non-proliferation thinking must therefore include deep sensitivity not only to political decision-making, but local culture. Suggestions are offered about how an ``anthropology of WMD'' might contribute to non-proliferation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4077575-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048737-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128665-0>
Chapter 52 Economic history and game theory ¤ This paper surveys the small, yet growing, literature that uses game theory for economic history analysis. It elaborates on the promise and challenge of applying game theory to economic history and presents the approaches taken in conducting such an application. Most of the essay, however, is devoted to studies in economic history that use game theory as their main analytical framework. Studies are presented in a way that highlights the range of potential topics in economic history that can be and have been enriched by a game-theoretical analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8>
Chapter 25 Government debt ¤ This chapter surveys the literature on the macroeconomic effects of government debt. It begins by discussing the data on debt and deficits, including the historical time series, measurement issues, and projections of future fiscal policy. The chapter then presents the conventional theory of government debt, which emphasizes aggregate demand in the short run and crowding out in the long run. It next examines the theoretical and empirical debate over the theory of debt neutrality called Ricardian equivalence. Finally, the chapter considers various normative perspectives about how the government should use its ability to borrow. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Chapter 25 Positive second-best theory: A brief survey of the theory of Ramsey pricing ¤ This chapter surveys issues in positive second-best theory, specifically the theory of the optimal pricing of goods produced by public firms that is, firms whose objective is the maximization of social welfare. It is assumed that these firms, characteristically, display increasing returns to scale. In these situations, first-best optima may require lump-sum taxes and subsidies. In view of the size of the public sector in most industrialized countries, it is difficult to imagine that public activities can be financed without distortionary effects elsewhere in the economy. The chapter assumes perfect possibilities for lump-sum income transfers to focus on the efficiency aspect of optimal pricing. If lump-sum redistribution is impossible, deviations from marginal costs for prices under public control may be motivated by distributional considerations that is, the government may want to use its excise tax power to improve the income distribution. The chapter provides general formulation that forms a basis for special cases that are analyzed in more detail subsequently. It also discusses the joint decision for the optimal supply of public goods and the pricing problem. Finally, it analyzes some issues in predation and Ramsey pricing in a dynamic context.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066472-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Chapter 21. Quantitative Models of Sovereign Debt Crises ¤ This chapter is on quantitative models of sovereign debt crises in emerging economies. We interpret debt crises broadly to cover all of the major problems a country can experience while trying to issue new debt, including default, sharp increases in the spread and failed auctions. We examine the spreads on sovereign debt of 20 emerging market economies since 1993 and document the extent to which fluctuations in spreads are driven by country-specific fundamentals, common latent factors and observed global factors. Our findings motivate quantitative models of debt and default with the following features: (i) trend stationary or stochastic growth, (ii) risk averse competitive lenders, (iii) a strategic repayment/borrowing decision, (iv) multiperiod debt, (v) a default penalty that includes both a reputation loss and a physical output loss, and (vi) rollover defaults. For the quantitative evaluation of the model, we focus on Mexico and carefully discuss the successes and weaknesses of various versions of the model.

Substantive Criteria Used for the Assessment of Mergers ¤ To decide if a merger should be blocked, conditioned or approved, three basic types of substantive test are employed: i) a dominance test (will the merger create or strengthen a dominant position?); ii) an SLC test (will the merger produce a substantial lessening of competition?); or iii) a public interest test (will the merger have a negative effect on the public interest?), This third test is not a...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9>
Chapter 102 The Becker–DeGroot–Marschak Mechanism is not Generally Incentive-Compatible in Practice ¤ Experimentalists have been so sure of the incentive compatibility of this mechanism in practice that they often explicitly inform their subjects that it is in the respondents' interest to report their true reservation prices, or words to that effect. However, as is reported here, it turns out that behavior is not fully determined by these incentives alone and that, contrary to the incentives provided, the choice of upper bound of the buyout price range tends to inﬂuence the seller prices that subjects state. Thus, studies which have used upper bounds clearly exceeding what real buyers could consider paying may have produced biased estimates of seller reservation prices.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2>
Technology and Communication : Innovation Waves against the Background of Egypt's Foreign Relations ¤ What effect do spatial mobility and migrations have on the diffusion of knowledge? In this volume, papers dealing with the topic have been collected from various culture-historical and theoretical disciplines. Chronologically they range from non-literate cultures to an insight into contemporary research on economic innovation. The interdisciplinary contributions reveal in different ways the relationships between spatial mobility and the transfer of knowledge, thus allowing the phenomenon to be structured in both historical and non-literate ages.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076600-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033596-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001480-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027089-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066559-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165992-2>
Chapter 31. The Economics and Econometrics of Active Labor Market Programs ¤ Policy makers view public sector-sponsored employment and training programs and other active labor market policies as tools for integrating the unemployed and economically disadvantaged into the work force. Few public sector programs have received such intensive scrutiny, and been subjected to so many different evaluation strategies. This chapter examines the impacts of active labor market policies, such as job training, job search assistance, and job subsidies, and the methods used to evaluate their effectiveness. Previous evaluations of policies in OECD countries indicate that these programs usually have at best a modest impact on participants’ labor market prospects. But at the same time, they also indicate that there is considerable heterogeneity in the impact of these programs. For some groups, a compelling case can be made that these policies generate high rates of return, while for other groups these policies have had no impact and may have been harmful. Our discussion of the methods used to evaluate these policies has more general interest. We believe that the same issues arise generally in the social sciences and are no easier to address elsewhere. As a result, a major focus of this chapter is on the methodological lessons learned from evaluating these programs. One of the most important of these lessons is that there is no inherent method of choice for conducting program evaluations. The choice between experimental and non-experimental methods or among alternative econometric estimators should be guided by the underlying economic models, the available data, and the questions being addressed. Too much emphasis has been placed on formulating alternative econometric methods for correcting for selection bias and too little given to the quality of the underlying data. Although it is expensive, obtaining better data is the only way to solve the evaluation problem in a convincing way. However, better data are not synonymous with social experiments. 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9>

Chapter 19. Forecasting Binary Outcomes ¤ Binary events are involved in many economic decision problems. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in diverse disciplines in developing models for forecasting binary outcomes. We distinguish between two types of forecasts for binary events that are generally obtained as the output of regression models: probability forecasts and point forecasts. We summarize specification, estimation, and evaluation of binary response models for the purpose of forecasting in a unified framework that is characterized by the joint distribution of forecasts and actuals, and a general loss function. Analysis of both the skill and the value of probability and point forecasts can be carried out within this framework. Parametric, semi-parametric, non-parametric, and Bayesian approaches are covered. The emphasis is on the basic intuitions underlying each methodology, abstracting away from the mathematical details. Binary events are involved in many economic decision problems.

Chapter 30 Culture in Urban and Regional Development ¤ This chapter critically assesses, from an economic viewpoint, the role of the arts and culture in urban and regional development and growth. This includes the analysis of short run spending impacts, and longer term effects on location quality and creativity. In addition, the specific possibilities for using arts and cultural activities as a focal point in strategies for urban revitalization are discussed including the role of tourism, the non-market demand for arts and culture as an element in local willingness to support urban and regional development policies, questions of sustainability, etc. The reverse influence of regional economic development on the demand for and supply of culture in the region is analyzed and the location of arts and cultural industries is discussed highlighting the role of agglomeration of cultural industries.

Chapter 13 Culture and Economic Development ¤ This chapter begins by noting that culture as an element in economic development in the Third World has been largely neglected in traditional development economics, most writers either seeing culture as an obstacle to development or ignoring it altogether. Recently a shift in thinking has occurred whereby culture is now more widely seen as being more central to the development process, especially where a human-centered rather than a goods-centered view of development is taken. A particular aspect of culture that has been seen as important has been cultural diversity; it is argued that the beneficial aspects of diversity can only be realized when they are seen within a global ethical framework. The chapter goes on to consider the destructive and constructive role of conflict in bringing about social change, and discusses the pervasive effects of globalization on the economies and cultures of the world, arguing that international integration can lead to national disintegration. Next the chapter looks at the role of tourism as a significant economic and cultural force in developing countries. Finally the essay concludes with some recommendations for policy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4>
Chapter 27 Market Design Using Agent-Based Models ¤ This chapter explores the state of the emerging practice of designing markets by the use of agent-based modeling, with special reference to electricity markets and computerized (on-line) markets, perhaps including real-life electronic agents as well as human traders. The paper first reviews the use of evolutionary and agent-based techniques of analyzing market behaviors and market mechanisms, and economic models of learning, comparing genetic algorithms with reinforcement learning. Ideal design would be direct optimization of an objective function, but in practice the complexity of markets and traders' behavior prevents this, except in special circumstances. Instead, iterative analysis, subject to design criteria trade-offs, using autonomous self-interested agents, mimics the bottom-up evolution of historical market mechanisms by trial and error. The chapter highlights ten papers that exemplify recent progress in agent-based evolutionary analysis and design of markets in silico, using electricity markets and on-line double auctions as illustrations. A monopoly sealed-bid auction is examined in the tenth paper, and a new auction mechanism is evolved and analyzed. The chapter concludes that, as modeling the learning and behavior of traders improves, and as the software and hardware available for modeling and analysis improves, the techniques will provide ever greater insights into improving the designs of existing markets, and facilitating the design of new markets.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011152-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Chapter 34 The Making of Cultural Policy: A European Perspective ¤ BEGIN No good comparable data on sizes of cultural sectors of the countries of Europe exist. Still, local and national governments of Europe spend substantial resources on culture and cultural sectors contribute significantly to employment and national income. After briefly describing special features of cultural goods and clarifying some misconceptions about the value of culture, valid and invalid arguments for subsidizing culture are discussed. Although it is easy to justify government support for preservation of heritage, this is more difficult for the performing arts. Due to changing technologies and advent of E-culture classic public-good arguments for government intervention in broadcasting and other cultural activities become less relevant. Different institutions lead to different cultural landscapes. Theories of delegation suggest delegating the judgement on artistic qualities and execution of cultural policy to an independent Arts Fund, with the Minister of Culture concentrating on formulating a mission for cultural policy and making sure it is implemented properly. Insights from the theories of local public goods and federalism are applied to the making of cultural policy in Europe. Different approaches to international cultural policy in Europe are discussed. The overview concludes with lessons for the making of cultural policy in Europe. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1>
Ghana: Agriculture is Becoming a Business ¤ Ghana’s agricultural sector has two faces. On the one hand, Ghana continues to face food security problems due to stagnating productivity in the food crop sector and undeveloped internal food markets. On the other hand, horticultural exports have been increasing and recent investments in cocoa and pineapple processing can been seen as signs of an emerging modern agricultural sector. The horticultural sector currently receives a lot of attention from donors and the Ghanaian government. The examination of several large donor projects in this sector reveals that donors are increasingly taking a value chain approach and trying to link smallholder farmers to exporters via outgrower schemes. Donors are also making an effort to connect their projects with other ongoing interventions. However, donor approaches vary according to donor preferences, and multi-donor programmes would probably be a better solution. While the current focus of donors and the Ghanaian government in the horticultural sector is welcome, it bears the risk of leaving the north of Ghana, where food crop production and poverty are concentrated, further behind. Food crops should receive more attention not only to resolve Ghana’s food security problem but also to take advantage of growing demand from Ghana’s middle-income class, which provides the opportunity for developing a local food industry.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1>
Introduction to the Series ¤ This chapter is an introduction to the series of the book Handbook Of Experimental Economics Results. Each Handbook provides self-contained surveys of the current state of a branch of economics in the form of chapters prepared by leading specialists on various aspects of this branch of economics. These surveys summarize not only received results but also newer developments, from recent journal articles and discussion papers. Some original material is also included, but the main goal is to provide comprehensive and accessible surveys.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1>
Methods of usability testing for users with cognitive impairments ¤ One challenge of the user-centered development of accessible information systems is the conduction of cognitively impaired persons in usability tests. The paper gathers existing guidelines for the application of usability testing with cognitively impaired people and shows empirical values for modified usability tests based on a case study. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of on site and remote usability testing are presented in a comparative study. Especially in the context of COVID-19, remote testing has gained in relevance in the present time.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005541-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125909-9>
Chapter 82 Partners versus Strangers: Random Rematching in Public Goods Experiments ¤ Simply repeating the game with the same set of subjects may change the nature of equilibrium, since incomplete information about types can lead to reputation effects of the sort described in this chapter. A common way to deal with this has been to rematch subjects randomly into groups for each iteration of the game, hence forming a repeated single-shot design and avoiding the repeated-game effects. This chapter tested this question by comparing a set of subjects who played infinitely repeated games with another set who played in a repeated single-shot. Players in the repeated game were called Partners, while those in the repeated single-shot game were called Strangers. The discussion of Partners versus Strangers thus far has been predicated on the assumption that the incentives of individuals are consistent with money-maximization in the experiment.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1>
Chapter 15. The Market for Technology ¤ This chapter reviews the growing literature on the “market for technology,” a broad term that denotes trade in technology disembodied from physical goods. The market for technology flourished during the nineteenth century in the United States. After several decades of relative decline, the market for technology has once again grown considerably in recent years, although the growth is uneven across sectors and across countries. Thus far, the literature has paid most attention to the supply of technology, and on the efficiency of market transactions in technology. A key contribution has been that the decision of firms to license depends on whether the revenues from licensing are higher than the rent-dissipation effect produced by increased competition in the licensor’s product markets. The literature has featured several factors that condition the tradeoff between licensing revenue and rent dissipation. For instance, general-purpose technologies enable the potential licensors to sell technology in product markets distant from the product operations of the licensors, and thus are more likely to be licensed. Another stream of research has focused on the factors, such as intellectual property protection, that condition the efficiency of licensing contracts. The study of the demand for external technology is less developed, and is an open area for future research. Another exciting area for future research is the relationship between the product market and the market for technology, of which a special but important case is the division of labor between technology specialists such as biotech firms, and their customers downstream, in this instance, pharmaceutical firms. The area in the most urgent need of attention is research on the consequences of the market of technology, on the rate and direction of inventive activity, and on productivity growth. This will also require a deeper understanding of the microfoundations of the market for technology. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059252-2>
Chapter 14. Optimal Monetary Stabilization Policy ¤ This chapter reviews the theory of optimal monetary stabilization policy in New Keynesian models, with particular emphasis on developments since the treatment of this topic in Woodford (2003). The primary emphasis of the chapter is on methods of analysis that are useful in this area, rather than on final conclusions about the ideal conduct of policy (that are obviously model-dependent, and hence dependent on the stand that one might take on many issues that remain controversial), and on general themes that have been found to be important under a range of possible model specifications. 1 1 Practical lessons of the modern literature on monetary stabilization policy are developed in more detail in Chapter 15 by Taylor and Williams (2010) and Chapter 22 by Svensson (2010) in this Handbook . With regard to methodology, some of the central themes of this review will be the application of the method of Ramsey policy analysis to the problem of the optimal conduct of monetary policy, and the connection that can be established between utility maximization and linear-quadratic policy problems of the sort often considered in the central banking literature. With regard to the structure of a desirable decision framework for monetary policy deliberations, some of the central themes will be the importance of commitment for a superior stabilization outcome, and more generally, the importance of advance signals about the future conduct of policy, the advantages of history-dependent policies over purely forward-looking approaches, and the usefulness of a target criterion as a way of characterizing a central bank's policy commitment.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Chapter 19. Economic and Social Impacts of the Media ¤ In this survey, we review the literature on the impact of exposure to the media. We cast a wide net and cover media impacts on education, family choices, labor and migration decisions, environmental choices, health, crime, public economics, attitudes, consumption and savings, and development economics. We stress five themes. First, the demand for entertainment plays a key role, with the economic impacts emerging largely as by-products. Second, to understand the media effects, one cannot just focus on the direct effect of exposure but one needs to take into account the crowding out of alternative activities (substitution effect). Third, the sources of identification play a critical role in determining what is known: credible estimates of short- and long-run effects are available for some topics and some media but not for others. Fourth, most of the evidence on social and economic impacts is for exposure to the entertainment media such as television, as opposed to the printed press. Fifth, for the policy impacts, both the substitution effect of media exposure and the demand for entertainment play important roles. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129410-5>
Chapter 20 Price Signaling and “Cheap Talk” in Laboratory Posted Offer Markets ¤ This chapter focuses on identifying the marginal impact of price signaling, holding all other environmental and institutional factors constant. Although price signaling often increases transaction prices, this increase is very often temporary. Equilibrium behavior may be unaffected by non-binding price signaling in many environments. Price increases due to price signaling are more likely when sellers compete in multiple markets. Conspiracies are more successful when a subset of sellers forego short term gains by repeatedly offering supercompetitive prices. The market impact of price signaling depends on the signaling language available to sellers. Very restrictive language (e.g., one price proposal by one seller per period) does not have a lasting impact on prices. By contrast, multiple-round structured signaling in which many sellers per period can propose price changes with specific responses required of other sellers can generate persistently higher prices compared to free form price signaling.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1>
Chapter 25. Neighborhood Effects And Housing ¤ This chapter focuses on neighborhood effects in housing markets. Households in effect choose neighborhood effects, or more generally social interactions, via their location decisions, which renders them endogenous. Across several classes of models that it examines, it emphasizes how we may detect empirically the presence of neighborhood effects when they may be priced by housing markets and be capitalized into housing values and rents. The chapter focuses on models that are empirically relevant and help identify neighborhood effects, and discusses actual empirical findings. The first class of models examined involves models of choice over discrete sets of individual dwelling units that allow for a multidimensional bundle of characteristics. These models extend the Berry-Levisohn-Pakes characteristics-based approach and allow for endogenous contextual effects. The chapter develops in detail a specific application that also endogenizes contextual effects at a low level of dimensionality. The chapter examines neighborhood choice, with endogenous and contextual neighborhood effects, and housing demand (with housing being measured as a scalar) as joint decisions. This approach utilizes individual and neighborhood-level data at several levels of aggregation. The chapter next examines neighborhood effects within the canonical AlonsoMillsMuth urban model with a well-defined spatial structure. Finally, the chapter reviews hierarchical models of neighborhood location in the presence of social interactions. These models describe communities in terms of a low-dimensional vector of attributes that are aggregated into a public good whose consumption is nonrival. Such approaches are designed to utilize community-level data, along with information on the community-specific distributions of various sociodemographicsociodemographic characteristics of individuals.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066514-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132883-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120990-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027266-7>
Chapter 1 Business cycle fluctuations in us macroeconomic time series ¤ This chapter examines the empirical relationship in the postwar United States between the aggregate business cycle and various aspects of the macroeconomy, such as production, interest rates, prices, productivity, sectoral employment, investment, income, and consumption. This is done by examining the strength of the relationship between the aggregate cycle and the cyclical components of individual time series, whether individual series lead or lag the cycle, and whether individual series are useful in predicting aggregate fluctuations. The chapter also reviews some additional empirical regularities in the US economy, including the Phillips curve and some long-run relationships, in particular long run money demand, long run properties of interest rates and the yield curve, and the long run properties of the shares in output of consumption, investment and government spending.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8>
Chapter 8. Post-1970 Trends in Within-Country Inequality and Poverty : Rich and Middle-Income Countries ¤ Like the other chapters in this volume of the Handbook of Income Distribution (and its predecessor), the aim of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive review of a particular area of research. We examine the literature on post-1970 trends in poverty and income inequality, up to 2010 or 2011 in most countries. We provide measures of the levels and trends in each of these areas, as well as an integrated discussion of empirical choices made in the measurement of poverty, overall income inequality, and inequality among those with top incomes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7>
Chapter 9 Spatial interaction, transportation, and interregional commodity flow models ¤ This chapter presents an overview of spatial interaction, transportation, and interregional commodity flow models. Spatial interaction and transportation models are used to facilitate the explanation and prediction of patterns of human and economic interaction over geographic space. Theoretical methods for studying these phenomena have been modified considerably during the past 30 years to provide operational assistance to transportation planners and, more recently, regional economists. The chapter explores the developments made in the ongoing evolution of models describing spatial interaction, transportation, and the flow of commodities among different regions. It also provides some brief historical excerpts from the formative years and examines various modern theories and formulations that have been proposed for modeling spatial interactions assuming that transportation costs are fixed. The chapter demonstrates the way a broad range of hypotheses may be reconciled within a single unifying framework. It presents alternative formulations for analyzing route choice on a transportation network where the costs are flow-dependent and deals with interregional commodity flow models in which the prices and service characteristics are, respectively, fixed and variable.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9>

Chapter 29 International rules and institutions for trade policy ¤ This chapter describes the basic structure of international trade agreements as they exist in practice, explores theoretically the normative consequences of actual and alternative trade agreements, and offers some theoretically-based explanation for the structure of trade agreements. International trade agreements codify attempts by countries to mutually restrain the degree of trade intervention from what might otherwise obtain. Generally, they include three basic elements: substantive obligations; permissible exceptions to those obligations; and enforcement mechanisms. Through the provisions of a trade agreement countries, therefore, typically agree to mutually restrain both their baseline levels of trade intervention and their use of special protection, with the effectiveness of these restraints determined ultimately by the strength of the enforcement mechanisms in place. The chapter describes some of the major themes that characterize the behavior of trade intervention in their presence and discusses why and in what circumstances countries might wish to enter into international trade agreements. It also reviews the literature related to the collection of rules and institutions that define an international trade agreement and explains the issues of enforcement, along with the process of multilateral and bilateral liberalization.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1>
The Influence of Policies on Trade and Foreign Direct Investment ¤ This paper assesses the importance of border and non-border policies for global economic integration. The focus is on four widely-advocated policies: removing explicit restrictions to trade and FDI; promoting domestic competition; improving the adaptability of labour markets; and ensuring adequate levels of infrastructure capital. The analysis covers FDI and trade in both goods and services, thus aiming to account for the most important channels of globalisation and dealing with most modes of cross-border services supply. The results highlight that, despite extensive liberalisation over the past two decades, there is scope for further reducing policy barriers to integration of OECD markets. Remaining barriers have a significant impact on bilateral trade and FDI, with anticompetitive domestic regulations and restrictive labour market arrangements estimated to curb integration as much as explicit trade and FDI restrictions. Simulating the removal of such barriers suggests that the quantitative effects of further liberalisation of trade, FDI and domestic product and labour markets on global integration could be substantial...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2>
Chapter 5 Defining Cultural and Artistic Goods ¤ This essay addresses the definition of artistic and cultural goods by the commonsense and pragmatic assertion that they are respectively goods that carry artistic and cultural (non-economic) values. However, these categories of non-economic value are themselves highly contested and require clarification for the definitions to be viable. The essay suggests an interpretation of the distinction of economic and non-economic values, and of non-economic cultural value, by drawing on the ideas of Nozick. For artistic value, the essay argues that creativity is a central concept, and explores the learning on creativity to be found in cognitive science. Cognitive science sees creativity as requiring both novelty and appropriateness to a particular cultural community. These insights underline some of the characteristics of markets for creative goods, including artistic goods, that cultural economists have stressed in their work independently of cognitive science. For artistic goods in particular, consumers join in the creativity of the artists, and this joint creativity enables us once again to invoke Nozick's concepts of intrinsic value and identify artistic value as a particular instance of non-economic value. The definitions are defended as coherent in the light of their consistency with economic thinking on stimulus goods and learning-by-consuming. Intellectual property is seen as overlapping but not necessary to artistic and cultural goods. Nothing in this essay should be taken as final, but, rather, as a possible starting point for a substantive discussion of non-economic values in these fields.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4>
Chapter 21 Empirical studies of macroeconomic interdependence ¤ This chapter presents some empirical results from studies of macroeconomic interdependence. It focuses on studies that involve linked macroeconometric models of two or more countries. It presents specific versions of the models and analysis with special attention to the role of exchange rates in international transmission. The chapter classifies the main linkage projects, paying special attention to those features of the models that have important bearing on the international transmission of disturbances under fixed and flexible exchange rates. It discusses the international repercussions of fiscal policy, monetary policy, and changes in world oil prices. Empirical studies of macroeconomic interdependence have been producing useful results for over a decade. The earliest studies were mainly of two types: large multilateral projects based mainly on linkage through trade flows and trade prices, and bilateral or few-country models with a more complete and consistent modeling of trade, capital, exchange rate, and, occasionally, migration linkages. Recently, the availability of better multi-country data sets has made possible the construction of many-country models based on consistent aggregate theoretical structures and emphasizing monetary and exchange rate linkages. At the same time, forecasting models such as Project LINK, the OECD INTERLINK, and the EEC Eurolink models have moved some way toward a complete specification of monetary and capital account linkages, and modelers have been examining and ironing out unnecessary differences among the structures of the individual country models.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1>
Regulatory reform in retail distribution ¤ The main purpose of this paper is to analyse cross-country differences in the regulation of the retail distribution industry in the OECD area, focusing on the situation in 1998. Regulatory differences are cast against changes in the industry environment to highlight the potential interactions between regulation and market forces. A number of countries have extensively liberalised market access and price and service regulations. In some countries there is currently a tendency to introduce access restrictions for large outlets. In other countries market access has been traditionally hindered by restrictive regulations and administrative burdens. The available empirical evidence suggests that regulations that restrict shop opening hours and hinder access by imposing special requirements for outlet registration, siting and/or size thresholds curb the dynamism of the industry (e.g. lowering entry and exit rates, and preventing restructuring and modernisation) and competitive pressures, leading to lower employment growth and higher consumer prices.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
Chapter 20. National Culture as Value Orientations: Consequences of Value Differences and Cultural Distance ¤ This chapter presents my theory of seven cultural value orientations and applies it to understanding relations of culture to significant societal phenomena. The first section explicates my conception of culture – a conception of the normative value system that underlies social practices and institutions. I then derive seven value orientations that are useful for describing and comparing societies. Next, the chapter discusses the conceptual underpinnings for measuring the cultural value orientations. It then presents the survey methods developed for this purpose, and the empirical validation of the content of the value orientations and of the structure of relations among them. This is based on analyses of data across 77 national groups in 75 countries. Brief comparisons of these value orientations with two other dimensional approaches to culture are followed by an analysis that justifies treating countries as cultural units. The middle section of the chapter uses the seven validated cultural orientations to generate a worldwide graphic mapping of national cultures. This map permits comparison of national cultures with one another on each orientation. It reveals eight distinct world cultural regions that reflect the influence of geographic proximity, history, language, and other factors. To illustrate the meaningfulness of the cultural map, I discuss the distinctive cultural profiles of each world cultural region. The final third of the chapter examines associations between culture, measured by the value orientations, and a variety of variables of economic significance: the socioeconomic level of countries, their level of corruption, the social net they provide to citizens, their level of democracy, and the competitiveness of their market systems. It discusses the reciprocal causal processes that may account for these associations. Finally, the chapter analyzes how distance between countries on cultural value orientations affects the flow of investment around the world. The current approach differs from well-known theories of cultural dimensions (e.g. Inglehart and Baker, 2000; Hofstede, 2001 ) in deriving the constructs to measure culture from a priori theorizing and then testing the fit of these constructs to empirical data. Moreover, whereas other approaches seek orthogonal dimensions, I assume that correlated dimensions capture culture better because they can express the interdependence of cultural elements. My theory of culture specifies a coherent, integrated system of relations among the seven cultural orientations. These orientations form three correlated bipolar dimensions. Empirical measures of the seven orientations support the coherence of culture by revealing that the cultural profiles of societies rarely exhibit incompatible value emphases.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1>
Chapter 3 The formation and dissolution of families: Why marry? Who marries whom? And what happens upon divorce ¤ This chapter describes the economic reasons for marriage, how families solve their economic problems, the marriage market, divorce and its economic consequences, and the future of the family. A successful theory, which is capable of explaining the data on marriage and divorce must incorporate ideas from sociology, biology, and other fields. An understanding of the economic point of view can be helpful in the construction of a unified approach. Despite its firm roots in nature and its antiquity in human society, the future of the family institution is recently put into question. The recent trends of declining marriage rates, declining fertility rates, higher divorce rates, and the rise in alternative arrangements such as cohabitation, single-person households, and single-mother families are common to many western societies. Easterlin (1987) argues that if the offspring's cohort is large relative to the parents' cohort (e.g., the baby boomers), then economic pressures and the desire to imitate their parents' consumption standards will force the youngsters to postpone marriage and have smaller families. This line of argument suggests that the current pressures on the family are cyclical in nature and will diminish as fertility declines.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006294-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006292-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123185-5>

Chapter 5. Program Evaluation and Research Designs ¤ This chapter provides a selective review of some contemporary approaches to program evaluation. One motivation for our review is the recent emergence and increasing use of a particular kind of “program” in applied microeconomic research, the so-called Regression Discontinuity (RD) Design of Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960). We organize our discussion of these various research designs by how they secure internal validity: in this view, the RD design can been seen as a close “cousin” of the randomized experiment. An important distinction which emerges from our discussion of “heterogeneous treatment effects” is between ex post (descriptive) and ex ante (predictive) evaluations; these two types of evaluations have distinct, but complementary goals. A second important distinction we make is between statistical statements that are descriptions of our knowledge of the program assignment process and statistical statements that are structural assumptions about individual behavior. Using these distinctions, we examine some commonly employed evaluation strategies, and assess them with a common set of criteria for “internal validity”, the foremost goal of an ex post evaluation. In some cases, we also provide some concrete illustrations of how internally valid causal estimates can be supplemented with specific structural assumptions to address “external validity”: the estimate from an internally valid “experimental” estimate can be viewed as a “leading term” in an extrapolation for a parameter of interest in an ex ante evaluation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3>
Financial turbulence : Some lessons regarding deposit insurance ¤ One specific aspect of financial safety nets that has been in the spotlight of late is deposit insurance. As events in markets are still unfolding, it is too soon to draw definitive conclusions regarding the effects of the crisis and the adequacy of financial safety nets, including deposit insurance arrangements. Nonetheless, preliminary suggestions for policy are emerging and the article singles out four areas for special attention. First, as regards coverage, deposit insurance systems with low levels of coverage and/or partial insurance may not be effective in preventing bank runs. Second, for an explicit deposit insurance system to be effective, depositors need to understand the extent of and limits to existing deposit protection schemes. Third, when different institutions are entrusted with responsibilities that are relevant in a crisis situation, ex ante arrangements delimiting the scope of the different responsibilities as well as the respective powers may not be sufficient to ensure co-ordination that is as close and smooth as needed. Fourth, the question as to whether a specific bankruptcy regime for banks is needed remains an important issue.

An Overview of Hedge Funds and Structured Products : Issues in Leverage and Risk ¤ The size of the hedge fund sector, using IOSCO sources and results from responses to an OECD Questionnaire on Hedge Funds, is around USD 1.4 trillion in assets under management (AUM). While this does not seem that large compared to total global AUM, the hedge fund share of trading turnover (augmented by leverage and investment style) is much greater than its share of global AUM....	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3>
Chapter 13. Undocumented Immigration and Human Trafficking ¤ Border and interior enforcement, legal penalties, and the market for smugglers distinguish undocumented migration from legal migration and introduce a number of challenges for migrants, employers, law enforcement, and policymakers. This chapter reviews the theoretical models and empirical evidence on the determinants of undocumented migration and its nature and prevalence around the world. Stricter enforcement vis-à-vis undocumented migration leads to unintended consequences, such as reduced circular migration and greater demand for smugglers. Although recent trends are generally toward stricter enforcement and more punitive sanctions for undocumented migrants and smugglers, there have been periods in recent history when undocumented immigration has been viewed with benign neglect. We review the costs and benefits of undocumented migration from a number of angles, including destination and origin countries, firms, consumers, taxpayers, native-born workers, and migrants themselves. We discuss the long-run impact of undocumented status on immigrants and their families, including the detrimental effect on integration and the limited extent of access to public benefits, such as health care and public pensions. We consider the tradeoffs of regularization programs, which may have economic benefits in the short run but may lead to increased undocumented immigration in the long run. Finally, we turn to human trafficking, which involves coercion, and review models and empirical evidence on human trafficking and policy responses.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069332-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4501977-0>
Does Computer Use Increase Educational Achievements? Student-level Evidence from PISA ¤ The aim of this paper is to assess whether the use of ICT has an impact on student performances as measured in the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2006. After controlling for observable students’ characteristics and self-selection, we did find a positive and significant effect of the frequency of computer use on science scores. In most countries, however, this effect seems larger when computer is used at home rather than at school. This finding questions the effectiveness of educational policies aimed at promoting computer use at school as a tool for learning.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
Chapter 35 Coordination Issues in Long-Run Growth ¤ Economic growth depends not only on how people make decisions but also upon how their decisions are coordinated. Because of this, aggregate outcomes can diverge from individual intentions. I illustrate this with reference to the modern literature on economic growth, and also with reference to an older literature on the stability of full-employment equilibrium. Agent-based computational methods are ideally suited for studying the aspects of growth most affected by coordination issues.

Chapter 4 Historical perspectives on income distribution: The case of Europe ¤ The evolution of income distribution over two centuries is an attractive topic because it allows one to test the inverse U-curve hypothesis using long series instead of cross-section data. In Section 1 the distribution trends in countries where global data are available, is considered, that is in four Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands, the German states and Germany, and in France. The inverse U-curve hypothesis is verified in four of them. Section 2 presents in a consistent framework, using the Theil indicator, all available information on inequality trends between agricultural and nonagricultural sectors and on inequality trends within each sector in European countries. Finally Section 3 throws light on the political and economic factors explaining the long-term evolution of distribution. The economic factors playing a key role are the market structures, the diffusion of education and saving, and dualism.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013887-2>
Making the most of the international aid system ¤ This article outlines how the global development set-up looks today. The picture is of a complex “ecosystem”, with many different types of organisations delivering assistance in a variety of different forms. This complexity presents both opportunities and threats to the developing countries on the receiving end. Without some oversight and guidance, the system could become burdensome and inefficient. The article describes how the DAC is in a unique position to keep track of the trends and to help to bring harmony to the system. It describes these issues in relation to the more than 200 “multilateral donors” – such as the United Nations, the World Bank and the global funds – which today receive or serve as a channel for 40% of all aid. The challenge is to ensure this is being delivered effectively and that efforts are as co-ordinated as possible, both with each other and with the priorities of the developing countries in which they work. As an example, the latest global plans to tackle climate change are a test case for the development community: the article explores how this can be done without increasing the complexity further.

Chapter 24 Selfishness, altruism and normative principles in the economic analysis of social transfers ¤ This chapter examines the role of altruistic motives in the economic analysis of public social transfers, both from a positive and from a normative point of view. The positive question is to know whether we can fully neglect altruistic considerations to explain the development or sustainability of these transfers. Such is the implicit ambition of efficiency theories of the Welfare State. However, while these theories may be suited for explaining the development of public insurance or life-cycle transfers, they rapidly reach their limits when we try to explain more redistributive dimensions of social transfers. At the other extreme, descriptions of social transfers as systems of extended insurance (behind the veil of ignorance) implicitly do as if individuals were ready to completely abstract from their real world situations, and this can be analyzed as an extreme form of altruism. Actual motivations for support of social transfers certainly lay somewhere in between, i.e., a mix of well-understood selfishness and partial altruism. This explains why these systems can redistribute more than explained by pure efficiency motives, but less than what would be predicted under the extended insurance hypothesis. One additional limit to redistribution is the fact that even very altruistic agents can deliberately reduce its scope because of its potential disincentive effects. The second part of the chapter examines normative considerations which seem relevant to the evaluation of systems of social transfers. In particular, the idea of extended insurance has paradoxical implications in some circumstances, because of its structural similarity to utilitarianism. Therefore it appears useful to look for other normative theories, such as inequality-averse social welfare functions or fairness criteria. It is shown how both approaches can be useful in the study of second-best solutions under incentive constraints. The chapter ends with a critical examination of the incorporation of individuals' altruistic feelings in social welfare functions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184535-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4302876-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057542-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197971-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133536-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129281-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020511-3>
Chapter 9. Causal inference in environmental conservation: The role of institutions ¤ The on-going degradation of global public goods such as biodiversity and climate regulation due to the loss of natural tropical ecosystems has generated demand for evidence on the effectiveness of alternative policy instruments for environmental conservation. Economists initially responded with ex post evaluations using quasi-experimental methods to identify average causal effects on outcomes such as deforestation. In this chapter, we demonstrate how careful attention to institutions enhances both the credibility and the policy relevance of these evaluations. Policy instruments such as protected areas, decentralization, and payments for ecosystem services are designed to change formal property rights institutions. Their causal effects are shaped by both formal and informal institutions, especially when they are applied to ecosystems that are also central to local livelihoods. Program evaluation should consider how these institutions define (1) assignment or selection of people and places, (2) specific treatments, through variation in institutional details that generate heterogeneous effects, (3) moderators that influence potential outcomes both with and without treatment, again generating heterogeneous effects, and (4) mechanisms, or the means by which instruments affect the ultimate outcomes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1>
Chapter 45 Computing equilibria for two-person games ¤ This paper is a self-contained survey of algorithms for computing Nash equilibria of two-person games. The games may be given in strategic form or extensive form. The classical Lemke-Howson algorithm finds one equilibrium of a bimatrix game, and provides an elementary proof that a Nash equilibrium exists. It can be given a strong geometric intuition using graphs that show the subdivision of the players' mixed strategy sets into best-response regions. The Lemke-Howson algorithm is presented with these graphs, as well as algebraically in terms of complementary pivoting. Degenerate games require a refinement of the algorithm based on lexicographic perturbations. Commonly used definitions of degenerate games are shown as equivalent. The enumeration of all equilibria is expressed as the problem of finding matching vertices in pairs of polytopes. Algorithms for computing simply stable equilibria and perfect equilibria are explained. The computation of equilibria for extensive games is difficult for larger games since the reduced strategic form may be exponentially large compared to the game tree. If the players have perfect recall, the sequence form of the extensive game is a strategic description that is more suitable for computation. In the sequence form, pure strategies of a player are replaced by sequences of choices along a play in the game. The sequence form has the same size as the game tree, and can be used for computing equilibria with the same methods as the strategic form. The paper concludes with remarks on theoretical and practical issues of concern to these computational approaches.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8>
Chapter 10. Civic Capital as the Missing Link ¤ This chapter reviews the recent debate about the role of social capital in economics. We argue that all the difficulties this concept has encountered in economics are due to a vague and excessively broad definition. For this reason, we restrict social capital to the set of values and beliefs that help cooperation, which for clarity we label civic capital . We argue that this definition differentiates social capital from human capital and satisfies the properties of the standard notion of capital. We then argue that civic capital can explain why differences in economic performance persist over centuries and discuss how the effect of civic capital can be distinguished empirically from other variables that affect economic performance and its persistence, including institutions and geography.

Chapter 92 Endogenous Properties of Equilibrium and Disequilibrium in Spatial Committee Games ¤ This chapter discusses that experiments demonstrate the extent to which outcomes are responsive to the structure of preferences. Where a preference-induced equilibrium exists, outcomes converge toward that equilibrium. Where a natural majority coalition exists, outcomes cluster around it. Where preferences are widely distributed, so too are outcomes. By and large, the fact that outcomes are sensitive to endogenous preferences comes as some relief. These results indicate that there is a clear patterning to outcomes and they are dependent on the preferences of actors. Rather than throwing up our hands in frustration over the impossibility of understanding basic collective choice processes, these results point to the possibility of predicting outcomes. Those theoretical constructs aim at capturing the complex relationships between preference and choices.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Introduction to the Series ¤ This chapter presents an introduction to the series Handbooks in Economics. The series produced handbooks for various branches of economics, each of which is a definitive source, reference, and teaching supplement for the use by professional researchers and advanced graduate students.

These surveys summarize not only received results but also newer developments, from recent journal articles and discussion papers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011152-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Chapter 18. Panel Data Forecasting ¤ This chapter reviews the panel data forecasting literature. Starting with simple forecasts based on fixed and random effects panel data models. Next, these forecasts are extended to allow for various ARMA type structure on the disturbances, as well as spatial autoregressive and moving average type disturbances. These forecasting methods are then studied in the context of seemingly unrelated regressions. We highlight several forecasting empirical applications using panel data, as well as several Monte Carlo studies that compare various forecasting methods using panel data. The chapter concludes with suggestions for further work in this area.

Chapter 30 Incomplete markets ¤ This chapter analyzes the GEI model of an exchange economy in which one finds that when markets are incomplete, changing the financial instruments, or when nominal assets are present, changing the money, supply leads to a change in the equilibrium allocation; in short, financial instruments and money are nonneutral. The chapter presents a systematic analysis of the concepts and mathematical techniques needed for a proper understanding of the behavior of GEI equilibria. While real assets are inflation proof, nominal assets are not. The economic consequence is the striking property exhibited by the GEI model with nominal assets: indeterminacy if the model is left unchanged and nonneutrality of money if a role is introduced for money as a medium of exchange. The chapter presents an analysis of the GEI model of a production economy: it is the theory that encounters great difficulties. When markets are incomplete each firm faces a public goods problem with respect to its constituency of shareholders (and employees) for which there is no evident solution. The chapter also presents a reasonably coherent view of the current status of the theory of incomplete markets.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066472-7>
Chapter 19 Economic analysis of food safety ¤ This chapter addresses the analysis of markets for food products that are differentiated by safety characteristics. The first part of the paper surveys the broad array of issues that are involved in food safety and the regulations that have been devised to address them. The next sections of the paper consider the analysis of the demand and supply of safety-differentiated products and the implications of alternative information regimes for market equilibrium. The final section of the paper considers the measurement of benefits and costs of food safety regulations in the context of recent efforts at regulatory impact assessment.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5>
The future of Chinese and South-East Asian migration to OECD countries ¤ CHINA and the Philippines are among the top 10 main sending countries to OECD countries. Population growth is still high in the Philippines, which will likely exert strong pressure for emigration if economic opportunities in the country do not keep up. In China and Indonesia population growth has been reduced to replacement or below replacement levels, thereby reducing future emigration pressure. Recent economic success, if continued, would likely reduce emigration on condition that in China the distribution of benefits from its economic growth is more equitable; that Indonesia is able to generate more employment-intensive economic growth; and that the Philippines is able to extricate itself from its long history of boom-bust economic growth. There are pockets of ethnic unrest that are currently mainly dormant, but should they escalate, they will most likely have an impact on emigration to nearby countries. A large portion of the population in the region lives in coastal areas, making them vulnerable to the negative impacts associated with climate change.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
Chapter 20 The industrial organization of health care markets ¤ Health care markets fail to satisfy many requirements for perfect competition, including large numbers of consumers and firms, zero search costs, and marketability of all goods and services. Over time, health care markets have evolved to overcome the resulting inefficiencies. We combine the theory of agency with a model of monopolistic competition to explore three regimes of health care organization that were dominant at different points in time: (1) independent physicians and cost-based reimbursement for hospitals; (2) regulation; and (3) managed care. Each regime represents, for its time, a sensible response to market failure. Each regime has predictable consequences for prices, costs, and quality. We examine the theoretical arguments and review the empirical evidence about each regime. A consistent message emerges: Providers respond to economic incentives in a manner consistent with theory.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
2. Market Economics of Uncertainty and Information ¤ The principles based on purposeful behavior, which have always been at the foundations of economics, began to expand to explain the acquisition of information and its use, including both the information that might be carried in the actions of others and in the behavior of markets. This evolution was accompanied by the development of more precise principles of behavior as well as modifications of those of classical origin. This chapter reports on the expectations development of individuals and in particular the capacity of individuals to condition their expectations of some events on the observation of multiple other events. That is, they measure the implicit conditional subjective probabilities of events that have a stochastic dependence on other observable events.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1>
Chapter 7 Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium Predictions as a Means of Organizing Behavior in Posted-Offer Market Experiments ¤ Market power arises in many posted-offer markets and drives a distinction between the competitive prediction and the Nash equilibrium for the market viewed as a stage game. Pricing patterns in such markets tend to be characterized by Edgeworth cycles that deteriorate as the sessions progress. The amplitude and frequency of the cycles are sensitive to design and procedural details, and vary considerably from experiment to experiment. Although persistent serial correlation in pricing proscribe any direct test of static Nash mixing predictions, rough correspondence between the central moments of predicted and observed densities has been observed in a variety of different instances. However, the persistent and very prominent deviations observed in an asymmetric design suggests that Nash mixing predictions do not uniformly organize behavior well. The circumstances under which mixing predictions may organize outcomes well merits further investigation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1>
Chapter 35 Cultural Policy: An American View ¤ American cultural policy is made and executed by multiple governmental entities, with a large part of direct public expenditure coming from sub-national governments rather than the central government. Much the largest share of government support is provided by tax concessions for gifts to not-for-profit enterprises that are the predominant producers of the subsidized arts, and by tax concessions to private owners who agree to preserve their heritage buildings and sites. The multiplicity of government decision makers and the reliance on “arms-length” relations between government and not-for-profit private providers of cultural services results in cultural policy that appears to be and is incoherent, but is characteristic of American public policy in many spheres.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4>

Chapter 39 Utility and subjective probability ¤ Utility and subjective probability involve the systematic study of people's preferences and beliefs, including quantitative representations of preference and belief that facilitate analyses of problems in decision making and choice behavior. Its history spans more than 250 years and is mainly because of people in economics, mathematics, statistics, and psychology. Utility theory is primarily concerned with properties of a binary relation on a set X , where X could be a set of commodity bundles, decision alternatives, monetary gambles, n -tuples of pure strategies, and so forth, and x > y is interpreted as x is preferred to y . The formal development of utility and subjective probability is based on the notion of a binary relation. Special types of binary relations are identified by conjunctions of properties that are equivalence, linear order, weak order, and partial order.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Chapter 1. Nature and Nurture Effects On Children's Outcomes: What Have We Learned From Studies of Twins And Adoptees? ¤ There is a rich history of using data from twins and from adoptees to control for genetic influences and thereby examine the impact of environment on children's outcomes. The behavioral genetics model is the workhorse of this literature and for a variety of outcomes including IQ scores and personality measures behavioral geneticists find that the bulk of the variance that can be explained is correlated with genetic influences. However, finding that variation in test scores has a large genetic component is quite different than asking whether test scores can be improved by interventions and changes in policy or whether such interventions pass a cost benefit test. Economists have recently begun asking how the intergenerational transmission of educational attainment, income and health vary when a child is being raised by adoptive rather than biological parents. Results suggest that both the biological and the nurturing parents contribute a great deal to the transmission of income and education to their children	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120990-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132883-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066514-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027266-7>
Chapter 72 Electric Power Market Design Issues and Laboratory Experiments ¤ The incentive failure of government ownership of public utility industries has helped to motivate the worldwide privatization of these industries. Similar shortcomings of rate-of-return regulation in the United States has led to major changes in the way in which the gas, telephone and cable TV industries are regulated, as public policy has leaned toward, if not fully embraced, the substitution of markets for direct regulation of these industries. Radical technological changes in long distance communication and transmission have also contributed to this accelerating trend. But such analysis does not deal with the question of how bidding behavior may be affected by line constraints; nor does it ask if optimization is supported by an equilibrium model. This chapter also inquires as to how market efficiency and the income shares of producers, wholesale buyers, and transmission line owners are altered with a variation on the auction market bidding rules. The effects of a line constraint and of changing the auction market rules are both examined under different levels of experience on the part of the subjects.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Chapter 11 The distribution of wealth ¤ This chapter is concerned with the distribution of personal wealth, which usually refers to the material assets that can be sold in the marketpace, although on occasion pension rights are also included. We summarise the available evidence on wealth distribution for a number of countries. This confirms the well known fact that wealth is more unequally distributed than income, and points to a long term downward trend in wealth inequality over most of the twentieth century. We also review the various theories that help account for these feature. Lifecycle accumulation is one popular explanation of wealth differences, but inheritance is also widely recognised as playing a major role, especially at the upper end of the wealth range. A recurrent theme in work on wealth distribution is the relative importance of these two sources of wealth differences. We discuss the results of studies that assess the contributions of inheritance and lifecycle factors, and give attention also to a variety of related issues, such as the link between wealth status across generations, and the possible motives for leaving bequests.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013887-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7>
Chapter 15. Human capital development before age five ¤ This chapter seeks to set out what economists have learned about the effects of early childhood influences on later life outcomes, and about ameliorating the effects of negative influences. We begin with a brief overview of the theory which illustrates that evidence of a causal relationship between a shock in early childhood and a future outcome says little about whether the relationship in question is biological or immutable. We then survey recent work which shows that events before five years old can have large long term impacts on adult outcomes. Child and family characteristics measured at school entry do as much to explain future outcomes as factors that labor economists have more traditionally focused on, such as years of education. Yet while children can be permanently damaged at this age, an important message is that the damage can often be remediated. We provide a brief overview of evidence regarding the effectiveness of different types of policies to provide remediation. We conclude with a list of some of the many outstanding questions for future research. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127364-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8>
Chapter 40 Urban housing markets: Theory and policy ¤ This chapter examines certain of the developments in the application of economic theory and in empirical and policy analysis with respect to housing markets in general and urban housing markets in particular. The majority of the material refers to US and UK experience with some English language contributions related to other, mainly European, countries. The main thrust of the chapter is to clarify how the particular attributes of housing, especially those of durability and locational specificity, have been introduced into microeconomic models of housing. On the demand side analysis concentrates on estimates of price and income elasticities and the results that arise from different mode specifications. On the supply side there is emphasis on the importance of distinguishing the factors determining new supply from those which affect investment in the existing stock. Overall housing market analysis is also divided into that which applies to the market as a whole and the very different issues, particularly with respect to market segmentation, which dominate urban models. Turning to housing policy the chapter clarifies the different approaches taken to analysis, measurement and evaluation of policy in Europe and America and examines in detail developments with respect to particular examples of policy concern, including market versus administrative allocation, housing and labour markets, the impact of local taxation and rent control.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1>
Pension Fund Demand for High-quality Long-term Bonds : Quantifying Potential "Scarcity" of Suitable Investments ¤ The article describes the results of a modeling exercise to gauge the size of potential pension fund demand for bonds under some simplifying assumptions, so as to illustrate the potential role of this specific group of investors. It provides a measure of the potential excess demand for high-quality fixed-income instruments from pension funds, using the admittedly restrictive assumptions that pension funds invest only in high-quality bonds in an attempt to achieve cash-flow matching of their liabilities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Chapter 16 The natural rate of unemployment: Explanation and policy ¤ This chapter describes unemployment in the long run. It presents the time path of unemployment in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe. There is an upward trend for unemployment in the United States; but in Europe, there has been an astonishing growth with unemployment rising in all but one of the last 15 years. This explains why the unemployment rates are so different for different groups of people in society. For example, unemployment rates are typically higher for young people than for older people. They are also higher for the unskilled, for blacks, and for workers in certain industries. These differences are closely related to the different rates of turnover of the different groups. To explain unemployment, three main types of model are constructed. The first of these is based on supply and demand and assumes that without government intervention these are, in the long run, equal. However, even without wage regulation there may be excess supply of labor and involuntary unemployment may persist because of the wage-setting behavior of monopsonistic firms or of monopolistic unions or because of bargaining between the two. Thus, second set of models has wages set by firms, and the third has wages set by unions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9>
Chapter 8. Dynamic Factor Models, Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregressions, and Structural Vector Autoregressions in Macroeconomics ¤ This chapter provides an overview of and user's guide to dynamic factor models (DFMs), their estimation, and their uses in empirical macroeconomics. It also surveys recent developments in methods for identifying and estimating SVARs, an area that has seen important developments over the past 15 years. The chapter begins by introducing DFMs and the associated statistical tools, both parametric (state-space forms) and nonparametric (principal components and related methods). After reviewing two mature applications of DFMs, forecasting and macroeconomic monitoring, the chapter lays out the use of DFMs for analysis of structural shocks, a special case of which is factor-augmented vector autoregressions (FAVARs). A main focus of the chapter is how to extend methods for identifying shocks in structural vector autoregression (SVAR) to structural DFMs. The chapter provides a unification of SVARs, FAVARs, and structural DFMs and shows both in theory and through an empirical application to oil shocks how the same identification strategies can be applied to each type of model.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8>
Investment climate, capabilities and firm performance : Evidence from the world business environment survey ¤ The World Business Environment Survey (WBES) provided a unique look at the impact of the investment climate on enterprise performance, employing a standard core questionnaire to more than 10 000 firms in 80 countries between late 1998 and mid-2000. This paper examines results of a special module of the survey administered in 28 of the WBES countries that focused on issues of competition, trade and firm capabilities in terms of technology and worker education and training. It confirms that key attributes of the investment climate such as corruption, financing, tax administration, regulations and policy uncertainty all matter in explaining firm performance as measured by sales growth, employment growth and investment growth. Further, excessive labour regulation is negatively associated with both employment and investment growth. The new data on firm capabilities suggest that firm investments in technology and skills are also critically associated with firm performance. Investment in technological capacity strongly relates to sales growth, while international technological acquisition relates clearly to employment and investment growth. Training matters as well, and it is quite clear that investments in private training services are significantly associated with all dimensions of firm growth. What is equally clear is that public training bears no significant relationship with firm performance. Firms that make no investments in training appear disproportionately influenced by three types of market failure. This link has direct implications for governments as they shape technology policy and training policy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3>
Chapter 10 Defense expenditure and economic growth ¤ This chapter reviews the empirical research on the relation between defense spending and economic growth. A broad flavor of the approaches adopted by different scholars is provided through a list of selected studies on the topic since 1973 and an outline of the variations over Benoit's original work that have been explored in the literature. A discussion of three major methodological issues is then undertaken. The following section summarizes the main substantive results reported in various studies, and another section contains some thoughts on the future research on the subject. The chapter ends with a few concluding and summarizing observations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132793-7>
Chapter 13. The Optimal Rate of Inflation ¤ Observed inflation targets around the industrial world are concentrated at two percent per year. This chapter investigates the extent to which the observed magnitudes of inflation targets are consistent with the optimal rate of inflation predicted by leading theories of monetary non-neutrality. We find that consistently those theories imply that the optimal rate of inflation ranges from minus the real rate of interest to numbers insignificantly above zero. Furthermore, we argue that the zero bound on nominal interest rates does not represent an impediment for setting inflation targets near or below zero. Finally, we find that central banks should adjust their inflation targets upward by the size of the quality bias in measured inflation only if hedonic prices are more sticky than nonquality-adjusted prices.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Structural Reform in the Rail Industry ¤ In a competition roundtable focused on separation of rail track ownership from that of train operations, accumulating evidence is examined that suggests the value of structural separation in the railways sector may be less than previously thought. Integration may yield benefits for a number of reasons, including externalities between train operations and rail maintenance, and difficulties in overseeing traffic in an environment with delays and imperfect information for the train dispatcher. The potential value of separation may differ between passenger operations and freight operations. While passenger operations often require subsidies and, in a separated regime, are often provided via competition for the market (concessions), freight operations offer more potential for beneficial vertical separation. For international traffic between moderate-sized countries, the ability to operate across borders may be limited by a number of factors, including language and technical specifications which need to be addressed in order to broaden the potential for international rail-based freight. This Roundtable on Structural Reform in the Rail Industry was held in 2005 in the Working Party on Regulation of the Competition Committee.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Chapter 52 The Problem of Common Choice in Symmetric N-person Coordination Games ¤ Coordination problems are easily solved when there are clear and unambiguous signals. Institutional mechanisms that enhance the clarity of signals enables even cheap talk to work as a coordinating mechanism. On the other hand, learning about signals, especially if there is path-dependent noise in the environment, complicates the ability of subjects to settle on a common coordinating device. Coordination problems, such as the one facing our Cornhusker motorists, can be simply and easily solved provided an appropriate institutional remedy is at hand. Markets, for example, with frictionless transaction costs and complete information, constitute one way of quickly coordinating supply and demand. The evolution of social norms constitutes another way of coordinating human action. Central to both of these solutions is the presence of a clear, unambiguous signal about what actions individuals should take. Where such a signal is present, the problem of coordination is easily solved; where absent, the problem of coordination can be extraordinarily difficult.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1>
Chapter 5. Population, Poverty, and the Natural Environment ¤ This chapter studies the interface in poor countries of population growth, rural poverty, and deterioration of the local natural-resource base, a subject that has been much neglected by modern demographers and development economists. The motivations for procreation in rural communities of the poorest regions of the world are analyzed, and recent work on the relevance of gender relationships to such motivations is summarized. Four potentially significant social externalities associated with fertility behavior and use of the local natural-resource base are identified. Three are shown to be pronatalist in their effects, while the fourth is shown to be ambiguous, in that it can be either pro-or anti-natalist. It is shown that one of the externalities may even provide an invidious link between fertility decisions and the use of the local natural-resource base. The fourth type of externality is used to develop a theory of fertility transitions in the contemporary world. The theory views such transitions as disequilibrium phenomena.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075236-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061619-8>
Chapter 45 Experimental Beauty Contest Games: Levels of Reasoning and Convergence to Equilibrium ¤ This chapter presents data from a series of experiments with human subjects to test how individuals form expectations of others' expectations. The experiment has much in common with Keynes' insight regarding the behavior of investors in financial markets, and therefore the game is called beauty contest game in honor of Keynes. This chapter introduces new asymmetric guessing games in which subjects of the same group may have different parameters p or intervals to choose from in order to separate leading decision rules. The main difference was the high number of frequencies at or near the equilibrium. The choices closest to the winning number were typically those which came from subjects who did their own pre-experiments with students, friends or even with a newsgroup experiment.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1>
Adapted Process Model for Manufacturing Within Production Networks ¤ The paper concentrates on the external elimination of bottlenecks by using congruent shared capacities within a non-hierarchical organized network. The study assumes that the capacity of assembly can be adapted by increasing the resources of the company. Conversely, the capacity of production is restricted by technological requirements and regulated by machine resources.To relieve capacity by external measures within a non-hierarchical organized network, an adapted process model is required. For this purpose, critical issues for the process flow within a network are identified and necessary regulations suggested.The paper presents the possibility of integrating the adapted approach into the operations management process as well as into systems of production planning and control and deduces the necessary information that is required to ensure the economic viability of bottleneck removal.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4329079-6>
Chapter 14. Inequality in Macroeconomics ¤ We revise some of the main ways in which the study of aggregate performance of an economy overlaps with the study of inequality.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7>
Chapter 3. Gravity Equations: Workhorse, Toolkit, and Cookbook ¤ This chapter focuses on the estimation and interpretation of gravity equations for bilateral trade. This necessarily involves a careful consideration of the theoretical underpinnings since it has become clear that naive approaches to estimation lead to biased and frequently misinterpreted results. There are now several theory-consistent estimation methods and we argue against sole reliance on any one method and instead advocate a toolkit approach. One estimator may be preferred for certain types of data or research questions but more often the methods should be used in concert to establish robustness. In recent years, estimation has become just a first step before a deeper analysis of the implications of the results, notably in terms of welfare. We try to facilitate diffusion of best-practice methods by illustrating their application in a step-by-step cookbook mode of exposition.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0>
Stocktaking Report and Policy Recommendations on Risk Awareness and Education on Natural Catastrophes ¤ The growing cost and frequency of natural catastrophes and their implications for economic growth and development have led to a concern over the level of public awareness and education relative to large-scale catastrophes and disaster risk reduction measures. Public awareness and education of disaster risk reduction are, in particular, increasingly acknowledged as important components of effective risk management of natural catastrophes. The financial component of disaster risk management and mitigation strategies, involving risk transfer and compensation strategies, is also recognised as being important for reducing the financial impact of catastrophes on individuals, businesses, and governments, and permitting more rapid economic and social recovery. As such, systematic promotion of public awareness and education of risks and risk reduction measures, including financial loss-sharing and risk transfer tools, is an important aspect of national and international strategies to reduce vulnerability and losses from catastrophic events.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
Chapter 19. Inflation Expectations, Adaptive Learning and Optimal Monetary Policy ¤ This chapter investigates the implications of adaptive learning in the private sector's formation of inflation expectations for the conduct of monetary policy. We first review the literature that studies the implications of adaptive learning processes for macroeconomic dynamics under various monetary policy rules. We then analyze optimal monetary policy in the standard New Keynesian model, when the central bank minimizes an explicit loss function and has full information about the structure of the economy, including the precise mechanism generating private sector's expectations. The focus on optimal policy allows us to investigate how and to what extent a change in the assumption of how agents form their inflation expectations affects the principles of optimal monetary policy. It also provides a benchmark to evaluate simple policy rules. We find that departures from rational expectations increase the potential for instability in the economy, strengthening the importance of anchoring inflation expectations. We also find that the simple commitment rule under rational expectations is robust when expectations are formed in line with adaptive learning.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2>
Introduction to the Series ¤ The Handbooks in Economics series comprises handbooks for various branches of economics, each of which is a definitive source, reference, and teaching supplement for use by professional researchers and advanced graduate students. Each Handbook of the series provides self-contained surveys of the current state of a branch of economics in the form of chapters prepared by leading specialists on various aspects of this branch of economics. These surveys summarize not only received results, but also newer developments, from recent journal articles and discussion papers. Some original material is also included, but the main goal is to provide comprehensive and accessible surveys.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059252-2>
Chapter 23 Waiting lists and medical treatment: Analysis and policies ¤ A number of health care systems use waiting time as a rationing device for access to inpatient care. However, a considerable amount of research has focussed in particular on the UK's National Health Service and its perceived problem of waiting “lists”. In this chapter a theoretical discussion addresses the issue of the optimum wait in the context of Paretian welfare economics. However, reference is also made to public choice analysis and to queuing theory. Empirical literature that explores the various dimensions of waiting costs is reviewed and evaluated. Different methods of estimation are illustrated and these include contingent valuation, implied valuation and econometric modelling. The policy section assesses various “solutions” to the waiting list “problem”. Options are classified in terms of their impact on excess demand and the issue of waiting list management is addressed. In the absence of an over-arching welfare analysis both empirical work and policy recommendations are inevitably piece-meal and open to debate. Given the inherent weaknesses of applied welfare economics the challenge is to find a framework which would attract a broader consensus.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Creating a Better Business Environment for Financing Business, Innovation and Green Growth ¤ Modern economies are increasingly reliant on innovation to improve their competitiveness and generate growth. However, the financing of innovation in Europe exhibits weaknesses that have been exacerbated by the recent economic and financial crisis, and which could have a material adverse impact on economic growth if left unchecked. This paper explains the European Investment Bank Group’s role in creating a better environment for financing business, innovation and green growth. It briefly presents to the reader the current challenges, both in relation to the availability of equity financing for earlier-stage business, innovation and green growth, but also the stark evidence of a continuing gap in bank lending. Moreover, it provides examples of ways that the financing of innovation can be improved against the backdrop of a flexible, business-oriented EU framework.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Chapter 26 Optimal fiscal and monetary policy ¤ We provide an introduction to optimal fiscal and monetary policy using the primal approach to optimal taxation. We use this approach to address how fiscal and monetary policy should be set over the long run and over the business cycle. We find four substantive lessons for policymaking: Capital income taxes should be high initially and then roughly zero; tax rates on labor and consumption should be roughly constant; state-contingent taxes on assets should be used to provide insurance against adverse shocks; and monetary policy should be conducted so as to keep nominal interest rates close to zero. We begin by studying optimal taxation in a static context. We then develop a general framework to analyze optimal fiscal policy. Finally, we analyze optimal monetary policy in three commonly used models of money: a cash-credit economy, a money-in-the-utility-function economy, and a shopping-time economy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8>
Chapter 50 Bargaining with incomplete information ¤ A central question in economics is understanding the difficulties that parties have in reaching mutually beneficial agreements. Informational differences provide an appealing explanation for bargaining inefficiencies. This chapter provides an overview of the theoretical and empirical literature on bargaining with incomplete information. The chapter begins with an analysis of bargaining within a mechanism design framework. A modern development is provided of the classic result that, given two parties with independent private valuations, ex post efficiency is attainable if and only if it is common knowledge that gains from trade exist. The classic problems of efficient trade with one-sided incomplete information but interdependent valuations, and of efficiently dissolving a partnership with two-sided incomplete information, are also reviewed using mechanism design. The chapter then proceeds to study bargaining where the parties sequentially exchange offers. Under one-sided incomplete information, it considers sequential bargaining between a seller with a known valuation and a buyer with a private valuation. When there is a “gap” between the seller's valuation and the support of buyer valuations, the seller-offer game has essentially a unique sequential equilibrium. This equilibrium exhibits the following properties: it is stationary, trade occurs in finite time, and the price is favorable to the informed party (the Coase Conjecture). The alternating-offer game exhibits similar properties, when a refinement of sequential equilibrium is applied. However, in the case of “no gap” between the seller's valuation and the support of buyer valuations, the bargaining does not conclude with probability one after any finite number of periods, and it does not follow that sequential equilibria need be stationary. If stationarity is nevertheless assumed, then the results parallel those for the “gap” case. However, if stationarity is not assumed, then instead a folk theorem obtains, so substantial delay is possible and the uninformed party may receive substantial surplus. The chapter also briefly sketches results for sequential bargaining with two-sided incomplete information. Finally, it reviews the empirical evidence on strategic bargaining with private information by focusing on one of the most prominent examples of bargaining: union contract negotiations.

Chapter 25 Calculating the Costs of Environmental Regulation ¤ Decisions concerning environmental protection hinge on estimates of economic burden. Over the past 30 years, economists have developed and applied various tools to measure this burden. In this chapter, we present a taxonomy of costs along with methods for measuring those costs. At the broadest level, we distinguish between partial and general equilibrium costs. Partial equilibrium costs represent the burden directly borne by the regulated entity (firms, households, government), including both pecuniary and nonpecuniary expenses, when prices are held constant. General equilibrium costs reflect the net burden once all good and factor markets have equilibrated. In addition to partial equilibrium costs, these general equilibrium costs include welfare losses or gains in markets with preexisting distortions, welfare losses or gains from rebalancing the government's budget constraint, and welfare gains from the added flexibility of meeting pollution constraints through reductions in the use of higher-priced, pollution-intensive products. In addition to both partial and general equilibrium costs, we also consider the distribution of costs across households, countries, sectors, subnational regions, and generations. Despite improvements in our understanding of cost measurement, we find considerable opportunity for further work and, especially, better application of existing methods.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3>
Chapter 12. The Refugee/Asylum Seeker ¤ This chapter discusses the research in economics on refugees and asylum seekers. Section 1 describes the trends in asylum seeking by source and host country. Section 2 presents a conceptual framework on why refugees might differ from other types of immigrants, and provides a new analysis comparing refugees to other immigrants in the United States using a sample of immigrants recently granted legal permanent residency. Section 3 describes a conceptual framework on why investments in host-country-specific human capital might differ between refugees and other immigrants, and presents a new analysis of refugee economic integration in the United States using synthetic panel data. Section 4 synthesizes the literature on the impact of refugees on sending and receiving communities. Section 5 discusses some political economy issues surrounding refugees, and their implications for modeling host nations’ asylum policy choices. The chapter closes in Section 6 with suggestions for further research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069332-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4501977-0>
Chapter 6 Forecasting with VARMA Models ¤ Vector autoregressive moving-average (VARMA) processes are suitable models for producing linear forecasts of sets of time series variables. They provide parsimonious representations of linear data generation processes. The setup for these processes in the presence of stationary and cointegrated variables is considered. Moreover, unique or identified parameterizations based on the echelon form are presented. Model specification, estimation, model checking and forecasting are discussed. Special attention is paid to forecasting issues related to contemporaneously and temporally aggregated VARMA processes. Predictors for aggregated variables based alternatively on past information in the aggregated variables or on disaggregated information are compared.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047390-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8>

Chapter 1. Preference Externalities in Media Markets ¤ Media industries typically exhibit two fundamental features, high fixed costs and heterogeneity of consumer preferences. Daily newspaper markets, for example, tend to support a single product. In other examples, such as radio broadcasting, markets often support multiple differentiated offerings. Both contexts can deliver preference externalities, when the options and well-being for consumers depend on the number and mix of consumers according to their content preferences. This chapter presents evidence on these fundamental features of media markets. We then incorporate these features into a suite of theoretical models to obtain both a description of media markets as well as predictions for how they would be expected to function. In Section 1.3, we turn to “results,” i.e., empirical evidence on the questions illuminated by the theoretical models. We then explore the effects of technological change, and we suggest directions for future work.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129410-5>
An OCL implementation for model-driven engineering of C++ ¤ Unlike traditional development techniques, Model-Driven Software Development utilizes models as the cornerstone of a software development process and the basis for automated generation of required development artifacts. Its goal is to automate transformations between models and source code. The Object Constraint Language (OCL) is a standard method for querying and validating standardized UML or Ecore models. Several toolchains implement this approach, for example the common Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). However, most of these solutions are based on Java or are proprietary solutions. A reason for this is that open source implementations for C++ based on an explicit standardized meta-model are still missing, which are necessary to query a model using OCL during runtime. The Model-Driven Engineering for C++ (MDE4CPP) project is an EMF-like, model-driven environment for common Eclipse Ecore and several OMG specifications like UML, fUML, or PSCS. Although already supporting the execution of UML models, the project did not support OCL so far. This paper presents the concept and implementation of OCL4CPP: an OCL parsing tool for checking, querying, and validating Ecore and UML models at run time within MDE4CPP. It describes implementation details as well as the use of the OCL parser for example applications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193754-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4832365-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4226127-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/105398068X> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1135597375>
Chapter 18 Duality for the household: Theory and applications ¤ This chapter presents the theory of consumer choice as applied to household behavior. An internally consistent, self-contained framework is developed for the analysis of consumer preferences, household production, quality attributes, and produced nonmarket commodities in static and dynamic environments. Consumer expectations and naive and rational habit formation are considered in detail. The emphasis is on developing an internally consistent duality for consumer choice theory in each of these contexts. The chapter develops a general, logically consistent modeling framework for the applied economic analysis of consumption choices by the household.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4>
Chapter 19 Donative nonprofit organizations ¤ In this chapter, we explore why donations are made to nonprofit organizations instead of other institutions or directly to recipients; how such nonprofit organizations behave; and what is the appropriate public policy toward subsidizing and regulating these entities. We focus on donative nonprofits—organizations precluded from distributing their surplus revenues to those in control that receive resources in the forms of donated time and money and tend to provide private pure, distributional, or excludable public goods. First, we discuss the definition of a private nonprofit organization and delineate some immediate corollaries and consequences of that definition. Next, we summarize the dimensions of the nonprofit sector—size, scope, and revenue mix—for various countries around the world. Third, we discuss various models of the role and behavior of donative nonprofit organizations. Finally, we discuss some specific behaviors of nonprofit organizations—the ways in which they conduct fundraising campaigns, set prices, employ labor, and use capital. The discussion of models of donative nonprofits forms the heart of our paper, and is organized as follows. First, we show that agency problems between donors (as principals) and charitable service-providing organizations (as agents) result whenever the latter are employed to provide public goods. If the organization is constrained against the distribution of profits, this agency problem is resolved. Second, we argue that a three-stage game is the most natural way to model the choices of intermediaries and donors. In this game, an intermediary makes a seed donation, collects donations from others, then can add to (but not subtract from) the total donated in previous stages. Third, we detail the choice the founding entrepreneur makes between organizing as a nonprofit or a for-profit organization, showing that it can be individually rational for the entrepreneur to constrain his future ability to distribute profits. Fourth, we show how commercial activities alter entrepreneurial decisions. Fifth, we discuss nonprofits that provide excludable public goods, such as those in the arts. Sixth, we discuss sorting of entrepreneurial types across sectors and industries. Seventh, we consider multiple public goods, which may be provided by a single or separate organizations, and the passthrough intermediaries that may support them. Eighth, we delineate a variety of internal agency problems and the ways in which nonprofit organizations cope with them. The final subsection looks at models of long-run equilibrium.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057542-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4302876-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133536-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129281-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197971-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020511-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184535-3>
Risks Ahead for the Financial Industry in a Changing Interest Rate Environment ¤ The current interest rate environment has been conducive to financial institutions assuming exposure to interest rate risks. As interest rates are expected to rise globally, albeit slowly, and current steep yield curves may soon flatten, such risks may materialise in the near future. At the same time, weaknesses in the banking sector still exist, especially for some segments of the European banking sector. While the effects of changes in interest rates and their structure on financial institutions differ, recent changes in asset and funding structures of banks make them generally more vulnerable to a changing interest rate environment. Currency risk exposure has also grown, and regional concentration may pose specific risks. An unravelling of carry trades will have a negative effect on some institutions. Proper risk management can help during an adjustment process, and regulatory reforms underway will better support risk management functions in financial institutions that are, in any case, already adjusting to the new environment.

Highlights of Recent Trends in Financial Markets ¤ After some significant corrections in the second half of May and in early June, major equity markets have resumed their growth, in some cases regaining levels reached before the May-June contraction. Against a backdrop of healthy corporate balance sheets, robust earnings growth and low default rates, investor sentiment has remained positive, as reflected in these equity market developments and compressed credit spreads. However, there are signs of increasing nevousness, which include the May/June market turbulence and somewhat increased levels of historical and implied volatility. The increased nervousness may reflect in part downward revisions to economic forecasts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6>
Chapter 3. Long-Term Barriers to Economic Development ¤ What obstacles prevent the most productive technologies from spreading to less developed economies from the world’s technological frontier? In this paper, we seek to shed light on this question by quantifying the geographic and human barriers to the transmission of technologies. We argue that the intergenerational transmission of human traits, particularly culturally transmitted traits, has led to divergence between populations over the course of history. In turn, this divergence has introduced barriers to the diffusion of technologies across societies. We provide measures of historical and genealogical distances between populations, and document how such distances, relative to the world’s technological frontier, act as barriers to the diffusion of development and of specific innovations. We provide an interpretation of these results in the context of an emerging literature seeking to understand variation in economic development as the result of factors rooted deep in history.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3>
National Implementation and Enforcement of Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaties ¤ The act of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone (NWFZ) by a state is a sovereign right protected by Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations and Article VII of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). It is a step towards nuclear disarmament by restricting the areas on earth and in space where such weapons may be freely produced, moved, tested, stationed and used. It is a measure of national security for states that wish to distance their territory and their populations completely from the nuclear arms race, its implications and its effects on development, health and international relations. When the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (Treaty of Pelindaba) enters into force, probably this year, over half of the earth’s land mass and 119 countries will be protected in such zones.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068925-6>
Chapter 7. The Economics of Television and Online Video Markets ¤ Television is the dominant entertainment medium for hundreds of millions. This chapter surveys the economic forces that determine the production and consumption of this content. It presents recent trends in television and online video markets, both in the US and internationally, and describes the state of theoretical and empirical research on these industries. A number of distinct themes emerge, including the growing importance of the pay-television sector, the role played by content providers (channels), distributors, and negotiations between them in determining market outcomes, and concerns about the effects of market power throughout this vertical structure. It also covers important but unsettled topics including the purpose for and effects of both the old (Public Service Broadcasters) and the new (online video markets). Open theoretical and empirical research questions are highlighted throughout.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129410-5>
Chapter 27. The Economics of Migration in the Gulf Cooperation Council Countries ¤ The GCC countries are among the top destinations for foreign workers from neighboring Arab and Asian countries. The Gulf region is also the top remitter in the world. This chapter discusses the reasons that placed the GCC countries at the heart of the migration debate. To better understand the movements of people, the chapter presents a brief history of migration to the region with an analysis of labor market data. The chapter also examines the consequences of migration on the local and regional economies. The current challenges to the region are also discussed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4501977-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069332-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0>
Chapter 22 Income and Peer Quality Sorting in Public and Private Schools ¤ Any system of primary and secondary schools involves explicit or implicit mechanisms that ration not only financial but also nonfinancial inputs into education production. This chapter focuses primarily on such mechanisms as they relate to the sorting of parents and children into schools and classrooms. Three primary mechanisms are reviewed: (1) sorting that emerges through residential location choices within housing markets that are linked to schools; (2) sorting that arises from parental choices to send children to private rather than public schools; and (3) sorting within schools that results from explicit tracking policies. The equilibrium level of sorting (along parental income and child peer quality dimensions) then depends on both the specifics of how education production works and the overall characteristics of the general equilibrium environment within which schools operate. We review the theoretical as well as the related simulation-based literature in this area and suggest that much potential exists for increasing empirical relevance of the emerging models for policy analysis, particularly as a related empirical literature comes to better terms with the nature of peer effects in education production.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2>
Chapter 7 Positional rules of collective decision-making ¤ In this chapter, we seek to review some of the central concepts and results in the literature on positionalist voting rules, which goes back to Borda (1781) . After the introduction of the basic notation and definitions in earlier parts of the chapter, we explore in Section 3 the distinction between positionalist and non-positionalist social ranking rules and social decision rules. We define alternative notions of positionality and give several examples. Section 4 discusses the positionalist decision procedures in the context of the conditions figuring in Arrow's celebrated impossibility theorem and also in the context of the simple majority rule. In Section 5, we review the literature on the structure of the Borda ranking rule and the Borda decision rule. Some well-known axiomatic characterizations of the Borda ranking rule and the Borda decision rule are discussed here. In Section 6, we discuss some results on the structure of score-based ranking rules and score-based decision rules, which include, as special cases, the Borda ranking rule and the Borda decision rule, respectively. This section also contains a discussion of dominance-based scoring rules and social decision rules known as runoff systems. Section 7 concludes the chapter.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166306-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143069-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022393-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5>
What is holding back productivity growth in India? : Recent microevidence ¤ This article examines recent micro-evidence on the productivity of Indian firms, helping to explain why India’s manufacturing sector has not performed as well as many observers expected. A series of structural distortions are documented, all of which may depress the performance of manufacturing, and thus the economy as a whole. These distortions exist at multiple levels, and reflect long-standing problems with the reallocation of labour across sectors, the excessively small scale of firms, low firm turnover, poor product market integration, high industry concentration and persistent state ownership. Combined, these phenomena represent severe restraints on the level and growth of productivity in manufacturing, and suggest that much remains to be done to improve the strength and sustainability of India’s development path.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
Land Use Restrictions as Barriers to Entry ¤ The OECD Competition Committee debated competitive effects of land use restrictions in February 2008. Land use restrictions often serve valuable social purposes. The benefits of particular policies for land use must be balanced against the costs, though. The social harms that can arise when land use restrictions create “entry barriers” are rarely considered explicitly. Land use restrictions can raise the price and reduce supply of a broad range of real estate and, by preventing new and innovative stores from opening, reduce shopping options available to consumers. More careful integration of policy on land use restrictions with competition policy could benefit consumers and many entrepreneurs and reduce the likelihood that public or private restrictions will lead to supply scarcity. This roundtable examines competition problems affecting commercial construction and use permits, geographic density tests, adverse impact tests, access condition to rights of way and private restrictions on land use. Steps are identified for improving public policies towards land use restrictions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9>
Chapter 38 Agglomeration economies and urban public infrastructure ¤ This chapter reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on agglomeration economies and urban public infrastructure. Theory links the two concepts by positing that agglomeration economies exist when firms in an urban area share a public good as an input to production. One type of shareable input is the close proximity of businesses and labor, that generates positive externalities which in turn lower the production cost of one business as the output of other businesses increases. The externalities result from businesses sharing nonexcludable inputs, such as a common labor pool, technical expertise, general knowledge and personal contacts. Another perhaps more tangible type of shareable input is urban public infrastructure. Public capital stock, such as highways, water treatment facilities, and communication systems, directly affect the efficient operation of cities by facilitating business activities and improving worker productivity. The literature has devoted considerable attention to both topics, but not together. Studies of agglomeration economies in several countries find that manufacturing firms are more productive in large cities than in smaller ones. Studies of the effect of infrastructure on productivity show positive, but in some cases statistically insignificant, effects of public capital stock on productivity. Most of these studies are at the national and state levels. Only a handful of studies have focused on the metropolitan level, and even fewer have estimated agglomeration economies and infrastructure effects simultaneously. Results from studies that include both types of shared inputs suggest that both spatial proximity and physical infrastructure contribute positively to the productivity of firms in urban areas. More research is needed to explore the interrelationships between urban size and urban public infrastructure and to open the “black box” of agglomeration economies and estimate how the various other factors associated with urban size affect productivity.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1>

Chapter 7 Forecasting with Unobserved Components Time Series Models ¤ Structural time series models are formulated in terms of components, such as trends, seasonals and cycles, that have a direct interpretation. As well as providing a framework for time series decomposition by signal extraction, they can be used for forecasting and for ‘nowcasting’. The structural interpretation allows extensions to classes of models that are able to deal with various issues in multivariate series and to cope with non-Gaussian observations and nonlinear models. The statistical treatment is by the state space form and hence data irregularities such as missing observations are easily handled. Continuous time models offer further flexibility in that they can handle irregular spacing. The paper compares the forecasting performance of structural time series models with ARIMA and autoregressive models. Results are presented showing how observations in linear state space models are implicitly weighted in making forecasts and hence how autoregressive and vector error correction representations can be obtained. The use of an auxiliary series in forecasting and nowcasting is discussed. A final section compares stochastic volatility models with GARCH.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047390-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1>
Secondary market liquidity in domestic debt markets : Key policy conclusions ¤ The Tenth OECD/World Bank/IMF Annual Global Bond Market Forum highlighted that liquidity is a complex concept with different dimensions – micro liquidity vs. macro liquidity, market liquidity vs. funding liquidity, endogenous vs. exogenous liquidity, and so on. Relative liquidity (including ‘liquidity freezes or squeezes’) can best be explained by focusing on the market’s institutional structure, in particular the architecture of electronic trading platforms, the importance of OTC trading, the nature and width of the investor base, disclosure requirements, valuation methods, the role of primary dealers including market-making requirements or conventions, tax factors, and the role of issuers of government bonds and other fixed-income instruments in primary and secondary markets.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6>
Chapter 46 Contributions of National Agricultural Research Systems to Crop Productivity ¤ This chapter describes the impact of national agricultural research systems on the unfolding of the Green Revolution in four regions: Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Although international institutions contributed much of the research that led to the Green Revolution, national programs also proved important in the development and diffusion of modern varieties. This chapter documents the Green Revolutions that occurred in 11 food crops – wheat, rice, maize, barley, sorghum, millets, lentils, groundnuts, beans, cassava and potatoes. The chapter traces the overall role of national institutions and the growing importance of national agricultural research systems in the developing world. It also discusses the interaction of National Agricultural Research Systems and International Agricultural Research Centers, which have largely played complementary roles. Finally, it discusses the political economy of support for national agricultural research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4704302-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4>

Chapter 25 The political economy of intergenerational cooperation ¤ This chapter examines the scope for mutually beneficial intergenerational cooperation, and looks at various attempts to theoretically explain the emergence of norms and institutions that facilitate this cooperation. The contributions reviewed come from branches of economics as far apart as household economics and political economy, and encompass both the normative and the positive branch of public economics. Section 2 establishes a normative framework. Sections 3 and 4 examine the properties of the laissez-faire solution in a pure market economy, and in one where reproductive decisions and intra-family transfers are constrained by self-enforcing family constitutions. Section 5 introduces the state, and shows that first and second-best policy include a pension and a child benefit scheme. Section 6 rexamines the same issues in the presence of educational investment. Section 7 introduces uncertainty and asymmetrical information, and shows that second-best public transfers to families are conditional on number of children, and on some measure of the children's success in adult life. Section 8 looks at the possibility that intergenerational redistribution might be supported by some kind of political equilibrium. One type of model looks at the possibility of a self-enforcing constitution governing intergenerational transfers at societal rather than family level. Another type of model looks for voting equilibria in direct, and in representative democracies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057542-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133536-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129281-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020511-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184535-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4302876-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197971-0>
Chapter 70. Labor Regulations, Unions, and Social Protection in Developing Countries: Market Distortions or Efficient Institutions? ¤ This chapter reviews what economists have learned about the impact of labor market institutions, defined broadly as government regulations and union activity on labor outcomes in developing countries. It finds that: (1) Labor institutions vary greatly among developing countries but less than they vary among advanced countries. Unions and collective bargaining are less important in developing than in advanced countries while government regulations are nominally as important. (2) Many developing countries' compliance with minimum wage regulations produces spikes in wage distributions around the minimum in covered sectors. Most studies find modest adverse effects of the minimum on employment so that the minimum raises the total income of low-paid labor. (3) In many countries minimum wages spillover to the unregulated sector, producing spikes in the wage distributions there as well. (4) Employment protection regulations and related laws shift output and employment to informal sectors and reduce gross labor mobility. (5) Mandated benefits increase labor costs and reduce employment modestly while the costs of others is shifted largely to labor, with some variation among countries. (6) Contrary to the Harris-Todaro two-sector model in which rural-urban migration adjusts to produce a positive relation between unemployment and wages across regions and sectors, wages and unemployment are inversely related by the wage curve. (7) Unions affect nonwage outcomes as well as wage outcomes. (8) Cross-country regressions yield inconclusive results on the impact of labor regulations on growth while studies of country adjustments to economic shocks, such as balance of payments problems, find no difference in the responses of countries by the strength of labor institutions. (9) Labor institution can be critical when countries experience great change, as in China's growth spurt and Argentina's preservation of social stability and democracy after its 2001-2002 economic collapse. Cooperative labor relations tend to produce better economic outcomes. (10) The informal sector increased its share of the work force in the developing world in the past two decades. The persistence of large informal sectors throughout the developing world, including countries with high rates of growth, puts a premium on increasing our knowledge of how informal sector labor markets work and finding institutions and policies to deliver social benefits to workers in that sector.

Chapter 30 A Framework for Applied Dynamic Analysis in IO ¤ This paper reviews a framework for numerically analyzing dynamic interactions in imperfectly competitive industries. The framework dates back to Ericson and Pakes [1995. Review of Economic Studies 62, 53–82], but it is based on equilibrium notions that had been available for some time before, and it has been extended in many ways by different authors since. The framework requires as input a set of primitives which describe the institutional structure in the industry to be analyzed. The framework outputs profits and policies for every incumbent and potential entrant at each possible state of the industry. These policies can be used to simulate the distribution of sample paths for all firms from any initial industry structure. The sample paths generated by the model can be quite different depending on the primitives, and most of the extensions were designed to enable the framework to accommodate empirically relevant cases that required modification of the initial structure. The sample paths possess similar properties to those observed in (the recently available) panel data sets on industries. These sample paths can be used either for an analysis of the likely response to a policy or an environmental change, or as the model's implication in an estimation algorithm. We begin with a review of an elementary version of the framework and a report on what is known about its analytic properties. Much of the rest of the paper deals with computational issues. We start with an introduction to iterative techniques for computing equilibrium that are analogous to the techniques used to compute the solution to single agent dynamic programming problems. This includes discussions of the determinants of the computational burden of these techniques, and the mechanism implicitly used to select an equilibrium when multiple equilibria are possible. We then outline a number of techniques that might be used to reduce the computational burden of the iterative algorithm. This section includes discussions of both the implications of differences in modeling assumptions used in the alternative techniques, and a discussion of the likely relevance of the different techniques for different institutional structures. A separate section reports on a technique for computing multiple equilibria from the same set of primitives. The paper concludes with a review of applications of the framework and a brief discussion of areas where further development of the framework would seem warranted.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133311-1>
Chapter 1. Introduction to the Handbook ¤ In the chapters of the book Economics of Innovation, Volume 1, it is clear that this basic understanding of the importance of internally generated economic change for the progress of the economy and the weaknesses of static economic analysis in the face of this phenomenon occupies much of the research in innovation economics. A number of themes common to at least several of the chapters touch on this and related ideas. The first and perhaps the most important theme is the essential dynamism of the innovative process. Knowledge, inventions, and innovations created today build on those created in the past, and the benefits of an innovation are often not felt until it undergoes a dynamic, cumulative learning and diffusion process. An understanding of this phenomenon underlies almost all of the chapters and is perhaps most obvious in those by Thompson on learning by doing, Bresnahan on general-purpose technologies, Teece on the innovative firm, and Stoneman and Battista on diffusion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059252-2>
Chapter 34 Coordination Success in Non-cooperative Large Group Market Entry Games ¤ Subsequent experimental studies of the market entry game and his associates, which systematically manipulated the information structure of the game, compared behavior in the domains of gains and losses, or introduced private information and asymmetry between players, have shown that this magic is robust. Under a wide variety of experimental conditions, interacting players in large groups playing the market entry game with no communication among them rapidly achieve coordination success that is accounted for on the aggregate level by a Pareto deficient equilibrium solution. When the entry fee is private information, and only the distribution of entry fees in the population is known, the effects of asymmetry between players can be studied. Whether players are symmetric or not, each player is faced on each period with a binary choice between earning a fixed payoff, regardless of the actions taken by the other players, or an uncertain payoff which is a linear function of the difference cm.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1>
Review of Competition Law and Policy in Poland ¤ Poland’s 1990 competition law, which supported its transition restructuring, now substantively follows the rules of the EU treaty. But enforcement still focuses on abuses by successors to pre-reform monopolies. Competition enforcement agency by the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (OCCP) is combined with consumer protection and monitoring state aids, while Antimonopoly Court integrates regulatory policies by deciding cases about infrastructure regulation. Clarifying the OCCP’s independence from the government will support the integrity of law enforcement as well as a more publicly visible advocacy role.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9>
Chapter 7. Educational Vouchers in International Contexts ¤ International evidence on school choice largely focuses on educational voucher or voucher-like systems. The research to date primarily focuses on two complementary questions: what are the effects of school choice on students who exercise school choice? and what are the effects of school choice on the overall system that allows choice? In this chapter, we review the educational voucher focusing on these two research questions. We primarily focus on educational voucher programs in Chile, Colombia, and Sweden. We discuss each of these programs and the accompanying literature in depth. We briefly discuss research from other countries, especially ongoing research in India, which may provide key insights into voucher and school-choice debates. Although there are a number of similarities between research on school choice in the United States and abroad, research on school choice abroad presents an entirely different set of political circumstances, institutions, and funding schemes. We discuss these issues and their impact on generalizeability of international research. We also recommend future directions for voucher research, particularly, in identifying key components of voucher systems that have led to the observed effects to date.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2>
The Financial Policy Landscape : A Conceptual Overview ¤ This article discusses different aspects of the formulation of financial policy against the backdrop of a changing financial services landscape.

Chapter 3 World military expenditures ¤ Military expenditure is difficult to define. Major issues are functional versus institutional approaches to defense, indirect and intangible costs and benefits and current versus comprehensive accounting. Authoritative institutions have adopted standard definitions but national governments are free to use their own definitions. Specific inflation pressures complicate the creation of real time series of military expenditures. International comparisons are influenced by the choice of exchange rates. For some countries, no credible data are available. Data series on military expenditures and arms transfers must be used with caution as the publishing institutions have only limited resources to deal with the numerous conceptual and practical problems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132793-7>
Chapter 36 Equilibrium analysis with non-convex technologies ¤ This chapter surveys the state of the art regarding the ArrowDebreu model of a Walrasian economy, consisting of a finite number of agents and commodities where one assumes perfect information, complete markets, no market imperfections, such as externalities, public goods, or non-convexities in consumption or production; firms are price-taking profit maximizers, and households are price-taking utility maximizers. In such a world, the basic properties of the classical ArrowDebreu model consist of the existence of competitive equilibria, the first and second welfare theorems, the computation of equilibria, and the local uniqueness and finiteness of equilibria. The chapter discusses that it is useful to adopt Walras' original conception of a competitive equilibrium as a solution to a (nonlinear) system of equations. Convexity plays an essential role in Scarf's analysis, both in the derivation of the market excess demand function from optimizing behavior on the part of agents and in the existence of a fixed-point that follows from Brouwer's theorem. Scarf's algorithm and its generalizations are the primary means of doing comparative statics in general equilibrium models. Computable general equilibrium models have replaced activity analysis and inputoutput analysis as the basic method of analyzing tax policy in national economies or trade policies among nations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066472-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Credit: Some Macroeconomic, Market and Consumer Implications ¤ Financial consumers are facing paradoxical situations. On the one hand, they are overly solicited to use credits on various forms. On the other hand, segments of the population do not have access to credit. In this paper, we examine some emerging issues regarding consumer protection and information in four OECD countries: Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. These four countries have much in common but nevertheless develop their own specific experience. By comparing their recent experience we identify some questions of emerging importance.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3>
Chapter 21 Intertemporal Welfare Economics and the Environment ¤ I review the complex welfare economic issues that arise in environmental decision-making over very long periods, as in cases relating to climate change and biodiversity loss. I also consider the issues that arise in choosing a discount rate to apply to very long-run projects and indicate how such rates should be chosen.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3>
Chapter 15 The theory and the facts of how markets clear: Is industrial organization valuable for understanding macroeconomics? ¤ This chapter has presented a survey of what industrial economists know about how markets clear. The evidence on price behavior is sufficiently inconsistent with the simple theories of market clearing that industrial economists should be led to explore other paradigms. The most useful extensions of the theory will be those that recognize that marketing is a costly activity, that an impersonal price mechanism is not the only device used to allocate goods, and that price methods in conjunction with non-price methods are typically used to allocate goods. Exactly what macroeconomists can learn from all this is less clear to me. Since both macroeconomists and industrial economists are interested in the same question of how markets clear, I have no doubt that there is the potential for the two groups to influence each other's research. Whether that potential is realized depends in part on how some of the new areas of research in industrial organization develop.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133311-1>
Chapter 7 The economics of fertility in developed countries ¤ This chapter describes the intellectual development and the empirical implications of the literature on the economics of fertility as it applies to fertility behavior in developed economies. The chapter reviews the literature on dynamic models of fertility behavior over the parents' life cycle, and outlines the ways in which these models extend the static models and the implications that they provide for dimensions of fertility behavior. The chapter also discusses various solutions to the fundamental identification problems that arise in assessing the impact of prices and income on both lifetime and lifecycle fertility behavior. The theory and econometric methods are better developed than the empirical literature. The challenge is to find plausibly exogenous variation in proxies for the price and income concepts appearing in the theories. The chapter provides a taxonomy of possible identifying information and gives hope that additional progress can be made in advancing the empirical understanding of fertility behavior.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123185-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006294-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006292-2>
Chapter 45 Microeconomic perspectives on aggregate labor markets ¤ The chapter discusses the role played by labor market institutions in shaping the dynamics of wages, employment, and unemployment across European countries and the United States. The first part of the chapter uses simple, but formal models to show that the greater job security granted to European employees should smooth out aggregate employment dynamics but, for given wage processes, cannot be expected to reduce aggregate employment. Slow employment creation and high, persistent unemployment are associated with high and increasing wages in cross-country evidence, and the chapter surveys recent work aimed at explaining such differential wage dynamics via insider-outsider interactions and wage bargaining institutions. The following section discusses the extent to which job security provisions and wage-setting practices can rationalize evidence on cross-sectional job turnover and wage inequality, and reviews the implications of such phenomena for aggregate labor markets' productivity. The chapter is concluded by a discussion of recent perspectives on the possible determinants (rather than the effects) of institutional labor market differences across industrialized countries and over time.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127364-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9>
Evaluating the Effectiveness of Financial Education Programmes ¤ Policy makers in many countries are giving more attention to ‘financial literacy’ or ‘financial capability’, and there are many financial education programmes. The need to evaluate the effectiveness of these programmes is likely to increase. But little evaluation is currently taking place, and the evaluations made so far show mixed and inconclusive results. It is not clear whether this is a consequence of poor evaluation methods or poor programme design, or, that financial education works patchily. But it does mean that a positive impact from financial education has not been unambiguously proven; nor has a clear picture emerged of what works best and why. Evaluation of financial education is inherently difficult, and the impact of any one programme can probably never be fully isolated. Nevertheless, this paper suggests that evaluating the effectiveness of financial education can and should be improved. It begins to develop an approach to do so, including a Financial Education Evaluation (FEE) Framework which can be tailored for any programme in any country. This paper also suggests guidelines for governments and other public authorities to lead the way towards better evaluation of the benefits, costs and value for money of financial education.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3>
Chapter 29. Intergenerational Mobility in the Labor Market ¤ This chapter summarizes what has been learned from recent research on intergenerational transmission of earnings status. The chapter begins by using a simple theoretical model to highlight several key concepts. Then it reviews (and discusses the connections among) three related empirical literatures: on sibling correlations in earnings, on the intergenerational elasticity of offspring’s earnings with respect to parents’ earnings or income, and on neighborhood effects. 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Chapter 10 Strategy-Proof Equilibrium Behavior in Two-Sided Auctions ¤ The experimental evidence from three prominent auction trading institutions: (1) the continuous double auction, (2) the uniform-price sealed bid-offer auction, and (3) the uniform-price double auction (with continuous feedback of real time information on the acceptance status of bids and offers), shows that subjects are able to work out a behavioral equilibrium which is strategy-proof. In institutions (2) and (3) this is achieved by a groping process which (a) approximates the competitive equilibrium, and (b) produces a large number of bids and offers that are tied, or nearly tied. Impossibility theorems provide important insight as to why the above two-sided mechanisms have difficulty achieving perfection, but they do not address the question as to why such field mechanisms, when studied in the laboratory, perform so well in fact surprisingly well given the theorems and the fact that we observe massive underrevelation in the experiments.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1>
Chapter 38 Institutions and economic development ¤ This chapter discusses two propositions: (1) institutions matter and (2) the determinants of institutions susceptible to the tools of economic analysis. Transaction costs include the direct costs of obtaining information, negotiating among the parties to an agreement, and communicating all relevant provisions to the parties, as well as the indirect costs arising from the opportunistic behavior of economic entities in light of imperfect information and risks. The theory of collective action relates to the question of under what conditions is it advantageous for individual entities to participate in the collective action for development of new or modified institutions given the distribution of expected costs and benefits to the individual innovators and the possible externality and/or free rider problems. Research on institutions and institutional change in a country may contribute not only to the development of economic theory in general, but also to that of institutional reforms in that country.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213090-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7>
Chapter 17 The Exercise of Market Power in Laboratory Experiments ¤ Many aspects of antitrust policy are influenced by the possibility that sellers in concentrated markets may have the power to raise prices above competitive levels. Of course, anyone can raise prices, so the issue is whether a change in structure, e.g., a merger, will allow one or more sellers to raise price profitably. A price increase by one seller diverts sales to others, so a firm is more likely to have market power when its competitors have limited capacity to expand their sales. Thus a merger that reduces competitors' capacity may create market power. Market power can also be sensitive to the trading institution, and this is the context that power issues first arose in experimental economics. Relatively high prices in posted-offer auctions are not surprising, since experimental economists have long noticed that prices in such markets tend to be above competitive levels, and will converge from above if they converge at all.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2>
Chapter 4 The new empirics of economic growth ¤ We provide an overview of recent empirical research on patterns of cross-country growth. The new empirical regularities considered differ from earlier ones, e.g., the well-known Kaldor stylized facts. The new research no longer makes production function accounting a central part of the analysis. Instead, attention shifts more directly to questions like, Why do some countries grow faster than others? It is this changed focus that, in our view, has motivated going beyond the neoclassical growth model.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Chapter 2 Long-Term Trends in Schooling: The Rise and Decline (?) of Public Education in the United States ¤ In recent decades, there has been rising anxiety about the quality of the public education in the United States. However, it is important to note that this has not always been the case; in fact, the United States has long been a leader in terms of the public provision of education at all levels of schooling. This chapter documents this history, describing the conditions in the early years of the country that were conducive to the rise of universal public education, in particular the relative homogeneity of the population and the local nature of the provision of public education. These factors increased local support and enabled the educational system to be responsive to local needs. In more recent history, however, there has been substantial change in the demographics of the United States; this chapter also explores how well the public education system has been able to adapt to these changes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2>
Chapter 9. Recent Trends in Inequality and Poverty in Developing Countries ¤ This chapter reviews the empirical evidence on the levels and trends in income/consumption inequality and poverty in developing countries. It includes a discussion of data sources and measurement issues, evidence on the levels of inequality and poverty across countries and regions, an assessment of trends in these variables since the early 1980s, and a general discussion of their determinants. There has been tremendous progress in the measurement of inequality and poverty in the developing world, although serious problems of consistency and comparability still remain. The available evidence suggests that on average the levels of national income inequality in the developing world increased in the 1980s and 1990s and declined in the 2000s. There has been a remarkable fall in income poverty since the early 1980s, driven by the exceptional performance of China over the whole period and the generalized improvement in living standards in all the regions of the developing world in the 2000s.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7>
The continuing role of item-specific agreements in the IAEA safeguards system ¤ The International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) “safeguards system” serves as the foundation of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime, under which the IAEA acts as an auditor, monitor and inspector of state-administered nuclear energy programmes. The system consists of agreements and practices that enable the IAEA to gain a clear picture of a state’s nuclear activities in order to provide credible assurances that nuclear energy is used for exclusively peaceful purposes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068925-6>
Chapter 10. Levels of Reasoning in Keynesian Beauty Contests: A Generative Framework ¤ We introduce a generalization of the Beauty Contest (BC) game as a framework that incorporates different models from micro- and macroeconomics by formulating their reduced forms as special cases of the BC. Examples include public good games, ultimatum games, Bertrand, Cournot, some auctions, asset markets, New-Keynesian, and general equilibrium models with sentiments/animal spirits. This becomes feasible by considering BC specifications with a best response or optimal action as a function of other players' aggregated actions. For characterizing an integrated account of heterogeneity in economics, as observed in BC experiments, we employ a non-equilibrium model, the so-called “level-k” model, based on one (or more) reference point(s) and (limited) iterated best responses. Level-k and related models thus bridge the gap between non-strategic (e.g. irrational, intuitive or random) behavior and equilibrium choices. We also give a brief overview of interactive decision-making within experimental economics, and discuss elicitation methods, cognitive and population measures, to better understand heterogeneity in human reasoning in general, and in economic experiments in particular.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Chapter 48 Agricultural Innovation: Investments and Incentives ¤ Investments in R&amp;D and agricultural innovations have been fundamental to long-term economic growth worldwide. But global resource allocation has been uneven, with some developing countries closing in on developed-world scientific capacities, others regaining ground lost over the past decade or so, but, unfortunately, many others either stalled or slipping behind. Recently, substantial shifts in the scientific basis for much of biological research have created a new and promising set of opportunities for innovation in agricultural biotechnologies. Moreover, the institutional, regulatory and, especially, intellectual property regimes that affect agricultural R&amp;D are also undergoing rapid change, providing enhanced private incentives for applications of biotechnology in agriculture. But the nature of these developments is raising real concerns about the extent to which developing-country agriculture will be able to partake in the benefits offered by the advances in biotechnology. In this chapter we present an overview of the globally evolving structure of funding and performance of agricultural research. This establishes the special nature of agricultural research as a truly joint endeavor of North and South, and of the public and private sectors. We then sketch the economics of intellectual property protection – highlighting static and dynamic models and the effects of competition – and alternative incentives to innovate. A brief list of means that have been used or proposed for protecting intellectual property in agriculture is presented, followed by a discussion of the ongoing global evolution of the intellectual property environment and relevant institutions. Then we discuss instruments that are available for transacting intellectual property rights (IPRs), provide a quantitative view of trends in agricultural intellectual property protection worldwide, and end with a short conclusion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4704302-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4>
Chapter Twenty-Five. Strategyproof Social Choice ¤ This chapter surveys the literature on strategy proofness from a historical perspective.

Chapter 22 Public-sector labor markets ¤ This chapter discusses public-sector labor markets. One unique aspect of public-sector labor markets is that the laws governing impasse resolution vary across states. This provides an opportunity for researchers to estimate their effects on union/nonunion wage differentials, on wage levels, on the demand for labor, and on public/private pay differentials. However, other aspects of the legal environment that influence bargaining also differ across states; these include budget referenda requirements, expenditure and/or tax limitation legislation, balanced budget requirements, and agency shop provisions. Studies are required that consider all of these forces simultaneously and allow for the possibility that many of them are endogenously determined. A second unique aspect is that the unit of observation in public-sector studies often tends to be a bargaining unit, and the underlying union contracts in areas where bargaining takes place are typically available to researchers. Third, in spite of the rapid growth of collective bargaining in the public sector and the variety of institutional arrangements for determining wages in the sector, many studies of public-sector labor markets make no mention of the role of unions and/or the effects of the institutional arrangements.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3>
Debt Markets : Policy Challenges in the Post-Crisis Landscape ¤ Discussions at the 11th OECD-WBG-IMF Global Bond Market Forum focused on four key areas: i) the impact of crisis-related measures and the potential implications of exit; ii) the measurement of sovereign risk; iii) the determinants of investor demand; and iv) debt managers’ response to the crisis. Overall, participants felt that the steps taken to stabilise financial conditions had generally been effective and that conditions in financial markets were normalising. However, discussions highlighted a number of ongoing risks including: i) while credible consolidation plans were needed, fiscal and monetary policy would be tightened too soon; ii) managing investor uncertainty would prove critical in managing risk in the near-term; and (iii) regulatory changes might lead to a deterioration in conditions in primary and secondary markets and otherwise aggravate the challenges facing debt managers.

Preventing Market Abuses and Promoting Economic Efficiency, Growth and Opportunity ¤ Effective competition law and policy are critical to achieving greater levels of economic efficiency, growth, employment and living standards. Pro-competitive reform and sound competition law enforcement have delivered dramatic price reductions, a proliferation of new products, superior quality and service and enhanced innovation wherever they have been embraced. Perhaps more importantly, they have strong links with key pillars of economic growth and development such as investment, governance, the cultivation of an entrepreneurial class, privatisation and trade. Achieving a better appreciation and understanding of these benefits and links is essential to making continued progress in removing ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9>

Chapter 7. DSGE Models for Monetary Policy Analysis ¤ Monetary DSGE models are widely used because they fit the data well and they can be used to address important monetary policy questions. We provide a selective review of these developments. Policy analysis with DSGE models requires using data to assign numerical values to model parameters. The chapter describes and implements Bayesian moment matching and impulse response matching procedures for this purpose.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Chapter 9 Approximate Nonlinear Forecasting Methods ¤ We review key aspects of forecasting using nonlinear models. Because economic models are typically misspecified, the resulting forecasts provide only an approximation to the best possible forecast. Although it is in principle possible to obtain superior approximations to the optimal forecast using nonlinear methods, there are some potentially serious practical challenges. Primary among these are computational difficulties, the dangers of overfit, and potential difficulties of interpretation. In this chapter we discuss these issues in detail. Then we propose and illustrate the use of a new family of methods (QuickNet) that achieves the benefits of using a forecasting model that is nonlinear in the predictors while avoiding or mitigating the other challenges to the use of nonlinear forecasting methods.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047390-9>
Chapter 12 Inequality, poverty and welfare ¤ This chapter is concerned with issues arising from the construction of ethical measures of inequality and poverty. The recent literature on measurement of inequality and poverty emphasizes the close connection between social welfare functions and ethical indices of inequality and poverty. This chapter surveys the main issues in this literature. In particular, we discuss how indices of inequality can be constructed from social welfare functions, and vice versa. Other issues include the equivalence theorems which provide the analytical foundations of the approach which declares one distribution to be more equal than another only when all “sensible” measures agree on the ranking. The chapter also discusses the measurement of mobility. Finally, the chapter describes some of the parallel issues which arise in the measurement of poverty.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022393-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143069-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166306-8>
Chapter 4 Forecast Combinations ¤ Forecast combinations have frequently been found in empirical studies to produce better forecasts on average than methods based on the ex ante best individual forecasting model. Moreover, simple combinations that ignore correlations between forecast errors often dominate more refined combination schemes aimed at estimating the theoretically optimal combination weights. In this chapter we analyze theoretically the factors that determine the advantages from combining forecasts (for example, the degree of correlation between forecast errors and the relative size of the individual models' forecast error variances). Although the reasons for the success of simple combination schemes are poorly understood, we discuss several possibilities related to model misspecification, instability (non-stationarities) and estimation error in situations where the number of models is large relative to the available sample size. We discuss the role of combinations under asymmetric loss and consider combinations of point, interval and probability forecasts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047390-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Chapter 13. Attitudes to Income Inequality : Experimental and Survey Evidence ¤ We review the survey and experimental findings in the literature on attitudes to income inequality. We interpret the latter as any disparity in incomes between individuals. We classify these findings into two broad types of individual attitudes toward the income distribution in a society: the normative and the comparative view. The first can be thought of as the individual's disinterested evaluation of income inequality; on the contrary, the second view reflects self-interest, as individuals’ inequality attitudes depend not only on how much income they receive but also on how much they receive compared to others. We conclude with a number of extensions, outstanding issues, and suggestions for future research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7>
Chapter 14. Diffusion, Strategic Interaction, and Social Structure ¤ We provide an overview and synthesis of the literature on how social networks influence behaviors, with a focus on diffusion. We discuss some highlights from the empirical literature on the impact of networks on behaviors and diffusion. We also discuss some of the more prominent models of network interactions, including recent advances regarding interdependent behaviors, modeled via games on networks.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120990-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027266-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066514-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132883-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5>
Chapter 5 The Economic Theory of Gift-Giving: Perfect Substitutability of Transfers and Redistribution of Wealth ¤ This chapter reviews the theory of the voluntary public and private redistribution of wealth elaborated by economic analysis in the last forty years or so. The central object of the theory is altruistic gift-giving, construed as benevolent voluntary redistribution of income or wealth. The theory concentrates on lump-sum voluntary transfers, individual or collective, which aim at equalizing the distribution of wealth from altruistic reasons or sentiments (perfectly substitutable altruistic transfers). It implies: (i) the Pareto-inefficiency of the non-cooperative interaction of individual altruistic transfers; (ii) the neutralization of public transfers by individual altruistic transfers; (iii) and the crowding out of private altruistic transfers by Pareto-efficient public redistribution. The chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an informal overview of the general intent and content of the theory. Section 3 gives a first formal version of the theory in a one-commodity setup (pure distributive social system). Non-cooperative distributive equilibrium is characterized, and its fundamental properties of existence and determinacy are analyzed. Section 4 extends the definitions and fundamental properties of pure distributive social systems to general social systems that combine competitive market exchange with the non-cooperative altruistic transfers of individuals endowed with non-paternalistic interdependent preferences. Section 5 states the neutrality property in two versions of the theory successively: the general social systems of Section 4; and the important special case of the pure distributive social systems of Section 3, where the set of agents is partitioned in two subsets, namely, a subset of poor individuals with zero endowments and egoistic preferences, and a subset of rich individuals altruistic to the poor and indifferent to each other. Section 6 reviews the theory of Pareto-efficient redistribution in pure distributive social systems. Section 7 returns to the fundamental assumption of perfect substitutability of transfers through a selective review of theoretical models of imperfectly substitutable transfers and empirical tests of perfect substitutability.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184535-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020511-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057542-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4302876-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129281-9>
National Legislative and Regulatory Activities ¤ One amendment changes the funding of the activities of the Federal Agency for Nuclear Control (FANC) whereby part of the fees is transformed into taxes.

Chapter 22 Economics of Conflict: An Overview ¤ In this chapter, we review the recent literature on conflict and appropriation. Allowing for the possibility of conflict, which amounts to recognizing the possibility that property rights are not perfectly and costlessly enforced, represents a significant departure from the traditional paradigm of economics. The research we emphasize, however, takes an economic perspective. Specifically, it applies conventional optimization techniques and game-theoretic tools to study the allocation of resources among competing activities – productive and otherwise appropriative, such as grabbing the product and wealth of others as well as defending one's own product and wealth. In contrast to other economic activities in which inputs are combined cooperatively through production functions, the inputs to appropriation are combined adversarially through technologies of conflict. A central objective of this research is to identify the effects of conflict on economic outcomes: the determinants of the distribution of output (or power) and how an individual party's share can be inversely related to its marginal productivity; when settlement in the shadow of conflict and when open conflict can be expected to occur, with longer time horizons capable of inducing conflict instead of settlement; how conflict and appropriation can reduce the appeal of trade; the determinants of alliance formation and the importance of intra-alliance commitments; how dynamic incentives for capital accumulation and innovation are distorted in the presence of conflict; and the role of governance in conflict management.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065004-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115806-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132793-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063255-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134192-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134037-1>

Chapter 26. The Labor Market in Computable General Equilibrium Models ¤ This chapter reviews options of labor market modeling in a computable general equilibrium framework. On the labor supply side, two principal modeling options are distinguished and discussed: aggregated, representative households and microsimulation based on individual household data. On the labor demand side, we focus on the substitution possibilities between different types of labor in production. With respect to labor market coordination, we discuss several wage-forming mechanisms and involuntary unemployment.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224214-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065341-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210294-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6>
Chapter 6. The Design of Performance Pay in Education ¤ This chapter analyzes the design of incentive schemes in education while reviewing empirical studies that evaluate performance pay programs for educators. Several themes emerge. First, education officials should not use one assessment system to create both educator performance metrics and measures of student achievement. To mitigate incentives for coaching, incentive systems should employ assessments that vary in both format and item content. Separate no-stakes assessments provide more reliable information about student achievement because they create no incentives for educators to take hidden actions that contaminate student test scores. Second, relative performance schemes are too rare in education. These schemes are more difficult to manipulate than systems built around psychometric or subjective performance standards. Third, assessment-based incentive schemes are mechanisms that complement rather than substitute for systems that promote parental choice, e.g. vouchers and charter schools.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2>
Chapter 23. Computing General Equilibrium Theories of Monopolistic Competition and Heterogeneous Firms ¤ This chapter considers alternatives to the Armington formulation of international trade found in most computable general equilibrium (CGE) models. International trade structures consistent with the monopolistic competition models suggested by Krugman (1980) and Melitz (2003) are presented in a computational setting. The Melitz structure of heterogeneous firms is particularly appealing given its consistency with micro-level findings on firm sizes and export behavior. We broaden the accessibility of these advanced trade theories for CGE modelers, and strengthen the link between contemporary CGE analysis and the broader trade community. Small-scale examples of all three theories (Armington, Krugman and Melitz) are introduced under a unified treatment. This is helpful in translating the advanced theories into an environment that is more familiar to CGE modelers. It is also helpful in showing how the different approaches affect outcomes, in a relatively transparent setting. Moving to an applied setting, we offer our approach to calibration and computation of models that include the Melitz heterogeneous firms structure. Our applications include an analysis of economic integration and subglobal climate policy in a model calibrated to the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) data. We do find that the heterogeneous firms structure matters for conclusions drawn from empirical CGE analysis. In our analysis of economic integration we find endogenous entry leading to important variety effects. We also find important productivity effects related to the competitive selection of more productive firms. In our examination of subglobal climate policy we see substantial trade diversion in the Melitz structure. This exacerbates the problem of carbon leakage and impacts the emissions yields from carbon-based tariffs.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224214-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210294-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065341-9>
Chapter Three. The Economics of Risky Health Behaviors ¤ Risky health behaviors such as smoking, drinking alcohol, drug use, unprotected sex, and poor diets and sedentary lifestyles (leading to obesity) are a major source of preventable deaths. This chapter overviews the theoretical frameworks for, and empirical evidence on, the economics of risky health behaviors. It describes traditional economic approaches emphasizing utility maximization that, under certain assumptions, result in Pareto-optimal outcomes and a limited role for policy interventions. It also details non-traditional models (e.g. involving hyperbolic time discounting or bounded rationality) that even without market imperfections can result in suboptimal outcomes for which government intervention has greater potential to increase social welfare. The chapter summarizes the literature on the consequences of risky health behaviors for economic outcomes such as medical care costs, educational attainment, employment, wages, and crime. It also reviews the research on policies and strategies with the potential to modify risky health behaviors, such as taxes or subsidies, cash incentives, restrictions on purchase and use, providing information, and restricting advertising. The chapter concludes with suggestions for future research. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
International licensing and the strengthening of intellectual property rights in developing countries during the 1990s ¤ Global intellectual property reform has been underway since the early 1990s (Box 1). With respect to international trade, a central pillar of the reform is the World Trade Organisation’s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement (TRIPS) that came into effect on 1 January 1995. Clearly, a strengthening of intellectual property laws worldwide can benefit those in industrialised nations who own most of the intellectual properties (e.g. copyrights on books, music, and software, patent rights on inventions, and trademark rights on business symbols and names).....	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2>
Chapter 21 Rules versus discretion in monetary policy ¤ Discretionary monetary policy has long been an anomaly to liberal economists. Henry Simons addressed the issue in his classic paper Rules versus Authorities in Monetary Policy. This chapter discusses the gold standard as a quasi-automatic monetary policy regime and alternative monetary rules are also examined. The modern literature centered on the concept of dynamic inconsistency and its relevance to the rules versus discretion debate is discussed in the chapter. A pure gold standard is a fully automatic monetary system. The specie-flow mechanism in which the money stock adjusts through the balance of payments reveals the equilibrating tendencies inherent in the system. With all goods traded and their prices equalized worldwide, adjustment comes purely through wealth effects as the outflow of gold from a country with a current account deficit reduces the flow of spending in that country. The pre-1977 arguments of principle for rules lacked any convincing demonstration that rules might systematically be better than discretion. This demonstration came with the dynamic inconsistency literature.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2>
Chapter 7 Cartels, collusion, and horizontal merger ¤ This chapter discusses the principal theoretical and practical problems of the economics of cartels, collusion, and horizontal merger. Because the new theoretical approaches are not easily modified to encompass welfare considerations, except in a very partial-equilibrium setting, the positive side of the analysis has received more weight than the normative. The principal factors that facilitate or hinder collusion are considered. The chapter discusses the types and extent of horizontal collusion. The principal forms of explicit agreement are cartels, joint ventures, and horizontal mergers. Empirical tests of factors that facilitate or hinder collusion are of two sorts: econometric and experimental. In a series of experiments described in the chapter, the pricing performance of an industry with and without certain types of contractual clauses, advance notice of price changes, and public price posting are compared. The combination of these practices is sufficient to raise price significantly above the level observed when the practices are removed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133311-1>
Chapter 55 Testing Theories of Other-regarding Behavior: A Sequence of Four Laboratory Studies ¤ This chapter describes a sequence of four experiments. The hypotheses tested are all informed by one or more of the aforementioned types of models. Each experiment builds on the findings of the previous experiment in the sequence. At the same time, each experiment involves a different game, thereby allowing us to study the phenomenon from a variety of perspectives. While some of the models that this chapter examines get important features of the data correct, none is completely satisfactory. What emerges from this sequence of experiments is a set of empirical regularities that should provide some useful guidance to the construction of more accurate models. This chapter found that preferences for distribution, independent of considerations of intentions, are sufficient to explain contributions in a simple dilemma game. The solidarity game and a linear public goods game proved sensitive to East German/West German cultural differences, but not so much so that it changes the qualitative features of giving.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1>
Chapter 13. Ambiguity and Ambiguity Aversion ¤ The phenomena of ambiguity and ambiguity aversion , introduced in Daniel Ellsberg’s seminal 1961 article, are ubiquitous in the real world and violate both the key rationality axioms and classic models of choice under uncertainty. In particular, they violate the hypothesis that individuals’ uncertain beliefs can be represented by subjective probabilities (sometimes called personal probabilities or priors ). This chapter begins with a review of early notions of subjective probability and Leonard Savage’s joint axiomatic formalization of expected utility and subjective probability. It goes on to describe Ellsberg’s classic urn paradoxes and the extensive experimental literature they have inspired. It continues with analytical descriptions of the numerous (primarily axiomatic) models of ambiguity aversion which have been developed by economic theorists, and concludes with a discussion of some current theoretical topics and newer examples of ambiguity aversion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120934-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135592-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070864-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186957-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050133-4>
Chapter 31 Computational Laboratories for Spatial Agent-Based Models ¤ An agent-based model is a virtual world comprising distributed heterogeneous agents who interact over time. In a spatial agent-based model the agents are situated in a spatial environment and are typically assumed to be able to move in various ways across this environment. Some kinds of social or organizational systems may also be modeled as spatial environments, where agents move from one group or department to another and where communications or mobility among groups may be structured according to implicit or explicit channels or transactions costs. This chapter focuses on the potential usefulness of computational laboratories for spatial agent-based modeling. Speaking broadly, a computational laboratory is any computational framework permitting the exploration of the behaviors of complex systems through systematic and replicable simulation experiments. By that definition, most of the research discussed in this handbook would be considered to be work with computational laboratories. A narrower definition of computational laboratory (or comp lab for short) refers specifically to specialized software tools to support the full range of agent-based modeling and complementary tasks. These tasks include model development, model evaluation through controlled experimentation, and both the descriptive and normative analysis of model outcomes. The objective of this chapter is to explore how comp lab tools and activities facilitate the systematic exploration of spatial agent-based models embodying complex social processes critical for social welfare. Examples include the spatial and temporal coordination of human activities, the diffusion of new ideas or of infectious diseases, and the emergence and ecological dynamics of innovative ideas or of deadly new diseases.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011152-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5>
Competition and Regulation Issues in Telecommunications: Synthesis ¤ The telecommunications industry has been transformed by increasingly vigorous competitive activity in an environment of rapid technical and regulatory change. As new technologies grow and as competitors enter and expand, firms often seek access to the networks of their competitors. The rules for connecting networks can be critical for the success of new and established networks and can have significant effects on investment. In fact, the most complex questions facing regulators in a potentially competitive telecommunications market are frequently focused on the conditions of access of one network to another’s network. One reason these problems are severe is that, as long as subscribers are only connected to one network, that network has a monopoly over calls that terminate with its subscribers, even if different networks might have competed to obtain that subscriber...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Chapter 12 Trade policies in developed countries ¤ Modern policy-oriented analysis of trade issues in developed countries focuses mainly on five sets of questions. This chapter discusses the differences in the levels of protection among industries. The industry and economy wide effects of trade liberalization on economic welfare, trade, output, employment and the distribution of income are discussed, and the effectiveness of the government policies are introduced for the purpose of assisting the economic adjustment to increased import. The chapter also discusses the economic effects of discriminatory tariff arrangements such as customs unions and the generalized system of preferences. The economic impact of specific nontariff measures, such as quantitative restrictions, preferential government purchasing policies, export, domestic subsidies, countervailing duties, dumping and antidumping duties, and domestic content requirements are reviewed. The chapter further discusses institutional arrangements and policies that maintain order in the international trading system and in the management of trade-policy conflict. Representative studies are cited with a view to establishing the main research results and suggesting issues on which further research is needed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0>
Residential Mobility and Public Policy in OECD Countries ¤ Residential mobility is closely tied to the functioning of housing markets and has important implications for labour mobility and the efficient allocation of resources across the economy. This paper analyses patterns of residential mobility across OECD countries and the role of housing policies in enhancing or hampering residential mobility. Based on cross-sectional household data for 25 countries, the results suggest that differences in residential mobility across countries are partially related to differences in public policies. After controlling for household and country- specific characteristics, residential mobility is higher in countries with lower transaction costs, more responsive housing supply, lower rent controls and tenant protection. Residential mobility tends also to be higher in environments with greater access to credit, suggesting that financial deregulation – by lowering borrowing costs and facilitating access to mortgage finance – facilitates mobility. This cross- country evidence is supported by city and state-level evidence for the United States. JEL classification: R23, R31, R21, R38, H20.

Chapter 46 Reciprocity in Ultimatum and Dictator Games: An Introduction ¤ This chapter presents data based on treatment manipulations intended to affect subjects' expectations about others' behavior, and degree of social isolation (anonymity) from the experimenter and others who might see the results, holding constant subject anonymity with respect to each other .The standard economic/game theoretic model predicts that the (conscious) reasoning process that applies to social exchange optimization in the self interest against other presumed self-interested protagonists applies also to coalitional relations, games against nature and other content-specific decision problems. Of course, this paradigm makes provision for cooperative behavior in repeat play interaction, but such outcomes emerge out of reward and threat possibilities, that channel the self-interest into longer term betterment over time. According to game theory, such behavior is strictly ruled out in any one-shot game, unless one postulates a taste (utility) for fairness, a topic to which we shall return after introducing our experimental design and results.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Chapter 4. Peer Effects in Education: How Might They Work, How Big Are They and How Much Do We Know Thus Far? ¤ This chapter summarizes the recent literature on peer effects in student outcomes at the elementary, secondary, and post-secondary levels. Linear-in-means models find modest sized and statistically significant peer effects in test scores. But the linear-in-means model masks considerable heterogeneity in the effects experienced by different types of students. Using nonlinear models, one prevalent finding is larger peer effects in which high ability students benefit from the presence of other high ability students. Studies that stratify students by race and ability often find that students are affected both by the racial composition of their peers and by the achievement of their same-race peers. At the university level, several studies find modest sized effects from dormmate and roommate background on own academic performance. For both university and high school students, the measured peer effects on “social” outcomes such as drinking are larger than the effects on academic outcomes. Many authors find substantial peer effects in drinking, drug use, and criminal behavior. This chapter suggest areas for future investigation and data collection.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2>
The Stock Market, the Housing Market and Consumer Behaviour ¤ After the buoyancy of stock markets in the late nineties, share prices have generally trended downwards since 2001. By contrast, house prices have continued to increase, rising more rapidly than the general price level in several countries. These developments have led to renewed interest in the impact of asset prices on consumption and overall demand. This paper analyses the roles of household financial wealth and housing wealth across G7 countries (with the exception of Germany), in determining private consumption. It provides some estimates of the sensitivity of consumption to various forms of wealth and tests whether these sensitivities have changed over time. The impacts of recent financial and housing market developments on consumption are also quantified. The main results are, first, that for all countries, wealth channels are identified, second, that these effects vary significantly across countries, and third that for some countries, their importance has tended to rise markedly over the recent past.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>

Chapter Six. Who Ordered That? The Economics of Treatment Choices in Medical Care ¤ In the United States, two patients with the same medical condition can receive drastically different treatments. In addition, the same patient can walk into two physicians’ offices and receive equally disparate treatments. This chapter attempts to understand why. It focuses on three areas: the patient, the physician, and the clinical situation. Specifically, the chapter surveys patient or demand-side factors such as price, income, and preferences; physician or supply-side factors such as specialization, financial incentives, and professionalism; and situational factors including behavioral influences and systems-level factors that play a role in clinical decision making. This chapter reviews theory and evidence, borrowing heavily from the clinical literature.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Chapter 30. Understanding Inflation as a Joint Monetary–Fiscal Phenomenon ¤ We develop the theory of price-level determination in a range of models using both ad hoc policy rules and jointly optimal monetary and fiscal policies and discuss empirical issues that arise when trying to identify monetary–fiscal regime. The chapter concludes with directions in which theoretical and empirical developments may go.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Chapter 19 The economics of disarmament ¤ The economics of disarmament is a new discipline. It involves analyses on the economic causes of the arms race, the definitions of disarmament and the economic determinants and military expenditure. Simultaneously, disarmament is considered as an obstacle to economic development, a peace dividend or an investment. The construction of economic models of disarmament produces some controversial results. Questions arise concerning the economic effects of a reduction in military expenditure on growth, employment, inflation, budget deficits, the costs of conversion or the dual use of military products, capital capacity and R&amp;D. Long term disarmament needs a development process and an adequate public policy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132793-7>
Chapter 8. A Survey of Venture Capital Research ¤ This survey reviews the growing body of academic work on venture capital. It lays out the major data sources used. It examines the work on venture capital investments in companies, looking at issues of selection, contracting, post-investment services, and exits. The survey considers recent work on organizational structures of venture capital firms, and the relationship between general and limited partners. It discusses the work on the returns to venture capital investments. It also examines public policies, and the role of venture capital in the economy at large.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4508395-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269795-5>
The subprime crisis : Size, deleveraging and some policy options ¤ The paper revises our previous USD 300 bn estimate for mortgage related losses to a range of USD 350-420 bn. In doing this the paper explicitly rejects the previous approach based on implied defaults from ABX pricing, because these prices are affected by illiquidity and extreme volatility; they will likely lead to misleading estimates of losses. Instead it builds a proper default model approach and allows for recovery of collateral via house sales over time. The paper separates out the losses due to commercial banks in the US, and goes on to look at the implied deleveraging required to meet capital standards. It could take 6-12 months for banks to offset losses via earnings alone, depending on Fed rate cuts and the dividend policy of banks. Since even more capital than this is required if banks were to expand their balance sheets, the paper looks at possibilities for capital injections from groups like sovereign wealth funds; and it also looks at a novel plan for the use of public money with an RTC-style approach and the issue of zero coupon bonds. Finally the paper looks at the issues of moral hazard, the likely size of the impact in Europe and Asia and non-bank corporate leverage.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3>
Country review of Argentina ¤ The Inter-American Development Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development co-operate in competition law and policy to promote increased economic growth, employment and economic efficiency and a higher average standard of living in the medium to long term. There is increasing consensus that sound competition law and policy are essential to achieving these goals. “Peer review” is a core element of OECD work. The mechanisms of peer review vary, but it is founded upon the willingness of all OECD countries and their partners to submit their laws and policies to substantive questioning by other members. This process provides valuable insights to the reviewed country and promotes transparency and mutual understanding for the benefit of all. The benefits of this process are particularly clear in the area of competition law and policy. As a result of the activities of the Competition Committee, OECD countries that once had real conflicts on competition issues have become partners in seeking to halt harmful international anticompetitive practices. The Committee has also become an important forum for assessing and demonstrating the usefulness of applying competition policy principles to economic and other regulatory systems. IDB/OECD co-operation in competition law and policy centers on annual meetings of the Latin American Competition Forum. LACF meetings include substantive roundtable discussions and peer reviews of national laws and institutions. The peer reviews have examined Brazil, Chile, Peru and now Argentina. The IDB is pleased to participate and finance this work, as part of its efforts to promote a better business climate for investment in the counties of Latin America and the Caribbean. We want to thank the Government of Argentina for volunteering to be peer reviewed at the fourth LACF meeting, held in San Salvador, El Salvador, on 11-12 July, 2006. It was encouraging to hear Argentina’s Delegation confirm at the meeting that the report’s recommendations were helpful and to hear from Delegates of other countries that this review has improved their understanding of Argentina’s competition law and policy. Finally, we want to thank Mr. John Clark, the author of the report, and the many competition officials whose written and oral contributions to the Forum have been so important to its success.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9>
Chapter 53 Health Economics for Low-Income Countries ¤ Good health is a determinant of economic growth and a component of the well-being of the population. This chapter discusses and synthesizes economic models of individual and household behavior, showing how the models may be used to illuminate health policy making in low-income countries. The models presented could help address questions such as: How can the health of the poor be improved, and what are the economic consequences of better health? What policies would improve intra-household distribution of health outcomes? It is argued that health economics research can provide information of relevance to health policies in low-income countries, if it were to take into account specific institutional contexts in which economic agents in these countries operate. Although institutions are universal, their type and extent of development differ across countries, and differ as well, in their effects on economic behavior. An important mechanism by which institutions affect health is through their effects on demand for health production inputs. Cooperative and noncooperative household models for analyzing intra-family allocations of health production inputs are reviewed, stressing the role institutions play in accounting for differences in levels of health and health care among individuals and across countries. Next, examples of application of nonexperimental and experimental approaches to estimation of economic and social impacts of better health in low-income countries are presented. Two main results emerge from the examples. First, health in low-income countries can be improved through implementation of simple interventions, such as provision of communities with basic social services, supplementation of normal household diets with micronutrients, deworming of school children, and cash transfers to families conditional on illness prevention and health promotion behaviors. Second, there are large returns to health investments. However, since placement and utilization of health interventions may not be random with respect to health status (clinics for instance may be constructed in high morbidity villages and then used more intensively by educated people with fewer health problems than illiterate individuals), estimated direct impacts of better health may be contaminated by indirect effects of other factors. The chapter shows how IV regression methods and randomized experiments have been used to resolve this endogeneity problem. Since its emergence as a disease in 1981, HIV/AIDS has become a major health problem in low-income countries, especially in Africa. The chapter illustrates how information generated by demand for HIV counseling and testing can be used to control the disease through mechanisms such as: treating pregnant women to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus from mother to child, targeting preventive measures and messages to individuals according to their HIV status, and timely treatment of AIDS-patients. Issues of industrial organization of health care, such as public provision of treatment, managed care, and national health insurance are briefly considered. The chapter concludes with a discussion of policy options for improving health in low-income countries.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213090-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7>
Chapter 23. The Welfare State and Antipoverty Policy in Rich Countries ¤ The aim of this chapter is to highlight some key aspects of recent economic research on the welfare state and antipoverty policy in rich countries and to explore their implications. We begin with the conceptualization and measurement of poverty before sketching out some core features and approaches to the welfare state and antipoverty policies. We then focus on the central plank of the modern welfare state's efforts to address poverty—namely, social protection, discussing in turn the inactive working-age population, child income support, in-work poverty, and retirement and old-age pensions. After that we discuss social spending other than cash transfers, the labor market, education, training and activation, and, finally, intergenerational transmission, childhood, and neighborhoods. We also discuss the welfare state and antipoverty policy in the context of the economic crisis that began in 2007–2008 and the implications for strategies aimed at combining economic growth and employment with making serious inroads into poverty. We conclude with directions for future research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7>
The status of radioactive waste repository development in the United States  December 2011 ¤ The current state of affairs concerning development in the United States of a permanent repository for disposal of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and high-level radioactive waste (HLW) is, in a word, uncertain. The President of the United States has asserted that he believes licensing and development of the Yucca Mountain repository should be abandoned, while other important parties believe licensing and development should continue. And not surprisingly, there is a disagreement as to what the law requires and whether the licensing process for the Yucca Mountain repository can be terminated at this point, even if the President would like for that to happen. The future of Yucca Mountain, and the future of radioactive waste disposal in the United States generally, currently are pending before the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and eventually the Supreme Court of the United States may decide some of the important legal issues concerning Yucca Mountain’s future. The November 2012 US elections also likely will have a significant impact on future radioactive waste repository development.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068925-6>
Chapter 17. New Perspectives on Gender ¤ Psychological and socio-psychological factors are now more commonly discussed as possible explanations for gender differences in labor market outcomes. We first describe the (mainly) laboratory-based evidence regarding gender differences in risk preferences, in attitudes towards competition, in the strength of other-regarding preferences, and in attitudes towards negotiation. We then review the research that has tried to quantify the relevance of these factors in explaining gender differences in labor market outcomes outside of the laboratory setting. We also describe recent research on the relationship between social and gender identity norms and womens labor market choices and outcomes, as well as on the role of child-rearing practices in explaining gender identity norms. Finally, we report on some recent work documenting puzzling trends in womens well-being and discuss possible explanations for these trends, including identity considerations. We conclude with suggestions for future research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127364-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8>
Chapter 10. Financing in Developing Countries ¤ This chapter reviews and synthesizes theoretical and empirical research on the role of finance in developing countries. First, the paper presents the stylized facts about firms in developing nations as well as the legal, financial, and broader institutional framework in which these firms operate. Next, the paper focuses on the financing choices available to small and medium firms in developing countries and highlights areas needing additional research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4508395-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269795-5>
Chapter 9. The Political Economy of Education Funding ¤ In most countries, the government is the main provider of education services. Even when a private education sector exists, it is often subsidized. Given the substantial involvement of governments in the education sector and the importance of skill acquisition for individual and national welfare, understanding how societies allocate public resources for education is a crucial issue. The purpose of this chapter is to review positive models of public funding for education. Models reviewed in this chapter consist of a private layer and a political economy layer. In the private layer, firms and households make their decisions taking as given the public policies. In the political economy layer, voters or groups with conflicting interests determine the public policy, taking into account the private sector response to the policy. The questions addressed by the models in this chapter include: What is the majority preferred level of funding for public education when private options are available? How do various dimensions of household heterogeneity (e.g., income, age, ability, tastes) alter the political equilibrium? What is the level of public funding in each community when households can sort themselves into multiple communities? Why are large-scale vouchers in education so rare across the world? Why are public education expenditures as a fraction of GDP rising along the development path? The focus of this chapter is theory, but calibrated versions of the theory that rely on empirical work are also included. We also review the empirical evidence that has bearing on the theoretical models in this chapter.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2>
Chapter 21 Economics of Defense in a Globalized World ¤ In a world continuously beset by conflict and violence, the positive study of international security and defense has developed rapidly over the past decade as a cohesive discipline within economics. Part of the cause for this trend is the revolutionary effects of globalization and its new challenges to world security and stability. The challenges to security now come from new sources; they threaten new dangers, and require new instruments and concepts from us. The field of play for defense economics has thus greatly increased, but the opportunity to exploit new insights from throughout economics grown accordingly. This essay aspires to show how the recent developments in models of international political economy relate to study of this phenomenal evolution of the world's strategic situation and challenges to its safety. Here I give one perspective on the contributions expected of defense economics in a globalized world where old patterns of thinking risk obsolescence. Emphasis is focused on (a) how the field is changing, and the relation between new security challenges and required new analytic approaches, (b) how developing ideas about conflict, predation and governance have entered into and greatly influenced defense economics, and (c) how this raises questions over what should be retained from study of earlier eras and what discarded.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115806-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065004-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132793-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134192-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134037-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063255-6>
Chapter 17. An Econometric Approach to General Equilibrium Modeling ¤ The first objective of this chapter is to present a new approach to econometric modeling of producer behavior. Our key contribution is to represent the rate and biases of technical change by unobservable or latent variables. We also divide the rate of technical change between components that are induced by changes in prices and those that are autonomous and not affected by prices. In our dataset, production is disaggregated into 35 separate commodities produced by one or more of the 35 industries making up the US economy. Our second objective is to present a new econometric model of aggregate consumer behavior. The model allocates full wealth among time periods for households distinguished by demographic characteristics, and determines the within-period demands for leisure, consumer goods and services. An important feature of our approach is the development of a closed-form representation of aggregate demand and labor supply that accounts for the heterogeneity in household behavior that is observed in micro-level data. Our model of producer behavior is the supply side of general equilibrium models of the US. The aggregate demand functions are important components of the demand side. These general equilibrium models are used to analyze the consequences of a broad spectrum of public policies. These applications are discussed in more detail in Chapter 8 of this Handbook. The third objective of the chapter is to demonstrate an important benefit of the econometric approach to parameterization. The parameter covariances obtained in the course of estimation can be used to construct confidence intervals for endogenous variables in general equilibrium models. Confidence intervals characterize the precision of modeling results more rigorously and systematically than traditional sensitivity analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065341-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210294-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224214-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
Chapter 14 Asset markets, exchange rates and the balance of payments ¤ This chapter reviews developments in international monetary economics from the late 1960s through the early 1980s. It discusses that the “monetary approach to the balance of payments” was the economic determinants of the behavior of the balance of payments, especially, the theoretical elaboration and empirical investigation of the dynamic mechanism of balance of payments adjustment. Recent research on macroeconomics, for both closed and open economies, expresses far less confidence in the ability of governments to systematically affect levels of national income and consistently maintain full employment through policy manipulation. The chapter discusses that in earlier work on exchange rate theory, the condition for equilibrium in the flow market for foreign exchange transactions has been regarded as the proximate determinant of the exchange rate. In some analyses, expectations of future exchange rates had an important influence on current exchange rates by affecting speculative capital flows. The chapter also provides modern analysis of the dynamics of balance of payments adjustment under fixed exchange rates beginning with a simple exposition of the key elements of the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment. Finally, the chapter also deals with the theory of flexible exchange rates. The evolution of the international monetary system from a regime of pegged exchange rates into a regime of flexible rates resulted in a renewed interest in the theory of exchange rate determination.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0>
Senegal: Making Better Use of Agribusiness Potential ¤ Senegal is a showcase of donors’ support to horticultural export development in sub-Saharan Africa. The first direct donor support to the Senegalese horticultural value chain dates back to 1998, with the World Bank-funded Agricultural Export Promotion Project (PPEA). Early recognition of the need to tackle the whole agricultural value chain, from inputs to production, processing and marketing, characterises donors’ support to the agricultural sector in Senegal. Facing declining traditional export sectors, groundnuts and fishing, Senegal has been undergoing a difficult transition process from traditional to commercial agriculture over the past decade. The 1994 devaluation of the CFA franc has benefited Senegal’s fruit and vegetables sub-sector, which presents the main hope of diversifying the country’s agricultural export structure. Consequently, the primary sector grew annually at an average 6.2 per cent between 2002 and 2005, which was much higher than real annual GDP growth. The chapter shows that aid to the agricultural sector has been proving positive in supporting the Senegalese government’s new sectoral development principle, the Accelerated Growth Strategy (SCA). Senegal has started to attract foreign investment in the export-oriented horticultural sector. Moreover, small and medium-sized horticultural producers and exporters, better organised and more empowered, have succeeded in increasing production and export volume, while simultaneously satisfying the stringent sanitary and phytosanitary requirements of the OECD markets. Today, Senegal’s agriculture faces challenges of expanding targeted products and markets. Donor assistance to Senegalese agriculture has evolved and donors are now applying a differentiated market approach for multiple private actors to work better with agricultural entrepreneurs. Strengthening Senegal’s agricultural potential and diversifying its agricultural production and export profile both horizontally and vertically are the long-term goals for both donors and the country.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
Mali: Beyond Cotton? Searching for "Green Gold" ¤ The Malian economy faces the challenge of reducing its over-dependence on cotton and gold. In order to do so, a search for “green gold” — commercial agriculture beyond cotton — is underway. Mali has started to exploit export market opportunities for horticulture products in Europe as well as in neighbouring countries. Moreover, the country is currently testing the introduction of domestic wheat production for local processing. Although donors are increasingly supporting the development of these new agricultural products, the reform of the cotton sector continues to receive their special attention. Moreover, certain agricultural sub-sectors such as livestock and fishing receive only limited support. The development of a vibrant private sector in agriculture requires further improvements in government policies and donor support, but also more active private sector participation. The government should re-engage in agricultural diversification, and donors should strive to increase the sustainability of their interventions. To this end, greater co-ordination between donors and government is needed in tandem with strengthening the capacity of the local private actors. The study highlights progress towards better donor co-ordination in agriculture and encouraging results, especially with respect to facilitating access to credit for farmers and fostering producers’ organisations. At the same time, it argues that there remains ample room for improvement. Donors tend to crowd in certain segments of the agricultural value chain and to specialise in specific export crops (e.g. the mango sector where 12 donors are currently operating) at the expense of some other important areas, which require additional support (e.g. livestock, transport infrastructure and logistics). A more balanced and coherent approach is warranted.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3>
Chapter 23 Artists' Careers and Their Labor Markets ¤ This chapter is a continuation of ongoing work by economists and others on artists' labor markets and careers. It highlights the use of quasi-panel data obtained from census data to examine the employment and earnings of artists while comparing them to all the other professional and technical workers. It also provides a glimpse into what can be learned about artists' careers from true panel data. Quasi-panels from the seven most recent US censuses (1940–2000) provide a reasonably consistent set of findings in each census year. Artists are found to work fewer hours, suffer higher unemployment and earn less than members of the reference group. Over the sixty year period, disparities in unemployment and annual hours worked are found to shrink somewhat, but disparities in earnings do not. Artists earned less across all years even when only members working full-time year-round of each group are compared. The earnings of artists are found to display greater variability than those of other professional and technical workers. The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 is used to examine almost twenty years in the artists' lives and provides some insights into their careers. It suggests that many people participate in the artistic labor market, but that few succeed to the point that enables them to develop a career in the arts. In part due to their relatively high educational levels, artists are found to be able to transition from forays into arts occupations to jobs in professional and managerial occupations, not into service occupations as artist ‘mythology’ might suggest. We find that when the artists are young and struggling to make it they do work in various service occupations that tend to provide greater work schedule flexibility.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1>
Chapter 5 A game theoretic approach to the theory of money and financial institutions ¤ This chapter discusses a game theoretic and gaming approach to the development of an appropriate microeconomic theory of money and financial institutions. The monetary and financial systems of an economy are part of the socio-politico-economic control mechanism used by every state to connect the economy with the polity and society. This neural network provides the administrative means to collect taxes, direct investment, provide public goods, finance wars, and facilitate international and intertemporal trade. Money measures provide a crude but serviceable basis for the accounting system, which, in turn, along with the codification of commercial law and financial regulation, are the basis for economic evaluation and the measurement of trust and fiduciary responsibility among economic agents. A basic purpose of the approach is adopted to show the minimal conditions that require that financial institutions and instruments emerge as the necessary carriers of process. The thrust is for the development of a mathematical institutional economics. A theory of money and financial institutions at the level of abstraction of general equilibrium theory is a theory of mechanisms and how they might work given the combination of economic forces and more or less exogenous socio-political forces.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2>
Chapter 23. Regional Studies : Latin America and the Caribbean ¤ This chapter offers an overview of migration and remittance flows with respect to the Latin American and Caribbean region from the colonial period to the present. Themes that cross history are highlighted as are the reversals of trends. Emphasis is given to south–south migration, to the factors that have motivated the out-migration of Latin Americans to the United States and Europe, and to the different attitudes concerning migratory movements that have been expressed by governments in both source and receiving nations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4501977-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069332-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0>
Chapter 2. The Contribution of Economic History to the Study of Innovation and Technical Change: 1750–1914 ¤ This chapter surveys the history of modern economic growth and suggests a number of mechanisms that drove the unprecedented technological thrust that account for the discontinuities of economic modernity. The Industrial Revolution and the subsequent developments did not just raise the level of technological capabilities; they changed the entire dynamics of how innovation comes about and the speeds of both invention and diffusion. For much of human history, innovation had been primarily a byproduct of normal economic activity, punctuated by periodical flashing insight that produced a macroinvention, such as water mills or the printing press. The mechanisms that account for innovation becoming a routine activity in terms of the production of useful knowledge are reviewed and linked to the “Baconian program” advocated by the eighteenth-century Enlightenment.

Chapter 9. Forecasting Real Estate Prices ¤ This chapter reviews the evidence of predictability in U.S. residential and commercial real estate markets. First, we highlight the main methodologies used in the construction of real estate indices, their underlying assumptions and their impact on the stochastic properties of the resultant series. We then survey the key empirical findings in the academic literature, including short-run persistence and long-run reversals in the log changes of real estate prices. Next, we summarize the ability of local as well as aggregate variables to forecast real estate returns. We illustrate a number of these results by relying on six aggregate indexes of the prices of unsecuritized (residential and commercial) real estate and REITs. The effect of leverage and monetary policy is also discussed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1>

Chapter 9. Computable General Equilibrium Modeling of Environmental Issues in Australia: Economic Impacts of an Emissions Trading Scheme ¤ A key distinguishing characteristic of computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling in Australia is its orientation to providing inputs to the policy-formation process. Policy makers require detail. They want to be able to identify convincingly which industries, which occupations, which regions and which households would benefit or lose from policy changes, and when the benefits or losses might be expected to flow. In this chapter, we explain how the necessary level of detail can be provided, using as an example analysis that was undertaken by Centre of Policy Studies (CoPS) and Frontier Economics of the potential economic impacts of a carbon price on the Australian economy. The Australian carbon price framework is assumed to be part of a global emissions trading scheme (ETS). Over time, the global ETS becomes the dominant greenhouse abatement policy for all countries including Australia. It sets the price for carbon permits and allocates the number of permits available to each country. A number of key findings emerge from the CGE simulations of the effects of the ETS policy. (i) Domestic abatement falls well short of targeted abatement, requiring significant amounts of permits to be imported. (ii) Despite the requirement for deep cuts in emissions, the ETS reduces Australias GDP by only about 1.1% relative to the base case in 2030. The negative impact on real household consumption (the preferred measure of national welfare) is somewhat greater, reflecting the need to import permits. (iii) The national macroeconomic impacts of the ETS might be described as modest in the context of the policy task. However, this does not carry through to the industry and state/territory levels where some industries and regions prove particularly vulnerable in terms of potential lost employment. The need for detail is highlighted throughout the analysis. For example, a suitably detailed treatment of electricity supply is provided by linking CoPS CGE model with Frontiers detailed bottom-up model of the stationary energy sector. Similarly, necessary detail on the effects of the global ETS on Australias international trading conditions is provided by linking with a multicountry model.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065341-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224214-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210294-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
Chapter 48 Race and gender in the labor market ¤ This chapter summarizes recent research in economics that investigates differentials by race and gender in the labor market. We start with a statistical overview of the trends in labor market outcomes by race, gender and Hispanic origin, including some simple regressions on the determinants of wages and employment. This is followed in Section 3 by an extended review of current theories about discrimination in the labor market, including recent extensions of taste-based theories, theories of occupational exclusion, and theories of statistical discrimination. Section 4 discusses empirical research that provides direct evidence of discrimination in the labor market, beyond “unexplained gaps” in wage or employment regressions. The remainder of the chapter reviews the evidence on race and gender gaps, particularly wage gaps. Section 5 reviews research on the impact of pre-market human capital differences in education and family background that differ by race and gender. Section 6 reviews the impact of differences in both the levels and the returns to experience and seniority, with discussion of the role of training and labor market search and turnover on race and gender differentials. Section 7 reviews the role of job characteristics (particularly occupational characteristics) in the gender wage gap. Section 8 reviews the smaller literature on differences in fringe benefits by gender. Section 9 is an extensive discussion of the empirical work that accounts for changes in the trends in race and gender differentials over time. Of particular interest is the new research literature that investigates the impact of widening wage inequality on race and gender wage gaps. Section 10 reviews research that relates policy changes to race and gender differentials, including anti-discrimination policy. The chapter concludes with comments about a future research agenda.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127364-3>
Chapter 32. What is a Sustainable Public Debt? ¤ The question of what is a sustainable public debt is paramount in the macroeconomic analysis of fiscal policy. This question is usually formulated as asking whether the outstanding public debt and its projected path are consistent with those of the government's revenues and expenditures (ie, whether fiscal solvency conditions hold). We identify critical flaws in the traditional approach to evaluate debt sustainability, and examine three alternative approaches that provide useful econometric and model-simulation tools to analyze debt sustainability. The first approach is Bohn's nonstructural empirical framework based on a fiscal reaction function that characterizes the dynamics of sustainable debt and primary balances. The second is a structural approach based on a calibrated dynamic general equilibrium framework with a fully specified fiscal sector, which we use to quantify the positive and normative effects of fiscal policies aimed at restoring fiscal solvency in response to changes in debt. The third approach deviates from the others in assuming that governments cannot commit to repay their domestic debt and can thus optimally decide to default even if debt is sustainable in terms of fiscal solvency. We use these three approaches to analyze debt sustainability in the United States and Europe after the sharp increases in public debt following the 2008 crisis, and find that all three raise serious questions about the prospects of fiscal adjustment and its consequences.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Chapter 9. From Aliens to Citizens : The Political Incorporation of Immigrants ¤ This chapter deals with the political incorporation of immigrants in host societies. Political incorporation is discussed with regard to the regulation of legal status, rights, opportunities, and acquisition of citizenship. We give examples of the legal regulation and policies from several countries in the world, showing thereby the diversity of approaches to political incorporation but also similarities to the regulation of access to residence, rights, and citizenship. We highlight changes in this regard since the Second World War and discuss more recent trends. Moreover, we discuss different factors explaining the variation in incorporation policies. Also, this chapter traces different dimensions of political participation of immigrants, and, finally, we address the expected effects on wider integration of citizenship acquisition.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069332-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4501977-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0>
Chapter 6. Growth and Structural Transformation ¤ Structural transformation refers to the reallocation of economic activity across the broad sectors agriculture, manufacturing, and services. This review article synthesizes and evaluates recent advances in the research on structural transformation. We begin by presenting the stylized facts of structural transformation across time and space. We then develop a multi-sector extension of the one-sector growth model that encompasses the main existing theories of structural transformation. We argue that this multi-sector model serves as a natural benchmark to study structural transformation and that it is able to account for many salient features of structural transformation. We also argue that this multi-sector model delivers new and sharper insights for understanding economic development, regional income convergence, aggregate productivity trends, hours worked, business cycles, wage inequality, and greenhouse gas emissions. We conclude by suggesting several directions for future research on structural transformation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3>
Chapter 55 Transformation of Markets for Agricultural Output in Developing Countries Since 1950: How Has Thinking Changed?  ¤ This chapter traces the evolution of the agricultural economics literature on agrifood output markets over the past 50 years, emphasizing research approaches and policy issues. The analysis of agrifood systems encompasses the demand and supply side of output markets. The analysis in this chapter is set within the conceptual framework of how the agrifood economy develops during the agricultural and structural transformation. The related paths of development of policy and policy issues, and research themes and methods, are analyzed in parallel. The chapter examines the shift from broad and atomistic “commodity” markets to differentiated and more concentrated “product” markets over the half century. Spurred by massive retail sector foreign direct investment (FDI) to which was added competitive investments from domestic capital, a profound retail transformation has occurred in the past decade – the “supermarket revolution”. This revolution has been the leading edge of globalization of domestic agrifood systems, not, as the literature currently emphasizes, opening to international trade. The chapter ends with a focus on the challenge for researchers in the next several decades, especially the need for new research methodologies that are suitable for understanding the role and influence of a small number of large-scale, multi-national firms, and for analyzing the impacts of the consolidation of the downstream segments of the agrifood system – the food industry – on upstream segments of the domestic agrifood systems, on rural development, and on trade.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4704302-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4>
Chapter 1 Technological determinants of firm and industry structure ¤ This chapter discusses the cost concepts required for analyzing the role of technology in the determination of firm and industry structure. It focuses on the general multiproduct case, although important single product aspects of the problem are also discussed. An analysis of the role these cost concepts play in determining efficient industry structure is presented in the chapter. The most basic concept with which to characterize the productive technology available to the firm is the technology set, a list of the combinations of inputs and outputs that are available to the firm. In a private enterprise economy, any industry structure that persists in the long run must yield the firms in the industry at least zero economic profits. This places certain restrictions on the relative locations of the cost and demand curves. In an empirical application that attempts to estimate the cost function of an individual firm, the data available may be better suited for estimating a short-run cost function: a specification that assumes that only some of the inputs available to the firm are set at their cost-minimizing levels.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133311-1>
Chapter 13 Empirical Studies of Corporate Law ¤ This chapter reviews the empirical literature, especially the event study literature, as it relates to corporate and securities law. Event studies are among the most successful uses of econometrics in policy analysis. By providing an anchor for measuring the impact of events on investor wealth, the methodology offers a fruitful means for evaluating the welfare implications of private and government actions. This chapter begins by briefly reviewing the event study methodology and its strengths and limitations for policy analysis. It then discusses one of the limitations of more conventional empirical work (cross-sectional analysis), the problem presented by the fact that the characteristics of firms that are studied in relation to each other (such as ownership and mechanisms of corporate governance) or to firm performance are not exogeneous but self-selected by firms. Thereafter it reviews in detail how event studies have been used to evaluate the wealth effects of corporate litigation. Subsequently, we focus on the methodology's application to corporate law and corporate governance issues, supplemented with discussion of other relevant empirical work as well. Event studies are emphasized because they have played an important role in the making of corporate law and in applied corporate finance and corporate law scholarship. The reason for this input is twofold. First, there is a match between the methodology and subject matter: the goal of corporate law is to increase shareholder wealth and event studies provide a metric for measurement of the impact upon stock prices of policy decisions. Second, because the participants in corporate law debates share the objective of corporate law, to adopt policies that enhance shareholder wealth, their disagreements are over the means to achieve that end. A further reason for emphasizing event study data is that they avoid the endogeneity concerns that can limit the results of other modes of empirical research in this area.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117663-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066510-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135492-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048737-4>
Capital Stocks, Capital Services and Multi-Factor Productivity Measures ¤ Capital services measures have long been recognised as the appropriate concept to capture capital input in production and productivity analysis. However, only few countries’ statistical agencies construct and publish such capital services measures. This paper describes capital services measures developed by OECD and presents estimation methods and results for the G7 countries. By way of example, the consequences of applying capital services measures instead of measures of gross or net capital stocks in the computation of rates of multi-factor productivity growth are examined for three countries, the United States, France and Australia ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
Chapter 73 Agricultural Productivity and Economic Growth ¤ In most poor countries, large majorities of the population live in rural areas and earn their livelihoods primarily from agriculture. Many rural people in the developing world are poor, and conversely, most of the world's poor people inhabit rural areas. Agriculture also accounts for a significant fraction of the economic activity in the developing world, with some 25% of value added in poor countries coming from this sector. The sheer size of the agricultural sector implies that changes affecting agriculture have large aggregate effects. Thus, it seems reasonable that agricultural productivity growth should have significant effects on macro variables, including economic growth. But these effects can be complicated. The large size of the agricultural sector does not necessarily imply that it must be a leading sector for economic growth. In fact, agriculture in most developing countries has very low productivity relative to the rest of the economy. Expanding a low-productivity sector might not be unambiguously good for growth. Moreover, there are issues of reverse causation. Economies that experience growth in aggregate output could be the beneficiaries of good institutions or good fortune that also helps the agricultural sector. Thus, even after 50 years of research on agricultural development, there is abundant evidence for correlations between agricultural productivity increases and economic growth but little definitive evidence for a causal connection. This chapter reviews theoretical arguments and empirical evidence for the hypothesis that agricultural productivity improvements lead to economic growth in developing countries. For countries with large interior populations and limited access to international markets, agricultural development is essential for economic growth. For other countries, the importance of agriculture-led growth will depend on the relative feasibility and cost of importing food.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4704302-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4>
Chapter 23. Trade, Growth and the Size of Countries ¤ Normally, economists take the size of countries as an exogenous variable. Nevertheless, the borders of countries and their size change, partially in response to economic factors such as the pattern of international trade. Conversely, the size of countries influences their economic performance and their preferences for international economic policies – for instance smaller countries have a greater stake in maintaining free trade. In this paper, we review the theory and evidence concerning a growing body of research that considers both the impact of market size on growth and the endogenous determination of country size. We argue that our understanding of economic performance and of the history of international economic integration can be greatly improved by bringing the issue of country size at the forefront of the analysis of growth.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3>
Chapter 11. The Global Distribution of Income ¤ This chapter investigates recent advances in our understanding of the global distribution of income, and produces the first estimates of global inequality that take into account data on the incomes of the top one percent within countries. We discuss conceptual and methodological issues – including alternative definitions of the global distribution, the use of household surveys and national accounts data, the use of purchasing power parity exchange rates, and the incorporation of recently available data on top incomes from income tax records. We also review recent attempts to estimate the global distribution of income. Our own estimates combine household survey data with top income data, and we analyze various aspects of this distribution, including its within- and between-country components, and changes in relative versus absolute global inequality. Finally, we examine global poverty, which is identified through the lower end of the global distribution.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7>
Chapter 2. An Overview of the Normative Economics of the Health Sector ¤ This chapter provides an overview of normative analysis in the health sector in recent decades. It surveys two distinct, but related, literatures. The first is normative analysis of the operation of health care and health care insurance markets, market failure, and the scope for non-market institutional arrangements to improve the efficiency and equity of the financing, funding, organization and delivery of health care. The second is the debate about the most appropriate normative framework within which to carry out normative analysis in the health sector, focusing on the welfarist and extra-welfarist frameworks. This is a debate about assumptions and methods. Although the rival frameworks share the broad conclusion that market failure pervades the health sector, the diagnoses regarding nature of that failure sometimes differ and, more importantly, the prescriptions to improve efficiency and equity often differ. Because it is not always clear what writers mean by welfare economics and extra-welfarism, I briefly summarize key concepts of efficiency and key assumptions and elements of each framework. The three subsequent sections then analyze the nature of health care as an economic commodity and the implications of these characteristics both for the operation of health care and health care insurance markets and for the methods of normative economic analysis. Section 4 surveys prominent approaches to analyzing equity in health care. Section 5 examines the methods of normative analysis as applied to evaluate individual health care services. Finally, I end with some observations on recent discussions of the role of normative economic analysis in policy making and of health economists as policy advisors.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Environmental Law and Nuclear Law : A Growing Symbiosis, by Sam Emmerechts ¤ International nuclear law has developed over the last 50 years and during most of its history its main focus has been on protecting people and property. Protection of the environment has only made an occasional appearance, and the international conventions on nuclear third party liability amply illustrate this point. Under the Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy (1960) and the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (1963) the notion of nuclear damage is understood to cover personal injury and property damage causally related to a nuclear incident. The conventions do not refer to environmental damage at all.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068925-6>
Competition and Regulation in Agriculture ¤ The Competition Committee (WP2 on Competition and Regulation) held a roundtable discussion in June 2004 on Competition and Regulation in Agriculture: Monopsony Buying and Joint Selling. Monopsonistic purchasing practices and joint price-setting activities in the agro-food sector were examined, with a particular focus on regulation and on the potential improvements that could arise from more pro-competitive regulations. Joint activity by producers can have a number of beneficial effects, such as from promoting a brand or food that would not otherwise be promoted, promoting a style of production (like organic production) or purchasing in large quantity in order to obtain quantity discounts. Harms may arise when the joint activity involves price or quality-setting and there is little competition from close substitutes. Cartellike activity by producers has often been supported by governments but is unlikely to achieve stated public policy goals because it often leads to higher consumer prices but enhance land values more than farmer income. Potentially monopsonistic purchasing practices in the agricultural sector were also considered. At times, price manipulation by large purchasers may occur. Competition authorities play an important role in assuring that activities of purchasers do not involve market power, particularly when purchases are concentrated in few, large firms and sellers have limited options besides selling into a highly concentrated market. However, to the extent that purchasers wish to contract for very specific forms of production, such as specific varieties of grain, there can be good commercial reasons that a purchaser would wish to focus on a specific forms of production and agriculture products should not be considered different from supplies in other sectors, which are customized for different purchasers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7>
A Market Perspective on the European Sovereign Debt and Banking Crisis ¤ Europe has been beset by an interrelated banking crisis and sovereign debt crisis. Bond spreads faced by Greece and Ireland, and to a lesser extent Portugal followed by Spain, have increased. This paper explores these issues from the perspective of financial markets, focusing mainly on the four countries in the frontline of these pressures: Greece and Portugal, on the one hand, where the problems are primarily fiscal in nature; and Ireland and Spain, on the other, where banking problems related to the property boom and bust have been the key moving part. The paper first examines the probabilities of default implicit in observable market spreads and considers these calculations against sovereign debt dynamics. It then explores the implications of the interaction between bank losses and fiscal deficits on the one hand, and the feedback that any debt haircuts anticipated by markets could have on bank solvency. The study finds that market-implied sovereign default probabilities do in fact discriminate quite clearly between countries based on five criteria that affect the probability of debt restructuring. The discussion highlights some implications for banking system balance sheets of expected losses and shows the potential impact on them of sovereign restructuring implicit in market analysis. While the paper does not make any recommendations for policy action, it does explore a range of policy options and the implications each might have for the financial markets.

Promoting Competition in the Natural Gas Industry ¤ Natural gas is a key source of energy for OECD countries, both in its own right and as an input into the production of electricity. Regulatory reform in this sector shares both important similarities and important differences with regulatory reform in other network industries. Like other network industries, regulatory reform in natural gas involves promoting competition in the competitive segments of the industry (particularly competition between gas producers), the development of a robust regime for access to the remaining essential facilities, and structural separation between the competitive and non-competitive segments of the industry. OECD countries have pursued each of these steps, licensing independent producers, pricing access to pipeline infrastructure and separating gas production from transportation (although long-term take-or-pay contracts make this last reform more difficult). Unlike other network industries, however, the structure of the industry varies widely from country to country according to the number of domestic gas producers, the geographic location of pipelines and the uses to which natural gas is put. Countries which rely primarily on imported gas have less to gain from domestic reform and much to gain from reform in producing countries. As OECD gas sources diminish and reliance on imports increases, regulatory reform in natural gas will increasingly become an issue for international trade.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9>
Chapter 6. Selection and design of environmental policy instruments ¤ In this article, we provide an overview of a rather large topic: how economics can inform the selection and design of policy instruments to deal with environmental problems. We first identify (in Sections 1 – 2 ) underlying market failures that underscore the need for policy. Then, (in 3 ) we look at the menu of available policies. After that, we turn to the selection and design of appropriate policy instruments, with attention to the success or failure of policy instruments that have been tried in the past. In order to select instruments, we look to the root causes of the failures that motivate the use of instruments. Unfortunately, there is no single unified theory of policy selection. Instead, we present a series of results based on various special cases. This is complemented with a number of practical and political considerations related primarily to feasibility and the incidence of policy costs, which interact with distributional concerns. In Section 5 , we look at several specific examples to bring out the ideas and principles with more concrete, real-life details. Finally, the last section deals with policy making in the Anthropocene – the new period of history we are entering, when the human economy is the main driving force behind many crucial environmental parameters on Earth.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3>
Introduction to the series ¤ The aim of the Handbooks in Economics series is to produce handbooks for various branches of economics, each of which is a definitive source, reference, and teaching supplement for use by professional researchers and advanced graduate students. Each handbook provides self-contained surveys of the current state of a branch of economics in the form of chapters prepared by leading specialists on various aspects of this branch of economics. These surveys summarize not only received results but also newer developments from recent journal articles and discussion papers. Some original material is also included, but the main goal is to provide comprehensive and accessible surveys. The handbooks are intended to provide not only useful reference volumes for professional collections but also possible supplementary readings for advanced courses for graduate students in economics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014743-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075236-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1>
Labour Force Participation of Women : Empirical Evidence on The Role of Policy and Other Determinants in OECD Countries ¤ This paper examines the determinants of female labour force participation in OECD countries. The econometric analysis uses a panel data set covering 17 OECD countries over the period 1985-1999, and distinguishes between part-time and full-time female participation rates. It shows a positive impact on female participation of a more neutral tax treatment of second earners (relative to single individuals), childcare subsidies, and paid maternity and parental leave. On the other hand, child benefits reduce female participation due to an income effect and their lump-sum character. Female education, the general labour market conditions, and cultural attitudes remain major determinants of female participation. Simulations illustrate the potentially significant impact that some of the examined policies could exert on female participation ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2>
Chapter 3 Public sector pricing ¤ This chapter discusses public sector pricing. Prices are an excellent instrument for coordinating supply and demand, provided people who do not pay can be excluded from consumption. Hence, prices are used not only by private entrepreneurs, but also by politicians, bureaucrats, and public utility managers. Public prices can be found in almost every economic activity. However, looking across countries, there are particular areas where public pricing is more likely to be found than in others. These areas are closely associated with supplying essential goods and services, either to industries or directly to consumers. Essential means that they cannot be cut off without danger of total or partial collapse of an economy. Essential goods and services are almost the same in all industrialized countries. Hence, it is possible to present a fairly general basic catalogue of candidates for public pricing. How many of these candidates are priced publicly in any one country, depends on the prevailing degree of confidence in the efficiency of the private sector, which differs from country to country.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4242500-1>
Chapter 22. Labor Markets and Referrals ¤ The use of social networks and personal referrals in the labor market is very widespread. Both firms and workers may find it beneficial to use these informal channels to produce successful matches between job seekers and vacancies. This Chapter discusses the existing literature and highlights the most robust results. It describes the theoretical literature on the use of informal search methods, both in a micro and in a macro setting, as well as the empirical findings in this area. The empirical evidence comes both from direct surveys of workers and firms and from indirect estimates that exploit structural modeling as well as natural experiments. Finally, the Chapter discusses open questions and possible avenues for future research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132883-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066514-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027266-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120990-4>
Chapter 62 Asymmetric Two-person Bargaining Under Incomplete Information: Strategic Play and Adaptive Learning ¤ This chapter focuses on a series of experiments investigating decision behavior in single-stage, two-person bargaining over the exchange of a single commodity, where neither trader knows with precision the reservation value that the other places on the good or service being bought or sold. Uncertainty about the other trader's reservation value is represented by a commonly known probability distribution. This chapter also summarizes the major behavioral regularities that have been observed in two computer-controlled bargaining experiments using the sealed-bid double auction mechanism. Under this mechanism, the buyer submits a bid anonymously over a computer network, and the seller submits an offer for the good she possesses. Bids and offers are submitted simultaneously. Considerable theoretical progress has been made in analyzing these bilateral bargaining situations with two-sided incomplete information within the general framework of the BayesianNash equilibrium.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1>

Chapter 18. Place-Based Policies ¤ Place-based policies commonly target underperforming areas, such as deteriorating downtown business districts and disadvantaged regions. Principal examples include enterprise zones, European Union Structural Funds, and industrial cluster policies. Place-based policies are rationalized by various hypotheses in urban and labor economics, such as agglomeration economies and spatial mismatch—hypotheses that entail market failures and often predict overlap between poor economic performance and disadvantaged residents. The evidence on enterprise zones is very mixed. We need to know more about what features of enterprise zone policies make them more effective or less effective, who gains and who loses from these policies, and how we can reconcile the existing findings. Some evidence points to positive benefits of infrastructure expenditure and also investment in higher education and university research—likely because of the public-goods nature of these policies. However, to better guide policy, we need to know more about what policies create self-sustaining longer run gains.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4239568-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4>
Chapter 17. Financial Risk Measurement for Financial Risk Management ¤ Current practice largely follows restrictive approaches to market risk measurement, such as historical simulation or RiskMetrics. In contrast, we propose flexible methods that exploit recent developments in financial econometrics and are likely to produce more accurate risk assessments, treating both portfolio-level and asset-level analysis. Asset-level analysis is particularly challenging because the demands of real-world risk management in financial institutions—in particular, real-time risk tracking in very high-dimensional situations—impose strict limits on model complexity. Hence we stress powerful yet parsimonious models that are easily estimated. In addition, we emphasize the need for deeper understanding of the links between market risk and macroeconomic fundamentals, focusing primarily on links among equity return volatilities, real growth, and real growth volatilities. Throughout, we strive not only to deepen our scientific understanding of market risk, but also cross-fertilize the academic and practitioner communities, promoting improved market risk measurement technologies that draw on the best of both.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4508395-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269795-5>

Chapter 21. Advances in Forecasting under Instability ¤ The forecasting literature has identified two important issues: (i) several predictors have substantial and statistically significant predictive content, although only sporadically, and it is unclear whether this predictive content can be exploited reliably; (ii) in-sample predictive content does not necessarily translate into out-of-sample predictive ability, nor ensures the stability of the predictive relationship over time. The objective of this chapter is to understand what we have learned about forecasting in the presence of instabilities. The empirical evidence raises a multitude of questions. If in-sample tests provide poor guidance to out-of-sample forecasting ability, what should researchers do? If there are statistically significant instabilities in Granger-causality relationships, how do researchers establish whether there is any Granger-causality at all? If there is substantial instability in predictive relationships, how do researchers establish which model is the “best” forecasting model? And finally, if a model forecasts poorly, why is that and how should researchers proceed to improve the forecasting models? In this chapter, we answer these questions by discussing various methodologies for inference as well as estimation that have been recently proposed in the literature.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047390-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1>
Chapter 10 Taxation ¤ This Handbook entry presents a conceptual, normative overview of the subject of taxation. It emphasizes the relationships among the main functions of taxation—notably, raising revenue, redistributing income, and correcting externalities—and the mapping between these functions and various forms of taxation. Different types of taxation as well as expenditures on transfers and public goods are each integrated into a common optimal tax framework with the income tax and commodity taxes at the core. Additional topics addressed include a range of dynamic issues, the unit of taxation, tax administration and enforcement, and tax equity.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048737-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066510-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117663-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135492-8>
Chapter 24 Non-Convexities, Economies of Scale, Natural Monopoly and Monopolistic Competition ¤ The classical discussion of the consequences of non-convexities took a new form as principles of game theory became joined with the structural features of large economies of scale. New models suggest that the threat of competition, as opposed to the existence of an actual competitor, serve to control monopolistic practices. The issues found in the literature explore and debate both the basic behavioral principles that might be at work as well as the application of those principles in particular situations. Sellers made private decisions about which of the two markets to enter. If the market with scale economies was chosen, then the seller chose three variables: the scale of plant that would be operated, the price to be posted and the maximum quantity to be offered. All decisions were made public simultaneously. After decisions were made public, sellers had the option of reducing their maximum quantity sold to zero.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2>
Chapter 20 Equilibrium under uncertainty ¤ This chapter reviews several concepts of equilibrium that have appeared in the recent literature on markets and uncertainty and focuses on various theories of equilibrium under uncertainty in a sequence of markets, in the absence of complete forward markets for contingent delivery. A stationary state is in full equilibrium, not merely when demands equal supplies at the currently established prices but also when the same prices continue to rule at all dateswhen prices are constant over time. The test of equilibrium over time is considered to be more important than mere arithmetical sameness or difference, noting that it implies constant prices in a stationary economy but does not necessarily implies constant prices in an economy subject to change. The ArrowDebreu model provides a solid foundation of equilibrium analysis upon which to build. Modern decision theory and probability theory enable dealing more effectively with the issues raised by uncertainty and with the conceptual problems of describing an economy that is both stationary and subject to change.

Chapter 15 Innovation and changes in regional structure ¤ This chapter reviews the innovation and changes made in regional structure. Innovation or technological change is a principal source of change in the economic structure of regions and nations. Although innovation has been studied as a critical variable in the production and management of firms and nations, technology has remained for the most part a black box within economic research. The chapter reviews the theoretical and model-based research on innovation and regional structure and explains regional differences in productivity. Labor inputs are considerably more heterogeneous and variable than traditionally considered. The chapter surveys the wide range of empirical studies that have contributed to the knowledge of the effects of technology on regional structure and change. Some effects of technology on regional development are outlined in the chapter. The organization of multiregional firms and their use of technology as an explicit strategic variable adds further complication to conventional theoretical treatments of urban and regional change. This review of the available empirical evidence on these topics focuses primarily on experience in the USA and Western Europe. The chapter also presents some comparisons between firms and regions in the context of innovation.

Chapter Twenty-Two. Compensation and Responsibilityprotect ¤ Many distributive issues involve situations in which initial characteristics make individuals unequal. In view of prevailing moral sentiments, some of these characteristics call for compensating transfers, and some do not. We study the literature on this problem of compensation. This literature follows the distinction between the ethical principle of compensation and that of responsibility. According to the former, a good resource allocation system should neutralize the differential influence over agents’ outcomes of the characteristics that elicit compensation. According to the latter, a good resource allocation system should remain neutral with respect to inequality arising from the influence of characteristics that do not elicit compensation. The principle of responsibility can be interpreted as a libertarian principle of natural reward, or as a principle of utilitarian reward. Depending on whether the emphasis is put on the principle of compensation or of responsibility, and depending on how the latter is interpreted, there exist four main families of solutions to compensation problems. We review the axiomatic analyses of these four families of solutions in the different models in which they have been studied. We also review the applications that have been made of these solutions to problems of income taxation, education investment, social mobility and health insurance systems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066735-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022393-0>
Chapter 3. The Adjustment of Immigrants in the Labor Market ¤ This chapter explores immigrant labor market adjustment by first describing methodological and theoretical considerations central to the analysis of earnings growth and occupational mobility. When no restrictions are placed on entry earnings or earnings growth, an inverse relationship between immigrant entry earnings and earnings growth emerges. An implication of this relationship is that the popular method for controlling for cohort effects developed by Borjas, and used in almost all recent studies of immigrant adjustment, is flawed. Recent US immigrants have low initial earnings, relative to natives and earlier immigrant cohorts, but high earnings growth, a pattern consistent with high levels of human capital investment. Why immigrants invest more in human capital than natives, and why investment patterns vary across immigrant groups, is explored. Important individual attributes include how easily immigrants’ source-country human capital transfers to the host country and how permanently attached immigrants are to the host country. Economic and social contexts, beyond the individual, are highlighted. Labor market adjustment from a family perspective is examined, with light shed on the controversy surrounding the Family Investment Hypothesis. The chapter concludes with a framework for examining immigrant adjustment across the labor markets of major immigrant-host countries and with directions for future research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069332-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4501977-0>
Chapter 18. The Politics of Monetary Policy ¤ In this paper we critically review the literature on the political economy of monetary policy, with an eye on the questions raised by the recent financial crisis. We begin with a discussion of rules versus discretion. We then examine the issue of the central bank’s independence (CBI) both in normal times and in times of crisis. Then we review the literature of electoral manipulation of policies. Finally we address international institutional issues concerning the feasibility, optimality, and political sustainability of currency unions in which more than one country shares the same currency. A brief review of the Euro experience concludes the paper.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2>
Chapter 9. Heterogeneous Agent Modeling: Experimental Evidence ¤ We report on experimental evidence rationalizing the use of heterogeneous agent models. We provide compelling evidence that subjects in laboratory experiments often behave in ways that depart from the rational choice ideal. Further, these subjects' heuristic approaches often differ from one another in distinct, classifiable ways. It follows that models of heterogeneous, boundedly rational agents can often deliver predictions that are a better fit to the experimental data at both the micro- and the macro-levels of analysis than can rational-choice, single-actor models. Our focus in this chapter is on experimental studies developed to address questions in macroeconomics and finance.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Chapter 15. Government Purchasing of Health Services ¤ This chapter reviews the literature on payment schemes for government purchases of health services. It focuses on four themes: (1) the tension between obtaining appropriate quality of services and keeping the cost of those services at an acceptable level; (2) the role of cost sharing by the payer when there is asymmetric information between purchaser and supplier about costs or case-mix; (3) the importance of commitment in purchasing; and (4) the role of reputation in maintaining quality in long term relationships between purchasers and suppliers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Chapter 10. Recursive Contracts and Endogenously Incomplete Markets ¤ In this chapter we study dynamic incentive models in which risk sharing is endogenously limited by the presence of informational or enforcement frictions. We comprehensively overview one of the most important tools for the analysis such problems—the theory of recursive contracts. Recursive formulations allow us to reduce often complex models to a sequence of essentially static problems that are easier to analyze both analytically and computationally. We first provide a self-contained treatment of the basic theory: the Revelation Principle, formulating and simplifying the incentive constraints, using promised utilities as state variables, and analyzing models with persistent shocks using the first-order approach. We then discuss more advanced topics: duality theory and Lagrange multiplier techniques, models with lack of commitment, and martingale methods in continuous time. Finally, we show how a variety of applications in public economics, corporate finance, development and international economics featuring incomplete risk sharing can be analyzed using the tools of the theory of recursive contracts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Chapter 5 Predictive Density Evaluation ¤ This chapter discusses estimation, specification testing, and model selection of predictive density models. In particular, predictive density estimation is briefly discussed, and a variety of different specification and model evaluation tests due to various authors including Christoffersen and Diebold [Christoffersen, P., Diebold, F.X. (2000). “How relevant is volatility forecasting for financial risk management?”. Review of Economics and Statistics 82, 12–22], Diebold, Gunther and Tay [Diebold, F.X., Gunther, T., Tay, A.S.

Chapter 38 Double-edged incentives: Institutions and policy coordination ¤ This chapter focuses on institutions and policy coordination. A large portion of international macroeconomics deals with the international transmission of national macroeconomic policies. Such spillovers naturally raise the possibility of inefficiencies: national policymakers, who set their fiscal and monetary policies to maximize a domestic objective, but ignoring the externalities that they impose on other countries, may find themselves in equilibria that entail collective irrationality. The chapter presents a detailed discussion on the fiscal policy. The illustrations revolve around two types of externalities: one tied to international redistribution via the intertemporal terms of trade and the other to a fiscal externality in capital taxation, when capital is mobile among countries. The analysis in the chapter does not rest on explicit micro foundations, but on quadratic payoff functions and linear and static macroeconomic models. Two main themes emerge from the analysis. First, that the analysis of international policy interactions is enriched by taking the incentives in the domestic policy process into account. The second central theme focuses on the institutions that can enforce cooperation. The chapter also discusses tax competition, domestic institutions in fiscal policy, and international institutions in fiscal policy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0>
Chapter 2. Social Norms and Preferences, Chapter for the Handbook for Social Economics edited by J. Benhabib, A. Bisin and M. Jackson ¤ Social norms are often posited as an explanation of differences in economic behavior and performance of societies that are difficult to explain by differences in endowments and technology. Economists are often reluctant to incorporate social aspects into their analyses when doing so leads to models that depart from the standard model. I discuss ways that agents' social environment can be accommodated in standard models and the advantages and disadvantages of doing so.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066514-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027266-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120990-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132883-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5>
Preface to the handbook ¤ Mark R. Rosenzweig and Oded Stark extend their thanks to authors who were waiting (while updating) patiently for their fellow authors to complete the write-ups of their drafts. They will know that their's and author's efforts were worthwhile if the Handbook of population and family economics contributes to increasing the population of economists involved in research on population and the family, and if the family of social science disciplines adopts the thinking of economists on population and family issues.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006292-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123185-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006294-6>

Chapter 14. Choice Under Uncertainty: Empirical Methods and Experimental Results ¤ This chapter is concerned with the empirical exploration and experimental investigation of the numerous theories of decision making under uncertainty proposed in the earlier chapters of this handbook. This chapter begins with static theories of behavior under risk ; then we look at dynamic theories under risk; and finally look at decision making under ambiguity (the theory of which is largely static at this point in time). As we proceed through the chapter we will come across a number of methodological issues concerning the conduct of experiments, and relating to the econometric analysis of the data. These issues will be elaborated further in the concluding subsections of the appropriate sections and in a concluding section at the end of the chapter.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186957-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120934-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070864-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135592-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050133-4>

Chapter 8. Advances in Numerical Dynamic Programming and New Applications ¤ Dynamic programming is the essential tool in dynamic economic analysis. Problems such as portfolio allocation for individuals and optimal economic growth are typical examples. Numerical methods typically approximate the value function. Recent work has focused on making numerical methods more stable, and more efficient in its use of information. This chapter presents two examples where numerical dynamic programming is applied to high-dimensional problems from finance and the integration of climate and economic systems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5>
Chapter 5. Insurance and Insurance Markets ¤ Kenneth Arrow and Karl Borch published several important articles in the early 1960s that can be viewed as the beginning of modern economic analysis of insurance activity. This chapter reviews the main theoretical and empirical contributions in insurance economics since that time. The review begins with the role of utility, risk, and risk aversion in the insurance literature and summarizes work on the demand for insurance, insurance and resource allocation, moral hazard, and adverse selection. It then turns to financial pricing models of insurance and to analyses of price volatility and underwriting cycles; insurance price regulation; insurance company capital adequacy and capital regulation; the development of insurance securitization and insurance-linked securities; and the efficiency, distribution, organizational form, and governance of insurance organizations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186957-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070864-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050133-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135592-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120934-5>
Chapter 13 The economics of military manpower ¤ The USA and other countries spend a significant portion of their defense budgets on personnel. Effective management of military forces requires an understanding of the economics of military manpower. Over the past three decades economists have produced a substantial body of research about the subject. This chapter distills this literature for a general audience. Topics surveyed include the supply of personnel, personnel productivity and the demand for personnel, procurement by conscription versus voluntary means, the structure of pay, the use of women and reservists, and the civilian return to military training and experience. It also points to directions for future research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132793-7>
Chapter 17 Microstructure and Asset Pricing ¤ Market microstructure and asset pricing both consider the behavior and formation of prices in asset markets. Yet neither literature explicitly recognizes the importance and role of the factors so crucial to the other approach. This survey seeks to join the two literatures by surveying the work linking microstructure factors to asset price dynamics. In the short run, these dynamics involve issues such as the auto-correlation and cross-correlation structure of stocks, and our survey will examine the literature relating these correlation structures to microstructure factors such as non-synchronous trading and dealer behavior. In the longer run, issues such as liquidity and the relation of private information to asset price dynamics are important. We survey the theoretical work linking microstructure factors to long-run returns, and we consider why stock prices might be expected to reflect premia related to liquidity or informational asymmetries. We also survey the empirical literature testing these relationships. We then discuss what issues remain contentious, and we provide some guidance for future research. We hope to show in this survey that asset-pricing dynamics may be better understood by recognizing the role played by microstructure factors, and that microstructure research can be enhanced by a greater understanding of its linkages with fundamental economic variables.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269795-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4508395-2>
Climate Change and Africa ¤ Climate change is a major threat to sustainable growth and development in Africa, and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Africa is particularly vulnerable to climate change because of its overdependence on rain-fed agriculture, compounded by factors such as widespread poverty and weak capacity. The main longer-term impacts include: changing rainfall patterns affecting agriculture and reducing food security; worsening water security; decreasing fish resources in large lakes due to rising temperature; shifting vectorborne diseases; rising sea level affecting low-lying coastal areas with large populations; and rising water stress.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1>
Chapter 70 Trading Institutions and Emission Allowances ¤ In the frictionless world of theory without transaction costs, allowance trading offers the potential of billions of dollars in savings when compared to traditional command and control regulation. It is therefore not surprising that regulators have embraced this approach in recent years to reduce the pain of achieving specific environmental objectives. This short review highlights the fact that policy-makers must recognize that the devil is in the details, and that several intermediate steps are necessary when translating these plans and schemes from the theorist's blackboard to the field. For example, regulators need to carefully consider the design of any new trading institutions and allowance characteristics. Failure to consider these details can lead to poorly designed trading institutions such as the EPA auction which can slow the development of the market and require redesign after only several years of operation. By contrast, sufficient consideration of incentives and sponsoring laboratory experiments when appropriate can lead to a better design of allowance characteristics such as in the RECLAIM program.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1>
Chapter 5. Domestic Institutions as a Source of Comparative Advantage ¤ Domestic institutions can have profound effects on international trade. This chapter reviews the theoretical and empirical underpinnings of this insight. Particular attention is paid to contracting institutions and to comparative advantage, where the bulk of the research has been concentrated. We also consider the reverse causation running from comparative advantage to domestic institutions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1>
Chapter 16 Economics of environment and renewable resources in socialist systems : Part 1: Russia Part 2: China ¤ This chapter discusses the Soviet system that serves to facilitate or prevent pollution. It discusses the extent to which the U.S.S.R.'s culture and endowment have led to or away from pollution. It discusses the way the lack of pluralism and the overwhelming emphasis on production make it difficult to protect the Soviet environment. The Soviet experience indicates that Soviet environmental theory and law are more impressive on paper than in practice. The Soviet Union has long had legislation setting limits on waste discharge that is by far more demanding than any other country in the world. It was widely acknowledged in the U.S.S.R. that these limits were set more to impress the outside world than to constrain Soviet producers. Much of the reason for the existence of pollution in the Soviet Union arises from the fact that the Soviet Union has placed and continues to place so much emphasis on economic growth.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075236-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014743-5>
Chapter 7. The Chinese Growth Miracle ¤ This chapter provides a review of China’s economic growth since 1978. Studying China’s economic success may shed new light on the political economy of growth, the impacts of the ascent of large countries on the rest of the world, and the relationship between inequality and economic growth. The chapter starts with a review of the characteristics of China’s economic growth and compares it with those of several similar economies. Then it shows how China’s economic success has been created by innovative institutional arrangements as well as adherence to the policy advice prescribed by neoclassical economics. After that, the chapter describes China’s export-led growth model and analyzes its causes and the structural imbalances associated with it. Lastly, the chapter presents data for income inequality in China and discusses how inequality may affect China’s prospect of avoiding the middle-income trap.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3>

Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC) and harmonisation of nuclear liability law within the European Union ¤ Recent events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plants have demonstrated the importance of having strong and effective nuclear liability regimes in effect at the national and global levels to assure the availability of prompt and equitable compensation for nuclear damage in the event of a nuclear incident. In the aftermath of Chernobyl, the international community came together under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (OECD/NEA) to review the nuclear liability principles in the 1963 Vienna Convention 1 and the 1960 Paris Convention,2 consider enhancements to improve the effectiveness of those principles and develop the basis for establishing a worldwide liability regime to supplement and enhance those principles with a view to increasing the amount of compensation available for nuclear damage.3 After an extensive and thorough review of the then existing liability regimes and numerous proposals for improvements, the international community adopted the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC)to be the basis for a worldwide liability regime. With the recent ratification of the CSC by the United States, the CSC is poised to come into effect. Now is the time for the international community, and especially those countries that use and promote the use of nuclear power, to act to bring the CSC into effect. Such action will establish a global regime that ensures the availability of prompt and equitable compensation for nuclear damage.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068925-6>
Chapter 5. Imperfect Information and Aggregate Supply ¤ This paper surveys the research in the past decade on imperfect information models of aggregate supply and the Phillips curve. This new work has emphasized that information is dispersed and disseminates slowly across a population of agents who strategically interact in their use of information. We discuss the foundations on which models of aggregate supply rest, as well as the microfoundations for two classes of imperfect information models: models with partial information, where agents observe economic conditions with noise, and models with delayed information, where they observe economic conditions with a lag. We derive the implications of these two classes of models for the existence of a nonvertical aggregate supply, the persistence of the real effects of monetary policy, the difference between idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks, the dynamics of disagreement, and the role of transparency in policy. Finally, we present some of the topics on the research frontier in this area. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2>
Chapter 9. Investing and Portfolio Allocation for Retirement ¤ The demographic situation in the majority of industrialized countries calls for the increasing participation in funded retirement programs, should the prospective retirees desire to maintain their habitual standard of living in retirement. This poses new challenges for both prospective retirees and policymakers and reveals the need for easily accessible information on the subject. The goal of this chapter is to supply such essential knowledge by summarizing various important facts and research findings about investing and portfolio allocation for retirement. This chapter describes the main risks, assets, and investment products that are relevant for retirement saving, and the main research related to portfolio choice over the lifecycle and annuities. The composition of the retirement portfolio during the working life and use of funds in retirement are examined in light of the lifecycle research. This chapter provides an overview of the literature and exemplifies the research results.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4334479-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006294-6>
Introduction to the Series ¤ The series Handbooks in Economics is to produce Handbooks for various branches of economics, each of which is a definitive source, reference, and teaching supplement for use by professional researchers and advanced graduate students. Each handbook provides self-contained surveys of the current state of a branch of economics in the form of chapters prepared by leading specialists on various aspects of this branch of economics. These surveys summarize not only received results but also newer developments, from recent journal articles and discussion papers. Some original material is also included, but the main goal is to provide comprehensive and accessible surveys.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059252-2>
Chapter 13 Human Capital and Technology Diffusion ¤ This paper generalizes the Nelson–Phelps catch-up model of technology diffusion. We allow for the possibility that the pattern of technology diffusion can be exponential, which would predict that nations would exhibit positive catch-up with the leader nation, or logistic, in which a country with a sufficiently small capital stock may exhibit slower total factor productivity growth than the leader nation. We derive a nonlinear specification for total factor productivity growth that nests these two specifications. We estimate this specification for a cross-section of nations from 1960 through 1995. Our results support the logistic specification, and are robust to a number of sensitivity checks. Our model also appears to predict slow total factor productivity growth well. 22 of the 27 nations that we identify as lacking the critical human capital levels needed to achieve faster total factor productivity growth than the leader nation in 1960 did achieve lower growth over the next 35 years.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059252-2>
Chapter 39 Information Cascade Experiments ¤ This chapter focuses on the information cascade experiments. The concept of an information cascade can be explained in the context of a specific numerical example that was used in initial laboratory experiments. The predictions are publicly announced as they are made, but individuals are not able to observe others' private signals. The first person in the sequence must predict only on the basis of private information. All of the analysis is based on the assumption that others do not make mistakes, and we conjecture that the anomalous behavior patterns may be explained by incorporating the possibility of decision error. When others may make errors, the option of following one's own information becomes more attractive. Even though these applications are motivated by naturally occurring institutions, the usefulness of field data is limited by the fact that the private information of traders and/or betters typically cannot be observed. Laboratory experiments are particularly useful in examining herding behavior because private information is observed by the experimenter and the flow is information can be precisely controlled.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Conceptual design of a microscale balance based on force compensation ¤ Macroscopic electromagnetic force compensation (EMFC) balances are well established but were not yet demonstrated within microsystems. Hence, in this paper, the concept and the design of a micro fabricated force compensation balance is presented. The implemented concentrated compliance mechanism in form of flexure hinges enables motion with high precision, which is combined with a force compensation mechanism. The concept of force compensation promises a high measurement range, which is expected to be up to 0.5 mN, while still enabling a high resolution of less than 8 nN. The developed dynamic model of the miniaturized balance is used for the design of a PID-controller strategy. Here, continuous and time-discrete controller approaches are compared. The time-discrete controller with realistic delay times, leads to an accuracy of the controller, which is better than the expected accuracy of the integrated capacitive position sensor.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4205811-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017233-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4774350-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4198914-4>
Chapter 37 Quality of life and environmental comparisons ¤ Recent research into the urban quality of life (QOL) is reviewed and analyzed, with a special emphasis on the estimation of implicit prices of environmental attributes. New work has incorporated traditional concerns of urban theory into QOL analyses, as well as increased our understanding of specification bias problems in hedonic estimations. However, empirical research into the QOL finds itself at a crossroads, as the large city-specific error components in the underlying wage and housing expenditure hedonic specifications result in imprecise measurement of overall QOL values and rankings. Amassing higher quality databases to deal with this problem should be high on the agenda of those interested in this research program.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4>
Chapter 28. Economic Growth and the Environment: A Review of Theory and Empirics ¤ The relationship between economic growth and the environment is, and will always remain, controversial. Some see the emergence of new pollution problems, the lack of success in dealing with global warming and the still rising population in the Third World as proof positive that humans are a short-sighted and rapacious species. Others however see the glass as half full. They note the tremendous progress made in providing urban sanitation, improvements in air quality in major cities and marvel at the continuing improvements in the human condition made possible by technological advance. The first group focuses on the remaining and often serious environmental problems of the day; the second on the long, but sometimes erratic, history of improvement in living standards. These views are not necessarily inconsistent and growth theory offers us the tools needed to explore the link between environmental problems of today and the likelihood of their improvement tomorrow. This review articles discusses and evaluates the theoretical literature linking environmental quality to economic growth. We focus on three questions. These are: (1) what is the relationship between economic growth and the environment? (2) how can we escape the limits to growth imposed by environmental constraints? and (3) where should future research focus its efforts? For the most part, we discuss the link between industrial pollution and growth, but also show how this most recent work is related to earlier contributions on exhaustible resources and growth. While no review can settle the perennial debate over the limits to growth, this review moves the literature forward by identifying important unresolved theoretical questions, reports on the results of recent empirical work, and provides an integrative assessment of where we stand today.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3>
Chapter 8 Growth Econometrics ¤ This paper provides a survey and synthesis of econometric tools that have been employed to study economic growth. While these tools range across a variety of statistical methods, they are united in the common goals of first, identifying interesting contemporaneous patterns in growth data and second, drawing inferences on long-run economic outcomes from cross-section and temporal variation in growth. We describe the main stylized facts that have motivated the development of growth econometrics, the major statistical tools that have been employed to provide structural explanations for these facts, and the primary statistical issues that arise in the study of growth data. An important aspect of the survey is attention to the limits that exist in drawing conclusions from growth data, limits that reflect model uncertainty and the general weakness of available data relative to the sorts of questions for which they are employed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059252-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3>
Chapter 9 Why Has Black-White Skill Convergence Stopped? ¤ All data sources indicate that black-white skill gaps diminished over most of the 20th century, but black-white skill gaps as measured by test scores among youth and educational attainment among young adults have remained constant or increased in absolute value since the late 1980s. I examine the potential importance of discrimination against skilled black workers, changes in black family structures, changes in black household incomes, black-white differences in parenting norms, and education policy as factors that may contribute to the recent stability of black-white skill gaps. Absent changes in public policy or the economy that facilitate investment in black children, best case scenarios suggest that even approximate black-white skill parity is not possible before 2050, and equally plausible scenarios imply that the black-white skill gap will remain quite significant throughout the 21st century.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2>
Chapter 31 Experiments with Arbitrage Across Assets ¤ Theoretical finance is essentially the study of inter-temporal arbitrage, but it is often interesting also to analyze relationships between asset prices. Cross-sectional analysis makes it possible to purge both field and laboratory data of unobservable changes in time-varying fundamentals. Also, although backward induction is at the heart of asset- pricing theory, subjects may find its logic dauntingly complex. They may be able to perceive cross-asset arbitrage opportunities much more readily. Foreign exchange markets are also environments where arbitrage across assets is salient. Indeed, purchasing power parity, uncovered interest parity, and covered interest parity are all descriptions of arbitrage across currencies, goods, and interest-bearing assets. Thus a simple theory of cross-asset arbitrage predicts the bluered exchange rate well, while the dollar price of each asset is quite different from its fundamental. Triangular arbitrage, a fundamental aspect of exchange rate theory, holds in these data, while a simple notion of inter-temporal arbitrage is soundly refuted.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2>
Governance and investment of sovereign and public pension reserve funds in selected OECD countries ¤ Many countries around the world are partly prefunding their otherwise pay-as-you-go (PAYG) financed social security systems by establishing or further developing existing public pension reserve funds (PPRFs). Most OECD countries have put in place internal and external governance mechanisms and investment controls to ensure the sound management of these funds and better isolate them from undue political influence. These structures and mechanisms are in line with OECD standards of good pension fund governance and investment management. In particular, the requirements of accountability, suitability and transparency are broadly met by these reserve funds. However, some specific details of the funds’ governance and investment management could be improved in a few countries, such as enhancing the expertise in the funds’ governing boards and constraining discretionary interventions by government. Such reforms will ultimately raise the long-term investment performance of the funds and the solvency of social security systems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3>
Extension of the Ahiezer-Kac Determinant Formula to the Case of Real-Valued Symbols with Two Real Zeros ¤ The Fredholm determinant asymptotics for self-adjoint convolution operators on finite intervals with real symbols vanishing on the real axis is studied. Explicit formulae are obtained in the case where the symbol satisfies the generalized zero index condition and has only two simple zeros of analytic type. These formulae are direct extensions of the AhiezerKacSzegö limit theorem which, in particular, take into account the oscillating character of the asymptotics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037944-9>
Chapter 66 Production, Productivity, and Public Investment in East Asian Agriculture ¤ Since the 1950s, agricultural growth in East Asia (China, Mongolia, North Korea, South Korea, and Taiwan) has reduced rural poverty and created a strong base for economic development. To gain a better understanding of the nature of this growth, we examine the sources of change in agricultural production and total factor productivity (TFP) and decompose the measurements into reform-based time periods. We also review studies that link public investments to agricultural growth and poverty reduction. We find that formulating growth-inducing and poverty-reducing strategies requires policymakers to understand the relative returns of different types of investments.

Chapter 19 Empirical studies of exchange rates: Price behavior, rate determination and market efficiency ¤ This chapter provides an overview of empirical results concerning recent exchange rate behavior. Alternative valuation measures, time series, and distributional properties have been covered in the chapter, along with estimates of transaction costs in the foreign exchange market. The chapter reviews empirical tests of specific models of exchange rate determination. It tests a particular model of exchange rate determination to forecast exchange rates or to examine the effect of other economic policies on exchange rates and vice versa. The chapter discusses the simple monetary approach, where exchange rates are determined by the relative demand for two moneys, and then proceeds to a portfolio balance approach that introduces bonds. It presents tests of foreign exchange market efficiency. Finally, the chapter provides an overview of efficient market theory, a review of evidence on the efficiency of markets in removing risk-free opportunities, and the evidence of the efficiency of markets in removing risky profit opportunities. It includes the evidence on the relationship between the forward rate and future spot rate. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1>
Chapter 72. Population and Health Policies* ¤ The program evaluation literature for population and health policies is in flux, with many disciplines documenting biological and behavioral linkages from fetal development to late life mortality, chronic disease, and disability, though their implications for policy remain uncertain. Both macro- and microeconomics seek to understand and incorporate connections between economic development and the demographic transition. The focus here is on research methods, findings, and questions that economists can clarify regarding the causal relationships between economic development, health outcomes, and reproductive behavior, which operate in many directions, posing problems for identifying causal pathways. The connection between conditions under which people live and their expected life span and health status refers to “health production functions.” The relationships between an individual's stock of health and productivity, well-being, and duration of life encompasses the “returns to health human capital.” The control of reproduction improves directly the well-being of women, and the economic opportunities of her offspring. The choice of population policies may be country specific and conditional on institutional setting, even though many advances in biomedical and public health knowledge, including modern methods of birth control, are now widely available. Evaluation of a policy intervention in terms of cost effectiveness is typically more than a question of technological efficiency, but also the motivation for adoption, and the behavioral responsiveness to the intervention of individuals, families, networks, and communities. Well-specified research strategies are required to address (1) the economic production of health capacities from conception to old age; (2) the wage returns to increasing health status attributable to policy interventions; (3) the conditions affecting fertility, family time allocation, and human capital investments; and (4) the consequences for women and their families of policies which change the timing as well as number of births.

Chapter 8. Institutions and Economic Growth in Historical Perspective ¤ This chapter surveys the historical evidence on the role of institutions in economic growth and points out weaknesses in a number of stylized facts widely accepted in the growth literature. It shows that private-order institutions have not historically substituted for public-order ones in enabling markets to function; that parliaments representing wealth holders have not invariably been favorable for growth; and that the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England did not mark the sudden emergence of either secure property rights or economic growth. Economic history has been used to support both the centrality and the irrelevance of secure property rights to growth, but the reason for this is conceptual vagueness. Secure property rights require much more careful analysis, distinguishing between rights of ownership, use, and transfer, and between generalized and particularized variants. Similar careful analysis would, we argue, clarify the growth effects of other institutions, including contract-enforcement mechanisms, guilds, communities, serfdom, and the family. Greater precision concerning institutional effects on growth can be achieved by developing sharper criteria of application for conventional institutional labels, endowing institutions with a scale of intensity or degree, and recognizing that the effects of each institution depend on its relationship with other components of the wider institutional system.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3>
Chapter 47 The causes and consequences of longterm unemployment in Europe ¤ One of the most striking features of European labor markets is the high incidence of longterm unemployment. In this chapter, we review the literature on its causes and consequences. Our main conclusions are that: the rise in the incidence of longterm unemployment has been “caused” by a collapse of outflow rates at all durations of unemployment; while the longterm unemployed do leave unemployment at a slower rate than the shortterm unemployed, this has always been the case and their relative outflow rate has not fallen over time; there is no evidence that, for a given level of unemployment, the incidence of longterm unemployment has been ratcheting up over time; once one controls for heterogeneity of the unemployed, there is little evidence of outflow rates that decline over a spell of unemployment. While these findings suggest that longterm unemployment is not a problem independent of unemployment itself, one should recognize that the experience of longterm unemployment is a horrid one for those unfortunate enough to experience it.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127364-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8>
Chapter Five. Demand for Health Insurance ¤ This chapter reviews topics related to the demand for health insurance, including the question of how choice of health insurance should be structured for consumers. After the first section summarizes some of the institutional features of health insurance in high- and middle-income countries, a second section synthesizes the normative and empirical literature on demand-side cost sharing in health insurance, integrating new developments in multiple goods, consumer errors in valuing health care and “offset effects” with the traditional risk protection-appropriate incentives trade-off. The practice of selective contracting on the supply side is an alternative to demand-side cost sharing. A third section proposes a theory of selective contracting and relates this supply-side policy to the question of optimal demand-side cost sharing. We observe two distinct approaches to structuring choice of health insurance in the US, private employers who severely limit choice, and public payers’ (and individual insurance markets’) market-determined choices. A fourth section reviews the pluses and minuses of these alternatives, and discusses the implications for structuring health insurance markets in the US.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Chapter 8. Economic Analysis of Risk and Uncertainty Induced by Health Shocks: A Review and Extension ¤ We review and extend the economic analysis of mitigating risks in the presence of health shocks. The existing literature is mainly focused on how shocks affect consumption, for example through their impact on medical spending. We argue that this focus is limited in that shocks to health itself, rather than consumption, may be more damaging. Since human capital is not transferrable, health risk—unlike medical spending risk—cannot be pooled through traditional insurance. Instead, medical innovation is the main method of achieving smoothing in health across disease states. We explore the welfare implications of this “health insurance” view of medical R&amp;D . We also review the evidence on how FDA regulations affect overall health risk, as regulations lower health risks of products ex post but raise risk ex ante by discouraging medical innovation. More analysis seems warranted on the relative value of programs aimed at mitigating shocks to health itself by stimulating innovation versus health insurance reforms aimed mainly at consumption smoothing.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120934-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050133-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070864-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186957-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135592-1>
Chapter 19 Experiments in Decentralized Monopoly Restraint ¤ This chapter focuses on laboratory experimental examinations of a particular class of institutions, policies or mechanisms of monopoly control. These are mechanisms which take the existence of a monopoly as a given and ask how might the abuses of monopoly be controlled in a decentralized manner. The most prevalent form of monopoly control in the United States for many decades was cost-based rate of return regulation. The academic and practitioner critics of rate of return regulation were numerous. In general, the arguments were that the incentives in the rate of return regulatory process itself led to distortions relative to standard measures of efficiency. This chapter focuses exclusively on experiments that do more than simply reform centralized price regulation, that is, we examine decentralized forms of monopoly control.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1>
Chapter 15 Why does money affect output? A survey ¤ Considerable studies have been done in the past years on to answer the question that why money affects output. Some of it has come from clarifying old and fuzzy ideas coordination problems and the respective roles of expectations of nominal and real rigidities. A lot of it has come from running into dead ends such as the failure to explain the joint price and output responses to money in as if competitive models or the failure of individual nominal rigidities to generate aggregate price inertia under simple Ss rules. Research on real rigidities is the most urgent. A general feature of goods markets is that the fluctuations in demand lead mostly to movements in output rather than in markups; and a general feature of labor markets is that the fluctuations in the demand for labor lead mostly to movements in employment rather than in real wages. Given these features, a very small amount of nominal rigidity will lead to long-lasting effects of nominal money on output.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2>
Chapter 12 Tests of multifactor pricing models, volatility bounds and portfolio performance ¤ Three concepts: stochastic discount factors, multi-beta pricing and mean-variance efficiency, are at the core of modern empirical asset pricing. This chapter reviews these paradigms and the relations among them, concentrating on conditional asset-pricing models where lagged variables serve as instruments for publicly available information. The different paradigms are associated with different empirical methods. We review the variance bounds of Hansen and Jagannathan (1991) , concentrating on extensions for conditioning information. Hansen's (1982) Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) is briefly reviewed as an organizing principle. Then, cross-sectional regression approaches as developed by Fama and MacBeth (1973) are reviewed and used to interpret empirical factors, such as those advocated by Fama and French (1993, 1996) . Finally, we review the multivariate regression approach, popularized in the finance literature by Gibbons (1982) and others. A regression approach, with a beta pricing formulation, and a GMM approach with a stochastic discount factor formulation, may be considered competing paradigms for empirical work in asset pricing. This discussion clarifies the relations between the various approaches. Finally, we bring the models and methods together, with a review of the recent conditional performance evaluation literature, concentrating on mutual funds and pension funds.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269795-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4508395-2>
Chapter 5. Theories of Statistical Discrimination and Affirmative Action: A Survey ¤ This chapter surveys the theoretical literature on statistical discrimination and affirmative action. This literature suggests different explanations for the existence and persistence of group inequality. This survey highlights such differences and describes in these contexts the effects of color-sighted and color-blind affirmative action policies, and the efficiency implications of discriminatory outcomes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120990-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027266-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132883-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066514-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5>
Expanded guarantees for banks : Benefits, costs and exit issues ¤ This article argues that the expansion of existing and the introduction of new guarantees for financial institutions has been a key element of the policy response to the recent financial crisis. Essentially, the government expanded its role as the provider of the safety net for banks by adopting the function of a guarantor of last resort. Among the various policy response measures, the expansion of guarantees has the benefit of entailing lower upfront fiscal costs relative to other options. Guarantees are not without cost however. Even if they do not generate significant upfront fiscal costs, they create contingent fiscal liabilities. Other potential costs include those arising from distortions to competition and incentives (moral hazard). For example, there may be a perception that similar guarantees will always be made available at low costs. The fact that the expansion of guarantees has not been as closely co-ordinated across borders as might have been desired has resulted in additional costs. To avoid additional costs arising from inconsistencies in exit strategies, close communication and coordination regarding pricing and timing issues is required, especially as a more formal framework for the public provision of insurance would still need to be developed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6>
Chapter 25 Stardom and Talent ¤ The Economics of Superstars sets out to explain the relationship between talent and success in the arts, but there is no agreement about what this relationship is. But whatever its other features may be, superstardom means that market output is concentrated on just a few artists. Concentration always raises the question of efficiency. Superstardom may be inefficient not only because it raises prices for consumers but also because it deprives other artists of the opportunity to practice art. Artists who do not practice art lose psychic income. Because psychic income cannot be transferred from one person to another, the loss of this income may be inefficient. This chapter reviews theories of superstardom and theories about the emergence of stars. The efficiency of superstardom is discussed in terms of effects on consumers and the use of publicity rights by the star. The chapter goes on to deal with the loss of opportunities to practice art that are caused by superstardom and suggests ways to alleviate the problem. Finally the empirical literature that tests the different theories of superstardom is reviewed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1>
Chapter 3. Technical Change and Industrial Dynamics as Evolutionary Processes ¤ This chapter reviews and integrates much of what has been learned on the processes of technological evolution, their main features, and their effects on the evolution of industries. First, we map and integrate the various pieces of evidence concerning the nature and structure of technological knowledge, the sources of novel opportunities, the dynamics through which they are tapped, and the revealed outcomes in terms of advances in production techniques and product characteristics. Explicit recognition of the evolutionary manners through which technological change proceeds has also profound implications for the way economists theorize about and analyze a number of topics central to the discipline. One is the theory of the firm in industries where technological and organizational innovation is important. Indeed a large literature has grown up on this topic, addressing the nature of the technological and organizational capabilities which business firms embody and the ways they evolve over time. Another domain concerns the nature of competition in such industries, wherein innovation and diffusion affect growth and survival probabilities of heterogeneous firms. The processes of knowledge accumulation and diffusion involve winners and losers, changing distributions of competitive abilities across different firms, and, with that, changing industrial structures. Both the sector-specific characteristics of technologies and their degrees of maturity over their life cycles influence the patterns of industrial organization—including size distributions, degrees of concentration, relative importance of incumbents and entrants, etc. This is the second set of topics which we address. Finally, in the conclusions we briefly flag some fundamental aspects of economic growth and development as an innovation-driven evolutionary process.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059252-2>
Chapter 26 Principles of Market Adjustment and Stability ¤ First, market prices can exhibit the type of instability predicted by classical dynamic models. Second, the conditions under which instability is observed are not captured by the cobweb model but such conditions are captured by models of the form developed by Marshall and Walras in which the market has perversely shaped curves, such as an upward-sloped demand or downward-sloped supply. Third, the appropriate model, Marshall or Walras, depends on properties of the underlying demand and supply. If the special shape is due to the existence of an externality such as a fad or a Marshallian external economy, then experiments have demonstrated that the Marshallian model is the appropriate model. If the special shape is due to income effects, then the appropriate model is the Walrasian model and not the Marshallian model. That is, if the special shape is due to income effects such as Giffen goods or a backward-bending supply of labor, then the Walrasian model reﬂects the appropriate principles. In summary, the mystery of the price discovery process is solved, in part, by classical models of adjustment.

Competition Issues in Road Transport ¤ The road transport sector, an essential mode of transport in OECD economies, is conventionally divided into two, largely unrelated, parts – the road freight industry and the road passenger industry. The sectors under discussion – trucking, buses, and taxis – have quite different characteristics and scope for competition, which reflect inter alia differences in the timeliness and economies of scale and scope in operations. Trucking can sustain high level of competition and to some extent buses as well while there is some debate as to how and what form of competition can be introduced in taxis. As in the air transport industry, international trucking is governed by restrictive bilateral treaties. Most countries have liberalised their domestic trucking sector, removing controls on entry and prices. In the bus industry, long-distance bus services are liberalised in some countries while intra-city or local buses are very rarely liberalised. The taxi industry appears at first sight to be competitive with many buyers and many sellers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Chapter 8 The agricultural transformation ¤ From both historical and contemporary cross-section perspectives, the agricultural transformation seems to evolve through at least four phases that are roughly definable. The process starts when agricultural productivity per worker rises. This increased productivity creates a surplus, which in the second phase can be tapped directly, through taxation and factor flows, or indirectly, through government intervention into the rural-urban terms of trade. This surplus can be utilized to develop the nonagricultural sector, and this phase has been the focus of most dual economy models of development. For resources to flow out of agriculture, rural factor, and product markets must become better integrated with those in the rest of the economy. The progressive integration of the agricultural sector into the macro economy, via improved infrastructure and market-equilibrium linkages, represents a third phase in agricultural development. When this phase is successful, the fourth phase is barely noticeable; the role of agriculture in industrialized economies is little different from the role of the steel, housing, or insurance sectors. But when the integration is not successfully accomplishedand most countries have found it extremely difficult for political reasonsgovernments encounter serious problems of resource allocation and even problems beyond their borders because of pervasive attempts by high-income countries to protect their farmers from foreign competition.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213090-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7>
Chapter 9 The Economics of Human Relationships ¤ Behind my reciprocation of a friend's gift may lie both instrumental reasons (I expect further future gifts) and communicative reasons (I want to establish or confirm a friendship per se ). In a theory of rational individual action, such communicative reasons can be incorporated as an argument of an agent's objective function. This chapter starts by reviewing a recent literature that takes this direction and introduces relational concerns through the concept of socially provided goods. From a relational perspective, however, individual intentions are not all that matters: a relation is characterized by the two (or more) persons linked and by the kind of link they have. This perspective, which in our view should complement the more traditional, individualistic one, is particularly suited to embed individual motivations in their social context and to study their co-evolution. In particular, we focus on the conditions under which reciprocity and altruism may survive and even spread over as social norms. Drawing from the literature on the dynamics of social norms, we argue that the combination of individual incentives and the forces of social selection may lead to a contraposition between a society's material success and its well-being, i.e., between its vitality and its satisfaction. Finally, we consider that the recent literature on the economic analysis of human relationships invites to a new reading of the classics of economics and of moral and political philosophy. Both the new and the old literature point at the need to broaden the scope of economic modeling, to lay down the building blocks of a new, up-to-date approach to political economy that is equipped to tackle the challenges posed by advanced industrial societies in their social, cultural and economic selection dimensions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057542-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020511-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184535-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4302876-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129281-9>
Chapter 4 The Gift and Reciprocity: Perspectives from Economic Anthropology ¤ Economic anthropology is a contested area of interdisciplinary research. Although some practitioners define the task as the application of mainstream economic theorizing to the full range of human groups in time and space, many others argue in the light of the ethnographic evidence that it is impossible to generalize Western models, such as those which base themselves on concepts of utility maximization by individual agents. These objections have nowhere been more vociferous than in the domain of exchange. Bronislaw Malinowski identified many kinds of transaction among the Trobriand Islanders; after initially sketching a notion of the pure gift, he later modified this and argued instead that reciprocity, in the sense of calculated give and take, was the central principle underpinning all social life. A more significant theoretical challenge to the presuppositions of modern economics came in same period from Marcel Mauss, who outlined in his essay The Gift an evolutionary process that began with the total prestation and ends in the modern world, dominated by contracts and markets. Only in this modern world do we arguably have the possibility of altruism, understood as disinterested giving. After reviewing some of the more influential later contributions to the anthropological literature on these topics, notably those of Karl Polanyi, Marshall Sahlins and Stephen Gudeman, this paper goes on to present brief ethnographic illustrations. These include examples of food sharing among hunter-gatherers and cultivators, and the hospitality rituals of the contemporary western bourgeois classes. Illustrations from postsocialist societies show the difficulties of predicting economic behavior in this field: some people seem to respond to dislocation by using objects to strengthen their interpersonal networks, while others facing apparently similar conditions prefer to contract their gift-giving. Finally, brief critical note is taken of recent ethnographic experiments in this field.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184535-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129281-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4302876-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020511-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057542-1>
Chapter 5 Educational Wage Premia and the Distribution of Earnings: An International Perspective ¤ This chapter analyzes the international evidence on the relationship between educational wage premia and the distribution of personal labor earnings. The aim is to review what is known about the contribution of differences in relative wages across schooling levels to the degree of variability, between countries and over time, in the pecuniary returns to work. Definition and measurement problems are of paramount importance in analyses of this kind, and so a large part of the chapter is devoted to some of these issues.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2>
Overview of Advances in Risk Management of Government Debt ¤ Modern risk management has become an important tool for achieving strategic debt targets in the OECD area. In essence, risk management policies, based on the use of formal methods, are now an integral part of debt management in most OECD jurisdictions. In general, risk management tolerances and policies are approved (and often set) by the Ministry of Finance (or other appropriate Ministry). This strategy about risks entails an explicit political decision about the trade-off between costs and risks. The actual risk management operation is often run at a separate agency responsible for management of the sovereign debt or at the central bank if it manages the debt, and is typically segregated from other treasury...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Chapter 20 Income and price effects in foreign trade ¤ This chapter identifies, summarizes, and evaluates the main methodological and policy issues that have surrounded the estimation of trade equations. By “trade equations,” it mean equations for the time-series behavior of the quantities and prices of merchandise imports and exports, and as the title of the chapter suggests, it focuses explicitly on the role played by income and prices in the determination of these trade variables. The chapter addresses the main methodological issues in the specification of trade models. It discusses variables in demand and supply functions for imports and exports, what choices and compromises have to be made in the measurement of these variables, and what light existing evidence throws on the choice among competing specifications. The treatment of dynamics and time lags, aggregation, simultaneity, and stability of the relationships concerned has also been discussed in the chapter. The empirical estimates of income and price elasticities themselves and to the policy implications of those estimates have also been reviewed. Finally, suggestions are made for further research in the chapter.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0>
Chapter 26 International Trade Theory: The Evidence ¤ This chapter focuses on the international trade theory. It discusses the Ricardian and the RicardoViner models. These models point to technological differences as the source of international comparative advantage. A simple Ricardian model has one input, labor, which is assumed to be mobile across the two sectors of the economy, but internationally immobile. The RicardoViner model introduces into the model two additional factors that are sector-specific. This gives curvature to the production possibilities curve and also allows international commerce to affect the distribution of income. Although there is little or no direct empirical support for these simple models, there is nonetheless growing awareness that technological differences are a natural consequence of economic isolation and play a role in the integration process, following an economic liberalization. The chapter provides an overview of the HeckscherOhlin model and discusses the Rybcyzinski theorem and the StolperSamuelson theorem. It also reviews the studies of the HeckscherOhlin model based on cross country comparisons. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1>
Chapter 3. Games on Networks ¤ We provide an overview and synthesis of the literatures analyzing games in which players are connected via a network structure. We discuss, in particular, the impact of the structure of the network on individuals’ behaviors. We focus on game theoretic modeling, but also include some discussion of analyses of peer effects, as well as applications to diffusion, employment, crime, industrial organization, and education.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8>
Chapter 1. Forecasting Inflation ¤ This chapter discusses recent developments in inflation forecasting. We perform a horse-race among a large set of traditional and recently developed forecasting methods, and discuss a number of principles that emerge from this exercise. We find that judgmental survey forecasts outperform model-based ones, often by a wide margin. A very simple forecast that is just a glide path between the survey assessment of inflation in the current-quarter and the long-run survey forecast value turns out to be competitive with the actual survey forecast and thereby does about as well or better than model-based forecasts. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of some specific prediction methods, including forecasts based on the Phillips curve and based on dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models, in greater detail. We also consider measures of inflation expectations taken from financial markets and the tradeoff between forecasting aggregates and disaggregates.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1>
Chapter 4. Advances in Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Health Interventions ¤ Recent work has clarified the welfare implications of the application of cost-effectiveness analysis to the allocation of health care. Although cost-effectiveness analysis shares many similarities with cost-benefit analysis, it did not develop as an outgrowth of neoclassical welfare economics. Consequently, even though the welfare implications of public decisionmaking based on cost-benefit analysis have long been understood, until recently the conditions under which decisions made on the basis of cost-effectiveness criteria lead to potential Pareto improvement had received little attention. This chapter describes the welfare economic foundations of cost-effectiveness analysis and how such foundations can be applied to resolve controversies in the application of the technique. It also discusses procedures for applying the technique, the circumstances under which decision rules based on cost-effectiveness analysis have desirable welfare economic properties, the appropriate perspective for the analysis, and issues in measuring outcomes. Even when standard welfare economic assumptions are not fully accurate descriptions of the markets and conditions in which health care is delivered, cost-effectiveness analysis can be a useful guide to allocation decisions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Chapter 9 Distributional and macroeconomic aspects of environmental policy ¤ The achievement of an efficient balance between the economic system and the environment is just one of many societal objectives. How environmental policy affects these other objectives is important because these impacts may serve to constrain the set of politically feasible policies, may recommend some approaches over others or may provide guidance as to the most appropriate timing of policy implementation. Two effects of environmental policy have been discussed in the chapter: distributional effects and macroeconomic effects. The former concerns how the costs and benefits of environmental policy are distributed among socioeconomic groups and among geographic regions; the latter concerns the impact of environmental policy on important national aggregates such as inflation, unemployment, and productivity. The chapter examines the theoretical models that serve to identify the channels of influence, the data which provide the raw material for the estimates and the methods used to quantify the impacts. The objective is to convey a sense of the magnitude of the impacts along with an appreciation for the reliability of these estimates for policy purposes. Finally, the chapter discusses the policies that have triggered the effects being estimated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014743-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075236-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1>
Chapter 10. Evolution of Ownership and Control Around the World: The Changing Face of Capitalism ¤ This chapter documents the evolution of ownership and control of firms around the world over a hundred year period from the beginning of the 20th century to today. It records the substantial changes that have taken place in the nature of stock markets and contrasts these with the persistent patterns of ownership that are observed in many countries around the world. In particular, it documents the growth in dispersion in ownership that took place in many countries from the early part of the 20th century. It reports that this took place in the absence of formal systems of investor protection but in the presence of institutional developments that facilitated the building of trust between investors and firms. Contrary to the view that concentrations of ownership necessarily undermine the operation of equity markets by exploiting minority interests, the chapter argues that in some countries they played a central role not just in exercising control but also in promoting relations between investors and firms that were central to the development of their stock markets. In particular, concentrations of ownership in the hands of families may have been a source of public as well as private benefits. The chapter concludes by looking at recent changes and argues that these reinforce the long-run patterns of the relative decline of the UK and US stock markets, the continued decline of family firms in the UK, the growth of private equity and the emergence of new forms of concentrated shareholdings.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4419850-4>
Chapter 11. Complex Decision Making : The Roles of Cognitive Limitations, Cognitive Decline, and Aging ¤ We review the evidence on decision making in complex choice situations—i.e., situations where there are many alternatives and/or where attributes of alternatives are difficult to understand. We focus on choices about health insurance, health care, and retirement planning, all of which are very important for the well-being of the elderly. Our review suggests that consumers in general, and the elderly in particular, have great difficulty making optimal choices in these areas. They often behave in ways that imply a high degree of “confusion,” such as (i) failure to understand key attributes of alternatives or (ii) inadequate cognitive capacity to process payoff relevant information. We go on to discuss extensions to standard rational choice models that account for consumer confusion. These include allowing perceived attributes to depart from true attributes, the use of heuristics, and inattention or procrastination. Such departures from rationality can be moderated by cognitive ability, age, etc. We hope that these new models may be useful in designing paternalistic interventions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006294-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4334479-3>
Chapter 1 A brief history of fiscal doctrine ¤ This chapter provides brief history of fiscal doctrine. The history of fiscal doctrine, perhaps more than that of any other aspect of economics, carries a particular fascination. On the one hand, it reflects the advance of analytical economics, an enrichment of the tool box, to use Joan Robinson's terms, which may then be applied to the solution of fiscal problems. The close linkages between general and fiscal theory is most evident for the analysis of tax incidence, which at each stage reflects the prevailing theory of price and distribution. The analysis of tax equity was affected profoundly by the growth of utility theory. The history of fiscal theory is arranged into five assays dealing with the theory of public expenditures, equity in taxation, efficiency in taxation, shifting and incidence, and macro aspects of fiscal policy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4242500-1>
Chapter 18. The Role of Media in Finance ¤ This chapter reviews and synthesizes a rapidly growing subfield that analyzes the relation between media and financial markets. Research in this area identifies novel data sources, such as newspaper articles, Internet search queries, and posts on social networks, and employs inventive empirical methods, notably textual analysis, to quantify the rich information environment in modern financial markets. Such data and methods enable powerful tests of theories and have the potential to address longstanding puzzles in finance, such as why trading volume and stock price volatility are so high.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129410-5>
Regulatory reform in road freight ¤ This study analyses regulatory developments across OECD Member countries in the road freight industry, with a focus on how these developments have affected competition and performance. Over the past two decades, a growing number of OECD countries have recognised that regulations unduly restricting competitive developments in this industry needed to be relaxed. Still, the pace and scale of liberalisation has varied widely from one country to another. The main remaining impediment to competition is the restrictive web of bilateral international and/or multilateral agreements that continue to impose discrimination on foreign hauliers. The empirical evidence available suggests that liberalisation has promoted efficiency and consumer welfare in the countries that have implemented reforms.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2>
Chapter 69 Population Growth and Trends in Food Production and Consumption in the CWANA Region ¤ Many of the financial and social challenges that face Central and West Asia and North Africa (CWANA) can be addressed through more efficient and sustainable use of arable land and water resources. In recent years improvements in land and water use have come from an agricultural sector that is moving from state to market control, but without greater changes the region will continue to be constrained by environmental degradation, institutional inefficiencies, and persistently high population growth rates. This chapter presents a trend analysis of major cropping groups for the period 19612002 and summarizes ways to address the key problems of food security, poverty reduction, and conservation of natural resources throughout the CWANA region. The International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) and its partners are presented as a regional knowledge portal through which many of these initiatives can occur.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4704302-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2>
Chapter 9. Analysis of Numerical Errors ¤ This paper provides a general framework for the quantitative analysis of stochastic dynamic models. We review the convergence properties of some numerical algorithms and available methods to bound approximation errors. We then address the convergence and accuracy properties of the simulated moments. We study both optimal and non-optimal economies. Optimal economies generate smooth laws of motion defining Markov equilibria, and can be approximated by recursive methods with contractive properties. Non-optimal economies, however, lack existence of continuous Markov equilibria, and need to be simulated by numerical methods with weaker approximation properties.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Chapter 9. The GED ¤ The General Educational Development (GED) credential is issued on the basis of an eight-hour subject-based test. The test claims to establish equivalence between dropouts and traditional high school graduates, opening the door to college and positions in the labor market. In 2008 alone, almost 500,000 dropouts passed the test, amounting to 12% of all high school credentials issued in that year. This chapter reviews the academic literature on the GED, which finds minimal value of the certificate in terms of labor market outcomes and that only a few individuals successfully use it as a path to obtain post-secondary credentials. Although the GED establishes cognitive equivalence on one measure of scholastic aptitude, recipients still face limited opportunity due to deficits in noncognitive skills such as persistence, motivation, and reliability. The literature finds that the GED testing program distorts social statistics on high school completion rates, minority graduation gaps, and sources of wage growth. Recent work demonstrates that, through its availability and low cost, the GED also induces some students to drop out of school. The GED program is unique to the United States and Canada, but provides policy insight relevant to any nation's educational context.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2>
Chapter 21 Game theory and statistics ¤ Game theory, in particular the theory of two-person zero-sum games, has played a multiple role in statistics. Its principal role has been to provide a unifying framework for the various branches of statistical inference. Statistics, regarded from the game-theoretic point of view, became known as decision theory. While unifying statistical inference, decision theory has also proved useful as a tool for weeding out procedures and approaches that have taken hold in statistics without good reason. On a less fundamental level, game theory has contributed to statistical inference the minimax criterion. While the role of this criterion in two-person zero-sum games is central, its application in statistics is problematic. Its justification in game theory is based on the direct opposition of interests between the players, as expressed by the zero-sum assumption. Together with the minimax criterion, randomized, or mixed, strategies also appear in decision theory. The degree of importance of randomization in statistics differs according to which player is randomizing. Mixed strategies for Nature are a priori distributions. In the Bayes approach, these are assumed to represent the Statistician's states of knowledge prior to seeing the data, rather than Nature's way of playing the game. Therefore, they are often assumed to be known to the Statistician before he or she makes his or her move, unlike the situation in the typical game-theoretic set-up. Mixed strategies for the Statistician, on the other hand, are, strictly speaking, superfluous from the Bayesian point of view, while according to the minimax criterion, it may be advantageous for the Statistician to randomize, and it is certainly reasonable to grant him or her this option.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Chapter 24. Urbanization and Growth ¤ This chapter on urbanization and growth focuses on modeling and empirical evidence that pertain to a number of inter-related questions. Why do cities form in an economy, with so much of economic activity in countries geographically concentrated in cities? Second, how do different types of cities interact with each other in terms of trade and migration? Given the answers to these questions the chapter turns to growth issues. How does a system of cities evolve under economic and population growth; and how does urban growth intersect with, or even define national economic growth? In growth theory, endogenous growth is based on knowledge spillovers and sharing, and evidence suggests that much of that interaction must occur at the level of individual cities. In the early stages of growth, economic development is characterized by urbanization – a spatial transformation of the economy, where the population moves through migration from an agricultural, rural based existence to one where production occurs in cities of endogenous numbers and size. How do we model that transformation process and what are the key aspects of the transformation? In any static, growth, or development–urbanization context, how do governance, institutions, and public policy affect city formation and sizes, which then in turn affect economic efficiency. Cities require enormous public infrastructure investments which affect urban quality of life, in particular health and safety and commuting and congestion costs. Institutions governing land markets, property rights, local government autonomy, and local financing affect the city formation process and city sizes. And national government policies concerning trade, labor policies and national investment in communications and transport infrastructure affect the shape of the urban system. A final set of questions has to do with where cities locate. What is the effect of history, of climate and of natural resource locations, including rivers and natural harbors, on the location of current urban agglomerations?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3>
Nano-structured diffraction gratings as polarizing beam splitters under vertical incidence ¤ Polarizing beam splitters have numerous applications in optical systems, e.g. for the measurement of freeform surfaces. We present a design and manufacturing process for a nanostructured diffraction grating with optimized diffraction efficiencies for TE- and TM-polarization, which acts as a beam splitter over a long range of incidence angles. First measurements confirm a strong difference in diffraction efficiencies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4603135-2>
Chapter 15 Labor markets in low-income countries ¤ Since labor is by far the most abundant resource in low-income countries, the determination of the returns to labor plays a central role in models of development. The chapter discusses the operation of low-income labor markets with reference to the models that have been and continue to be influential in shaping the study of such markets. These models are evaluated in terms of their ability to shed light on the realities of the allocation, pricing, and employment of labor in low-income countries. The chapter discusses models directly concerned with and evidence on the employment and pricing of labor in the rural (agricultural) sector. The chapter also discusses the process of determining rural wages are and their rigidity, the social and private costs of reallocating labor from agriculture to other activities, labor supply behavior, labor market dualism, and unemployment determination. The chapter describes risk-mitigating and effort-eliciting contractual arrangements involving rural labor and the organization of the agricultural enterprise in an environment characterized by incomplete markets. The chapter discusses the issue of whether labor is efficiently allocated across sectors and across geographical areas and problems of barriers to mobility. Models of migration incorporating human capital investments, information and capital constraints, uncertainty with respect to employment, riskiness in annual incomes, temporary migration, remittances, and heterogeneity in preferences and abilities among workers are discussed. The chapter also discusses urban labor markets, and addresses issues concerning the duality of urban labor markets and unemployment determination. The chapter highlights issues of importance to the study of developing economies in particular, life cycle and intergenerational labor market mobility.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213090-6>
Chapter 17 Organization of Arts and Entertainment Industries ¤ The organization of the creative (arts and entertainment) industries rests on many types of contracts. These contracts govern collaborations between artists and other parties – at arm's length, or within an enterprise. These contracts' structures devolve from a few bedrock properties of creative work and creative products. Artists invest in developing their talents, presenting themselves before ‘gatekeepers’ who seek talents that can profitably be developed and marketed. Gatekeepers commonly function as agents for selecting artists and as match-makers between artists and complementary inputs. As an extension of the gatekeeping function, the participants in creative industries take part in a continuous ranking process that sets and revises the ranks of vertically differentiated talents. Real option contracts pervasively govern the sequential steps of developing a creative product. These can leave the artist an autonomous creative agent (pop musicians and record labels) or enclose artists' talents in an employment relationship (classic Hollywood studios). The transformation of the movie industry to ‘flexible specialization’ illustrates how changing basic conditions can transform the dominant form of organization. The scales of enterprise in the creative industries tend to be driven by the efficient scales with which creative goods are distributed (very large for record labels and movie studios, small for art galleries), and they tend to assort themselves into those focused on the distribution of creative goods (‘promoters’) and those concerned with identifying and nurturing creative talents (‘pickers’). Large enterprises also include the ‘entertainment conglomerates’ which seek synergistic gains that depend theoretically on quite special conditions; foreclosure and its avoidance may be principal motives. Non-profit enterprises dominate a number of arts activities, apparently for two interrelated reasons. These activities incur high fixed but low marginal costs, pressing them to employ two-part prices and club arrangements to ensure fixed costs' coverage. When product quality is endogenous, however, non-profit status may be necessary for the manager credibly to foreswear degrading quality once the fixed payment is in hand. Non-profits supported by donation streams thus enjoy functional advantages.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1>
Chapter 2. New Monetarist Economics : Models ¤ The purpose of this paper is to discuss some of the models used in New Monetarist Economics, which is our label for a body of recent work on money, banking, payments systems, asset markets, and related topics. A key principle in New Monetarism is that solid microfoundations are critical for understanding monetary issues. We survey recent papers on monetary theory, showing how they build on common foundations. We then lay out a tractable benchmark version of the model that allows us to address a variety of issues. We use it to analyze some classic economic topics, like the welfare effects of inflation, the relationship between money and capital accumulation, and the Phillips curve. We also extend the benchmark model in new ways, and show how it can be used to generate new insights in the study of payments, banking, and asset markets.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Chapter 3 Three centuries of inequality in Britain and America ¤ Income and wealth inequality rose over the first 150 years of US history. They rose in Britain before 1875, especially 1740–1810. The first half of the 20th century equalized pre-fisc incomes both in Britain and in America. From the 1970s to the 1990s inequality rose in both countries, reversing most or all of the previous equalization. Government redistribution explains part but not all of the reversals in inequality trends. Factor-market forces and economic growth would have produced a similar timing of rises and falls in income inequality even without shifts in the progressivity of redistribution through government. Redistribution toward the poor tends to happen least in those times and polities where it would seem most justified by the usual goals of welfare policy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013887-2>
Chapter 35 Learning to Forecast Rationally ¤ This chapter reports several robustness checks. OJ specifications designed to capture prior beliefs and non-linear responses to news detected some transient effects in many subjects, but for the most part the final regression is indistinguishable from the basic specification presented in this chapter. Eight parameter MD specifications that allow separate learning for each level of each symptom also converged roughly to the basic specification presented above, but we detect a general bias towards overresponding to the more informative symptom levels and underresponding to the less informative symptom levels. This chapter draws three conclusions from the data analysis. First, the rationality assumption is a good first approximation to subjects' forecasts at the end of 480 learning trials. Second, systematic biases towards under or overresponse can be detected in specific circumstances, e.g., overresponse in the noisier OJ environment. Third, more experiments are needed in a wider variety of tasks and environments in order to understand more fully when people can learn to forecast rationally.

Chapter Twenty-Six. Probabilistic and Spatial Models of Voting ¤ This chapter discusses results about committees that use majority rule, some related results about majority rule as a social choice rule (that is, without referring to a specific context where majority rule is used), and results about electoral competitions where the winner is selected by majority rule.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022393-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066735-2>
Chapter 16 Regional policies in developing countries ¤ This chapter focuses on regional policies in developing countries. Diversity in the regional problems of developing countries and in the social and economic policies designed to alleviate these problems reflects not only different levels of development and the systems of government, but also geography, history and tradition, and societal goals. In any country, developed or developing, what constitutes a regional problem differs among social groups. In the developed industrial market economies, regional problems are rarely defined in terms of absolutes. Relative imbalances in the indicators of the social and economic conditions of different regions induce regional policy responses from the center. The chapter discusses the key themes that link thinking about regional development to the process of economic growth. It refers to the policy implications of these theories and discusses the relevance of the urban dimension in regional policy analysis. The chapter also discusses the four major aspects of regional development strategy: (1) experience with national and regional planning agencies; (2) the role of infrastructure; (3) policies to promote industrial development in lagging regions; and the roles of communications and human resource investments. It also draws some lessons from regional development experience in developing countries in the past two decades and some conclusions on the effectiveness of past policies and implications for the future.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9>
Chapter 4 Public Facility Location: A Multiregional and Multi-Authority Decision Context ¤ This chapter describes some public facility location (PFL) problems. PFL problems have been studied within several analytical traditions for example, the general location theory, the theories of public goods and public choice, and the operations research tradition. The chapter focuses on the study of PFL-problems that are related to different aspects of these traditions. The perspective in this study is not intra-urban but regional. This is emphasized by a concentration on location problems in the agendas of the following type: (i) location among municipalities in a region and (ii) location among regions in a national (or multiregional) perspective. Taking a region as a reference area, the chapter identifies the coordination problem of a regional authority and the simultaneous game-like competition among each municipality of the region. Municipality refers to a community with a local government. A similar two-level decision problem is also identified for settings with a national authority and independent regional authorities. The chapter presents various types of PFL-problems and deals with the aggregation of demand and supply from the subregional to the regional level.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1>
To Change the World: The Irony, Tragedy, and Possibility of Christianity in the Late Modern World ¤ The structure of this book is quite simple. Hunter creates a three-part typology of ways in which Christians have attempted to change the world; he then systematically argues for the inadequacy of each strategy; and, finally, he proposes a fourth alternative that he says fits his theory of power and cultural change. To give away the ending of this review, I found his three-fold typology to be useful at a descriptive level, but I was dissatisfied with the solution that he proposes. The first type he labels “defensive against” and includes fundamentalists, many mainstream evangelicals, and some conservative Catholics. They have a mythical ideal of a rightly ordered society and believe that American culture is morally bankrupt, moving toward disorder.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049420-2>
Chapter 115 On the Performance of the Lottery Procedure for Controlling Risk Preferences ¤ This chapter describes the lottery procedure for inducing preferences over units of experimental exchange and show how it is supported by several experiments on behavior in simple contexts. This chapter reviews various evidence from a set of paired choice and pricing tasks designed to determine whether subjects' revealed preferences over gambles are consistent with attempted risk preference induction. There is strong support for the performance of inducing when subjects choose between paired gambles. Subjects induced to be risk seeking nearly always choose the riskier gamble, while those induced to be risk averse choose the less risky one. There is similar support for pricing gambles, but the strength of the effect is a function of the variance of the gambles. This is consistent with other experimental evidence about the importance of saliency. Risk preferences matter little when there is little risk As risk increases, risk preferences should become more important in the experiments. Subjects appear to price gambles more consistently with their induced risk preferences as variance increases.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1>
Chapter 8. Energy, the Environment and US Economic Growth ¤ The point of departure for the study of the impact of energy and environmental policies is the neoclassical theory of economic growth formulated by Cass (1965) and Koopmans (1967). The long-run properties of economic growth models are independent of energy and environmental policies. However, these policies affect capital accumulation and rates of productivity growth that determine the intermediate-run trends that are important for policy evaluation. Heterogeneity of different energy producers and consumers is critical for the evaluation of energy and environmental policies. To capture this heterogeneity it is necessary to distinguish among commodities, industries and households. Econometric methods are essential for summarizing information on different industries and consumer groups in a form suitable for general equilibrium modeling. In this chapter, we consider the application of econometric general equilibrium modeling to the US the economy that has been studied most intensively. The framework for our analysis is provided by the Intertemporal General Equilibrium Model (IGEM) introduced by Jorgenson and Wilcoxen (1998). The new version of the IGEM presented in this paper is employed for the evaluation of proposed legislation on climate policy by the US Environmental Protection Agency (2012b).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065341-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210294-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224214-9>
Chapter 5 Structural change in agricultural production: Economics, technology and policy ¤ Over the last few decades, the structure of agricultural production around the world has been changing. An economic analysis of the factors influencing this evolution is presented. Special attention is given to the role of technology and resource mobility. Linkages with changes in market conditions are also evaluated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2>
Chapter 3 Money in general equilibrium theory ¤ This chapter describes conditions for the existence of general monetary equilibrium in a simple setting and discusses the role of money in general equilibrium theory. The principal contribution of general equilibrium theory has been its axiomatic validation of the benchmark model of price taking, individual rationality, and market clearing. The basic role of money as a medium of exchange is lost unless it also fills its role as a numeraire. If the value of money in relation to goods is zero, it cannot serve its purpose at all. Because terminal money lays no apparent claim to goods or services, the terminal value of money is zero. This implies, by the same reasoning, that the value of money is zero in the penultimate period. In Bewley's infinite horizon model, uncertainty generates a precautionary demand for money. Because there are no other stores of value, agents hold money as insurance against shortfalls in endowment value. If monetary markets are operated by an authority set up for the common good, it is natural to suppose that the authority would be willing to collect money left at the market after terminal trading to dispose it.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Corporate Pension Fund Liabilities and Funding Gaps ¤ The fixed nature of pension benefits under corporate defined benefit (DB) pension plans imply that plan sponsors face financial and potentially biometric risks. A large number of OECD countries have such DB pension schemes, whereby employees receive a specific payment upon retirement and for which sponsoring employers are responsible to some extent for meeting any shortfall in pension funding relative to liabilities, although, across countries, these schemes vary in importance. Recent financial market developments, including in particular the post-2000 equity market correction and declining interest rates have illustrated the vulnerability of DB plan sponsor companies to financial risks. While it is difficult to form a judgement about the exact magnitude of the funding gaps that have arisen, estimates of such gaps were considered to be of sufficiently large scale to raise concern amongst policymakers. Policy responses run the gamut from relief measures intended to lessen temporarily the financial pressures on sponsoring...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Chapter 32 Out-of-Equilibrium Economics and Agent-Based Modeling ¤ Standard neoclassical economics asks what agents' actions, strategies, or expectations are in equilibrium with (consistent with) the outcome or pattern these behaviors aggregatively create. Agent-based computational economics enables us to ask a wider question: how agents' actions, strategies, or expectations might react to—might endogenously change with—the patterns they create. In other words, it enables us to examine how the economy behaves out of equilibrium, when it is not at a steady state. This out-of-equilibrium approach is not a minor adjunct to standard economic theory; it is economics done in a more general way. When examined out of equilibrium, economic patterns sometimes simplify into a simple, homogeneous equilibrium of standard economics; but just as often they show perpetually novel and complex behavior. The static equilibrium approach suffers two characteristic indeterminacies: it cannot easily resolve among multiple equilibria; nor can it easily model individuals' choices of expectations. Both problems are ones of formation (of an equilibrium and of an “ecology” of expectations, respectively), and when analyzed in formation—that is, out of equilibrium—these anomalies disappear.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011152-0>
Chapter 16 Stability ¤ The chapter is concerned with endogenous processes operating in an economy that brings equilibrium; the most famous and most discussed is the law of demand and supply. If, at prevailing market signals, there is a positive excess demand in a market price, it will rise; if there is a negative excess demand, it will fall. In a partial equilibrium framework when all other prices are held fixed, it seemed that this process would bring about equilibrium provided only that the excess demand in this market was a diminishing function of its price. The chapter discusses that there is a large class of economies that have unstable equilibria under the most popular form of the price mechanism. The chapter discusses the ArrowDebreu specifications in which goods are distinguished by physical characteristics, location, date of delivery, and state of nature. It is a commonplace that many of these goods lack markets in actual economies. It is also clear that many planned excess demands are not public knowledge and that one cannot sensibly retain the traditional price adjustment schema. An alternative is to study a sequence of short period equilibriaa procedure familiar from the theory of growth. The aim is to study convergence to long-run equilibrium whether in a deterministic or in a stochastic setting. Expectations and their formation are central to this kind of approach once durable goods and production lags are included. One is then concerned with convergence to rational expectation equilibrium.

Revisiting the asset-meltdown hypothesis ¤ The present article focuses on the so-called “asset meltdown hypothesis”, which postulates a direct link between demographic developments and the level of asset prices. In particular, proponents of this hypothesis argue, when baby boomers start entering retirement they will become net sellers of financial assets to finance retirement consumption. As subsequent generations are smaller in numbers, other things equal, this would put downward pressure on financial asset prices. Revisiting this hypothesis, there is some support for a link between demographics and financial asset prices, although the link may not be strong. A number of mitigating factors exist, so that “other things” will not be equal. A major question in this context is to what extent demographic developments and their implications for other variables affecting financial asset prices are already reflected in financial asset prices and how fast any additional pressures on financial asset prices will play themselves out.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3>
Chapter 1. Securitization ¤ We survey the literature on securitization and lay out a research program for its open questions. Securitization is the process by which loans, previously held to maturity on the balance sheets of financial intermediaries, are sold in capital markets. Securitization has grown from a small amount in 1990 to a pre-crisis issuance amount that makes it one of the largest capital markets. In 2005 the amount of non-mortgage asset-backed securities issued in US capital markets exceeded the amount of US corporate debt issued, and these securitized bonds—even those unrelated to subprime mortgages—were at center of the recent financial crisis. Nevertheless, despite the transformative effect of securitization on financial intermediation, the literature is still relatively small and many fundamental questions remain open.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4508395-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269795-5>
Chapter 41 Hedonic analysis of housing markets ¤ This chapter examines the hedonic analysis of housing markets. These techniques have been widely applied in studies of the demand for housing attributes and environmental amenities. The chapter discusses the theoretical foundation of hedonic analysis, the use of hedonic estimates of demand for welfare analysis, the empirical difficulties that arise in such studies, and some of the methods for overcoming these difficulties.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4>
Chapter 13 Land resources and land markets ¤ Land is a central concept not only in the technical sciences and in professions such as engineering, geology, agriculture, and forestry but also in law and in the social sciences. This chapter discusses the economics of land. There exists an ancient and persistent suspicion that land is not just any commodity or factor of production. Land has played a prominent role in the development of general economic theory, and it retains a special position in some current renditions thereof. There is recurrent debate whether any economic theory that treats land as nothing special can be valid. In the most general versions of the mainstream economic theory, land is treated as a factor of production, and the debate revolves around whether it is useful to reserve a special place for land in formulating the aggregate production function. Land and natural resource concepts remain important for many special purposes in economics. The Ricardian concept of economic rent remains durable and finds application in areas as diverse as land economics, location theory, and welfare change measurement. Agricultural economics, natural resource economics, urban economics, and regional economics are important areas of specialization within economics, and the classic concept of land, which is appropriately updated, plays an important role in each.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014743-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075236-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1>
Chapter 27 International Trade, Foreign Investment, and the Environment ¤ The 1990s produced a large literature on foreign trade and the environment, including both theoretical and empirical contributions. The paper surveys this literature. It starts by looking at the traditional Heckscher–Ohlin type models of international trade and then moves to noncompetitive models and the strategic use of environmental policy in open economies. A shorter section is devoted to public-choice approaches to environmental policy. Moreover, the paper deals with factor mobility and interjurisdictional competition, with intertemporal issues such as renewable resources and foreign indebtedness, with the empirical evidence, and with institutional issues related to the World Trade Organization and international environmental agreements. Basically three questions are addressed from different points of view: – Are trade liberalisation and increased factor mobility good or bad for the environment? – Are there larger incentives to relax environmental policies if economies are more open? – Do we have to expect a race towards the bottom in environmental regulation if trade and international factor movements are liberalised? The answers to all these questions are ambiguous. Since many of the recent contributions to the theoretical literature model second-best worlds, in which the environmental externality is only one of several distortions of the economy, the results depend crucially on the nature of the other distortions. This survey paper gives an overview of this literature and explains the contradictory results. On the empirical side, the results are inconclusive as well. The link between environmental policies on the one hand and international trade and factor movements on the other is much weaker than one might have expected given the intensity and controversy of the policy debate at the turn of the century. Based on the theoretical results and on the empirical evidence, the paper finally tries to identify promising areas of future research. In spite of much progress made in the last decade, much remains to be done.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3>
Chapter 6. Identification of Models of the Labor Market ¤ This chapter discusses identification of common selection models of the labor market. We start with the classic Roy model and show how it can be identified with exclusion restrictions. We then extend the argument to the generalized Roy model, treatment effect models, duration models, search models, and dynamic discrete choice models. In all cases, key ingredients for identification are exclusion restrictions and support conditions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9>

Chapter 8 The Social Value of Education and Human Capital ¤ We review and extend the empirical literature that seeks evidence of a wedge between the private and social returns to human capital, specifically education. This literature has two main strands. First, much of modern growth theory puts human capital at center-stage, building on older notions of human capital externalities as an engine of economic growth. Empirical support for these ideas, based on both the comparative growth of national outputs and on the geographic dispersion of wages within countries, is meager. There is a strong association between average earnings and average education across nations and regions in the U.S. that exceeds the private returns to education. However, problems of omitted variables and endogeneity inherent in spatial equilibrium models mean that this association can hardly be understood as evidence for social returns. There is no evidence from this literature that social returns are smaller than private ones, yet neither is there much to suggest that they are larger . We then turn to the literature on job market signaling, which implies that social returns to education are smaller than private returns. Consistent with our earlier conclusions, we find scant evidence of this. We construct a model of the speed of employer learning about workers' unobserved talents, and we estimate the model using panel data on young workers. We find that employer learning about productivity occurs fairly quickly after labor market entry, implying that the signaling effects of schooling are small.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2>
Retirement saving and the payout phase : How to get there and how to get the most of it ¤ In the wake of a dramatic financial crisis and with the first waves of baby boomers approaching retirement we hardly need to think about how best to arrive at the pension funds' payout phase. This paper argues that there is an urgent need to raise retirement saving, to reduce defined contribution plan members' exposure to investment risks and to provide the financial industry with cheap and safe payout instruments. These challenges are also likely to call for a more active government role.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Chapter 20. Peer Effects in Education : A Survey of the Theory and Evidence ¤ We survey the theoretical and empirical literature on peer effects in education. Theoretical models of peer effects are first summarized. Models of educational provision regimes in which peer effects play a central role are then discussed. Next we discuss the identification issues in estimating peer effects and strategies used to resolve them. Last we survey the empirical evidence on and channels of peer effects in education.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132883-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120990-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066514-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027266-7>

Chapter 9 Neoclassical growth theory ¤ This chapter is an exposition, rather than a survey, of the one-sector neoclassical growth model. It describes how the model is constructed as a simplified description of the real side of a growing capitalist economy that happens to be free of fluctuations in aggregate demand. Once that is done, the emphasis is on the versatility of the model, in the sense that it can easily be adapted, without much complication, to allow for the analysis of important issues that are excluded from the basic model. Among the issues treated are: increasing returns to scale (but not to capital alone), human capital, renewable and non-renewable natural resources, endogenous population growth and technological progress. In each case, the purpose is to show how the model can be minimally extended to allow incorporation of something new, without making the analysis excessively complex. Toward the end, there is a brief exposition of the standard overlapping-generations model, to show how it admits qualitative behavior generally absent from the original model. The chapter concludes with brief mention of some continuing research questions within the framework of the simple model.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>

Measures of Restrictions on Inward Foreign Direct Investment for OECD Countries ¤ This paper provides new measures of restrictions on inward foreign direct investment (FDI) for OECD countries. Several different types of restrictions are considered: limitations on foreign ownership, screening or notification procedures, and management and operational restrictions. These restrictions are computed for nine sectors and eleven sub-sectors, most of which are in services, and then aggregated into a single measure for the economy as a whole. According to the aggregate indicators, the last two decades, and especially the 1990s, have witnessed dramatic liberalisation in FDI restrictions. OECD countries are now generally open to inward FDI, although there remain substantial differences between countries and across industries. The most open countries are now in Europe, at least as far as statutory restrictions are concerned. The preponderance of remaining restrictions is in services, with almost no overt restrictions in manufacturing...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
Introduction to the series ¤ The aim of the Handbooks in Economics series is to produce Handbooks for various branches of economics, each of which is a definitive source, reference, and teaching supplement for use by professional researchers and advanced graduate students. Each Handbook provides self contained surveys of the current state of a branch of economics in the form of chapters prepared by leading specialists on various aspects of this branch of economics. The Handbooks provide not only useful reference volumes for professional collections but also possible supplementary readings for advanced courses for graduate students in economics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123185-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006294-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006292-2>
Chapter 8. Blockholders: A Survey of Theory and Evidence ¤ This paper reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on the role of blockholders (large shareholders) in corporate governance. We start with the underlying property rights of public corporations; we discuss how blockholders are critical in addressing free-rider problems and why, like owners of private property in general, blockholders are likely to be active in firm governance. We then examine what distinguishes a blockholder from an ordinary shareholder and advocate additional definitions from the typical threshold of 5% ownership. We next present new evidence on the frequency and characteristics of blockholders in United States corporations. Then we develop a simple unifying model to present theories of blockholder governance through both voice (direct intervention) and exit (selling one's shares). We survey the empirical evidence on blockholder governance, emphasizing the empirical challenges in identifying causal effects involving blockholders. We highlight the lack of credible instruments for blockholders and argue that exogenous variation should not be a prerequisite for research—a narrow focus on identification may lead to a focus on identifying narrow questions. We emphasize the value of descriptive research with blockholders and how endogeneity concerns can be addressed with economic logic and by directly testing alternative explanations. We close with suggestions for future research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4419850-4>
Evaluating risk sharing in private pensions plans ¤ The principal purpose of this article is to analyse the trade-off between the (un)certainty in contributions on the one hand and benefits on the other that is embedded in different pension arrangements. The article employs the funding ratio (ratio of assets to liabilities) and the replacement rate (ratio of benefits to salaries) as key criteria for evaluating the risk sharing characteristics of a private pension plan from the perspective of the plan member. The stochastic simulations performed show that hybrid plans (those in between traditional DB and individual DC) appear to be more efficient and sustainable forms of risk sharing than either of the other two. Of the three main hybrid plans analysed, conditional indexation plans appear to have the greatest potential as sustainable forms of risk sharing.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3>
Chapter 9. Inflation Persistence ¤ This chapter examines the concept of inflation persistence in macroeconomic theory. It begins by defining persistence — emphasizing the difference between reduced-form and structural persistence. It then examines a number of empirical measures of reduced-form persistence, considering the possibility that persistence may have changed over time. The chapter then examines the theoretical sources of persistence, distinguishing “intrinsic” from “inherited” persistence, and deriving a number of analytical results on persistence, emphasizing the influence of the monetary policy regime. It summarizes the implications for persistence from the literature on imperfect information models, learning models, and so-called “trend inflation models,” providing some new results throughout. Finally, it summarizes the results on persistence from the many studies of disaggregated price data.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Effects of environmental policy on the type of innovation : The case of automotive emission-control technologies ¤ This article uses patent data to assess policy factors (domestic and international) for patenting activity in automotive emission control technologies. Particular attention is paid to the role of different policy types and fuel prices on both post-combustion and integrated abatement technologies. The results confirm that fuel prices have played a role in the development of integrated strategies, while regulatory standards have been more important with respect to post-combustion technologies. In addition, ‘integrated’ abatement strategies are more closely linked to general determinants of innovation than is the case for post-combustion technologies. This has implications for the design of policies which encourage innovations with both private and public benefits.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>

Chapter 22 Targets and instruments of monetary policy ¤ This chapter discusses the major conceptual developments in the literature of targets and instruments of money policy, with particular emphasis on the broader strategic issues defining the overall framework within which policy operates. The instrument problem of the selection of specific price or quantity that the central bank directly and immediately controls is examined in the chapter. It is a fact that what most people mean by money in discussions of monetary policy is not a plausible policy instrument at all, because it is endogenous in the kind of fractional reserve banking system common to most modern market economies. Hence, money is at best an intermediate target of monetary policy. The chapter discusses the implications of alternative monetary policy frameworks for the information available to the economy's private sector, the positive empirical question of when and whether any given central bank has actually based its operations on one kind of targeting strategy or another, and the empirical basis for making the normative selections of monetary policy targets and instruments.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2>
Chapter Seven. Theoretical Issues Relevant to the Economic Evaluation of Health Technologies ¤ Medical cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is perhaps the most widely applied tool to guide policy decisions concerning the use of health care resources. This chapter first reviews the rationale for and common practice of medical cost-effectiveness analysis. It seeks to place CEA within a conventional microeconomic framework. Methodological controversies in CEA are then discussed within this framework. They include: the decision-making perspective of the analysis; incorporating equity concerns; the treatment of joint costs and benefits; and the treatment of time horizon and discounting.

Chapter 68 Models of Aggregate Economic Relationships that Account for Heterogeneity ¤ This chapter covers recent solutions to aggregation problems in three application areas: consumer demand analysis, consumption growth and wealth, and labor participation and wages. Each area involves treatment of heterogeneity and nonlinearity at the individual level. Three types of heterogeneity are highlighted: heterogeneity in individual tastes, heterogeneity in income and wealth risks, and heterogeneity in market participation. Work in each area is illustrated using results from empirical data. The overall aim is to present specific models that connect individual behavior with aggregate statistics, as well as to discuss the principles for constructing such models.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>

Chapter 2 From Market Jaws to the Newton Method: The Geometry of How a Market Can Solve Systems of Equations ¤ This chapter focuses on the geometry of how a market can solve systems of equations from market jaws to the newton method. Since market equilibrium can be interpreted as a solution to a system of equations, price discovery, as it called in the language of market makers, can be viewed as having found the solution. Of course the information needed to even formulate the equations does not exist in one place so the idea that markets are searching for the solution to a system of equations as a numerical process would search, cannot be taken literally. The empirical foundation for jaws can be found in many forms. When markets are on the way up the number of bids typically exceeds the number of asks. When markets are on the way down, the number of asks typically exceeds the number of bids. This is exactly the concept of pushing referred to Plott.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1>
Chapter 2 Art and Culture in the History of Economic Thought ¤ Attention to art and culture goes far back in the history of economic thought. In the seventeenth century those activities were viewed suspiciously as likely to be either wasteful extravagances of the aristocracy, or dangerous distractions for the working classes. Eighteenth century economic thinkers offered more positive and thoughtful speculations. Mandeville and Galiani observed that the prices of art works were determined almost entirely on the demand side of the market, often by fashion and the search for distinction. The Enlightenment economic thinkers were intrigued by various aspects of art markets. Hume and Turgot perceived positive social benefits emerging from the arts, and they attempted to understand of what these consisted. Smith picked up some of the hints that were dropped and looked at art markets in a depth that had not been undertaken before. Like some other Enlightenment thinkers, Smith pictured the arts as being mainly about the imitation of perfection. Jeremy Bentham, with his emphasis on utility as a tool by which both to understand and judge market performance, insisted that the arts should not be distinguished from other forms of entertainment: pushpin, he asserted, equals poetry. Other political economists followed Bentham's lead and steered away from exploration of the economics of the arts. To some extent the void thus created was filled by humanistic writers, novelists, and essayists, notably Arnold, Ruskin, Dickens, and Morris, who were highly critical of the industrialization of the period and the emerging discipline of political economy that they perceived to go with it. In the “marginal revolution” of the 1870s the Benthamite injunction against special treatment for the arts was largely observed. At the same time, several of the new economists, notably William Stanley Jevons, became “closet esthetes”, enjoying their guilty pleasures but not often subjecting the arts to economic analysis. Disappointingly little concerning the arts and culture can be found in the distinctive American economics of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. There was almost a reversion to the seventeenth century view of the arts as the corrupt playthings of the idle rich. However, something like a return to the rich speculation of the eighteenth century Enlightenment occurred in the Bloomsbury Group that included the economist John Maynard Keynes. They rejected “Benthamism” and distinguished between the artistic experience and human consumption, and between the “imaginative life” of the mind and the biological activity of humans and other creatures. They discerned complex effects of the arts throughout society and placed arts policy high on the policy agenda.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1>
New challenges in the use of government debt issuance procedures, techniques and policies in OECD markets ¤ Government debt issuance procedures and policies differ across OECD jurisdictions, in particular in terms of technical standards for selling techniques, primary dealer systems and other primary market arrangements. However, the increased integration of global financial markets (including the jump in the integration of European government debt markets since the introduction of the Euro) has been an important catalyst in the standardisation of the structure and types of instruments as well as the convergence of general procedures and policies for the issuance government debt. In many countries, the ongoing credit and economic crises have prompted a review of existing issuance procedures and policies. This article provide (a) a survey of the general characteristics of government debt issuance procedures and related primary dealer (PD) arrangements in the OECD area; and (b) an evaluation of the challenges and changes generated by the impact of the turmoil in global financial markets on issuance procedures and policies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6>

Improving public spending efficiency in primary and secondary education ¤ Influenced by the perceived link between higher levels of educational attainment and growth, the education sector has seen significant reform efforts in recent years in a number of countries. Public spending in this sector has increased on average by one-fifth in real terms over the past decade and growth in terms of spending per student has also been marked in many countries (Figure 1, upper panel); governments in the OECD area now spend on average around 3% of GDP on primary and secondary education. However, a close correspondence between the level of resources and educational outcomes is difficult to demonstrate empirically: cross-sectional evidence reveals only a weak correlation between national spending per student or teaching resources and mean pupil performance in standardised tests (Figure 1, lower panels). Extra resources devoted to education do not automatically lead to commensurate improvements in outcomes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2>

Chapter 23. Families in Macroeconomics ¤ Much of macroeconomics is concerned with the allocation of physical capital, human capital, and labor over time and across people. The decisions on savings, education, and labor supply that generate these variables are made within families. Yet the family (and decision making in families) is typically ignored in macroeconomic models. In this chapter, we argue that family economics should be an integral part of macroeconomics and that accounting for the family leads to new answers to classic macro questions. Our discussion is organized around three themes. We start by focusing on short- and medium-run fluctuations and argue that changes in family structure in recent decades have important repercussions for the determination of aggregate labor supply and savings. Next, we turn to economic growth and describe how accounting for families is central for understanding differences between rich and poor countries and for the determinants of long-run development. We conclude with an analysis of the role of the family as a driver of political and institutional change.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8>
Chapter 12. Housing, Finance, and the Macroeconomy ¤ In this chapter, we review and discuss the large body of research that has developed over the past 10-plus years that explores the interconnection of macroeconomics, finance, and housing. We focus on three major topics—housing and the business cycle, housing and portfolio choice, and housing and asset returns—and then review the recent literature that studies housing and the macroeconomy during the great housing boom and bust of 2000–2010. Our emphasis is on calibrated models that can be compared with data. In each section, we discuss the important questions, the typical set of tools used, and the insights that result from influential articles. Although great progress has been made in understanding the impact of housing outcomes on macroeconomic aggregates and vice versa, work remains. For example, economists recognize the importance of changing credit-market conditions in amplifying the volatility of house prices, but cannot explain the timing of these changes. At the end of the chapter, we discuss a new literature that assesses the macroeconomic effects and welfare implications of housing policies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4239568-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9>

Increasing side-channel resistance by netlist randomization and FPGA-based reconfiguration ¤ Modern FPGAs are equipped with the possibility of Partial Reconfiguration (PR) which along with other benefits can be used to enhance the security of cryptographic implementations. This feature requires development of alternative designs to be exchanged during run-time. In this work, we propose dynamically alterable circuits by exploring netlist randomization which can be utilized with PR as a countermeasure against physical attacks, in particular side-channel attacks. The proposed approach involves modification of an AES implementation at the netlist level in order to create circuit variants which are functionally identical but structurally different. In preliminary experiments, power traces of these variants have been shuffled to replicate the effect of partial reconfiguration. With these dynamic circuits, our experimental results show an increase in the resistance against power side-channel attacks by a factor of [Tilde] 12.6 on a Xilinx ZYNQ UltraScale+ device.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4347749-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1135808198> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075860-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4238872-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4396978-1>

Chapter 18 Empirical studies of innovation and market structure ¤ This chapter discusses the perceptible movement of empirical scholars from a narrow concern with the role of firm size and market concentration toward a broader consideration of the fundamental determinants of technical change in industry. Although tastes, technological opportunity, and appropriability conditions themselves are subject to change over time, particularly in response to radical innovations that alter the technological regime, these conditions are reasonably assumed to determine inter-industry differences in innovative activity over relatively long periods. Although a substantial body of descriptive evidence has begun to accumulate on the way the nature and effects of demand, opportunity, and appropriability differ across industries, the absence of suitable data constrains progress in many areas. It has been observed that much of the empirical understanding of innovation derives not from the estimation of econometric models but from the use of other empirical methods. Many of the most credible empirical regularities have been established not by estimating and testing elaborate optimization models with published data but by the painstaking collection of original data, usually in the form of responses to relatively simple questions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133311-1>
Chapter 9. Earnings, Consumption and Life Cycle Choices ¤ We discuss recent developments in the literature that studies how the dynamics of earnings and wages affect consumption choices over the life cycle. We start by analyzing the theoretical impact of income changes on consumptionhighlighting the role of persistence, information, size and insurability of changes in economic resources. We next examine the empirical contributions, distinguishing between papers that use only income data and those that use both income and consumption data. The latter do this for two purposes. First, one can make explicit assumptions about the structure of credit and insurance markets and identify the income process or the information set of the individuals. Second, one can assume that the income process or the amount of information that consumers have are known and test the implications of the theory. In general there is an identification issue that has only recently being addressed with better data or better experiments. We conclude with a discussion of the literature that endogenizes peoples earnings and therefore change the nature of risk faced by households.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127364-3>
Chapter 103 Utility Maximization ¤ A testable form of the utility hypothesis results from identifying necessary condition(s) for the existence of a utility function that rationalizes the price and quantity data, meaning a utility function that correctly predicts choices that do not violate an agent's budget constraint. Possible inconsistencies with utility-maximizing choices are of no clear economic interest unless the objects of choice are scarce. In order for the chosen commodities to be scarce, the agent's budget constraint must be binding. Hence, a specific testable form of the utility hypothesis must incorporate scarcity. There are various ways to incorporate scarcity in the model of the utility-maximizing agent. The model of the utility-maximizing agent is central to theoretical and applied economics and to economics education. But how can one test for the presence of utility maximization? More specifically, how can one test the utility hypothesis, defined as the hypothesis that real economic agents behave as if they maximize utility functions subject to binding budget constraints?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1>

Questions such as these define the field of economic growth. This paper documents the facts that underlie these questions. How much richer are we today than 100 years ago, and how large are the income gaps between countries?

U.S.India Nuclear Cooperation and Non-Proliferation ¤ The “Agreement for Cooperation Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of India Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy”1 (hereinafter referred to as “U.S.-India Nuclear Cooperation Agreement” or “123 agreement”) acknowledges a shift in international strategies and relations in both countries. As to India, it marks the end of nuclear isolation resulting from constraints, embargoes and controls and instead opens the path for nuclear commerce. With respect to the United States it entails a major geo-strategic ally in the evolving South- Asia region and promises large commercial benefits to the U.S. nuclear sector. This so called “nuclear deal” constitutes one of the major political, economic and strategic relationships developing between the two countries since 2001. It will lead to the separation of military and civilian nuclear installations in India, the latter to be placed under the safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). It thus de facto accepts India in the club of nuclear weapon states within the meaning of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)2 although it is not party to this treaty, refuses adhering to it, officially possesses nuclear weapons and is not subject to a comprehensive system of safeguards.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068925-6>
Chapter 13. Estimating Effects of Price-Distorting Policies Using Alternative Distortions Databases ¤ To analyze the effects of prospective policy changes, sectoral and economy-wide modelers need to begin with baseline estimates of policy induced price distortions. Global trade modelers mostly use the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) protection database, which currently relies heavily on 2004 import tariffs plus (for Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries) an estimate of agricultural production and export subsidies in that year. This chapter addresses three questions relating to the very extensive use of that database. Are there other price-distorting policy instruments worthy of inclusion in the base year? What is the appropriate counterfactual set of price distortions in the year of concern (such as when a proposed reform is expected to be fully implemented, as distinct from the base year of 2004)? How are the price distortions (e.g. tariff rates) on individual products aggregated to the GTAP product groups? (i) We show there are some additional agricultural policy instruments that need to be included for some developing countries. (ii) We draw on political economy theory, a set of political econometric equations and knowledge of current World Trade Organization (WTO)-bound tariffs to show that some developing countries could well raise their agricultural protection rates over coming decades in the absence of a successful conclusion to the WTOs Doha Round. Hence, the appropriate counterfactual policy regime in projections modeling may not be the status quo , but rather higher agricultural protection rates for at least some countries. The alternative counterfactual considered generates much higher estimates of the prospective costs of not embracing trade policy reform. (iii) We draw on recent aggregation theory to show that the national and global welfare costs of current policies are seriously underestimated using conventional tariff aggregation methods.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224214-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210294-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065341-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6>
Chapter 1 Impossibility theorems in the arrovian framework ¤ Given a set of outcomes that affect the welfare of the members of a group, K.J. Arrow imposed the following five conditions on the ordering of the outcomes as a function of the preferences of the individual group members, and then proved that the conditions are logically inconsistent: • The social choice rule is defined for a large family of assignments of transitive orderings to individuals. • The social ordering itself is always transitive. • The social choice rule is not dictatorial. (An individual is a dictator if the social ordering ranks an outcome x strictly above another outcome y whenever that individual strictly prefers x to y .) • If everyone in the group strictly prefers outcome x to outcome y , then x should rank strictly above y in the social ordering. • The social ordering of any two outcomes depends only on the way that the individuals in the group order those same two outcomes. The chapter proves Arrow's theorem and investigates the possibility of uncovering a satisfactory social choice rule by relaxing the conditions while remaining within the Arrovian framework, which is identified by the following five characteristics: • The outcome set is unstructured. • The society is finite and fixed. • Only information about the ordering of the outcome set is used to convey information about individual welfare. • The output of the social choice process is an ordering of the outcome set. • Strategic play by individuals is not considered.

Tax and good governance ¤ Taxation is fundamental to sustainable development. The ability to raise revenue and manage public expenditure is of core importance to every state. However, taxation plays another crucial role which has been often overlooked or underestimated in the past: as a catalyst for more responsive and accountable governments. This article explains why international taxation is a “missing link” in the development-statebuilding process and offers an important route for building effective and self-supporting states. It explores the challenges for developing countries with regard to international taxation and how future work proposed by the OECD will address these challenges. The article concludes with an assessment of what more the international community can do to better target aid towards building the capacity of developing countries’ tax administrations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
Chapter 4. Law and Corporate Governance ¤ Pragmatic and effective research on corporate governance often turns critically on appreciating the legal institutions surrounding corporate entities—yet such nuances are often unfamiliar or poorly specified to economists and other social scientists without legal training. This chapter organizes and discusses key legal concepts of corporate governance, including statutes, regulations, and jurisprudential doctrines that “govern governance” in private and public companies, with concentration on the for-profit corporation. We review the literature concerning the nature and purpose of the corporation, the objects of fiduciary obligations, the means for decision making within the firm, as well as the overlay of state and federal law pertaining to how that decision-making authority is exercised within publicly traded companies. A core feature of this analysis is that while the basic structures pertinent to corporate law and governance are familiar and in some ways predictable, they are also in a constant state of flux, shaping and being shaped by institutional adaptations of firms, regulators and courts. This chapter is most appropriate for social science researchers and/or students who are new to the legal dimensions of firm governance.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4419850-4>
Chapter 18 A survey of behavioral finance ¤ Behavioral finance argues that some financial phenomena can plausibly be understood using models in which some agents are not fully rational. The field has two building blocks: limits to arbitrage , which argues that it can be difficult for rational traders to undo the dislocations caused by less rational traders; and psychology , which catalogues the kinds of deviations from full rationality we might expect to see. We discuss these two topics, and then present a number of behavioral finance applications: to the aggregate stock market, to the cross-section of average returns, to individual trading behavior, and to corporate finance. We close by assessing progress in the field and speculating about its future course.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4508395-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269795-5>
Chapter 1. The Global Demography of Aging: Facts, Explanations, Future ¤ Population aging is the 21st century's dominant demographic phenomenon. Declining fertility, increasing longevity, and the progression of large-sized cohorts to the older ages are causing elder shares to rise throughout the world. The phenomenon of population aging, which is unprecedented in human history, brings with it sweeping changes in population needs and capacities, with potentially significant implications for employment, savings, consumption, economic growth, asset values, and fiscal balance. This chapter provides a broad overview of the global demography of aging. It reviews patterns, trends, and projections involving various indicators of population aging and their demographic antecedents and sequelae. The chapter also reviews theories economists use to explain the behavioral changes driving the most prominent demographic shifts. Finally, it discusses the changing nature of aging, the future of longevity, and associated policy implications, highlighting some key research issues that require further examination.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4334479-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006294-6>

Chapter 4. The Human Capital (Schooling) of Immigrants in America ¤ This chapter deals with several salient issues about immigrants to the US and their education. These issues include a comparison of the schooling accomplishments of immigrants and the native-born that emphasizes the considerable diversity in the schooling accomplishments among different immigrant subgroups and between legal and undocumented migrants. I also examine the role of the foreign-born who come to the United States for post-secondary schooling. Finally, I show that the educational generational progress among all groups of immigrants to the United States has been quite impressive during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069332-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4501977-0>

Chapter 42 Labor markets in the transitional Central and East European economies ¤ In this chapter, I survey principal econometric studies of several important labor market issues in Central and East European countries as they launched the transition from central planning to a market economy. The topics covered include employment, wage and fringe benefits determination in firms, individual wages and human capital, determinants of unemployment duration, and matching of the unemployed and vacancies. The studies are of interest because one can observe the functioning of nascent markets and institutions after prices and wages ceased being set by planners. Moreover, the variation in relevant variables has been tremendous, thus permitting the researchers to estimate precisely key parameters.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127364-3>

Indeed, during the 18th century there was a kind of “arms race” in which noble houses competed for prestige through the quality of their orchestras and operas. Gradually, however, the role of churches and the nobility declined and more market-oriented venues, including vibrant markets for free-lance performance and composition, became dominant. A survey of 646 musicians born between 1650 and 1849 quantifies these trends, along with the increasing tendency for composers to earn their livelihood in part by teaching in conservatories and other music schools. The same data set is tapped to show the various ways in which composers learned their musical skills. When the data are analyzed in still another way, Austria is found to be the most intensive employer of composer–musicians per million population and also to have given birth to the largest number of composers relative to its population. The territory that in 1990 was Czechoslovakia was second in births; Germany was second in employment. One means by which composers derived income, especially with the ascendance of free-lance composition, was publication of their creations. The evolution of publishing technology and music copyright is traced. Gradually, as income per capita grew in the industrialized nations, audiences for musical performances broadened until by the end of the 19th century mass markets came into being. Radio and the phonograph radically transformed the ways music was enjoyed and widened the market for music even more. The electronic media in turn intensified a tendency that was already evident in the early 18th century – the ability of a few “superstars” to achieve spectacular financial success.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4>
Pension fund governance : Challenges and potential solutions ¤ Good governance is increasingly recognised as an important aspect of an efficient private pension system, enhancing investment performance and benefit security. Yet, despite regulatory and industry initiatives, governance weaknesses persist across OECD and non-OECD countries. This paper highlights the main governance challenges faced by policymakers (particularly with trust-based pension systems), and draws on recent policy initiatives to propose possible solutions to strengthen governance arrangements.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6>
Chapter 12 The core and balancedness ¤ Of all solution concepts of cooperative games, the core is probably the easiest to understand. It is the set of all feasible outcomes (payoffs) that no player (participant) or group of participants (coalition) can improve upon by acting for themselves. Once an agreement in the core has been reached, no individual and no group could gain by regrouping. In a free market, outcomes should be in the core; economic activities should be advantageous to all parties involved. For many games, feasible outcomes that cannot be improved upon may not exist.. In such cases one possibility is to ask that no group could gain much by recontracting. It is as if communications and coalition formations are costly. The minimum size of the set of feasible outcomes required for non-emptiness of the core is given by the so-called balancedness condition. The sets containing outcomes upon which nobody could improve by much are called -cores. The chapter discusses the theory of cores in the case of transferable utility (TU) game, the theory of cores of games with non-transferable utility (NTU), and some economic applications of the theory.

Financial Markets Highlights - May 2007 ¤ There was a sizeable correction in financial markets in February. However, since then all of the reflation trades have returned: equities have recouped their losses to the end of April; bonds yields have fallen and spreads have resumed their narrowing pattern; commodities have rallied along with commodity currencies; and the US dollar is weaker....	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3>
Chapter Ten. Health Care Markets, Regulators, and Certifiers ¤ Economists have devoted considerable attention to the question of whether market transactions, contracts, and/or regulation can generate efficient outcomes. The chapter presents a discussion on efficient outcomes for health care services markets. The chapter begins with an analysis of whether health care markets are different from textbook markets. Arrow argues that the conditions facilitating an optimal state are often missing in health care. This chapter discusses and examines these conditions and pays particular attention to asymmetric information about quality. The chapter also reviews the empirical evidence on the performance of competitive health care markets. At one time the conventional wisdom was that competition led to higher prices, an idea captured by the theory of the Medical Arms Race. With the growth of selective contracting between providers and payers, competition is now associated with lower prices. The chapter also discusses regulatory approaches to containing prices. Theory suggests that a mixed payment scheme combining a fixed prepayment with partial cost sharing should outperform either pure prepayment or pure cost-based payment. The chapter also includes another quality assurance mechanismthird party certification embodied by health care report cards. Despite widely cited unanticipated and undesirable consequences, report cards for health insurers and providers seem to offer several benefits: they move market share away from the worst sellers, encourage all sellers to improve quality, and facilitate matching between severely ill patients and the best providers. The chapter also explores pay for performance schemes, which combine elements of incentive contracts and quality certification.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Chapter 21. Income Distribution in Computable General Equilibrium Modeling ¤ Studying the poverty and income distribution effects of macroeconomic policies or shocks requires a methodology that accounts on the one hand for the nature of the policy or shock being studied and their aggregate impact on the economy and, on the other hand, the heterogeneity of their overall effects among individuals or households at the micro level. Standard evaluation methods are of little use here. Methods based on the comparison between individuals exposed and not exposed to the policy or shock are clearly not applicable since, by definition, all individuals are affected by any policy with some macroeconomic dimension. The evaluation methodology thus needs to rely not only on a micro but also on a macro counterfactual within some kind of general equilibrium setting. This chapter reviews the growing literature that addresses this challenge by combining macro and micro modeling in various ways. It describes existing methodologies and their underpinning links with economic theory and presents some applications. The chapter is structured according to the nature of the computable general equilibrium (CGE) macro model being used and how the macro and micro components of the methodology are connected together and/or integrated. It thus starts from a simple framework where the two components are handled separately: the CGE model is static and Walrasian and the unidirectional link from the macro to the micro component essentially consists of changes in prices. It then moves to more integrated variants, where results from both the CGE and micro models are looped back and forth, and also to non-Walrasian specifications where both price and aggregate quantity changes link the macro and the micro components. Finally the chapter considers dynamic settings where the static CGE model on the macro side is replaced by a recursive-dynamic model, whereas the micro data base is allowed to change over time through both exogenous demographic and policy-induced endogenous economic transitions. Illustrations of that approach are drawn from the Global Income Distribution Dynamics (GIDD) model recently developed at the World Bank.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224214-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210294-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065341-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6>
Exploring the Relationship Between Education and Obesity ¤ An epidemic of obesity has been developing in virtually all OECD countries over the last 30 years. Existing evidence provides a strong suggestion that such an epidemic has affected certain social groups more than others. In particular, a better education appears to be associated with a lower likelihood of obesity, especially among women. This paper sheds light on the nature and the strength of the correlation between education and obesity. Analyses of health survey data from Australia, Canada, England, and Korea were undertaken with the aim of exploring this relationship. Social gradients in obesity were assessed across the entire education spectrum, overall and in different population sub-groups. Furthermore, investigations testing for mediation effects and for the causal nature of the links observed were undertaken to better understand the underlying mechanisms of the relationship between education and obesity.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2>
Chapter 4. Family Ties ¤ We study the role of the most primitive institution in society: the family. Its organization and relationship between generations shape values formation, economic outcomes, and influences national institutions. We use a measure of family ties, constructed from the World Values Survey, to review and extend the literature on the effect of family ties on economic behavior and economic attitudes. We show that strong family ties are negatively correlated with generalized trust; they imply more household production and less participation in the labor market of women, young adult, and elderly. They are correlated with lower interest and participation in political activities and prefer labor market regulation and welfare systems based upon the family rather than the market or the government. Strong family ties may interfere with activities leading to faster growth, but they may provide relief from stress, support to family members, and increased well-being. We argue that the values regarding the strength of family relationships are very persistent over time, more so than institutions like labor market regulation or welfare systems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3>
Chapter 44 Non-zero-sum two-person games ¤ This chapter is devoted to the study of Nash equilibria, and correlated equilibria in both finite and infinite games. We restrict our discussions to only those properties that are somewhat special to the case of two-person games. Many of these properties fail to extend even to three-person games. The existence of quasi-strict equilibria, and the uniqueness of Nash equilibrium in completely mixed games, are very special to two-person games. The Lemke-Howson algorithm and Rosenmüller's algorithm which locate a Nash equilibrium in finite arithmetic steps are not extendable to general n -person games. The enumerability of extreme Nash equilibrium points and their inclusion among extreme correlated equilibrium points fail to extend beyond bimatrix games. Fictitious play, which works in zero-sum two-person matrix games, fails to extend even to the case of bimatrix games. Other algorithms that would locate certain refinements of Nash equilibria are also discussed. The chapter also deals with the structure of Nash and correlated equilibria in infinite games.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Chapter 41 Gross job flows ¤ Market economies experience high rates of job creation and job destruction in almost every time period and sector. Each year, many businesses expand and many others contract. New businesses constantly enter, while others abruptly exit or gradually disappear. Amidst the turbulence of business growth and decline, jobs, workers and capital are continually reallocated among competing activities, organizations and locations. We synthesize the growing body of research on this process, especially as it pertains to the creation and destruction of jobs. We summarize and analyze empirical regularities related to cross-sectional, cross-country and cyclical variation in job flows. We also relate theories of heterogeneity, growth and fluctuations to the large magnitude of job flows and to systematic patterns of cross-sectional and time variation. Other major themes include the connection between job flows and worker flows, creative destruction and the productivity-improving role of factor reallocation, reallocation behavior and consequences in transition economies, and the productivity and welfare effects of policies that impede or encourage job flows.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127364-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8>
Chapter 15. Wealth and Inheritance in the Long Run ¤ This chapter offers an overview of the empirical and theoretical research on the long-run evolution of wealth and inheritance. Wealth–income ratios, inherited wealth, and wealth inequalities were high in the eighteenth to nineteenth centuries up until World War I, then sharply dropped during the twentieth century following World War shocks, and have been rising again in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. We discuss the models that can account for these facts. We show that over a wide range of models, the long-run magnitude and concentration of wealth and inheritance are an increasing function of r ¯ − g where r ¯ is the net-of-tax rate of return on wealth and g is the economy's growth rate. This suggests that current trends toward rising wealth–income ratios and wealth inequality might continue during the twenty-first century, both because of the slowdown of population and productivity growth, and because of rising international competition to attract capital.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7>
Preface to the handbook ¤ Natural resources have been studied by economists from the earliest days of the profession. They have been seen as providing the basis for national prosperity, power, and wealth. The ability to harness energy in new ways has been recognized as a major, if not the major, factor underlying the industrial revolution. Because forests, fisheries, and agricultural land are fundamental to food supplies, these resources have been long studied. Uniting the study of natural resource issues is the growing realization that the most important energy and natural resource issues are inherently interdisciplinary. The study of resource economics has required and motivated researchers to reach out beyond their own disciplines and integrate ideas from other fields into their own disciplines. This integration will influence not only resource economics but also other areas within economics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014743-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075236-7>
Chapter 8. Moral Hazard and Consumer Incentives in Health Care ¤ Consumer incentives are reflected in a wide range of choices, many of which occur in both insurance- and tax-financed health care systems. However, health insurance and sick leave pay cause consumer incentives to be reflected in moral hazard effects of several types. Theoretically, ex ante moral hazard (a reduction of preventive effort in response to insurance coverage) is not unambiguously predicted, and there is very limited empirical evidence about it. The case for static ex post moral hazard (an increase in the demand for medical care of a given technology) is stronger. The empirical evidence reported comes from three sources, natural experiments, observational comparisons of individuals, and the Health Insurance Experiment (HIE). The distinguishing feature of the HIE is that participants were assigned to insurance plans, which forestalls the possibility of good risks self-selecting plans with substantial cost sharing, resulting in an overestimate of the effects of plan design on health care expenditure. While the values of estimated price elasticities vary widely among the three sources and less markedly according to the type of care (outpatient, hospital, dental, mental), the responsiveness of the demand for medical care to net price is beyond doubt. The pure price elasticity for medical care in excess of a deductible (i.e. where the marginal price is constant) was estimated by HIE at 0.2 overall. Finally, there may be a dynamic moral hazard effect (choice biased in favor of new, usually more expensive medical technology). Here, the empirical evidence is very scanty again. Another promising field for future research is the interplay between consumer incentives and rationing by the physician in managed care.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Chapter 30. The Causal Effect of Education on Earnings ¤ This paper surveys the recent literature on the causal relationship between education and earnings. I focus on four areas of work: theoretical and econometric advances in modelling the causal effect of education in the presence of heterogeneous returns to schooling; recent studies that use institutional aspects of the education system to form instrumental variables estimates of the return to schooling; recent studies of the earnings and schooling of twins; and recent attempts to explicitly model sources of heterogeneity in the returns to education. Consistent with earlier surveys of the literature, I conclude that the average (or average marginal) return to education is not much below the estimate that emerges from a standard human capital earnings function fit by OLS. Evidence from the latest studies of identical twins suggests a small upward “ability” bias – on the order of 10%. A consistent finding among studies using instrumental variables based on institutional changes in the education system is that the estimated returns to schooling are 20–40% above the corresponding OLS estimates. Part of the explanation for this finding may be that marginal returns to schooling for certain subgroups – particularly relatively disadvantaged groups with low education outcomes – are higher than the average marginal returns to education in the population as a whole. 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Chapter 91 Institutional Modifications of Majority Rule ¤ This chapter states that institutions and preferences are hopelessly confounded with the world of politics. Starting with data about institutional variation and variation in policy outcomes, it is impossible to make any hard and fast inferences about the impact of institutional features on policy outcomes. Do the states with a line-item veto spend less on certain budget categories because of the line-item veto, or because those states have electorates that prefer both the line-item veto and those expenditure patterns? Disentangling cause, effect, and spurious correlation can be virtually impossible with natural data. Experiments are uniquely suited for examining institutional effects. The experimenter can hold preferences constant and randomly assign subjects to treatments distinguished only by variations in institutional rules; resulting differences in behavior may be ascribed to the institutional differences with a degree of confidence that would be impossible in natural political settings.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1>
Preface to the handbook ¤ This chapter presents the book Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare in two volumes, essays on past and on-going work in social choice theory and welfare economics. The first volume consists of four parts. In Part 1 (Arrovian Impossibility Theorems), various aspects of Arrovian general impossibility theorems, illustrated by the simple majority cycle first identified by Condorcet, are expounded and evaluated. In Part 2 (Voting Schemes and Mechanisms), the operation and performance of voting schemes and cost-sharing mechanisms are examined axiomatically, and some aspects of the modem theory of incentives and mechanism design are expounded and surveyed. In Part 3 (Structure of Social Choice Rules), the positional rules of collective decision-making (the origin of which can be traced back to a seminal proposal by Borda), the game-theoretic aspects of voting in committees, and the implications of representative democracy in the theoretical arena of social choice theory are examined. In Part 4 (Welfare, Justice and Poverty), the possibility and implications of making use of interpersonal comparisons of welfare (with or without cardinal measurability) are expounded, and the status of utilitarianism as a theory of justice is critically examined.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166306-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022393-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143069-4>
Chapter 8 Mobility barriers and the value of incumbency ¤ This chapter discusses the difference between determinants of barriers to the mobility of capital and the welfare implications of entry and exit. The first task is confined for identifying situations in which a firm that is established in an industry benefits because of its incumbency. An incumbency advantage does not necessarily imply that welfare would be improved by encouraging entry. Consumers may be disadvantaged if forced to switch to another supplier. Industry costs would increase if entry eroded the benefits of economies of scale or learning. Entry prevention may result in both lower prices and lower costs than would occur if entry were allowed. The chapter describes Bain's determinants of barriers to entry and shows the way they may be interpreted in the light of recent contributions to the theory of strategic entry deterrence. The role of behavior in the determination of the conditions of entry is discussed in the chapter. Strategic entry deterrence is designed to influence the behavior of potential rivals. It is effective only to the extent that potential competitors look to current behavior as indicative of future market conditions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133311-1>
Chapter 15 The economics of outdoor recreation ¤ The economics of outdoor recreation deals with the supply of and demand for natural resources for recreational purposes. This chapter discusses the conceptual and empirical approaches, problems, and solutions encountered in applying economics to the provision of natural resources and explains the way in which the evolution of the economics of outdoor recreation has been influenced by the distinctive nature of markets for outdoor recreation. The distinctive characteristic of a recreational activity is that the services usually are provided by the public sector. This characteristic strongly favors the nature of research on outdoor recreation economics; it is welfare economics in action with the task of providing the public sector better information about the allocation of recreational resources. As a tool for analyzing decisions in the public sector, outdoor recreation economics has primarily become the study of the demand for outdoor recreation. Public sector decisions about natural resources tend to be lumpythat is, whether to utilize a resource for a specific purpose such as recreation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014743-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075236-7>
Chapter 47 Livestock Productivity in Developing Countries: An Assessment ¤ This chapter assesses livestock productivity in the developing world in the context of growing demand for livestock products and substantial changes in the structure of food demand, commercialization of production, and growing importance of international markets. Issues related to the roles of the various partners in livestock research are also considered and modalities to ensure more effective linkage between research and development agencies to improve technology transfer and impact are discussed. The chapter starts discussing the factors affecting livestock development and how these factors interact at different stages in the process of commercialization and development of the livestock sector. This serves as the conceptual framework to analyze trends in livestock demand; structural characteristics of livestock production in developing countries; global trends in productivity, and the evolution of research and development in developing regions. Past trends show that changes in global livestock production are explained by demand and supply changes associated to economic growth mainly in East and Southeast Asia while on the other hand productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa has remained stagnated for most of the past 40 years. National research systems in developing countries have focused mostly on research in ruminants, while research in poultry production has been dominated by the private sector. Despite these research priorities in developing countries, productivity differences in poultry and pig production between high income and some of the fast growing developing countries have been reducing in the past years, while large differences in productivity still persist in the case of milk and beef production with no evidence of developing countries catching-up with most productive countries. Major improvements in livestock productivity are possible and could contribute to economic growth in developing countries, but increased investment in livestock research and a framework for international action to support livestock research and development in developing countries are needed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4704302-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4>
Chapter 15 Staggered price and wage setting in macroeconomics ¤ This chapter reviews the role of temporary price and wage rigidities in explaining the dynamic relationship between money, real output, and inflation. The key properties to be explained are that monetary shocks have persistent, but not permanent, effects on real output, and that the correlation between current output and inflation is positive for leads of inflation and negative for lags of inflation. The paper begins with a short empirical guide to price- and wage-setting behavior in market economies. It then compares alternative price- and wage-setting theories and argues that staggered contracts models continue to provide the most satisfactory match with the key macroeconomic facts. It then examines the microeconomic foundations of staggered contracts models and reviews some of their extensions and applications. Research in this area has been very active in the 1990s with a remarkable number of studies using, estimating, or testing models of staggered price and wage setting. A new generation of econometric models incorporating staggered price and wage setting with rational expectations has been built. Researchers have begun to incorporate staggered wage and price setting into real business cycle models. Close links have been discovered between the parameters of people's utility functions and the parameters of staggered price- and wage-setting equations. There is now a debate about whether standard calibrations of utility functions prevent staggered price models, at least those with frequent price changes, from explaining long persistence of real output. A theme of the paper is that the advent of rational expectations in the 1970s led to models of price and wage rigidities which were more amenable to empirical testing than earlier models, and this is one reason for the recent controversies and debates. There is much to be discovered from these debates and from the future research they stimulate.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Chapter 31 Prevention ¤ Prevention ranges from medical decisions such as vaccinations and clinical preventive services delivered during periodic health examinations to private health lifestyle decisions such as regular exercise and non-smoking. The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of economic issues that cut across a variety of prevention decisions. After discussing what prevention means, the chapter reviews some basic theoretical insights about prevention from human capital models and insurance models. Consumer or household behavior receives most of the attention, partly because there is not an identifiable industry that produces prevention viewed broadly. The chapter next explores market failures that might lead to too little prevention from a societal perspective: ex ante moral hazard from health insurance, externalities from vaccinations, lack of consumer information, and the public good aspects of prevention-related research and development. Health economics provides some conceptual and empirical arguments for policies to encourage prevention. However, the economic perspective often remains quite different from the perspective of many public health professionals who are strong advocates of prevention. With that distinction in mind, the chapter then turns to policy-relevant questions of whether prevention can reduce total medical expenditures, and the effectiveness of policy interventions to encourage prevention. The chapter concludes with some reflections on what economics has offered and can offer to prevention research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Outlook for the Securitisation Market ¤ Securitisation issuance has slumped in recent years, with the market having become increasingly dependent on central bank and government support in both Europe and the United States. Despite facing a number of threats that could inhibit a recovery in the shorter term, the securitisation market is expected to recover over a longer term horizon. Funding costs have improved, but investor confidence in the asset class remains weak, and the impact of regulatory reform is as yet difficult to fully assess. A long-term sustainable recovery for the securitisation market remains in the hands of regulators and policy makers. They must be awake to the possibility that a recovery in securitisation markets could be a prerequisite to unlocking credit markets in general and supporting a wider global economic recovery.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3>
Improving Competition in Real Estate Transactions ¤ The OECD Competition Committee debated improving competition in real estate transactions in February 2007. Real estate transactions are subject to a variety of potential limitation of competition that can have significant effects on ordinary consumers. In fact, because of the annual volume of transactions and the fact that real estate expenses (mortgage payments and rent) constitute a significant portion of spending out of available revenue to spend (often exceeding 25%), the impacts of anti-competitive action in this sector may have larger financial value than in most other sectors. Practices of real estate agents vary significantly across countries, but a common trend appears to be the introduction of listing services that may provide a platform for anti-competitive practices to spread, at the same time as the Internet potentially provides improved opportunities for real estate sellers to reach buyers directly. In many countries, the operation of transferring legal title to properties is subject to cartel-like prices. Competitive problems have also been identified in the mortgage markets, with cartel activity having been found in a least one case and a lack of non-bank sources of finance in some countries.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Chapter 66 The Measurement of Productivity for Nations ¤ This chapter covers the theory and methods for productivity measurement for nations. Labor, multifactor and total factor productivity measures are defined and are related to each other and to gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Their growth over time and relative counterparts are defined as well. Different conceptual meanings have been proposed for a total factor productivity growth (TFPG) index. These are easiest to understand for the case in which the index number problem is absent: a production process that involves one input and one output (a 1–1 process). It is easily seen that four common concepts of TFPG all lead to the same result in the 1–1 case. Moving on to a general N input, M output production scenario, we demonstrate that a Paasche, Laspeyres or Fisher index number formula provides a measure for all four of the concepts of TFPG introduced for the 1–1 case. This is an advantage of the Paasche–Laspeyres–Fisher family of formulas. When multiple inputs or outputs are involved, there is the problem of choosing among alternative functional forms. The axiomatic and economic approaches to index formula choice are reviewed. In addition, we briefly cover the Divisia index number approach and growth accounting, including the KLEMS (capital, labor, energy, materials and services) approach. The gross output measures of the KLEMS approach are contrasted with value added output measures such as GDP. Also, an alternative family of revenue function based productivity growth indexes proposed by Diewert, Kohli and Morrison (DKM) is outlined. The DKM approach facilitates the decomposition of productivity growth into economically meaningful components. This approach is useful, for example, for examining the effects of changes in the terms of trade on productivity growth.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>

Chapter 9 Predation, Monopolization, and Antitrust ¤ This chapter discusses a wide range of strategies that can be employed by incumbent firms either to protect or to extend their market shares against competitive attacks by actual and potential entrants. The hallmark of these strategies is that, invariably, they reduce the expected level of profits that incumbent's rivalspresent and futurecan hope to earn. As such, they differ from those types of conduct whose aim is to implement and enforce collusive arrangements among market participants. Unlike many collusive strategies, these hostile and exclusionary strategies that include low prices, output expansions, introductions of new products, redesigns of the existing products, and promotions are difficult to distinguish from area part and parcel of market rivalry that economists find salutary for economic welfare, that policy-makers wish to promote, and that business leaders often deplore.

Ensemble size classification in Colombian Andean string music recordings ¤ Reliable methods for automatic retrieval of semantic information from large digital music archives can play a critical role in musicological research and musical heritage preservation. With the advancement of machine learning techniques, new possibilities for information retrieval in scenarios where ground-truth data is scarce are now available. This work investigates the problem of ensemble size classification in music recordings. For this purpose, a new dataset of Colombian Andean string music was compiled and annotated by musicological experts. Different neural network architectures, as well as pre-processing steps and data augmentation techniques were systematically evaluated and optimized. The best deep neural network architecture achieved 81.5% file-wise mean class accuracy using only feed forward layers with linear magnitude spectrograms as input representation.

Statistical Yearbook on African Central Government Debt : Overview of a New OECD Publication ¤ The borrowing needs of African governments are increasingly met by issuing marketable debt instruments. Leading practices from OECD governments exert an important influence on debt management and the functioning of markets for sovereign debt instruments. This first issue of the Statistical Yearbook on African Central Government Debt provides comprehensive and consistent information on African central government debt instruments. It includes individual country data but also comparative statistics to facilitate pan-African (cross-country) analysis.

Chapter 18 Teacher Quality ¤ Improving the quality of instruction is a central component to virtually all proposals to raise school quality. Unfortunately, policy recommendations often ignore existing evidence about teacher labor markets and the determinants of teacher effectiveness in the classroom. This chapter reviews research on teacher labor markets, the importance of teacher quality in the determination of student achievement, and the extent to which specific observable characteristics often related to hiring decisions and salary explain the variation in the quality of instruction. The evidence is applied to the comparison between policies that seek to raise quality by tightening the qualifications needed to enter teaching and policies that seek to raise quality by simultaneously loosening entry restrictions and introducing performance incentives for teachers and administrators.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2>
Chapter 12. Heterogeneity and Networks ¤ This chapter shows that networks can have large and differentiated effects on behavior and then argues that social and economic pressures facilitate the formation of heterogeneous networks. Thus networks can play an important role in understanding the wide diversity in human behavior and in economic outcomes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5>
Chapter 14 Income distribution, economic systems and transition ¤ We consider the differences in income distribution between market and planned economies in two ways. First, using benchmarks from the OECD area we review evidence from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union during the socialist period. Second, we look at the transitions currently being made by the latter. In each case we review available data and the problems they present before considering in turn: (i) the distribution of earnings of full-time employees; (ii) the distribution of individuals' per capita household incomes; and (iii) the ways in which the picture is altered by nonwage benefits from work, price subsidies and social incomes in kind. For the socialist period we are able to consider long series of data, often covering several decades, and we can thus show the changes in the picture of distribution under the socialist system. We also emphasise the diversity across the countries concerned. For the period of transition, itself incomplete, the series are inevitably shorter but we are able to avoid basing conclusions on evidence drawn from single years. The picture during transition, like that under socialism, is varied. Russia has experienced very sharp increases in measured inequality to well above the top of the OECD range. The Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland have seen more modest rises. We note the lack of a satisfactory analytic framework in the literature that encompasses enough features of the transition, a framework which would help interpretation of the evidence.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013887-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7>
Chapter 4 Non-Walrasian equilibria, money, and macroeconomics ¤ Non-Walrasian equilibria, also called equilibria with rationing, are a wide class of equilibrium concepts that generalize the traditional notion of Walrasian equilibrium by allowing markets not to clear and emphasizing quantity rationing. In Walrasian equilibrium, total demand equals total supply for each good. This consistency of the actions of all agents is achieved by price movements in the manner in which all private agents receive a price signal and assume that they will be able to exchange whatever they want at that price system. A Walrasian equilibrium price system is a set of prices for which total demand and total supply are equal in all markets. Transactions are equal to the demands and supplies at this price system. Money can be interpreted as commodity money. But the recent evolution of money tends to privilege the interpretation of money as fiat money that is a costlessly produced legal medium of exchange. This chapter discusses simple macroeconomic applications of the microeconomic concepts and presents a micromacro model of imperfect competition and unemployment.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2>
Chapter 3 The History of Art Markets ¤ Treating markets as arenas where relative advantage is contested, this entry explores the emergence and evolution of Western markets for paintings, 1450–1750, in terms of the players, their creative moves to secure gain, and the rules they devised to maintain order. Primary markets for paintings arose as a derivative of the commission market for one-off, mainly religious paintings in places such as Florence and Bruges, in the second half of the 15th century. Demand from foreign merchants eager to obtain works in the new medium, oil, gave Bruges an edge. So did a demand for easel paintings on thin linen, and even in oil on panel, as cheap substitutes for tapestries. Variety and cost also played a role. Emulation among differently-trained artists generated novel products plus extraordinary cost reductions, and painters discovered a latent demand among the less wealthy. Some novel products were exported, as were new techniques. The retail market in Florence was limited in size and largely confined to serving a need for cheaper versions of unique, public commissions. A mass demand for paintings across the social spectrum occurred principally in Northern cities: e.g., Antwerp, and later Amsterdam, though also in Spain. Resale markets followed retail with a lag, recycled paintings being handled by second-hand clothes dealers. This sequence – commission nexus, cost-reduction and novel sorts of paintings, mass retail, then resale markets – occurred in cities across Europe. As mass markets emerged, so too did specialist dealers. A large part of the entry is devoted to detailing their creative marketing moves. There were tensions as to whether only artists might sell, but demand mostly overrode guild reluctance to relinquish control of distribution. Widespread distribution came to require efficient sales mechanisms, hence public sales and auctions. The entry explores auction rules and techniques within the broader sequence identified above.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1>
Production and Use of ICT : A Sectoral Perspective on Productivity Growth in the OECD Area ¤ This paper examines the roles of the ICT-producing sector and of key ICT-using industries in overall productivity growth in OECD countries. The ICT manufacturing sector, in particular, has been characterised by very high rates of productivity growth in many countries and provides a large contribution to labour productivity growth in Finland, Ireland and Korea. In a few countries, notably the United States and Australia, certain ICT-using services have also experienced an above-average pick-up in productivity growth in the second half of the 1990s. Further structural reform may be needed before ICT use will also show up in the productivity statistics of other OECD countries. Differences in the measurement of productivity in ICT-producing and -using industries across countries complicate the cross-country analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
Chapter 28 The Economic Analysis of Advertising ¤ This chapter offers a comprehensive survey of the economic analysis of advertising. A first objective is to organize the literature in a manner that clarifies what is known. A second objective is to clarify how this knowledge has been obtained. The chapter begins with a discussion of the key initial writings that are associated with the persuasive, informative and complementary views of advertising. Next, work that characterizes empirical regularities between advertising and other variables is considered. Much of this work is conducted at the inter-industry level but important industry studies are also discussed. The chapter then offers several sections that summarize formal economic theories of advertising. In particular, respective sections are devoted to positive and normative theories of monopoly advertising, theories of price and non-price advertising, theories of advertising and product quality, and theories that explore the potential role for advertising in deterring entry. At this point, the chapter considers the empirical support for the formal economic theories of advertising. A summary is provided of empirical work that evaluates the predictions of recent theories of advertising, including work that specifies and estimates explicitly structural models of firm and consumer conduct. This work is characterized by the use of industry (or brand) and even household-level data. The chapter then considers work on endogenous and exogenous sunk cost industries. At a methodological level, this work is integrative in nature: it develops new theory that delivers a few robust predictions, and it then explores the empirical relevance of these predictions at both inter-industry and industry levels. Finally, the chapter considers new directions and other topics. Here, recent work on advertising and media markets is discussed, and research on behavioral economics and neuroeconomics is also featured. A final section offers some concluding thoughts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133311-1>

Chapter 12 Multiple use management of public forestlands ¤ This chapter focuses on the multiple-use management of public forestlands. The managers of these lands must, in addition to considering the value of timber harvests, consider various nonmarket amenity services, such as recreation, water flow, and wildlife, which are influenced by alterations in the standing stocks of timber. The chapter discusses research results on the relation of such multiple-use management to single-purpose timber management. The presentation is motivated by a number of issues of current concern, including (1) the withdrawal of lands from timber management, (2) the specialization or diversification of land use, (3) the level and stability of timber supply, and (4) the wisdom of certain accepted rule-of-thumb principles of public forestland management related to the age and level of harvests. The principles of public forestry in the United States have often been driven by the fear of timber shortage and the destabilizing effects on employment and prices arising from fluctuations in the supply of timber. The chapter describes the institutional setting for multiple-use management within the U.S. Forest Service. BEGIN: This chapter focuses on the multiple-use management of public forestlands.

Chapter 45 Trade and industrial policy reform ¤ This chapter reviews the consequences of policy reforms. It covers both theory and evidence, as it is only the interplay of the two that allows comprehending and interpreting the world around. Research on policy reform has not been short on either theory or evidence, even though, there is still a need for systematic empirical studies on the consequences of the recent round of reforms. The chapter focuses on trade and industrial policies and discusses macroeconomic stabilization issues as they impinge on microeconomic reforms. The chapter reviews the literature on the strategy of reform and covers recent contributions including those in the theories of piecemeal reform, timing and sequencing of reform, credibility, and political economy. It also reviews the available evidence on the consequences of the reforms of the 1980s, paying particular attention to the supply response and to static and dynamic efficiency.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213090-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7>
The macroeconomic policy challenges of continued globalisation ¤ This article investigates the macroeconomic policy challenges associated with a prospective continuation of international trade and financial integration over the next two decades, making use of a global macroeconomic model newly developed by the OECD. The analysis has several important policy implications. First, with the shares of non-OECD economies in world output, trade, and capital markets rising substantially, global economic developments would become much more dependent on developments in these economies than they used to be. Second, the sustainability of existing global current account imbalances will depend in part on the future build-up and composition of international assets and liabilities. While the imbalances could be sustainable for some time if economic integration continues at its current pace, a slowdown of the globalisation process would raise the likelihood of a disruptive adjustment in financial markets. Third, the increase in trade and financial linkages implies that macroeconomic shocks in a given country or region have a larger impact on other economies in the future than they do today. Policymakers in the OECD may have to act more promptly and more vigorously to economic “shocks” in the non-OECD economies in order to limit the impact on OECD economies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2>
Chapter 24 Economics of dental services ¤ The purpose of this chapter is to review dental economics in three major areas: (i) demand for and utilisation of dental care, (ii) productivity, technical efficiency and economies of scale in dental care production, and finally (iii) economic evaluation of dental care procedures and programmes. As a background to the review, we consider what makes dental care different from other health care, describe briefly dental care systems in a number of countries and present data on inputs and outcomes in terms of dental health. Within each major area, we review developments in conceptual and theoretical thinking, consider developments in the measurement of key variables and methods, and present some major results. We also draw lessons to be learnt concerning the state of the art in terms of theory, methodology and results, and outline directions for future research. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Chapter 15. How Mortgage Finance Affects the Urban Landscape ¤ This chapter considers the structure of mortgage finance in the United States and its role in shaping patterns of homeownership, the nature of the housing stock, and the organization of residential activity. We start by providing some background on the design features of mortgage contracts that distinguish them from other loans and that have important implications for issues presented in the rest of the chapter. We then explain how mortgage finance interacts with public policy, particularly tax policy, to influence a household's decision to own or rent and how shifts in the demand for owner-occupied housing are translated into housing prices and quantities, given the unusual nature of housing supply. We consider the distribution of mortgage credit in terms of access and price, by race, ethnicity, and income, and over the life cycle, with particular attention to the role of recent innovations such as nonprime mortgage securitization and reverse mortgages. The extent of negative equity has been unprecedented in the past decade, and we discuss its impact on strategic default, housing turnover, and housing investment. We describe spatial patterns in foreclosure and summarize the evidence for foreclosure spillovers in urban neighborhoods. Finally, we offer some thoughts on future innovations in mortgage finance.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4239568-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9>
Review of bilateral investment treaties signed by Parties to the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) 2006 ¤ This paper reviews the content of bilateral investment treaties listed in Annex 6 of the CEFTA 2006 with a view to identifying commonalities and potential gaps. The paper examines provisions on admission and treatment (i.e., national treatment and mostfavoured nation); transfers, expropriation, and dispute settlement (i.e., state-to-state and investor-to-state).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3>
Chapter 52 Population Policies, Fertility, Women's Human Capital, and Child Quality ¤ Population policies are defined here as voluntary programs which help people control their fertility and expect to improve their lives. There are few studies of the long-run effects of policy-induced changes in fertility on the welfare of women, such as policies that subsidize the diffusion and use of best practice birth control technologies. Evaluation of the consequences of such family planning programs almost never assess their long-run consequences, such as on labor supply, savings, or investment in the human capital of children, although they occasionally estimate the short-run association with the adoption of contraception or age-specific fertility. The dearth of long-run family planning experiments has led economists to consider instrumental variables as a substitute for policy interventions which not only determine variation in fertility but are arguably independent of the reproductive preferences of parents or unobserved constraints that might influence family life cycle behaviors. Using these instrumental variables to estimate the effect of this exogenous variation in fertility on family outcomes, economists discover these “cross effects” of fertility on family welfare outcomes tend to be substantially smaller in absolute magnitude than the OLS estimates of partial correlations referred to in the literature as evidence of the beneficial social externalities associated with the policies that reduce fertility. The paper summarizes critically the empirical literature on fertility and development and proposes an agenda for research on the topic.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213090-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7>
Preface to the Handbook ¤ Econometrics is a field that uses economic theory and statistical methods to address empirical problems in economics. It is a tool for empirical discovery and policy analysis. The chapters in the book Handbook of Econometrics, Volume 6A embody this vision, and either implement it directly or provide the tools for doing so. This vision is not shared by those who view econometrics as a branch of statistics rather than as a distinct field of knowledge that designs methods of inference from data based on models of human choice behavior and social interactions. All of the essays in this volume offer guidance to the practitioner on how to apply the methods they discuss to interpret economic data. The econometrics of industrial organization (IO) is another vibrant area of applied econometrics. Scholars in the field of IO have embraced econometrics. The resulting symbiosis between theory and practice is a paragon for econometric research. Modern developments in game theory have been incorporated in econometric models that enrich both theory and empirical analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Chapter 15. Theory of Combinatorial Games ¤ Aim: To present a systematic development of the theory of combinatorial games from the ground up. Approach: Computational complexity. Combinatorial games are completely determined; the questions of interest are efficiencies of strategies. Methodology: Divide and conquer. Ascend from Nim to Chess and Go in small strides at a gradient that is not too steep. Presentation: Mostly informal; examples of combinatorial games sampled from various strategic viewing points along scenic mountain trails illustrate the theory. Add-on: Atasteof constraint logic , a new tool to prove intractabilities of games.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8>

Chapter 33 Empirical research on nominal exchange rates ¤ This chapter presents a critical survey and an interpretation of recent exchange rate research. It focuses on empirical results for exchange rates among major industrialized countries. The expectations of future exchange rate changes are a key determinant of asset demands, and therefore of the current exchange rate. The expectations variable is relatively straightforward in the conventional monetary models; in theoretical terms , it is determined by the rational expectations assumption, while in empirical terms, it is typically measured by the forward discount or interest differential. The standard empirical implementation of rational expectations methodology infers ex ante expectations of investors from ex post changes in the exchange rate. Unexpected changes in monetary policy frequently cause movements in the exchange rate in the direction hypothesized by the sticky-price monetary model. The chapter presents a survey of the work on exchange rate determination in floating rate regimes. It considers evidence across exchange rate regimes and examines the issue of speculative bubbles. It also reviews some relatively new directions in exchange rate research that focus on the micro-structure of foreign exchange markets.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0>
Chapter 12 Approximation, perturbation, and projection methods in economic analysis ¤ This chapter examines local and global approximation methods that have been used or have potential future value in economic and econometric analysis. The chapter presents the related projection method for solving operator equations and illustrates its application to dynamic economic analysis, dynamic games, and asset market equilibrium with asymmetric information. In the chapter, it is shown that a general class of techniques from the numerical partial differential equations literature can be usefully applied and adapted to solve nonlinear economic problems. Despite the specificity of the applications discussed in the chapter the general description makes clear the general usefulness of perturbation and projection methods for economic problems, both theoretical modeling and empirical analysis. The application of perturbation and projection methods and the underlying approximation ideas have substantially improved the efficiency of economic computations. In addition, exploitation of these ideas will surely lead to progress.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011152-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1>
Chapter 23 Economic interdependence and coordination of economic policies ¤ The term “economic interdependence” has come into widespread use during the past decade. The chapter addresses the various meanings of this term, the possible reasons for increased economic interdependence on some of its meanings, and the implications of that increased economic interdependence for the functioning of national economies, including national economic policy. Economic interdependence refers to some measure of the value of economic transactions between two countries, or between a country and the rest of the world, perhaps scaled to total national output or to some measure of total financial assets. The responses to increased economic interdependence have varied in character and direction. One response involves steps toward disintegration, to reduce the interdependence and restore some freedom of action to national policy-makers. A second response involves attempts to coordinate national policy actions in one fashion or another, sometimes through conscious collaboration among nations, sometimes by one nation attempting to impose its preferred course of action on others. A third response involves the search for new policy instruments not subject to the same degree of erosion as the traditional instruments, or even choosing instruments that capitalize on the increased economic openness and mobility. New barriers to foreign trade and international movement of capital are examples of disintegration, of efforts to reduce interdependence by providing for increased separation among national markets.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1>
Chapter 16 Credit Rationing ¤ Credit markets differ from standard markets in two important respects. First, standard markets, which are the focus of classical competitive theory, involve a number of agents who are buying and selling a homogeneous commodity. Second, in standard markets, the delivery of a commodity by a seller and payment for the commodity by a buyer occur simultaneously. The analysis of credit allocation can go astray in trying to apply the standard supply and demand model that is not very appropriate for the market for promises. In the United States, a complicated, decentralized, and interrelated set of financial markets, institutions, and instruments have evolved to provide credit. Credit rationing focuses on one set of these instrumentsloan contractswhere the promised repayments are fixed amounts. At the other extreme, equity securities are promises to repay a given fraction of a firm's profits. A spectrum of securities, including convertible bonds and preferred shares, exists between loans and equity.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Chapter 2. DSGE Model-Based Forecasting ¤ Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models use modern macroeconomic theory to explain and predict comovements of aggregate time series over the business cycle and to perform policy analysis. We explain how to use DSGE models for all three purposes – forecasting, story-telling, and policy experiments – and review their forecasting record. We also provide our own real-time assessment of the forecasting performance of the Smets and Wouters (2007) model data up to 2011, compare it with Blue Chip and Greenbook forecasts, and show how it changes as we augment the standard set of observables with external information from surveys (nowcasts, interest rates, and long-run inflation and output growth expectations). We explore methods of generating forecasts in the presence of a zero-lower-bound constraint on nominal interest rates and conditional on counterfactual interest rate paths. Finally, we perform a post-mortem of DSGE model forecasts of the Great Recession, and show that forecasts from a version of the Smets–Wouters model augmented by financial frictions and with interest rate spreads as an observable compare well with Blue Chip forecasts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6>
Chapter 16. Hedge Funds ¤ This chapter begins with a brief history of hedge funds from the perspective of hedge fund investors—exploring the attributes that attracted private, wealthy investors to an opaque, nascent hedge fund industry during the decades leading up to new millennium. Following the chronology of several important market events, the first two sections traces the performance of hedge funds from these early days of the industry to the recent decade during which institutional investor emerged as the dominant investor group—a phenomenon that began shortly after the burst of the dot-com bubble and survives to this date. The arrival of institutional investors did much to encourage more transparency on the way hedge funds operate and spurred the development of performance benchmarks and databases. Using these benchmarks of hedge funds section two assesses the risk-adjusted performance of hedge funds during these decades of changing investor clientele. An important attraction of the hedge fund industry to portfolio investors is the rich tapestry of strategies with widely divergent risk-return characteristics. Section 3 is devoted to models of different categories of hedge fund strategies and highlights the drivers of performance as well as their inherent risk factors. Armed with these analytical tools and the empirical evidence on the capital formation process since the turn of the century, section 4 begins by tackling the problem of portfolio construction. The section continues with a reminder on the impact of leverage inherent in most hedge fund strategies and argues that risk management must take into account both dimensions of risk—those that emanates from holding risky assets as well as attendant risk of funding leveraged positions. The chapter concludes with discussions the impact of hedge fund research on product innovations, risk management of leverage hedge fund products and performance evaluation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269795-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4508395-2>
Households' wealth composition across OECD countries and financial risks borne by households ¤ The first section of this article presents a combined analysis of households’ financial and non-financial balance sheets across OECD countries over the period 1995-2006, based on two OECD data collections – financial balance sheet accounts and households’ financial and non-financial assets. The scope of the study mainly covers households’ gross wealth (financial, dwellings and land) and therefore does not include debt. The second section, based on the OECD households’ financial and non-financial assets database, analyses financial risks borne by households investing their savings either in investment fund shares, in life insurance reserves or in pension schemes, and how these allocations have changed and developed over time in various OECD countries.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6>
Less than you thought : The fiscal autonomy of sub-central governments ¤ State and local governments in OECD countries have access to various fiscal resources. Discretion over them varies considerably, and so does sub-central governments’ power to shape their budget and to determine outcomes like public sector efficiency, equity in access to public services or the long term fiscal stance. Data on the revenue structure of sub-central governments (SCG) would therefore be helpful. But indicators have long insufficiently reflected the way state and local budgets are funded. The most frequently used indicator is the ratio of SCG to total tax revenue, which is a poor measure for assessing the true autonomy SCGs enjoy. Since the power over fiscal revenue is a critical determinant for government finance, a set of more refined indicators for assessing fiscal autonomy should be established.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
Chapter 18 Forecasting in Marketing ¤ With the advent of advanced data collection techniques, there is an increased interest in using econometric models to support decisions in marketing. Due to the sometimes specific nature of variables in marketing, the discipline uses econometric models that are rarely, if ever, used elsewhere. This chapter deals with techniques to derive forecasts from these models. Due to the intrinsic non-linear nature of these models, these techniques draw heavily on simulation techniques.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047390-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8>
5. Mechanism Design and Policy Applications ¤ Early in the development of experimental economics interest emerged in using the lab as a test bed for mechanism design and the examination of public policy questions.The contingent valuation method (CVM) is a hypothetical survey instrument that has been widely used and promoted in the assessment of environmental resource damages. Harrison and Rutström discuss the crucial issue of whether there is bias in CVM instruments arising from the fact that both the policy being evaluated and its damage prevention value are hypothetical with weak and distorted private incentives for respondents to accurately reveal their preferences. In these settings the question is whether people overstate their true evaluations. They provide a comprehensive review of a wide range of experiments allowing the existence of hypothetical bias to be determined, concluding that the existence of such bias, while highly variable, is persistent and cannot be ignored in the use of CVM instruments.

Introduction to the Series ¤ The series Handbooks in Economics produce books for various branches of economics, each of which is a definitive source, reference, and teaching supplement for use by professional researchers and advanced graduate students. Each book provides self-contained surveys of the current state of a branch of economics in the form of chapters prepared by leading specialists on various aspects of this branch of economics. These surveys summarize not only received results but also newer developments, from recent journal articles and discussion papers. Some original material is also included, but the main goal is to provide comprehensive and accessible surveys.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066510-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117663-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048737-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135492-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1>
Chapter 10. External Adjustment, Global Imbalances, Valuation Effects ¤ We provide an overview of the recent developments of the literature on the determinants of long-term capital flows, global imbalances, and valuation effects. We present the main stylized facts of the new international financial landscape in which external balance sheets of countries have grown in size and discuss implications for the international monetary and financial system.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0>
Chapter 23 Optimal policies for natural monopolies ¤ This chapter examines some of the optimal policies that are used to control a natural monopoly. Although the traditional view suggests that government intervention and natural monopoly go hand in hand, economic analysis since the late 1960s has suggested rather forcefully that there are ways to introduce competition for a market, even if a natural monopoly structure exists within a market. The chapter provides an overview of possible competitive approaches to the natural monopoly problem. It discusses some of the major concepts in optimal pricing in regulated industries. These include peak load pricing, Ramsey pricing, and nonlinear outlay schedules. The chapter reviews a set of issues related to the fairness of regulated prices is discussed in the context of cross-subsidy or interservice subsidy. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133311-1>
Consumer Protection and Financial Innovation : A Few Basic Propositions ¤ The issue of financial innovation and consumer protection is mostly about access and suitability. Access refers to a situation in which affordable, mainstream financial products are available to all segments of the population across the range of income levels and demographic characteristics. Suitability addresses the appropriateness of the products for particular consumer groups. Innovative products will tend generally to be either positive for access to finance or neutral. But products that actually result in increased access to finance may nonetheless still raise suitability issues. Innovative products can be particularly difficult for retail consumers to understand and better financial education is needed to help address financial illiteracy. In addition, service providers should have appropriate internal controls to minimise the chances that consumers take on inappropriate exposures. Even the best disclosures, alone, may not be adequate, so to avoid situations in which retail investors become involved with unsuitable products, institutions should be “encouraged” to develop sufficient measures for client protection as part of their product development activities. Stricter penalties should be used when needed to address mis-selling, fraud or firm misconduct. JEL Classification: G01, G28, G38.

Chapter 23 Economic growth and the environment ¤ Environmental pollution is introduced both as a joint product and as a source of disutility in growth models. The purpose is to explore vital questions such as: is environmental protection compatible with economic growth; is it possible to have sustained growth in the long run without accumulation of pollution; what is the impact of environmental concerns on growth, and in particular, how are the levels, the paths or the growth rates of crucial variables such as capital, income, consumption or environmental pollution affected if we take into account the environment; what type of deviations do we observe between market outcomes and the social optimum; what are the policy implications of these deviations; what do data tell us about stylized facts relating environmental quality and economic development (the environmental Kuznets curve); and how can total factor productivity be decomposed into its sources once we account for the fact that an economy produces not only the desired output, but also undesirable output (environmental pollution)?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3>
Chapter 12. Digitization, Copyright, and the Flow of New Music Products ¤ Copyright protection grants creators monopolies – with their attendant harms – in order to provide incentives for continued creation. File sharing, which exploded with Napster’s appearance in 1999, effectively weakened copyright protection. Researchers have documented depressing effects of file sharing on demand, but what is arguably more important are the possibly curtailed incentives to bring new creative products to market. At the same time that technological change has weakened effective copyright protection, other innovations have reduced the costs of production, promotion, and distribution, making it unclear how recent technological changes, on balance, would affect the flow of new music products. This chapter reviews the emerging evidence on the quality and service flow of new recorded music products since Napster.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4>
Chapter 12 Multiple objective decision analysis in regional economics ¤ This chapter discusses the concept of multiple objective decision analysis in regional economics. Until the end of the 1960s, decision analysis was still dominated by simple optimization methods, such as single objective programming, cost-benefit analysis, and fixed target approaches. As a result, a systematic analysis of conflicts involved in economic decision problems with multiple goals and multiple actors did not receive sufficient attention. Later, a need was felt for appropriate analytical tools for analyzing conflicts among policy objectives. Multiple objective decision analysis aims at providing such a set of tools. In the past decade, multiple objective decision analysis has become one of the most powerful methodologies in the programming theory. It serves to enhance the quality of decision making by providing both a sound methodological platform for decision analysis and an operational framework for actual decision making. The chapter provides a presentation and discussion of the theoretical framework of multiple objective decision analysis and its use in regional economics. It also provides some basic concepts in multiple objective decision analysis and reviews its links to the choice theory.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9>
Chapter 2. Inequality, Income, and Well-Being ¤ Individual well-being depends not only on income but also on other dimensions of life, such as health, the quality of social relations and of the environment, employment, and job satisfaction. In this chapter we survey the economic literature on how to construct such overall measures of well-being. We distinguish three approaches: the capability (and functionings) approach, the use of subjective life satisfaction measures, and the calculation of equivalent incomes. We discuss the normative assumptions underlying these three approaches, focusing on two issues: the degree to which individual preferences are respected and where in each approach the boundaries of individual responsibility are drawn. We compare the measurement of inequality in well-being with the use of multidimensional inequality measures. We illustrate the general theoretical issues in three domains of application: measuring the effects of household size and composition in the literature on equivalence scales, valuing publicly provided goods and services, and making international comparisons of well-being involving international purchasing power parity comparisons.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7>
Chapter 46 Non-cooperative games with many players ¤ In this survey article, we report results on the existence of pure-strategy Nash equilibria in games with an atomless continuum of players, each with an action set that is not necessarily finite. We also discuss purification and symmetrization of mixed-strategy Nash equilibria, and settings in which private information, anonymity and idiosyncratic shocks are given particular prominence.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8>
Chapter 1. Geophysical and Geochemical Aspects of Environmental Degradation ¤ The environmental system is characterized by an interplay of geophysical and geochemical processes that provide a setting for life. Now that human interventions are affecting the global system as a whole, it is important to distinguish between changes of natural origin and changes brought about by human activities. Major difficulties arise in doing this because of the nonlinear and chaotic nature of the interactions between the environmental and human systems. Following an initial review of basic earth science principles, this chapter focuses on five fundamental issues that are important in all quarters of the world. Two sections deal with purely atmospheric issues, air pollution near the earth’s surface and depletion of ozone in the stratosphere. These sections are followed by a closer look at water pollution and water management. A specific issue, acidification of freshwaters and soils, is next dealt with in more detail. The final issue addressed in the chapter, global climate change, requires an analysis of the total environmental system. All of these environmental issues have a bearing on how humankind might be able to secure sustainable development for the future, which is touched upon in the concluding section.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075236-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061619-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1>
Chapter 43 Agriculture and Human Capital in Economic Growth: Farmers, Schooling and Nutrition ¤ This survey reviews the existing literature, identifying the contribution of agriculture, schooling, and nutrition to economic growth and development over time and across countries. Particular attention is paid to the roles of improvements in agricultural technology and of the human capital of farmers and farm people. Macroeconomic and microeconomic evidence related to the interactions between human capital, productivity and health are explored. Most of the world's growth in population, labor productivity and real income per capita have occurred over the past 250 years. We show that for most countries, development is a process of conversion from primarily agrarian economies to urban industrial and service economies. The evidence is that positive technology shocks to agriculture have played a key role in igniting a transition from traditional to modern agriculture and to long-term economic growth in almost all countries. Improvements in agricultural technologies improve labor productivity and create surplus agricultural labor that can provide workers for the growing urban areas. In some cases, improved nutrition helps raise labor productivity and allows individuals to work for longer hours, which makes human capital investments more attractive. The induced improvements in the skill level of a population have major implications for raising living standards, improving health standards, and altering time allocation decisions. In most currently poor and middle income countries, improved schooling has been more important than improved nutrition or caloric intake in explaining recent economic growth. Nevertheless, the poorest countries of the world continue to have a large share of their labor force in agriculture, and growth cannot occur until they experience their own agricultural transformation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4704302-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5>
Chapter 1. Modeling coupled climate, ecosystems, and economic systems ¤ Human economies and ecosystems form a coupled system coevolving in time and space, since human economies use ecosystems services and at the same time affect ecosystems through their production and consumption activities. The study of the interactions between human economies and ecosystems is fundamental for the efficient use of natural resources and the protection of the environment. This necessitates the development and use of models capable of tracing the main interactions, links and feedbacks. In developing this chapter, our objective was to focus on a segment of rapidly developing literature on coupled ecological/economic models with an emphasis on climate change. The advantage of this approach is that it introduces the reader to a very important current research topic, but it also allows, by using climate as the reference ecosystem, the exploration of new modeling approaches which are relevant and useful for the modeling of other types of coupled ecological/economic systems. These include modeling of deep structural uncertainty by using robust control methods, exploring modeling through cumulative carbon budgeting, studying spatial transport phenomena and spatial aspects in economic/ecological modeling.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3>
Chapter 51 Coordination Failure in Market Statistic Games ¤ A central question in economics is how do markets coordinate the behavior of anonymous decision makers in a many person decentralized economy. Economic theory has traditionally addressed the question using the equilibrium method, which abstracts away from an important aspect of the general coordination problem, because it assumes an equilibrium. For abstract games, an equilibrium is defined as an assignment to each player of a strategy that is best for him when the others use the strategies assigned to them. The relevance of this abstract mutual consistency requirement for economic modeling is an open question. The requirement has two related problems: disequilibrium and coordination failure. First, the mutual consistency requirement of an equilibrium assignment is not an implication of individual rationality, but an additional strong assumption. Second, there is often more than one equilibrium assignment. For example, multiple Pareto ranked equilibria arise in both macroeconomic models with production, search, or trading externalities and microeconomic models of monopolistic competition, technology adoption and diffusion, and manufacturing with non-convexities.

Chapter 65 Payoff Uncertainty and Cooperation in Finitely-repeated Prisoner's Dilemma Games ¤ Several of the results reported here broadly support theories of sequential equilibria. In particular, at least four pieces of data indicate that game theory's structurally-oriented models predict some of the reasons for individuals' play in the prisoner's dilemma game: (1) more cooperation resulted when a cooperative equilibrium existed; (2) players cooperated more overall and more in the first round in SW than in SS; (3) Column was more cooperative than Row on the first trial; and (4) the SW Column Uncertain condition produced the most end game cooperation. Unfortunately, these effects only explain part of the picture. In essence, even after considering the effects of uncertainty, the original issue still remains: considerable cooperation resulted when no cooperative equilibria exist.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1>
Chapter 6 Institutions as a Fundamental Cause of Long-Run Growth ¤ This paper develops the empirical and theoretical case that differences in economic institutions are the fundamental cause of differences in economic development. We first document the empirical importance of institutions by focusing on two “quasi-natural experiments” in history, the division of Korea into two parts with very different economic institutions and the colonization of much of the world by European powers starting in the fifteenth century. We then develop the basic outline of a framework for thinking about why economic institutions differ across countries. Economic institutions determine the incentives of and the constraints on economic actors, and shape economic outcomes. As such, they are social decisions, chosen for their consequences. Because different groups and individuals typically benefit from different economic institutions, there is generally a conflict over these social choices, ultimately resolved in favor of groups with greater political power. The distribution of political power in society is in turn determined by political institutions and the distribution of resources. Political institutions allocate de jure political power, while groups with greater economic might typically possess greater de facto political power. We therefore view the appropriate theoretical framework as a dynamic one with political institutions and the distribution of resources as the state variables. These variables themselves change over time because prevailing economic institutions affect the distribution of resources, and because groups with de facto political power today strive to change political institutions in order to increase their de jure political power in the future. Economic institutions encouraging economic growth emerge when political institutions allocate power to groups with interests in broad-based property rights enforcement, when they create effective constraints on power-holders, and when there are relatively few rents to be captured by power-holders. We illustrate the assumptions, the workings and the implications of this framework using a number of historical examples.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059252-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3>
Chapter 6. Financial Innovation ¤ Although financial innovation has been an important part of the financial landscape throughout modern economic history, it has received relatively little attention in academia. This essay surveys the existing literature on financial innovation from the disciplines of financial economics, history, law, and industrial organization. I begin by defining financial innovation and discussing problems with creating taxonomies of financial innovations. I then discuss the explanations given for the extensive amount of financial innovation we observe both today and in history, which include: (a) completing inherently incomplete markets; (b) addressing persistent agency concerns and information asymmetries; (c) minimizing transaction, search or marketing costs; (d) responding to tax and regulatory forces; (e) responding to changes in economic conditions, in particular new or newly perceived risks; and (f) capitalizing on technological developments. I review work that studies the identity of innovators, the process of diffusion of innovation, and private benefits of innovation. I illustrate these general trends with a description of a sequence of innovations that show that repeated experimentation and failure characterize the evolutionary process. As difficult as it may be to measure the private benefits to innovators, it has proven even more problematic to conclusively model or measure the social welfare benefits of financial innovation, although one can point to specific innovations that appear to enhance welfare.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269795-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4508395-2>
Chapter 17. Trade and Cultural Diversity ¤ This chapter surveys the recent economic literature on the relationships between globalization and cultural diversity. We first review the different channels through which international integration interacts with cultural diversity across individuals, communities, and nations. We then present some recent formal economic models of cultural transmission and cultural evolution, and show how these models can be embedded into standard economic frameworks to analyze the links between globalization and cultural diversity. The chapter then presents various applications from trade in cultural goods, foreign direct investment in tourism to cultural integration of foreign migrants. Finally, normative implications and the relationships between cultural policy and international policies are also discussed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4>

Private pensions and the financial crisis : How to ensure adequate retirement income from DC pension plans ¤ The current economic and financial crisis has shaken confidence in funded pension systems in general and in defined contribution (DC) pension plans in particular. The crisis has highlighted the impact of market conditions on retirement savings accumulated in DC pension plans and the uncertainty as to whether those retirement savings may prove adequate to finance retirement – particularly for those close to retirement. The purpose of this paper is to provide recommendations on how to ensure adequate retirement income from DC pension plans. In this context, this paper addresses three main questions: 1) How much do people need to save? 2) How can the effects of market risk on DC pension plans be alleviated? 3) How can retirement income be protected during the payout phase? The analysis concludes that in order to deliver adequate retirement income from DC pension plans with a certain degree of certainty, there is a need for comprehensive measures which include: higher contributions; increasing the contribution period by postponing retirement; setting as default options relatively conservative investment policies including life-cycle strategies; and managing risk in the payout phase with inflationindexed life annuities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Reflections on the Economics of Education ¤ Modern research on the economics of education began in the 1950s with research by T. W. Schultz, Jacob Mincer, Sherwin Rosen and some others, although there are earlier precedents, including analyses by Adam Smith, Alfred Marshall, and Milton Friedman. This new literature treats education as an investment that has both costs and returns. The returns analyzed are principally the increase in earnings because of greater amounts of schooling. The costs included tuition, fees, and other direct expenses from schooling, and the earnings foregone by being in school rather than at work. Higher education has boomed throughout the world during the past three decades in many poorer and in all rich nations. An important part of the explanation for this development is that new technologies, such as computers and the Internet, increased the demand for persons with college education, because college graduates more easily utilize and adapt to these technologies. Other important developments explaining the greater incentives to get a higher education are the shift to high-skilled services, such as the education and health sectors, and away from manufacturing and increased globalization that helped spread the demand for these new technologies throughout the world.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2>
Chapter 6. Forecasting Stock Returns ¤ We survey the literature on stock return forecasting, highlighting the challenges faced by forecasters as well as strategies for improving return forecasts. We focus on U.S. equity premium forecastability and illustrate key issues via an empirical application based on updated data. Some studies argue that, despite extensive in-sample evidence of equity premium predictability, popular predictors from the literature fail to outperform the simple historical average benchmark forecast in out-of-sample tests. Recent studies, however, provide improved forecasting strategies that deliver statistically and economically significant out-of-sample gains relative to the historical average benchmark. These strategies – including economically motivated model restrictions, forecast combination, diffusion indices, and regime shifts – improve forecasting performance by addressing the substantial model uncertainty and parameter instability surrounding the data-generating process for stock returns. In addition to the U.S. equity premium, we succinctly survey out-of-sample evidence supporting U.S. cross-sectional and international stock return forecastability. The significant evidence of stock return forecastability worldwide has important implications for the development of both asset pricing models and investment management strategies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1>
Governments and the Market for Longevity-indexed Bonds ¤ Uncertainty about length of life, longevity risk, is a growing financial problem for pension funds and annuity providers. Unfortunately, there is a lack of financial instruments to hedge against this longevity risk, thereby complicating risk management by pension funds and hindering the expansion of the annuity market. Consequently, this paper examines the role of government in promoting a private market solution for longevity hedging financial products. Governments could in principle improve the market for annuities by issuing longevity-indexed bonds and by producing a longevity index. The paper argues that the first public policy role is hampered by the fact that governments are themselves already exposed to significant longevity risk. However, governments could take other steps such as producing a reliable longevity index.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3>
Chapter Four. Improving Health in Developing Countries : Evidence from Randomized Evaluations ¤ We summarize evidence from the growing body of randomized evaluations on health in developing countries from the perspective of the human capital investment model, cost-effectiveness analysis, and behavioral economics. Many cost-effective methods of infectious disease prevention have limited uptake. Contributing factors include externalities from infectious disease prevention, public goods problems, liquidity constraints, and behavioral factors, such as present bias and limited attention. Across a variety of contexts, consumer use of cost-effective products for prevention and non-acute care is highly sensitive to price and convenience. Health education has a mixed record, often working in combination with incentives and functioning through increasing salience rather than delivering information. The quality of health services in many developing countries is very poor, with weak incentives for public sector health workers. Reforms that strengthen incentives show promise but institutional details matter. Programs based on this more nuanced understanding of health decision making can save millions of lives.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Chapter 24. Market Structure in Multisector General Equilibrium Models of Open Economies ¤ We provide an overview of several approaches to modeling market structure in multisector general equilibrium (MSGE) models, including both oligopoly and monopolistic competition. We emphasize open economy models and applications to international economic policy. We map out practical strategies for implementing variations on market structure, including functional forms and calibration strategies. We also identify areas that, in our view, are promising for further research. This includes both exploring the implications of moving away from average cost pricing models (including monopolistic competition) for labor market outcomes and inequality, and better methods for econometric estimation of parameters and confronting alternative forms of market structure against measures of model performance (specification testing).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210294-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224214-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065341-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5>
Chapter 8 Women's roles in the agricultural household: Bargaining and human capital investments ¤ Three themes are related to women's economic roles in the agricultural household. First the unified family as coordinator of production and consumption over a life cycle. Second the role of separability of production and consumption decisions in the agricultural household that depends on the equivalence of hired and of family labor. Third Nashbargaining or Pareto efficient collective coordination in the family. Increases in women's human capital affects gender bargaining and is closely related to declines in child mortality, fertility, and population growth, and increases in child “quality” as proxied by child schooling and health status.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4>
Chapter 5 Military alliances: Theory and empirics ¤ This chapter provides an overview of the main theoretical and empirical findings in the economics of military alliances. The pure public and joint product models are presented along with the empirical methods used to test them. Issues concerning burden sharing and strategic doctrine in the NATO alliance are discussed. Comparisons between the Nash and Lindahl allocation processes are made by presenting the empirical work that has attempted to distinguish between them. Attention is also given to the median-voter model and to alternative technologies of public good supply.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132793-7>
Chapter 5. Insurance Markets for the Elderly ¤ We describe the risks faced by the aging population and survey the corresponding insurance markets for these risks. We focus on income risk, health expenditure risk, long-term care expenditure risk, and mortality risk. We also discuss the interactions between social insurance and private insurance markets.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006294-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4334479-3>
Chapter Fifteen. Public and Private Sector Interface ¤ A major feature of the health sector is the existence of health insurance, either public or private. Often both coexist in the same country. Public health insurance is often accompanied by public provision of health care. We consider two main areas of public–private interface: in funding of health care expenditures and in provision of health care. Within each area, both positive and normative views are explored. On funding issues, the role of three main sources of funds—public health insurance, private health insurance, and out-of-pocket payments—and their interactions are addressed. Topics covered in provision of health care include interaction of public and private providers, dual practice, and public–private partnerships. Empirical evidence is also reviewed.

Chapter 94 Three-way Experimental Election Results: Strategic Voting, Coordinated Outcomes and Duverger's Law ¤ This chapter discusses here all used plurality voting. Thus, subjects could cast the vote vectors (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1) and (0, 0, 0) for the candidates O, G and B, respectively. After each election, the candidate with the most votes was declared the winner and subjects were paid accordingly. If a tie occurred between two or more candidates, the winner was selected randomly with the tied candidates having equal probabilities of being selected. After each election, subjects were informed of the number of votes received by each candidate, the election winner and their payoffs. The equilibria are based on expectations about (1) which candidates will be in contention in a close race (conditional tie probabilities) and (2) the values voters place on breaking ties in their favor. For these payoffs, only the relative strengths of candidates O and G matter in selecting the equilibrium. When O is perceived strong while G is weak, all majority voters vote for O.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
International Pooling of Operators' Funds : An Option to Increase the Amount of Financial Security to Cover Nuclear Liability? ¤ Financial security to cover the third party liability of the operators of nuclear installations is nearly exclusively provided by the insurance industry. The recent revision exercises of the international nuclear liability conventions resulted in higher liability amounts and in a broader concept of compensable nuclear damage. This marks a new challenge for the insurance industry: its financial capacity is not unlimited, and there seems to emerge difficulties to cover the new liability in full.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068925-6>
Chapter 15. Learning in Networks ¤ We choose between alternatives without being fully informed about the rewards from different courses of action. In making our decisions, we use our own past experience and the experience of others. So the ways in which we interact - our social network - can influence our choices. These choices in turn influence the generation of new information and shape future choices. These considerations motivate a rich research programme on how social networks shape individual and collective learning. The present paper provides a summary of this research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132883-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027266-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120990-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066514-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5>
Assessing Default Investment Strategies in Defined Contribution Pension Plans ¤ This paper assesses the relative performance of different investment strategies for different structures of the payout phase. In particular, it looks at whether the specific glide-path of life-cycle investment strategies and the introduction of dynamic features in the design of default investment strategies affect significantly retirement income outcomes. The analysis concludes that there is no “one-size-fits-all” default investment option. Life-cycle and dynamic investment strategies deliver comparable replacement rates adjusted by risk. However, life-cycle strategies that maintain a constant exposure to equities during most of the accumulation period, switching swiftly to bonds in the last decade before retirement, seem to produce better results and are easier to explain. Dynamic management strategies can provide somewhat higher replacement rates for a given level of risk than the more deterministic strategies, at least in the case of pay-outs in the form of variable withdrawals. The length of the contribution period also affects the ranking of the different investment strategies with life-cycle strategies having a stronger positive impact the shorter is the contribution period.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Nuclear Renaissance in Italy : Maintaining Momentum ¤ Following the adoption of Law No. 99 of 23 July 2009, Italy is on the threshold of returning to nuclear power, even though there are many more challenges yet to overcome. It should be recalled that Law No. 99/2009 includes enabling provisions empowering the Government to issue one or more implementing decrees providing rules for the siting of new nuclear power plants, the licensing process for the construction, operation and dismantling of those plants, as well as rules for interim storage and the final disposal of nuclear waste. On 15 February 2010, upon the proposal of the Ministry of Economic Development, the Italian Council of Ministers issued Legislative Decree No. 31/20102 (hereinafter “decree”) implementing the enabling provisions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068925-6>
Chapter 17 The economics of population aging ¤ This chapter explores the ways in which changing the age structure of the population in the macroeconomic models affects variables, such as consumption, wages, government spending, and saving. The chapter also presents the basic data on the ways in which the age structure of the population is evolving over time, considers the effects of population aging on production and consumption in the economy as a whole, and discusses the effects of aging. One of the salient themes of this chapter is that the costs of population aging currently in prospect are to a large extent simply the passing of the transitory benefits of reduced fertility. A second theme of this chapter is that although aging will not appreciably change the overall burden of transfers that society makes to dependents, it will greatly change the channels through which these transfers flow. Population aging has a larger effect on individual transfer schemes considered in isolation than on the net flow of transfers taken together. In the case of government transfer schemes to dependents, which focus particularly on the elderly, the average age of providing is younger than the average age of receiving and thus population aging enlarges the burden of such transfer schemes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123185-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006292-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006294-6>
Chapter 6 Money, inflation and growth ¤ Different long-run rates of growth of money supply are eventually reflected in different rates of inflation. Tobin studied this in a simple descriptive model with aggregate saving depending only on current income. It was found that money growth was associated with higher capital stock and output per person in the steady state. Faster inflation led savers to shift their portfolios in favor of real capital. The chapter examines Sidrauski model illustrating the central neutrality result and presents some of its variations in which neutrality with respect to output fails even though the real interest rate is not affected by inflation. It examines the Fisher relation and focuses on deviations from the one infinitely lived family models. The exact function of money and the sensitivity of the long-run inflationgrowth relation to different assumptions about the reasons why money is held are also examined.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2>
Chapter 15. Empirical Studies of Media Bias ¤ In this chapter we survey the empirical literature on media bias, with a focus on partisan and ideological biases. First, we discuss the methods used to measure the relative positions of media outlets. We divide bias into two categories, explicit and implicit bias. We group existing measures of implicit bias into three categories: measures based on comparing media outlets with other actors, measures based on the intensity of media coverage, and measures based on tone. In the second part of the chapter we discuss the main factors that are found to be correlated with media bias, dividing these into demand-side and supply-side factors. We also discuss the role of competition across media outlets. In the third part of the chapter we discuss some of the attempts to measure the persuasive impact of media bias on citizens’ attitudes and behavior.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129410-5>
Chapter 35 Market failures and second-best analysis with a focus on nutrition, credit, and incomplete markets ¤ This chapter studies second-best models of nutritional externalities, credit, and incomplete markets for risk, developing implications for welfare-improving government policy using primitive economic building blocks. Using a simple model of altruism wherein the rich obtain utility from the nourishment of the poor, the analysis describes efficiency properties of alternative food subsidy policies, with and without enforcement costs of targeting subsidies to the poor. In three models of imperfect information in credit markets, the chapter characterizes equilibrium financial contracts and policy remedies to inefficiencies. Finally, welfare properties of stereotypical agricultural policies are developed in a stochastic production economy with incomplete markets.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6>
Chapter 18. Calibration and Expert Testing ¤ I survey and discuss the recent literature on testing experts or probabilistic forecasts, which I would describe as a literature on “strategic hypothesis testing” The starting point of this literature is some surprising results of the following type: suppose that a criterion forjudging probabilistic forecasts (which I will call a test) has the property that if data are generated by a probabilistic model, then forecasts generated by that model pass the test. It, then, turns out an agent who knows only the test by which she is going to be judged, but knows nothing about the data-generating process, is able to pass the test by generating forecasts strategically. The literature identifies a large number of tests that are vulnerable to strategic manipulation of uninformed forecasters, but also delivers some tests that cannot be passed without knowledge of the data-generating process. It also provides some results on philosophy of science and financial markets that are related to, and inspired by the results on testing experts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8>

Collective Pension Funds : International Evidence and Implications for China's Enterprise Annuities Reform ¤ Collective pension funds (CPFs) – occupational pension funds that cover the employees of more than one employer (enterprise) – have been operating in OECD countries for decades. Generally speaking, there are two models, i.e. closed pension funds, with membership restricted to a particular industry or group of industries, and open pension funds, open to all types of companies. The governance structure of such funds also operates in two ways – via an internal model (with trustees appointed by employers and employees) and an external model (with professional, commercial trustees). In this report, we first describe and analyse how CPFs are operated in selected OECD countries and non-OECD economies. Then, we review occupational pensions (or Enterprise Annuities – EA – in Chinese terminology) in general and CPFs in particular. Given the problems holding back the development of EA plans among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in China, and bearing in mind both China’s specific situations and international best practices, we propose a number of policy recommendations to promote the development of CPFs covering the SME sector. Our practical policy recommendations include: 1) industry funds with more open membership; 2) establishment of new purpose-built industry funds; 3) establishment of new regional EA administration centres acting as independent pension councils (trustees) for open pension funds; 4) in parallel to these policy initiatives in China, commercial trustees should be encouraged to establish CPFs targeting the SME sector.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Chapter 6. The Economics of Cultural Awards ¤ This chapter considers the economic dimensions of prizes and awards in the arts. It first treats the role of awards in the markets for artistic goods: their effect on sales, earnings, and consumer demand, and their function as judgment devices or quality signals. Also discussed are the costs of mounting an awards program, and the economics of awards administration and presentation. The chapter then takes up a broader set of economic considerations, beyond those of commerce as such, discussing the role of prizes as a form of symbolic capital in the economy of prestige. This symbolic role includes their reputation effects and relation to cultural branding; their function as a form of incentive for artists; their capacity to predict or determine an eventual canon of esteemed works; and their value within an increasingly international system of cultural status hierarchies. Having surveyed the existing literature, the chapter concludes by noting economists’ narrow and excessive emphasis on the material consequences of prizes, and the many fundamental areas of inquiry that remain wide open for future research. These include the economics of sponsorship, particularly philanthropic sponsorship; the role of social capital and the system of exchange and reciprocity involving judges, recipients, and administrators; and the economics of the awards industry as a whole, its global dispersion, and its large-scale functions and effects within the creative economy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4>
Chapter 1. International Comparisons of Health Expenditure: Theory, Data and Econometric Analysis ¤ Comparisons of aggregate health expenditure across different countries have become popular over the last three decades as they permit a systematic investigation of the impact of different institutional regimes and other explanatory variables. Over the years, several regression analyses based on cross-section and panel data have been used to explain the international differences in health expenditure. A common result of these studies is that aggregate income appears to be the most important factor explaining health expenditure variation between countries and that the size of the estimated income elasticity is high and even higher than unity which in that case indicates that health care is a luxury good. Additional results indicates, for example, that the use of primary care gatekeepers lowers health expenditure and also that the way of remunerating physicians in the ambulatory care sector appears to influence health expenditure; capitation systems tend to lead to lower expenditure than fee-for-service systems. Finally, we also list some issues for the future. We demand more efforts on theory of the macroeconomic analysis of health expenditure, which is underdeveloped at least relative to the macroeconometrics of health expenditure. We also demand more replications based on updated data and methods that seeks to unify the many differing results of previous studies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Chapter 3. Education and Family Background : Mechanisms and Policies ¤ In every society for which we have data, people's educational achievement is positively correlated with their parents' education or with other indicators of their parents' socio-economic status. This topic is central in social science, and there is no doubt that research has intensified during recent decades, not least thanks to better data having become accessible to researchers. The purpose of this chapter is to summarize and evaluate recent empirical research on education and family background. Broadly speaking, we focus on two related but distinct motivations for this topic. The first is equality of opportunity. Here, the major research issues are: How important a determinant of educational attainment is family background, and is family background—in the broad sense that incorporates factors not chosen by the individual—a major, or only a minor, determinant of educational attainment? What are the mechanisms that make family background important? Have specific policy reforms been successful in reducing the impact of family background on educational achievement? The second common starting point for recent research has been the child development perspective. Here, the focus is on how human-capital accumulation is affected by early childhood resources. Studies with this focus address the questions: What types of parental resources or inputs are important for children's development, why are they important, and when are they important? In addition, this literature focuses on exploring which types of economic policy, and what timing of the policy in relation to children's social and cognitive development, are conducive to children's performance and adult outcomes. The policy interest in this research is whether policies that change parents' resources and restrictions have causal effects on their children.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2>
The Challenges of Narrowing the US Current-Account Deficit and Implications for Other Economies ¤ This article uses the OECD’s interlink model to explore several possible channels through which a narrowing of the US current account deficit could occur. The shocks considered include dollar depreciation, fiscal consolidation, and an improvement in the non-price competitiveness of US producers. A key conclusion is that shocks would have to be very large in order to materially reduce the US external deficit, largely because of the offsetting impact of second-round effects. In addition...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2>
Chapter 5 Empirical evidence on income inequality in industrialized countries ¤ This chapter reviews the evidence on cross-national comparisons of annual disposable income inequality in over 20 wealthy nations. We begin by reviewing a number of conceptual and measurement issues which must be addressed by any cross-national comparison of survey-based household income data. With these caveats in mind, we present data on both the level of inequality during the early to mid-1990s, and in inequality trends since 1970. While most comparisons are made in terms of relative incomes within nations, we also make some real income comparisons at a point in time using purchasing power parities. The data indicate that a wide range of inequality exists across these rich nations during this decade, with the most unequal nation experiencing a level of inequality which is more than twice the level found in the most equal nation. Country specific trends in income inequality are more similar, although not universally so. The large majority of nations have experienced rising income inequality over the last decade or longer. This increase is not offset by changes in income mobility over this period, and follows a period of declining income inequality in most of these same nations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013887-2>
Chapter 28 Game theory and evolutionary biology ¤ The subject matter of evolutionary game theory is the analysis of conflict and cooperation in animals and plants. Originally, game theory was developed as a theory of human strategic behavior based on an idealized picture of rational decision making. Evolutionary game theory does not rely on rationality assumptions but on the idea that the Darwinian process of natural selection drives organisms toward the optimization of reproductive success. Most of evolutionary game theory focuses on those cases where stable equilibrium is reached. However, the dynamics of evolutionary processes in disequilibrium is also an active area of research. In principle, evolutionary game theory deals only with fully symmetric games. Asymmetric conflicts are embedded in symmetric games where each player has the same chance to be on each side of the conflict. The mathematical definition of evolutionary stability refers to symmetric games only. Because asymmetric conflicts can be embedded in symmetric games, this is no obstacle for the treatment of asymmetric conflicts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8>
Chapter 2 The theory of the firm ¤ The theory of the firm has long posed a problem for economists. This chapter discusses the analytical models of the firm that go beyond the black-box conception of a production function. The firm is seen as a contract among a multitude of parties. The main hypothesis is that contractual designs, both implicit and explicit, are created to minimize transaction costs between specialized factors of production. This follows Coase's original hypothesis that institutions serve the purpose of facilitating exchange and can best be understood as optimal accommodations to contractual constraints rather than production constraints. There are three problems that need attention. A first step is to develop and apply techniques that deal with nonstandard problems, such as incomplete contracts, bounded rationality, and multi-lateral contracting. The second step ought to integrate observations from neighboring fields, such as sociology and psychology, in a consistent way into the theoretical apparatus. The third step will be to increase the evidence/theory ratio, which is currently very low in this field.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133311-1>
Chapter 24. Risk Sharing Between Households ¤ This chapter reviews the literature identifying the different roles that family and kinship networks play in sharing risk. After a brief overview of efficient risk sharing, we discuss the channels by which households pool risk and the motives for entering in binding informal arrangements. Informal risk sharing arrangements are often thought to be enforced via reciprocal repeated relationships that are not family or kin specific. Other explanations draw from behavioral psychology and evolutionary biology and emphasize the link between gene transmission, family ties, and altruism. Next, we turn to the formation of risk sharing arrangements, either as partially overlapping networks or as risk sharing groups. We find that both types of arrangements often coexist and complement each other. The nature of strategic interactions among individuals and households has been shown to affect the stability of the resulting risk sharing equilibria. We finish with a discussion of the available evidence on strategic link and group formation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066514-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027266-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120990-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132883-8>
Chapter 36 Games in coalitional form ¤ This chapter has had two principal purposes. One was to develop the idea of the “coalitional function” of a cooperative game as a means of abstracting from given settings (pure exchange economies, strategic-form games, political games, and the like) the possibilities available to the various coalitions through player cooperation. The other was to present several classes of games (market games, simple games, convex games, symmetric games) on which attention will be focused in subsequent chapters, and to provide several tools (covers and extensions, contractions and reductions, and the like) which will be useful in further analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Chapter 8. Exchange Rates and Interest Parity ¤ This chapter surveys recent theoretical and empirical contributions on foreign exchange rate determination. The chapter first examines monetary models under uncovered interest parity and rational expectations, and then considers deviations from UIP/rational expectations: foreign exchange risk premium, private information, near-rational expectations, and peso problems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0>
Chapter 6 Long-run income distribution and growth ¤ This chapter presents a discussion on the long-run income distribution and growth. Development economics began macro. If the whole economy changes structure during the course of development, then to understand the process one has to look at the economy as a whole. Increasing poverty and declining productive potential resulting from stabilization programs aimed at offsetting external shocks have been the rule for most developing countries in the 1980s. The long-run approach is presumably of interest because it tells something about how economies change in historical timein particular, over the century or two of what Kuznets (1966) calls modern economic growth. Schumpeter's Theory of Economic Development is infrequently read nowadays, but it is the true origin of the field. Schumpeter's theory of development is interesting in itself, because it emphasizes technical and institutional change. Schumpeter begins with the kind of theory now considered long run, and in a leap discards it for more interesting processes that have been dropped from the orthodox canon. One key analytical question is how the entrepreneur obtains resources to innovate. The chapter also discusses demand-driven models; shades of Marx, the neoclassical resurgencetrade, structuralists versus monetarists, and so on. One function of neoclassical theory is to defuse radical economics by embellishment with optimizing agents and suppression of social content.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213090-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7>
Chapter 35 Trends in sizes and structures of urban areas ¤ This chapter reviews the literature dealing with systems of cities and the patterns of development within such systems. It starts with the longstanding question of the distribution of city sizes, both in relation to how this distribution can be described and, given the form that it takes, how that form can be explained. Such explanations frequently invoke various sorts of agglomeration economies and so some of the literature relating to these is included here. The chapter then surveys the literature that examines patterns of development within urban systems, and then work at a more disaggregated level on suburbanisation. The chapter concludes with a summary of research into recent patterns of urbanisation, including relative recentralisation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4>
Chapter 9 Uncertainty in trade models ¤ The chapter evaluates variety of models, each involving uncertainty in the context of international trade. Uncertainty has many potential roles in microeconomic models of international trade. It creates a rationale for additional markets and hence both added dimensions for potential gains from trade and a plethora of results contingent upon the particular market structure assumed. In addition, uncertainty arises in issues concerning the existence and form of extra market organizations and institutions. The role of uncertainty, and its policy implications, varies both across models of a given typeconsidering the advisibility of free trade with and without complete marketsand across types of models. For some purposes, results are preserved by treating trade and production in equities rather than in the traditional physical commodities. In other areas, the presence of uncertainty increases the possible explanations of market failureconsidering the role of pecuniary externalities with incomplete markets. In addition, uncertainty is linked to the existence and extent of extra market institutions and organizations. The variety of potential models, even within the context of uncertainty and international trade, suggests that it must forgo the comfort of strong conclusions, either positive or normative. The outcome often depends on the extent of markets and/or the extent of extra market institutions, with their implicit patterns of potential externalitiesyet perhaps the justification for the study of international economics is that national boundaries do affect the nature and extent of markets and institutions in many ways.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0>
Chapter 18 The analysis of union behavior ¤ There is a substantial body of economic research, largely theoretical but with a recent empirical component, on the analysis of union behavior. This chapter reviews this literature selectively to place it in perspective so that analysts may begin to answer questions raised by the descriptive research on labor unions and to understand the role that unions play in the economy. It focuses on fitting the existing work into a coherent conceptual framework and on suggesting some directions for further research. The chapter presents a working definition of a labor union and describes the economic modus operandi of labor unions in the American economy. A number of examples of unions in various industries within the United States are presented in the chapter to highlight the role that market and legal/political constraints play in determining the environment within which unions operate.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3>
Chapter 56 Rural Financial Markets in Developing Countries ¤ This review examines portions of the vast literature on rural financial markets and household behavior in the face of risk and uncertainty and limited commitment. In addition to examining household strategies and bilateral contracting we place particular emphasis on studying the important role of financial intermediaries, competition and regulation in shaping the changing structure and organization of rural markets. Our goal is to provide a framework within which the evolution of financial intermediation in rural economies can be understood.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4704302-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5>
Chapter Eighteen. Topological Theories of Social Choice ¤ This chapter presents a simple introduction to the main results in topological social choice theory. Given a continuous social welfare function, these results show the following: (i) Unanimity and Anonymity are incompatible; (ii) Weak Pareto and No Veto are incompatible; and (iii) Weak Pareto implies the existence of a Strategic Manipulator. Given the role of continuity in all these results, its justification is critically discussed. Finally, a remarkable proof of Arrow's theorem using topological methods is presented.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066735-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022393-0>
Chapter 41 Poverty and policy ¤ The structure, efficiency, and growth of production affect (and are affected by) the distribution of consumption. Poverty analysis has three tasks: (1) to define and describe poverty, (2) to understand its causes, and (3) to inform policy. This chapter outlines history of economic thought on poverty since the mercantilists, concentrating on relevance to current economic analysis and policy. It examines how poverty is defined and measured. Evidence from modern household surveys has allowed in the examination of the interactions between demographic, nutritional, and labor-force characteristics of poverty groups. In this process, modern economics is developing some of the central insights of the classical economists, though with measurement and modeling methods not available to them. The chapter discusses the classic development issue of the effect of growth on poverty and inequality, and (the recent classic) macroeconomic adjustment and the poor. It explores several issues that arise in governmental attempts to reduce poverty through direct interventions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213090-6>
Introduction to the Series ¤ The series Handbooks in Economics produces handbooks for various branches of economics, each of which is a definitive source, reference, and teaching supplement for use by professional researchers and advanced graduate students. Each handbook provides self-contained surveys of the current state of a branch of economics in the form of chapters prepared by leading specialists on various aspects of this branch of economics. These surveys summarize not only received results but also newer developments, from recent journal articles and discussion papers. Some original material is also included, but the main goal is to provide comprehensive and accessible surveys.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2>
Chapter 12 Aggregate investment ¤ The 1990s have witnessed a revival in economists' interest and hope of explaining aggregate and microeconomic investment behavior. New theories, better econometric procedures, and more detailed panel data sets are behind this movement. Much of the progress has occurred at the level of microeconomic theories and evidence; however, progress in aggregation and general equilibrium aspects of the investment problem also has been significant. The concept of sunk costs is at the center of modern theories. The implications of these costs for investment go well beyond the neoclassical response to the irreversible-technological friction they represent, for they can also lead to first-order inefficiencies when interacting with informational and contractual problems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8>
Chapter 18. Trade Elasticity Parameters for a Computable General Equilibrium Model ¤ Computable general equilibrium (CGE) models of international trade typically rely on econometrically estimated trade elasticities as model inputs. These elasticities vary by as much as an order of magnitude and there is no consensus on which elasticities to use. We review the literature estimating trade elasticities, focusing on several key considerations. What are the identifying assumptions used to separate supply and demand parameters? What is the nature of the shock to prices employed in the econometrics? And what is the time horizon over which trade responds to this shock? This discussion ranges from older reduced form approaches that use time-series variation in prices, to more recent work that identifies demand elasticities from trade costs or by using instruments in cross-section or panel data, and finally to prominent applications that separately identify supply and demand parameters in the absence of instruments. We also discuss recent theoretical developments from the literature on heterogeneous firms that complicate the interpretation of all these parameter estimates. Finally, we briefly survey a literature on structural estimation and link this to recent attempts to incorporate such theories in CGE applications. By elucidating the differences and similarities in these approaches we hope to guide the CGE practitioner in choosing elasticity estimates. We favor elasticities taken from econometric exercises that employ identifying assumptions and exploit shocks that are similar in nature to those imposed in the model experiment.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065341-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224214-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210294-7>
Chapter 21 Segmented labor markets ¤ The segmented labor market (SLM) approach is typically identified with a group of economists who argue that the neoclassical apparatus provides an inadequate or incomplete description of the labor market and leaves unexplained most of the major labor market policy issues. The SLM literature ranges over a broad spectrum of viewpoints sharing a common hypothesis that labor markets are segmented and that problems of income distribution, unemployment, and discrimination are a result of that segmentation. Some models and research that carry the SLM label are clearly different from neoclassical research. A distinctive feature of SLM research is that it is primarily motivated by concern over policy issues. The chapter describes the SLM model of the internal labor market of the primary sector of the economy and the SLM model of the secondary or low wage sector of the economy. In the chapter, the secondary sector model is analyzed and the findings in the empirical literature that are relevant to the testable hypotheses of the SLM are surveyed.

Chapter 20 Marketing and distribution: Theory and statistical measurement ¤ Agricultural marketing and distribution are broad areas that cover a wide assortment of pricing and market structure issues for agricultural commodities and processed food products. A synthesizing framework is developed in order to discuss the relevant Handbook chapters and an assortment of additional marketing topics. The first two sections of this chapter deal with traditional marketing topics: price forecasts, pricing models that emphasize form, spatial and intertemporal features of a market, and tests of pricing efficiency. A third section is devoted to the rapidly growing area of food-market industrialization, including various aspects of information, the changing role of the consumer, and contracting issues. The last section presents a series of discussions on political and institutional constraints in international commodity marketing such as state trading enterprises, export subsidy programs, case studies of trade disputes, and an analysis of the multinational enterprise.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5>
Chapter 36 Careers in organizations: Theory and evidence ¤ We survey the theoretical literature on careers in organizations, focusing on models that address detailed evidence or stylized facts. We begin with what we call building-block models: human-capital acquisition, job assignment, incentive contracting, efficiency wages, and tournaments. We then show how these building blocks can be combined and enriched to address various aspects of careers. We first focus on applied models aimed at outcomes familiar from labor economics: wage growth in the absence of promotions, promotions used for job assignment, promotions used to provide incentives, and separation. We then consider topics more often discussed in human resource management and organization theory than in labor economics: politics, social relations, and work practices. We end by reviewing three models that address broad patterns of detailed evidence rather than a few stylized facts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127364-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9>
Chapter 38 International Trade Policy and Negotiations ¤ Trade policy has been one of the most important issues in agricultural economics for more than 200 years. Our focus here is on evaluating relatively recent contributions to the understanding of agricultural trade policy and trade agreements. We present some background concerning trade policies and agreements and then consider the economic analysis of these agreements and policies. We concentrate on recent trade agreements, especially the Uruguay Round Agreement of 1994, and on recent analyses of this agreement and other trade policies in agriculture. We conclude by discussing current issues facing trade negotiations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2>
Chapter 17. Health and Inequality ¤ We examine the relationship between income and health with the purpose of establishing the extent to which the distribution of health in a population contributes to income inequality and is itself a product of that inequality. The evidence supports a substantial impact of ill-health on income, mainly operating through employment, although the magnitude of ill-health’s contribution to income inequality is difficult to gauge. Variation in exposure to health risks early in life could be an important mechanism through which health may generate and possibly sustain economic inequality. If material advantage can be exercised within the domain of health, then economic inequality will generate health inequality. In high-income countries, the evidence that income (wealth) does have a causal impact on health in adulthood is weak. But this may simply reflect the difficulty of identifying a relationship that, should it exist, is likely to emerge over a lifetime as poor material living conditions slowly take their toll on health. There is little credible evidence to support the claim that the economic inequality in society threatens the health of all its members or that relative income is a determinant of health.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7>
Chapter 24 Human Capital and Artists' Labour Markets ¤ It is argued that human capital theory applies only weakly to artists' decisions about investment in schooling and training and about occupational choice. However, the same can be said about the sorting model. What is lacking in cultural economics is an understanding of talent and creativity, what economic factors motivate artists and how creativity can be encouraged as part of government cultural policy. Bringing social and cultural capital into the equation do not seem to add much in the way of understanding artists' labour markets. A novel argument is made that the reproducibility of works of art in combination with copyright law alters the established view that human capital cannot be separated from labour, in this case that of the artist.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1>
Chapter 12 Forecasting with Breaks ¤ A structural break is viewed as a permanent change in the parameter vector of a model. Using taxonomies of all sources of forecast errors for both conditional mean and conditional variance processes, we consider the impacts of breaks and their relevance in forecasting models: (a) where the breaks occur after forecasts are announced; and (b) where they occur in-sample and hence pre-forecasting. The impact on forecasts depends on which features of the models are non-constant. Different models and methods are shown to fare differently in the face of breaks. While structural breaks induce an instability in some parameters of a particular model, the consequences for forecasting are specific to the type of break and form of model. We present a detailed analysis for cointegrated VARs, given the popularity of such models in econometrics. We also consider the detection of breaks, and how to handle breaks in a forecasting context, including ad hoc forecasting devices and the choice of the estimation period. Finally, we contrast the impact of structural break non-constancies with non-constancies due to non-linearity. The main focus is on macro-economic, rather than finance, data, and on forecast biases, rather than higher moments. Nevertheless, we show the relevance of some of the key results for variance processes. An empirical exercise ‘forecasts’ UK unemployment after three major historical crises.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047390-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8>
Chapter 15 Anomalies and market efficiency ¤ Anomalies are empirical results that seem to be inconsistent with maintained theories of asset-pricing behavior. They indicate either market inefficiency (profit opportunities) or inadequacies in the underlying asset-pricing model. After they are documented and analyzed in the academic literature, anomalies often seem to disappear, reverse, or attenuate. This raises the question of whether profit opportunities existed in the past, but have since been arbitraged away, or whether the anomalies were simply statistical aberrations that attracted the attention of academics and practitioners. One of the interesting findings from the empirical work in this chapter is that many of the well-known anomalies in the finance literature do not hold up in different sample periods. In particular, the size effect and the value effect seem to have disappeared after the papers that highlighted them were published. At about the same time, practitioners began investment vehicles that implemented the strategies implied by the academic papers. The weekend effect and the dividend yield effect also seem to have lost their predictive power after the papers that made them famous were published. In these cases, however, I am not aware of any practitioners who have tried to use these anomalies as a major basis of their investment strategy. The small-firm turn-of-the-year effect became weaker in the years after it was first documented in the academic literature, although there is some evidence that it still exists. Interestingly, however, it does not seem to exist in the portfolio returns of practitioners who focus on small-capitalization firms. Likewise, the evidence that stock market returns are predictable using variables such as dividend yields or inflation is much weaker in the periods after the papers that documented these findings were published. All of these findings raise the possibility that anomalies are more apparent than real. The notoriety associated with the findings of unusual evidence tempts authors to further investigate puzzling anomalies and later to try to explain them. But even if the anomalies existed in the sample period in which they were first identified, the activities of practitioners who implement strategies to take advantage of anomalous behavior can cause the anomalies to disappear (as research findings cause the market to become more efficient).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269795-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4508395-2>
Chapter 1. The Principal Problem in Political Economy: Income Distribution in the History of Economic Thought ¤ This chapter considers the history of theories of income distribution, from the time of Adam Smith until the 1970s. It is divided into two main parts. Part I considers the positive theory of income distribution, beginning with the classical economists’ analysis of the functional distribution of income between wages, profits, and rent. It goes on to present the new theories that emerged with the marginalist revolution and which were based on maximizing behavior and market equilibrium. The main focus during the early stages of the new developments was on the markets for consumer goods and the role of marginal utility in price determination. The later neoclassical economists, including Alfred Marshall and Knut Wicksell, paid more attention to the special features that characterized the labor market and the role of marginal productivity in wage formation. In the twentieth century, the neoclassical theory was extended to include analysis of the role of imperfect competition, human capital, and risk-taking. Also included in this part of the chapter is a discussion of statistical and institutional approaches. Part II covers normative theories of income distribution and their implications for redistributive policy. It begins with a consideration of the value judgments implicit in the policy recommendations of the classical economists and continues with the attempts to establish an analytical foundation for welfare economics. The rise of Paretian welfare theory with its emphasis on the impossibility of interpersonal comparisons of utility made it difficult to draw conclusions regarding income redistribution, but the older utilitarian approach, including equal sacrifice theories, continued to live on in the modern analysis of optimal redistribution. A short Part III contains some concluding reflections on the position of income distribution theory within economics as a whole.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7>
Chapter 2. Structural Estimation in Urban Economics ¤ Structural estimation is a methodological approach in empirical economics explicitly based on economic theory, in which economic modeling, estimation, and empirical analysis are required to be internally consistent. This chapter illustrates the structural approach with three applications in urban economics: (1) discrete location choice, (2) fiscal competition and local public good provision, and (3) regional specialization. For each application, we first discuss broad methodological principles of model selection and development. Next we treat issues of identification and estimation. The final step of each discussion is how estimated structural models can be used for policy analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4239568-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1>
Chapter 15 National Policies and Economic Growth: A Reappraisal ¤ The new growth literature, using both endogenous growth and neoclassical models, has generated strong claims for the effect of national policies on economic growth. Empirical work on policies and growth has tended to confirm these claims. This paper casts doubt on this claim for strong effects of national policies, pointing out that such effects are inconsistent with several stylized facts and seem to depend on extreme observations in growth regressions. More modest effects of policy are consistent with theoretical models that feature substitutability between the formal and informal sector, have a large share for the informal sector, or stress technological change rather than factor accumulation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059252-2>
The incidence of carbon pricing : Norway, Russia and the Middle East ¤ Russia, Norway and the Middle East are three regions that have distinct histories in energy policies. Current situations will make it more challenging for Russia and the Middle East to implement greenhouse gas abatement than it will be for Norway, even though all three are major energy producers. Relative to the world as a whole, Russia is most heavily impacted, with the Middle East less so but still significantly affected. Norway’s potential economic loss is only a little larger than the world average. This asymmetry implies that if the differences in impacts are not broadly understood, then international negotiations may be subjected to bargaining under asymmetric information. If so, they may not be able to reach agreement. The result reported here is thus a step in overcoming information asymmetries and facilitating successful negotiation. The results also have clear implications for the speed at which Russia undertakes energy market reforms, and for the manner in which Middle Eastern countries implement diversification of their economies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2>
Chapter Twenty-Three. Welfarism, Individual Rights, and Procedural Fairness ¤ Ever since Sen crystallized the logical conflict between the welfaristic value of the Pareto principle and the nonwelfaristic value of individual libertarian rights into what he christened the impossibility of a Paretian liberal , there have been many attempts in social choice theory to generalize, or to repudiate, the conflict between welfare and rights. This chapter focuses on this logical conflict and tries to find a way of balancing these two important values in human well-being. We will identify three issues in this line of research, viz., the formal articulation of rights , the social realization of rights , and the initial conferment of rights . We will also examine the sustainability of Sen's concept of individual rights and examine the game form articulation of individual rights as a viable alternative to Sen's proposed concept.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066735-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022393-0>
Chapter 8. Bestsellers and Blockbusters: Movies, Music, and Books ¤ This chapter is a survey on the economics of blockbusters and bestsellers in popular entertainment and culture, with a particular focus on empirical methods and applications to movies, music, and books. We first survey various conceptual models on the economics of superstars and the winner-take-all nature of product success. We then survey the range of statistical methodologies that can be used to quantify formally the winner-take-all nature of the distribution of success while estimating the correlates of success across competing titles. In separate subsections for movies, music, and books, we survey the empirical literature that relates to the blockbuster phenomenon. The final section discusses specific current topics related to the distribution of success, focusing on issues that appear to be fruitful areas for future research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4>
Chapter 70 The Changing Context and Prospects for Agricultural and Rural Development in Africa ¤ Over the past decade, economic and agricultural growth in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has resumed. The secular downward trend in agricultural prices ended in the early 1990s; growing incomes in Asia and Africa, combined with continued rapid population growth, are fueling food demand, which is expected to lead to a gradual upward trend in international real agricultural prices. For Africa the major agricultural growth opportunities will be in regional and domestic markets for food staples. To seize these opportunities, SSA will have to support economic growth via continued sound macroeconomic policies, further improvements in the investment climate, and investments in infrastructure and institutions. In the agricultural sector SSA will have to (1) remove the remaining agricultural taxation that still disadvantages African farmers relative to all other farmers in the world, (2) improve its services for small farmers, (3) significantly increase its investment in agricultural technology generation and dissemination at national and subregional levels, (4) empower local governments, communities, and farmer organizations for their own development via further administrative and fiscal decentralization and community-driven development, and (5) strengthen the already existing regional agricultural institutions for agricultural trade, biosafety, phytosanitary regulations, seed production, regulation and trade, and technology generation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4704302-7>
Chapter 66 Learning and Equilibrium in Games ¤ This chapter describes a very general approach to learning in games: experience-weighted attraction (EWA) learning. This approach strives to explain, for every choice in an experiment, how that choice arose from players' previous behavior and experience, using a general model which can be applied to most games with minimal customization and which predicts well out of sample. Sophisticated EWA includes important equilibrium concepts and many other learning models as special cases. The model therefore allows one- stop shopping for learning about the latest statistical comparisons of many different learning and equilibrium models . The model can also be adapted to field applications in which strategies and payoffs are often poorly-specified. The EWA model presented is a simplification (as are all the other adaptive models) because it does not permit players to anticipate learning by others. Omitting anticipation logically implies that players do not use information about the payoffs of other players, and that whether players are matched together repeatedly or randomly re-matched should not matter.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1>
Chapter 7. The Economics of Tracking in Education ¤ Tracking refers to the practice of dividing students by ability or achievement. Students may be tracked within schools by placing them into different classrooms based on achievement, which is the typical practice in countries such as the United States or Canada. Alternatively, students could be streamed into different schools, with either vocational or academic emphases, as has been practiced commonly in Europe. Proponents of tracking argue that tracking can increase the efficiency of schooling by focusing on the needs of distinct groups of students. Opponents' main concerns relate to perpetuating and aggravating inequality. Evaluating effects of tracking on average student achievement and the distribution of achievement is difficult, in part because of variations from study to study and from country to country in the characteristics of the tracking system. Early work, largely in the United States and Britain, used variation across and within schools, and often found that tracking increased inequality in achievement. But more recent work in the United States has questioned these findings, suggesting that careful attention to endogenous placement of students into classrooms and endogenous use of tracking across schools changes results dramatically. Experimental studies on within-school tracking in the United States have produced mixed results, and one experiment in Kenya suggests that tracking can boost the achievement of both low-achieving and high-achieving students. A large body of work now uses geographical variation across regions, countries, grades, and time to identify the effects of tracking. These studies for the most part suggest that tracking aggravates inequality in outcomes. These results are fairly strong, and may be identifying the more dramatic effects that obtain when students are separated into vocational schools and more academically oriented schools, as opposed to the effects of within-school tracking. The paper concludes with an outline of how future research might better categorize and rigorously evaluate the real-world nuances of tracking.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2>
Chapter 6 The cost of children and the use of demographic variables in consumer demand ¤ This chapter describes various methods on the elusive concept of the cost of children. At starvation level, there does not seem to be a specific cost level that can be identified as the costs. Traditional estimates define material needs at a minimum level, which are priced, and add up to cost. The choice of these inputs, especially for nonfood, is arbitrary. The imputation of joint costs and scale effects is an unsolved problem. The more sophisticated method based on food shares tends to overestimate the cost ratios, because it does not account for fixed costs. The adult goods method tends to underestimate for similar reasons. The scales based on demand behavior, estimated on complete-demand systems, seem more hopeful, but Pollak and Wales state that demand behavior does not give a valuable result either. Subjective estimators seem to overcome these difficulties. They are not based on any economic modeling, but just on the registration of opinions, where it is postulated that verbal labels have a common meaning for all respondents.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123185-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006292-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006294-6>
Chapter 8. School Accountability ¤ School accountability—the process of evaluating school performance on the basis of student performance measures—is increasingly prevalent around the world. In the United States, accountability has become a centerpiece of both Democratic and Republican federal administrations' education policies. This chapter reviews the theory of school-based accountability, describes variations across programs, and identifies key features influencing the effectiveness and possible unintended consequences of accountability policies. The chapter then summarizes the research literature on the effects of test-based accountability on students and teachers, concluding that the preponderance of evidence suggests positive effects of the accountability movement in the United States during the 1990s and early 2000s on student achievement, especially in math. The effects on teachers and on students' long-run outcomes are more difficult to judge. It is also clear that school personnel respond to accountability in both positive and negative ways, and that accountability systems run the risk of being counter-productive if not carefully thought out and monitored.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2>
Chapter 30 Price Bubbles ¤ This chapter reports the results of laboratory asset markets in which each trader receives an initial portfolio of cash and shares of a security with an earnings life of 15 trading periods. Each trader is free to trade shares of the security using double auction trading rules. At the end of the experiment, a sum equal to all dividends received on shares, plus initial cash plus capital gains minus capital losses is paid in U.S. currency to the trader. The baseline experiments have individual traders endowed with different initial portfolios. A common characteristic of first-period trading is that buyers tend to be those with low share endowments, while sellers are those with relatively high share endowments. This suggests that risk-averse traders might be using the market to acquire more balanced portfolios. If liquidity preference accounts for the low initial prices, which in turn lead to expectations of price increases, then making the initial trader endowments equal across subjects would tend to dampen bubbles.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1>
Chapter 19 Temporary General Equilibrium Theory ¤ Traditional general equilibrium theory has, for a long time, studied an economic model that is essentially static, where the agent's expectations are self-fulfilling and the equilibrium is achieved solely by the price system. The chapter presents the conceptual framework underlying temporary equilibrium models. This chapter discusses the central role played by an agent's expectations in his or her decision-making process. This model is the microeconomic foundation of the whole theory. A few models using the temporary competitive equilibrium method are also studied in the chapter. It is postulated that prices move fast enough in each period to match supply and demand. The first problem studied is the issue of the existence of an equilibrium in asset markets that is very important in any theory of financial markets. In the framework of a simple model, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a competitive equilibrium in asset markets is some partial agreement among economic agents concerning expected future spot prices of these assets. The chapter studies the temporary equilibrium with the quantity rationing method and to the possible contributions of this approach to the theory of employment and inflation. The basic axiom of this approach is that in the short run, quantities adjust infinitely faster than prices. One is thus led to study a model where prices are temporarily fixed in each period and equilibrium is achieved by quantity rationing. The chapter also presents an evaluation of the equilibrium concepts used in this area.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066472-7>
Subject Index of Volume 2 ¤ This chapter lists the important subjects that are discussed in Volume 2 of Handbook of the Economics of Giving, Altruism and Reciprocity , such as access to land, common pool, giving clubs, economic inequality, transfers, money supply, public education, and others.

Thinking beyond Basel III : Necessary Solutions for Capital and Liquidity ¤ In previous studies, the OECD has identified the main hallmarks of the crisis as too-big-to-fail institutions that took on too much risk; insolvency resulting from contagion and counterparty risk; the lack of regulatory and supervisory integration; and the lack of efficient resolution regimes. This article looks at how the Basel III proposals address these issues, helping to reduce the chance of another crisis like the current one. The Basel III capital proposals have some very useful elements, notably a leverage ratio, a capital buffer and the proposal to deal with pro-cyclicality through dynamic provisioning based on expected losses. However, this report also identifies some major concerns. For example, Basel III does not properly address the most fundamental regulatory problem that the “promises” that make up any financial system are not treated equally. This issue has many implications for the reform process, including reform of the structure of the supervision and regulation process and whether the shadow banking system should be incorporated into the regulatory framework – and, if so, how. Finally, modifications in the overall riskweighted asset framework are suggested that would deal with concentration issues.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Chapter 49 Social Distance and Reciprocity in Dictator Games ¤ This chapter defines various social distances as the degree of reciprocity that people believe is inherent within a social interaction. The greater the social distance, or isolation, between a person and others, the weaker is the scope for reciprocal relations. This chapter conjecture that the FHSS-V treatment defines a minimal increase in the social distance between proposer and recipient, as compared with the FHSS-R treatment. At the other pole, which we use to define the maximal social distance, the experiment is operated double blind, meaning that the procedures make it evident to all subjects that the experimenter, who makes and retains no record of the data by subject name, and any person who subsequently sees the data, can never know who made what decision. The objective of this procedure is to remove all social context in a manner that is transparent to the subjects.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Chapter 4. Executive Compensation: Where We Are, and How We Got There ¤ In this study, I summarize the current state of executive compensation, discuss measurement and incentive issues, document recent trends in executive pay in both U.S. and international firms, and analyze the evolution of executive pay over the past century. Most recent analyses of executive compensation have focused on efficient-contracting or managerial-power rationales for pay, while ignoring or downplaying the causes and consequences of disclosure requirements, tax policies, accounting rules, legislation, and the general political climate. A major theme of this study is that government intervention has been both a response to and a major driver of time trends in executive compensation over the past century, and that any explanation for pay that ignores political factors is critically incomplete.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269795-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4508395-2>
Chapter 26. Changes in the Wage Structure and Earnings Inequality ¤ This chapter presents a framework for understanding changes in the wage structure and overall earnings inequality. The framework emphasizes the role of supply and demand factors and the interaction of market forces and labor market institutions. Recent changes in the US wage structure are analyzed in detail to highlight crucial measurement issues that arise in studying wage structure changes and to illustrate the operation of the supply-demand-institution framework. The roles of skill-biased technological change, globalization forces, changes in demographics and relative skill supplies, industry labor rents, unions, and the minimum wage in the evolution of the US wage structure are examined. Recent wage structure changes are placed in a longer-term historical perspective, and differences and similarities in wage structure changes among OECD nations are assessed. 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

How competitive is product market regulation in India? : An international and cross-state comparison ¤ This paper assesses the extent to which India's regulatory environment promotes or inhibits competition in markets where technology and market conditions make competition viable. The analysis is based on the OECD’s indicators of Product Market Regulation (PMR) which have been used extensively over the last decade to benchmark regulatory frameworks in OECD countries and have proven useful in encouraging countries to implement structural reforms that enhance economic performance.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2>
Chapter 4 Litigation ¤ The purpose of this chapter is to survey the academic literature on the economics of litigation and to synthesize its main themes. The chapter begins by introducing the basic economic framework for studying litigation and out-of-court settlement. One set of issues addressed is positive (or descriptive) in nature. Under what conditions will someone decide to file suit? What determines how much is spent on a lawsuit? When do cases settle out of court? Important normative issues are also addressed. Are the litigation decisions made by private parties in the interest of society as a whole? Next, the chapter surveys some of the more active areas in the litigation literature. Topics include rules of evidence, loser-pays rules, appeals, contingent fees for attorneys, alternative dispute resolution, class actions, and plea bargaining.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117663-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066510-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135492-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048737-4>
Chapter 2. The Advertising-Financed Business Model in Two-Sided Media Markets ¤ This chapter focuses on the economic mechanisms at work in recent models of advertising finance in media markets developed around the concept of two-sided markets. The objective is to highlight new and original insights from this approach, and to clarify the conceptual aspects. The chapter first develops a canonical model of two-sided markets for advertising, where platforms deliver content to consumers and resell their “attention” to advertisers. A key distinction is drawn between free media and pay media, where the former result from the combination of valuable consumer attention and low ad-nuisance cost. The first part discusses various conceptual issues such as equilibrium concepts and the nature of inefficiencies in advertising markets, and concrete issues such as congestion and second-degree discrimination. The second part is devoted to recent contributions on issues arising when consumers patronize multiple platforms. In this case, platforms can only charge incremental values to advertisers, which reduce their market power and affect their price strategies and advertising levels. The last part discusses the implications of the two-sided nature of the media markets for the choice of content and diversity.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129410-5>
Chapter 11 The Arts in the “New Economy” ¤ The revolutionary growth in economic prosperity and technological change that underlie the “new economy” have profoundly affected the arts. They have evidently contributed new and previously unimaginable methods of dissemination and preservation. But they have even had revolutionary effects on goals and standards. They have substantially affected training. These developments also raise profound problems for financial support and pricing. The paper characterizes these developments and suggests the nature of the relationships. It also provides a brief discussion of relevant pricing principles dealing with the trade-off between encouragement of creativity and facilitation of dissemination.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4>
Competition Law and Policy in Switzerland ¤ Swiss competition policy has traditionally been relatively lenient and low profile. The impact of competition policy on economic development has therefore been at best neutral. As the slow rate of growth becomes an issue, however, a more vigorous approach to competition has been identified as an important factor for improving growth prospects. The 2003 reform of the Cartel Act strengthened Swiss competition law, in particular by introducing direct sanctions for the most serious infringements and a leniency programme, thus bringing it closer to that of the European Union and of many other OECD countries. The Swiss Competition Commission has been given considerable new powers to combat private restraints of competition. Comco will have to enforce the new laws resolutely and step up action to promote regulatory reforms. In doing so, it is burdened by institutional arrangements and mechanisms that temper its full independence. The Swiss competition enforcers do not benefit from the networks of exchanges available to national competition authorities in EU member States. Matters are further complicated by a relative lack of resources. Strengthening competition is key for an effective internal market. The amendments to strengthen the Cartel Law and pending reform proposals signal determination on the part of the Confederation to tackle the problems. This report served as the basis for a peer review in the Competition Committee in 2005.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9>
Competition Law and Policy in the European Union ¤ Competition policy played a central role in the development of the EU and its institutions. The European Commission, supported by the European courts, developed the framework for competition policy in Europe. This framework has been built since the Treaty of Rome in 1957 on a foundation of promoting market opening while strengthening the institutions of the European Community. The competition policy of the European Community is now in transition toward a basis in market-centered economic considerations, as well as on application through the now-extensive network of national-level authorities. The “modernisation” reforms of the enforcement process became effective in May 2004, along with changes in the control of mergers, and the Commission has been considering revisions to its policies about other topics, notably abuse of dominance and state aid. As the Member States adapt their substantive rules to those of the Community, the roles of the European Commission, the national competition agencies and the courts are changing. Co-ordination of enforcement among many agencies in the European Community, particularly concerning applications for leniency as part of cartel investigations, is increasingly important. The Commission moved to strengthen its capacity for economic analysis and to correct weaknesses in its decision process that had been revealed in critical court decisions. The challenge to this system, well adapted for administrative application, is to produce results that are convincing to the courts while maintaining policy consistency in a system of decentralised enforcement. This report served as the basis for a peer review in the Competition Committee in 2005.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7>
Chapter 20. Wanting Robustness in Macroeconomics ¤ Robust control theory is a tool for assessing decision rules when a decision maker distrusts either the specification of transition laws or the distribution of hidden state variables or both. Specification doubts inspire the decision maker to want a decision rule to work well for a ∅ of models surrounding his approximating stochastic model. We relate robust control theory to the so-called multiplier and constraint preferences that have been used to express ambiguity aversion. Detection error probabilities can be used to discipline empirically plausible amounts of robustness. We describe applications to asset pricing uncertainty premia and design of robust macroeconomic policies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2>
Chapter 36 Antitrust Policy toward Horizontal Mergers ¤ Recently there has been a notable increase in interest in antitrust law in much of the world. This chapter discusses antitrust policy toward horizontal mergers, the area of antitrust that has seen some of the most dramatic improvements in both economic tools and the application of economics in enforcement practice. The chapter discusses theoretical considerations, merger laws and enforcement practices, econometric methods for analyzing prospective horizontal mergers, and evidence concerning the ex post effects of actual horizontal mergers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133311-1>
Chapter 7 Theories of the distribution of earnings ¤ Several empirical regularities motivate most theories of the distribution of labor earnings. Earnings distributions tend to be skewed to the right and display long right tails. Mean earnings always exceed median earnings and the top percentiles of earners account for quite a disproportionate share of total earnings. Mean earnings also differ greatly across groups defined by occupation, education, experience, and other observed traits. With respect to the evolution of the distribution of earnings for a given cohort, initial earnings dispersion is smaller than the dispersion observed in prime working years. We explore several models that address these stylized facts. Stochastic theories examine links between assumptions about the distribution of endowments and implied features of earnings distributions given assumptions about the processes that translate endowments into earnings. Selection models describe how workers choose a career. Because workers select their best option from a menu of possible careers, their allocation decisions tend to generate skewed earnings distributions. Sorting models illustrate this process in an environment where workers learn about their endowments and therefore adjust their allocation decisions over time. Human capital theory demonstrates that earnings dispersion is a prerequisite for significant skill investments. Without earnings dispersion, workers would not willingly make the investments necessary for high-skill jobs. Human capital models illustrate how endowments of wealth and talent influence the investment decisions that generate observed distributions of earnings. Agency models illustrate how wage structures may determine rather than reflect worker productivity. Tournament theory addresses the long right tails of wage distributions within firms. Efficiency wage models address differences in wages across employments that involve different monitoring technologies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013887-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7>
The Evolution of Homeownership Rates in Selected OECD Countries: Demographic and Public Policy Influences ¤ Homeownership rates have increased significantly in many OECD countries over recent decades. Using micro-econometric decomposition techniques, this paper shows that part of this increase can be explained by changes in the characteristics of households, including age, household structure, income and education. Nevertheless, a significant portion of the change in homeownership rates remains unexplained by shifts in household characteristics, leaving a potential role for public policy in explaining developments in homeownership rates. Panel estimates suggest that the relaxation of down-payment constraints on mortgage loans has increased homeownership rates among credit-constrained households over recent decades, resulting in a rise in the aggregate homeownership rate that is comparable with the impact of population ageing. In countries where tax relief on mortgage debt financing is generous, however, the expansionary impact of mortgage market innovations on homeownership is smaller. This is consistent with the tendency for such housing tax relief to be capitalised into real house prices, which may crowd-out some financially constrained households from homeownership at the margin. The impact of housing policies regulating the functioning of the rental market, such as rent regulation and provisions for tenure security, on tenure choice is also explored. JEL classification: R21, R31, G21, H24. Keywords: Housing markets, homeownership, mortgage markets, financial regulation, taxation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2>
Chapter 40 Policy lessons from development experience since the Second World War ¤ This chapter presents the evolution of thought regarding development policy and the evidence that challenged development thinking. The chapter focuses on the interaction between experience with development policy and development thought, as a prelude to the more detailed studies of individual aspects of economic policy and experience that follow. The chapter starts with the ideas and thinking that underlay the initial formulation of development policy. The overriding influence of the experience with early development policies is a major factor affecting policies and thinking about development and as such is important in its own right. The experience of developing countries, both the success stories (primarily in East Asia) and the stories of those countries whose growth stalled in the 1980s, is reviewed in the chapter with respect to the influence of success or failure on policy formulation. The theory and evidence regarding alternative strategies to undertake policy reform are reviewed in the chapter. The coherence of policy and the political economy of economic policy formulation and execution are also addressed in the chapter.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213090-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7>
Chapter 34 Success and Failure in Defense Conversion in the ‘Long Decade of Disarmament’ ¤ The ‘long decade of disarmament’ between the mid-1980s and the late 1990s provides ample evidence of the effects of a substantial defense downturn. The chapter starts out with a brief discussion of various concepts of conversion, focusing on a resource-reuse perspective. This is followed by sections on measuring success and failure in the conversion of resources and putting such measures into the perspectives of broader economic theories of change and growth. The body of the chapter is a review of the analytical and comparative literature analyzing the benefits and costs of the reuse of six types of resources, namely government spending, military research and development facilities, defense production facilities, armed forces and defense industry personnel, military land and military equipment, including chemical weapons and nuclear material. The chapter concludes with a brief analysis of various government policies aiming at improving the rate of success of conversion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134192-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063255-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132793-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065004-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134037-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115806-4>
Chapter 18 The Media and Advertising: A Tale of Two-Sided Markets ¤ Media industries are important drivers of popular culture. A large fraction of leisure time is devoted to radio, magazines, newspapers, the Internet, and television (the illustrative example henceforth). Most advertising expenditures are incurred for these media. They are also mainly supported by advertising revenue. Early work stressed possible market failures in program duplication and catering to the Lowest Common Denominator, indicating lack of cultural diversity and quality. The business model for most media industries is underscored by advertisers' demand to reach prospective customers. This business model has important implications for performance in the market since viewer sovereignty is indirect. Viewers are attracted by programming, though they dislike the ads it carries, and advertisers want viewers as potential consumers. The two sides are coordinated by broadcasters (or “platforms”) that choose ad levels and program types, and advertising finances the programming. Competition for viewers of the demographics most desired by advertisers implies that programming choices will be biased towards the tastes of those with such demographics. The ability to use subscription pricing may help improve performance by catering to the tastes of those otherwise under-represented, though higher full prices tend to favor broadcasters at the expense of viewers and advertisers. If advertising demand is weak, program equilibrium program selection may be too extreme as broadcasters strive to avoid ruinous subscription price competition, but strong advertising demand may lead to strong competition for viewers and hence minimum differentiation (“la pensée unique”). Markets (such as newspapers) with a high proportion of ad-lovers may be served only by monopoly due to a circulation spiral: advertisers want to place ads in the paper with most readers, but readers want to buy the paper with more ads.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1>
Income Distribution and Poverty in the OECD Area : Trends and Driving Forces ¤ This article uses internationally-comparable data on the distribution of income across households to identify some well-founded facts to replace the conjecture and supposition which too often dominate discussions on inequality and poverty. There has been a general trend in nearly all OECD countries towards increased market income (earnings and income from capital) inequality between the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s. However, in a significant minority of countries this has not resulted in higher levels of inequality because either the amounts distributed through the tax and transfer system have increased, or because it has become more progressive. Changes in income distribution in the past ten years generally favoured the prime-age and elderly age groups, particularly those around retirement age. Relative income levels of single parents are very low and have worsened in a number of countries. Trends in earned income, and in particular trends in employment, are found to be crucial in explaining these changes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2>
Chapter 50 Understanding Political Corruption in Low Income Countries ¤ Building on the large and growing empirical literature on the political behavior of individuals in low income countries, this Chapter seeks to understand corruption through the lens of political economy – particularly in terms of the political and economic differences between rich and poor countries. Our focus is on the political behavior of individuals exposed to democratic political institutions. We review the existing literature on the determinants of individual political behavior to ask whether we can understand the choice of political actors to be corrupt and, importantly, of other individuals to permit it, as a rational response to the social or the economic environment they inhabit. We also discuss the implications of this view of corruption for anti-corruption policies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213090-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7>
Chapter 6. Immigrants and Immigrant Health ¤ Using the National Health Interview Survey (1989–2011), we document the Healthy Immigrant Effect (HIE)—immigrants are in better health upon arrival in the United States than their native counterparts, but this health advantage erodes over time—irrespective of the health measure, race/ethnicity, or gender. Further, most immigrant groups arrive lighter than natives and then converge towards their native counterparts, suggesting acculturation plays a role in explaining the HIE. Finally, we show that constraining the period effects to be the same for natives and immigrants may lead one to conclude there is no evidence of unhealthy assimilation, particularly if the rates at which natives and immigrants are becoming unhealthy differ from each other and change across time periods.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4501977-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069332-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0>
Chapter 40 Common knowledge ¤ This chapter presents some of the implications for economic behavior of the hypotheses that events, actions, optimization, and rationality are common knowledge. The main conclusion is that an apparently innocuous assumption of common knowledge rules out speculation, betting, and agreeing to disagree. Knowledge and interactive knowledge are central elements in economic theory. Common knowledge is the limit of a potentially infinite chain of reasoning about knowledge. Public events are the most obvious candidates for common knowledge. But events that the agents create themselves, such as the rules of a game or contract, can also plausibly be seen as common knowledge. Certain beliefs about human nature might also be taken to be common knowledge. Economists are especially interested, for example, in the consequences of the hypothesis that it is common knowledge that all agents are optimizers. It often occurs that after lengthy conversations or observations, what people are going to do is common knowledge, although the reasons for their actions may be difficult to disentangle.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8>
Chapter 2. Advances in Zero-Sum Dynamic Games ¤ The survey presents recent results in the theory of two-person zero-sum repeated games and their connections with differential and continuous-time games. The emphasis is made on the following (1) A general model allows to deal simultaneously with stochastic and informational aspects. (2) All evaluations of the stage payoffs can be covered in the same framework (and not only the usual Cesàro and Abel means). (3) The model in discrete time can be seen and analyzed as a discretization of a continuous time game. Moreover, tools and ideas from repeated games are very fruitful for continuous time games and vice versa. (4) Numerous important conjectures have been answered (some in the negative). (5) New tools and original models have been proposed. As a consequence, the field (discrete versus continuous time, stochastic versus incomplete information models) has a much more unified structure, and research is extremely active.

Chapter 37 Reciprocity and Contract Enforcement ¤ This chapter reports the results of experiments that were designed to test the effectiveness of reciprocity as a contract enforcement device. It turns out that reciprocity generates a significant increase in effort levels relative to the prediction based on selfish preferences. Moreover, it gives rise to a considerable mitigation of the contract enforcement problem. The impact of reciprocity is particularly strong if both parties have possibilities to reciprocate. Hence, reciprocity can lead to considerable efficiency gains for the contracting parties. These results indicate that models that neglect reciprocity are likely to make wrong predictions and are, thus, seriously incomplete as a basis for normative advice.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1>
Chapter 1 Bayesian Forecasting ¤ Bayesian forecasting is a natural product of a Bayesian approach to inference. The Bayesian approach in general requires explicit formulation of a model, and conditioning on known quantities, in order to draw inferences about unknown ones. In Bayesian forecasting, one simply takes a subset of the unknown quantities to be future values of some variables of interest. This chapter presents the principles of Bayesian forecasting, and describes recent advances in computational capabilities for applying them that have dramatically expanded the scope of applicability of the Bayesian approach. It describes historical developments and the analytic compromises that were necessary prior to recent developments, the application of the new procedures in a variety of examples, and reports on two long-term Bayesian forecasting exercises.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047390-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8>
Chapter 31. Fiscal Multipliers: Liquidity Traps and Currency Unions ¤ We provide explicit solutions for government spending multipliers during a liquidity trap and within a fixed exchange regime using standard closed and open-economy New Keynesian models. We confirm the potential for large multipliers during liquidity traps. For a currency union, we show that self-financed multipliers are small, always below unity, unless the accompanying tax adjustments involve substantial static redistribution from low to high marginal propensity to consume agents, or dynamic redistribution from future to present non-Ricardian agents. But outside-financed multipliers which require no domestic tax adjustment can be large, especially when the average marginal propensity to consume on domestic goods is high or when government spending shocks are very persistent. Our solutions are relevant for local and national multipliers, providing insight into the economic mechanisms at work as well as the testable implications of these models.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Chapter 19 Child health in developed countries ¤ This chapter provides an overview of the literature on child health in developed countries. I first lay out a simple economic model of the demand for child health inputs, and discuss whether the evidence is consistent with that model. Next, two main causes of market failure in the market for child health inputs — lack of information and externalities — are analyzed. These failures may provide an economic rationale for government intervention in the market for health care. Much of the literature on child health has focused on one such intervention, the provision of public health insurance. However, the utilization of health care is only one input into the production of child health, and it is far from the most important input for most children. Hence, the last section of this chapter offers a brief review of what we know about the effects of government interventions designed to address other threats to child health. The chapter concludes with some opinions about useful direction for future research and data collection efforts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Chapter 4 Home production — A survey ¤ The chapter presents a survey on home production. The terminology of the theory of home production has been used to extend economic analysis to such diverse fields as family formation (marriage and divorce), fertility decisions, and involvement in illegal activities. It has been adapted to re-examine the demand for health, the demand for travel and transport choice, and more. Many of these applications have expanded to become research fields in their own right (for example, the economics of the family, the economics of fertility, and the economics of crime). This survey focuses on home production in its narrower definition, discussing inputs, shadow prices, production technology, and other aspects of the home production process. The theory of home production cannot escape the limitations of traditional consumption theory as the outputs (that is, the commodities) are unobserved. Any empirical investigation based on this theory is therefore confined to the study of inputs, that is, changes in their level and mix as a result of changes in output, prices, and productivity. Moreover, the study of inputs is hampered by the fact that data on inputs are not readily available, the output (as mentioned) cannot be measured directly, and prices (specifically the price of time) are unknown. In an extreme case, work at home and work in the market are perfect substitutes-a person is indifferent to the composition of the goods and services he consumes, whether they are produced at home or purchased in the market.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3>
Chapter 2 The Empirical Analysis of Transfer Motives ¤ The empirical economic literature covers many different forms of pro-social behaviour going from anonymous charitable contributions to caring for an ageing parent or buying Christmas gifts. The chapter focuses on the meta-questions concerning the motivations underlying this behaviour. While the public goods-model of altruism has played a pivotal role in the economic work, the discussion in the chapter is structured around a simple list of motivations, derived from the psychological literature. Altruism (or empathy) is only one of the many motivations leading to voluntary transfers. Transfers may also follow from a feeling of duty or because the donor wants to obey social norms. They may be part of reciprocal arrangements, which finally are in the self-interest of all the parties involved. They may reflect pure materialistic egoism or a desire to gain social prestige. The survey of the empirical literature makes a distinction between one-way transfers where there is no real social interaction between the donor and the recipient and two-way transfers, i.e. interpersonal gifts that take place in a non-anonymous setting. The former refer to contributions of money and time to charities, the latter refer to interhousehold and intrafamily transfers. It is argued that the simple oppositions between pure altruism and warm glow or between altruism and exchange are insufficient, and that we should more explicitly think about how to distinguish the different warm glow or exchange-interpretations from one another. Traditional economic methods of indirect testing for motivational differences will probably be insufficient for this task. A better insight into the different motivations for pro-social behaviour is important for its own sake. It is also necessary for understanding the consequences of government intervention (the crowding-out effect) or the behaviour of charities.

Chapter 73. Investment in Education: Inputs and Incentives ¤ From the point of view of economic development, education is the acquisition of knowledge and skills through experiences from conception onwards over the life cycle that increase productivity broadly defined. Education can occur through, but is not limited to, formal educational activities such as preschool programs, schools, and formal training programs. The proximate determinants of education are experiences or inputs into knowledge and skills production functions. Within a dynamic forward-looking model of human capital investments, these experiences are determined sequentially by a series of family or individual decisions given past, current and expected future resources, markets, policies, and other institutions. The context in which these microinvestment demands are made, in turn, reflects decisions of suppliers of services that are explicitly related to education as well as of options that may be importantly related to education through other experiences, such as in labor markets. To understand the nature of inputs and incentives related to education in developing countries, attention must be paid to both the demand and the supply sides for investments in education, both of which are conditioned significantly by policy choices. Therefore, there are numerous important policy questions related to educational inputs and incentives. What are critical inputs into different educational processes? How important are various incentives for improving these inputs? How effective are various demand-side policies versus supply-side policies? How important are policies that have direct impact on input decisions versus policies that alter longer-run incentives to invest in current education through altering expected longer-run returns from such investments? What are the benefits relative to the resource costs of alternative policies for improving educational inputs? This chapter assesses the current state of empirical knowledge, and gaps in that knowledge, on educational incentives and inputs in developing countries as related to such questions.

What is the future for Latin American migration? ¤ International migration in Latin America today presents several features that will remain constant up to 2030, and new issues will emerge such as the growing feminisation of migration, the special case of indigenous people or human rights aspects. A concentrated migration pattern to the United States and Spain dominate the region. Although this will continue during the next decades, there will also be an incipient pattern of diversification of destinations (other European countries, Canada and Japan). Little progress has been made regarding the productive use of remittances, and the agreements and programmes targeted for temporary labour migration have not become widespread and also continue to include meagre migrant worker quotas. Today, the main destinations for intraregional migrants are Argentina, Costa Rica and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, but there are some modest signs of change in the future.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3>
Chapter 5. Recent Developments in Mass Media : Digitization and Multitasking ¤ Technology and consumer behavior are changing supply and demand for mass media. Digitization has increased consumer control over media content and advertising, with implications for advertising avoidance, advertising targeting and personalization, competition among media platforms, and media market outcomes. In addition, consumers increasingly use a “second screen” to multitask during media programs, enabling immediate online response to program and advertising content, but also offering new opportunities to divert attention. This chapter presents recent data showing that video has remained the dominant mass medium and establishing the prevalence of digitization and multitasking behavior. It then selectively reviews academic research on the antecedents and consequences of the changing picture of mass media consumption, with a particular focus on the past 5–10 years.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129410-5>
Chapter 10. Insurance Reimbursement ¤ This paper discusses theoretical and empirical findings concerning insurance reimbursement of patients or providers by insurers operating in private markets or in mixed public and private systems. Most insurances other than health insurance do not reimburse; instead they pay cash to insureds conditional on the occurrence of a prespecified event. In contrast, health insurance ties the payment to medical expenditures or costs incurred in some fashion, often making payments directly to medical providers. These differences are caused by a much higher degree of moral hazard and the dominant effect of insurer demand on provider prices. Health insurances also often prohibit balance billing, provider charges in excess of some prespecified amount. Such prohibitions are related to patient inability to shop or bargain, and to insurer market power. Empirical evidence suggests that some versions of physician and hospital reimbursement have increased the level of medical spending relative to the level that would be experienced under prospective payment. In particular, cost-based reimbursement raises total spending. Optimal reimbursement, with balance billing prohibited, may also be chosen to control moral hazard; payment will generally involve a mix of fee-for-service and predetermined (salary or capitation) payment, and may well involve positive patient cost sharing. Monopsony behavior by dominant insurers is possible, and may improve consumer welfare but not total welfare.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Chapter 34 Price Discrimination and Competition ¤ This chapter surveys the developments in price discrimination theory as it applies to imperfectly competitive markets.

OECD Statistical Yearbook on African Central Government Debt : Summary and Overview ¤ The borrowing requirements of African governments in financing their budget deficits are increasingly met by selling marketable instruments but also by the issuance of non-marketable debt in the form of bi-lateral, multilateral and concessional loans.

Review of Sectoral Reforms in Ireland ¤ Sectoral reforms in Ireland have been an important part of the move toward market-based growth but as yet progress has varied among the sectors.

Chapter 67 Linking the Theory with the Data: That is the Core Problem of International Economics ¤ The greatest problem for empirical analysis is how best to allow the context to affect the inferences. Econometric theory presupposes contextual “restrictions” that can be taken as given or assigned a probability distribution. These contextual inputs are rarely available. I illustrate this point with a review of the empirical work in international economics which has focused not on properties of estimators but instead how best to link the theory with the data. I argue that the two errors we should worry about are not rejecting a true null or accepting a false null but rather taking the theory too seriously and not taking the theory seriously enough.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Chapter 11. Empirical Analyses of Networks in Finance ¤ The recent global financial crisis has triggered a huge interest in the use of network concepts and network tools to better understand how instabilities can propagate through the financial system. The literature is today quite vast, covering both theoretical and empirical aspects. This review concentrates on empirical work, and associated methodologies, concerned with the evaluation of the fragility and resilience of financial and credit markets. The first part of the review examines the literature on systemic risk that arise from banks mutual exposures. These exposures stem primarily from interbank lending and derivative positions, but also, indirectly, from common holdings of other asset classes, that can lead to common shocks in instances of fire sales, and from widespread non-performing loans to the real sector during period of economic downturns. We survey (a) studies that characterize the structure of national interbank networks, in some cases using a multiplex representations, (b) studies that introduce novel methods to quantify systemic risk and identify systemically important institutions, such as via stress test scenarios, (c) studies that assess which regulatory measures can help mitigate the propagation of contagion and distress in the financial system, and (d) studies that explore which location advantages may arise from holding privileged positions in the interbank network, such as via preferential lending relationships, or because of occupying a more central node, and if such advantages can provide an early indication of the build up of systemic risk. The second part of the review is dedicated to the analysis of indirect networks, specifically (e) proximity based network, i.e. networks obtained starting from a proximity measure sometime filtered with a network filtering methodology, (f) association network, i.e. networks where a link between two financial actors is set if a statistical test again a null hypothesis is rejected, and (g) statistically validated networks, i.e. event or relationship networks where a subset of links is selected according to a statistical validation associated with the rejection of a random null hypothesis. The need for a joint consideration of direct and indirect channels of contagion is briefly discussed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5>
Chapter 9 Representative Democracy as Social Choice ¤ Social Choice traditionally employs the preferences of voters or agents as primitives. However, in most situations of constitutional decision-making the beliefs of the members of the electorate determine their secondary preferences or choices. Key choices in US political history, such as the ratification of the Constitution in 1787 and the election of Lincoln in 1860, were conditioned by changing beliefs as regards the truth of propositions about the political universe. Preference-based models of election tend to conclude that candidates, or parties, converge to a vote-maximizing policy position at the “electoral center”. Empirical work suggests that such a conclusion is invalid. This chapter argues, on the contrary, that parties or candidates adopt positions that optimize, in a Nash equilibrium sense, with respect to both their beliefs over electoral response, and their beliefs over appropriate policy choices. The analysis indicates that political choices will be different depending on whether plurality (“first past the post”) or proportionality is used as the method of electoral representation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166306-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143069-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022393-0>

We also consider the more modest literature that considers the effect on innovation of firm characteristics other than size. Finally, we review the literature that considers three classes of factors that affect interindustry variation in innovative activity and performance: demand, appropriability, and technological opportunity conditions.

Cultural Innovation by Cultural Organizations ¤ This chapter assesses the theories and related empirical evidence regarding the factors that explain cultural innovation by cultural organizations. It begins by defining key concepts, including what is meant by a cultural organization, cultural innovation, and the innovation referent. The chapter identifies two main disciplines that have been interested in cultural innovation or innovative programming by cultural organizations: sociology and economics. The focus, contributions, and overlap of these two disciplinary approaches to cultural innovation are discussed, and the chapter concludes by identifying some gaps and putting forward some suggestions for future research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4>
Chapter 36 Laboratory Tests of Job Search Models ¤ This chapter is concerned with laboratory tests of job search models. Formal models of job search specify certain common elements, i.e., the length of the search horizon, the searcher's discounting rate of interest, the net costs (subsidies) to search in each period of the search horizon, and the searcher's knowledge about the wage offer distribution he or she faces. Because these factors are difficult, if not impossible, to observe in the naturally-occurring economy, controlled laboratory tests of the search model offer the only practical means for formally testing search models. A basic job search model of interest to economists specifies a finite search horizon. Searchers know the (discrete) wage offer distribution and must accept or decline an offer when it is received. The search model has sharp predictions for a utility maximizing, risk neutral agent. In this case the agent seeks to maximize the expected present value of the income from search. This can be accomplished by choosing an appropriate (minimally acceptable) reservation wage each period.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1>
Chapter 88 Voluntary Provision of Public Goods ¤ This chapter discusses that redistributing resource endowments from people who contribute to public goods to other people who contribute to public goods will have no effect on the aggregate contributions to public goods. However, redistribution from non-contributors to contributors will result in an increase in the provision of public goods. A model which incorporates equity theory is used to generate alternative hypotheses for the behavior of individual contributors. Aggregate contribution data from three-person public goods environments support the neutrality theorem originally when endowments were redistributed among contributors. The individual contribution data, however, did not support the predictions of the conventional model. Individuals with relatively high endowments tended to under-contribute, relative to the conventional predictions, while individuals with relatively low endowments over-contributed.

Chapter 11 Oligopoly theory ¤ The oligopoly theory usually refers to the partial equilibrium study of markets in which the demand side is competitive, while the supply side is neither monopolized nor competitive. It is exclusively concerned with single period models. The two models that are mainly discussed are Cournot's and a model based on Chamberlin. In Cournot's model, it is assumed that the products of the firms are perfect substitutes and each firm decides the output levels with price being determined in the market. The Chamberlinian model allows for imperfect substitutability among the outputs of the firms, and each firm is assumed to name prices for their products. The chapter also presents some of the basic structure for the models of multi-period oligopoly. The time structure of none of these models is explicit; however, none of them makes sense when interpreted as strictly single-period models. Thus, for the best understanding of them, it is necessary to augment them by making the time relations explicit and by making an appropriate reformulation of the firm's objective functions. The chapter also examines various models in which the time structure is explicit and the firms seek to maximize discounted profit streams. The chapter also discusses models with entry and exit of firms.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066472-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Chapter 12. Natural Experiments in Macroeconomics ¤ A growing literature relies on natural experiments to establish causal effects in macroeconomics. In diverse applications, natural experiments have been used to verify underlying assumptions of conventional models, quantify specific model parameters, and identify mechanisms that have major effects on macroeconomic quantities but are absent from conventional models. We discuss and compare the use of natural experiments across these different applications and summarize what they have taught us about such diverse subjects as the validity of the Permanent Income Hypothesis, the size of the fiscal multiplier, and about the effects of institutions, social structure, and culture on economic growth. We also outline challenges for future work in each of these fields, give guidance for identifying useful natural experiments, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the approach.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8>
Chapter 51 Inspection games ¤ Starting with the analysis of arms control and disarmament problems in the sixties, inspection games have evolved into a special area of game theory with specific theoretical aspects, and, equally important, practical applications in various fields of human activity where inspection is mandatory. In this contribution, a survey of applications is given first. These include arms control and disarmament, theoretical approaches to auditing and accounting, for example in insurance, and problems of environmental surveillance. Then, the general problem of inspection is presented in a game-theoretic framework that extends a statistical hypothesis testing problem. This defines a game since the data can be strategically manipulated by an inspectee who wants to conceal illegal actions. Using this framework, two models are solved, which are practically significant and technically interesting: material accountancy and data verification. A second important aspect of inspection games is the fact that inspection resources are limited and have to be used strategically. This is demonstrated in the context of sequential inspection games, where many mathematically challenging models have been studied. Finally, the important concept of leadership, where the inspector becomes a leader by announcing and committing himself to his strategy, is shown to apply naturally to inspection games.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Introduction ¤ The topics covered by the chapters of the current book Handbook of Economics in Education , step into some of the most obvious gaps that have become evident with the newly emerging research. While there are antecedents to the work in each of the chapters, recent research has taken the ideas into new and productive areas. The first two chapters cover developments in the econometric methods used and the emerging work with the international test score data. The next two chapters deal with family background and peers as much-researched determinants of educational outcomes beyond the traditional school resource inputs. Next are two chapters addressing specific topics related to the teaching profession: salary setting and licensure. Three chapters address separate institutional features of the school system: educational tracking, school accountability, and the GED as a credential for school dropouts. The final two chapters relate to valuation of school quality on the housing market and to apprenticeship as a specific combination of formal education with work-based training that is widely used in several countries, respectively.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2>
Investment in human capital through upper-secondary and tertiary education ¤ This article examines various efficiency and equity aspects related to the skill acquisition of young people and older adults. The analysis suggests that human capital investment is associated with significant labour-market gains for individuals, including higher post-tax earnings and better employment prospects, which exceed the investment costs, mainly foregone earnings and tuition fees, by a significant margin. It also shows that the net benefits are strongly influenced by policy related factors, such as study length, tuition subsidies and student support. Overall, the estimates reported in the article indicate that there are strong incentives for the average student to continue studying beyond the compulsory schooling age, and also point to the benefits of such investment in education for society as a whole. However, the net gains fall with age, mainly reflecting a shorter period to take advantage of the benefits that come with education. Finally, the article notes that students in higher education tend to come from more affluent backgrounds and that they benefit from large public subsidies, whereas young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely to participate in tertiary education and thus benefit from public subsidies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
Piezoelectric active bearings and supports: structures, characteristics, applications ¤ Active kinematic pairs, piezoelectric motors, active bearings, piezoelectric supports, multi-degree-of-freedom actuators	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014722-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4568836-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127559-7>
Environmental Regulation and Competition ¤ Environmental protection and competitive markets are two of the highest policy priorities. In June 2006 the Competition Committee held a roundtable discussion on potential restrictions to competition due to environmental protection. Environmental regulations can constitute substantial barriers to entry in some markets, can provide a basis for predatory behaviour in some markets and can be harmful to competition and welfare through a variety of other channels. Environmental rules can thus raise prices to consumers by reducing competition in the market. Any assessment of the costs and benefits of an existing or proposed environmental rule is incomplete without an analysis of the costs generated by any resulting reduction in competition. On the other hand, there is no firm empirical evidence that environmental policy affects the competitiveness of firms and countries. Ideally, environmental policies should be effective and among equally effective policies, the policy that is least restrictive of competition should be chosen. Environmental policy makers should ensure that environmental benefits continue to outweigh costs, including the indirect costs associated with effects on market structure. Environmental policy is first and foremost about securing public environmental goods which are demanded in their own right and which are fundamental to a well-functioning market.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7>
The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) International Organisation : Which Laws Apply to this International Nuclear Operator? ¤ ITER is a research project the purpose of which is to demonstrate the scientific and technical feasibility of fusion as a new source of energy. After construction of large Tokamaks,1 such as the JT60 in Japan, TFTR (Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor) in the United States, JET (Joint European Torus) in the United Kingdom and Tore Supra in France, this project is the last stage of research to be conducted before construction of an industrial reactor.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068925-6>
Chapter 16. Health and Long-Term Care ¤ This chapter summarizes the recent economic literature on health and long-term care as it relates to population aging. The profound demographic changes taking place in developed countries will require changes in how societies provide and pay for long-term care. Both the supply side and the demand side of the health care markets are undergoing change. This chapter provides a review of the main economic theories and empirical findings about the supply of and demand for long-term care, primarily among the elderly. It also reviews the main features and problems with insurance markets and quality of care. There is a short section that explains new promising data sets available for researchers. This chapter concludes with questions for future research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006294-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4334479-3>
Chapter 17 Empirical studies of industries with market power ¤ This chapter describes the econometric studies of market power in single markets and in groups of related markets. The recent increase in the number of such studies and substantial advances in the methods for carrying them out constitute a dramatic shift in the focus of empirical work in the industrial organization (IO) field. The chapter discusses time series data from single industries or on data from closely related markets. The new empirical industrial organization (NEIO) is clearly somewhat different than the previously dominant empirical method in the field, the structureconductperformance paradigm (SCPP). The chapter presents the formation and enforcement of tacitly collusive arrangements, the nature of noncooperative oligopoly interaction in the world, the degree of single-firm market power under product differentiation, and the size and determinants of the industry price-cost margin. It reviews the various empirical models of monopoly power and of oligopoly interaction and describes the theoretical and empirical arguments for why it is monopoly power that is being measured.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133311-1>
Chapter Twenty-Seven. Geometry of Voting ¤ It is shown how simple geometry can be used to analyze and discover new properties about pairwise and positional voting rules as well as for those rules (e.g., runoffs and Approval Voting) that rely on these methods. The description starts by providing a geometric way to depict profiles, which simplifies the computation of the election outcomes. This geometry is then used to motivate the development of a “profile coordinate system,” which evolves into a tool to analyze voting rules. This tool, for instance, completely explains various longstanding “paradoxes,” such as why a Condorcet winner need not be elected with certain voting rules. A different geometry is developed to indicate whether certain voting “oddities” can be dismissed or must be taken seriously, and to explain why other mysteries, such as strategic voting and the no-show paradox (where a voter is rewarded by not voting), arise. Still another use of geometry extends McGarvey's Theorem about possible pairwise election rankings to identify the actual tallies that can arise (a result that is needed to analyze supermajority voting). Geometry is also developed to identify all possible positional and Approval Voting election outcomes that are admitted by a given profile; the converse becomes a geometric tool that can be used to discover new election relationships. Finally, it is shown how lessons learned in social choice, such as the seminal Arrow's and Sen's Theorems and the expanding literature about the properties of positional rules, provide insights into difficulties that are experienced by other disciplines.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022393-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066735-2>
Chapter 15 Existence of competitive equilibrium ¤ This chapter discusses that the mathematical model of a competitive economy conceived as an attempt to explain the state of equilibrium reached by a large number of small agents interacting through markets. Four distinct, but closely related, approaches to the existence problem are recognized. At first, proofs of existence of an economic equilibrium were uniformly obtained by application of a fixed-point theorem of the Brouwer type or Kakutani type or by analogous arguments. This approach, which has remained of central importance to the present, is the subject of the chapter. Second, in the past decade, efficient algorithms of a combinatorial nature for the computation of an approximate economic equilibrium were developed. Third, recently, the theory of the fixed-point index of a map and the degree theory of maps were used to establish the existence of an economic equilibrium, and finally a differential process was proposed whose generic convergence to an economic equilibrium provides an alternative constructive solution of the existence problem.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066472-7>
Chapter 3 Models of marital status and childbearing ¤ The chapter presents an investigation on those microeconomic models of marital status and childbearing that contains implications for female labor supply. The chapter focuses its discussion primarily on the developed countries, principally the United States, but refers to developing country issues where these are applicable. The role of economic variables as determinants of demographic behavior is often far more vivid and persuasive in developing nations than it is in the United States or Western Europe. The chapter presents a review for the United States of trends in those demographic variables that are strongly associated with female labor supply: age at first marriage, marital dissolution, age at first birth, the number of children born over the life cycle, and the age pattern of fertility. Demographers have uncovered pronounced empirical regularities in these variables, at least in aggregate data; in some instances the patterns are regular enough to be summarized in parsimonious model schedules. These schedules are reviewed in the chapter. The chapter discusses that economists have left such regularities largely unexploited; the prior information embedded in model schedules may yield efficiency gains in estimation, especially where aggregate data are concerned. The chapter concludes with a review of the recent efforts to establish regularities in micro data.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3>

Chapter 31 Coordination and Lock-In: Competition with Switching Costs and Network Effects ¤ Switching costs and network effects bind customers to vendors if products are incompatible, locking customers or even markets in to early choices. Lock-in hinders customers from changing suppliers in response to (predictable or unpredictable) changes in efficiency, and gives vendors lucrative ex post market power – over the same buyer in the case of switching costs (or brand loyalty), or over others with network effects. Firms compete ex ante for this ex post power, using penetration pricing, introductory offers, and price wars. Such “competition for the market” or “life-cycle competition” can adequately replace ordinary compatible competition, and can even be fiercer than compatible competition by weakening differentiation. More often, however, incompatible competition not only involves direct efficiency losses but also softens competition and magnifies incumbency advantages. With network effects, established firms have little incentive to offer better deals when buyers' and complementors' expectations hinge on non-efficiency factors (especially history such as past market shares), and although competition between incompatible networks is initially unstable and sensitive to competitive offers and random events, it later “tips” to monopoly, after which entry is hard, often even too hard given incompatibility. And while switching costs can encourage small-scale entry, they discourage sellers from raiding one another's existing customers, and so also discourage more aggressive entry. Because of these competitive effects, even inefficient incompatible competition is often more profitable than compatible competition, especially for dominant firms with installed-base or expectational advantages. Thus firms probably seek incompatibility too often. We therefore favor thoughtfully pro-compatibility public policy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133311-1>
Introduction to the Series ¤ The series Handbooks in Economics produces handbooks for various branches of economics, each of which is a definitive source, reference, and teaching supplement for the use by professional researchers and advanced graduate students. Each handbook provides self-contained surveys of the current state of a branch of economics in the form of chapters prepared by leading specialists on various aspects of this branch of economics. These surveys summarize not only received results but also newer developments, from current journal articles and discussion papers. Some original material is also included, but the main goal is to provide comprehensive and accessible surveys.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1>
Dealing with the crisis and thinking about the exit strategy ¤ This article looks at the stages of crisis management and some of the different degrees of transparency on losses and risks in the US and Europe. It also compares alternative approaches to dealing with impaired assets used in the USA and Europe. Exposure to off-balance losses remains a key issue. Europe, surprisingly, has been and remains the major issuer of collateralised synthetic obligations that have been so prominent in the crisis. The capital needs of banks over the next few years is examined, and great uncertainties remain due to the unknown extent to which off-balance sheet vehicles will need to be consolidated. Finally, the requirements of longer-run reform are outlined.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6>
Chapter 32 Perspectives on PPP and long-run real exchange rates ¤ This chapter presents an overview of the long-run determinants of purchasing power parity (PPP). It reviews the huge time series literature testing simple PPP. This area has proven fruitful ground for applying modern methods for dealing with nonstationary and near-nonstationary time series. The chapter traces out the evolution of the literature from naive static tests of PPP to modern unit-root approaches for testing whether real exchange rates are stationary and to cointegration techniquesthe most recent phase of PPP testing. The research on more disaggregated price data is discussed in the chapter, including a nearly two-hundred year data set on commodity prices in England and France during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Aside from providing an extremely long data set, this historical data offers some perspective on the behavior of cross-country relative prices in more modern times. The chapter looks at some possible medium- and long-run determinants of the real exchange rate, particularly the supply-side determinants emphasized in the popular BalassaSamuelson model. It also considers some evidence that positive demand shocks, such as unexpected increases in government spending, lead to medium-run appreciations of the real exchange rate.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1>
Chapter 1 Properties of Disequilibrium Adjustment in Double Auction Markets ¤ The tendency of double auction markets to converge to the equilibrium of the associated competitive equilibrium model is well known, but the equilibration process is not understood. The reason for adjustment and the processes that are actively involved with the adjustment process are still a mystery. However, the study of many markets reported over the years by many different research groups have provided some properties of disequilibria and the dynamics of the adjustment process. Double auction markets have properties that are closely associated with certain institutional and environmental features and have been studied extensively. First, there is a period structure to the markets: an open and a close. Second, major changes, such as parameter changes, occur between the close of one period and the open of the next and this fact is public information. That is, parameter changes do not occur during a period. Third, the commodity traded is like a service that does not have a life of over one period. Redemption values and costs are active for only one period at a time. If the commodity does have a time lifelike a securityit will systematically change its value between periods, such as a dividend that is paid at the end of a period. This chapter does not specifically explores the dynamics of adjustment that occur in other market structures, the properties listed in the chapter are characteristic of the asset markets that have been studied: speculative markets and economies characterized by overlapping generations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1>
Chapter 25 Agriculture and ecosystem services ¤ A broad range of agriculture-environment interactions can be organized around the concept of agriculture as a producer and consumer of ecosystem services . Viewed as capital assets, ecosystems embody production technologies that are valuable, complex, and often poorly understood. The quantity and quality of services they deliver depend almost always on the joint actions of many dispersed resource users. Furthermore, ecosystems deliver multiple types of services, across widely varying spatial scales. Efficient delivery of alternative environmental “crops” such as carbon sequestration, water quality, and wildlife habitat requires distinctive institutional forms, and an intellectual integration of ecology into agricultural economics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4>
Bourdieu on Religion: Imposing Faith and Legitimacy ¤ Until recently Pierre Bourdieu has been known in the United States as a sociologist of culture, education, stratification, and social theory—not a sociologist of religion. But, as Erwan Dianteil and others have pointed out, Bourdieu drew extensively on the sociological classics of religion (particularly Weber, Durkheim, and Mauss) to develop his sociological framework. Though Bourdieu himself devoted little of his tremendous sociological output to religion, Terry Rey, in this important book on Bourdieu and religion, shows not only how Bourdieu drew on the classics to frame his sociology, including his thinking about religion, but also the growing influence of Bourdieu's work on the contemporary sociology of religion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049420-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Chapter 10. Improving Education Outcomes in Developing Countries : Evidence, Knowledge Gaps, and Policy Implications ¤ Improvements in empirical research standards for credible identification of the causal impact of education policies on education outcomes have led to a significant increase in the body of evidence available on improving education outcomes in developing countries. This chapter aims to synthesize this evidence, interpret their results, and discuss the reasons why some interventions appear to be effective and others do not, with the ultimate goal of drawing implications for both research and policy. Interpreting the evidence for generalizable lessons is challenging because of variation across contexts, duration and quality of studies, and the details of specific interventions studied. Nevertheless, some broad patterns do emerge. Demand-side interventions that increase the immediate returns to (or reduce household costs of) school enrollment, or that increase students’ returns to effort, are broadly effective at increasing time in school and learning outcomes, but vary considerably in cost-effectiveness. Many expensive “standard” school inputs are often not very effective at improving outcomes, though some specific inputs (which are often less expensive) are. Interventions that focus on improved pedagogy (especially supplemental instruction to children lagging behind grade level competencies) are particularly effective, and so are interventions that improve school governance and teacher accountability. Our broad policy message is that the evidence points to several promising ways in which the efficiency of education spending in developing countries can be improved by pivoting public expenditure from less cost-effective to more cost-effective ways of achieving the same objectives. We conclude by documenting areas where more research is needed, and offer suggestions on the public goods and standards needed to make it easier for decentralized and uncoordinated research studies to be compared across contexts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2>
Chapter 5. Values of Music ¤ In this chapter I survey the kinds of value that music can have, or the variety of ways in which music can be valued, and the relationships and correlations among those values or ways of valuing. First and foremost is music’s musical value, or the value of music as music, which is a species of artistic value, itself closely related to but not identical with aesthetic value. Yet music clearly has value beyond its purely musical value. Music obviously has economic value, whether as a commodity, a service, or a skill. More generally, music has, or can have, various sorts of practical value. Notable among the practical values of music would be social value, entertainment value, therapeutic value, functioning-enhancement value, and self-affirmation value. The relation between the practical or instrumental values that a piece of music can possess and its musical or artistic value is complicated, and will vary from case to case.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1>
Chapter 38 Game-theoretic aspects of computing ¤ This chapter discusses the game-theoretic aspects of computing. Game theorists would probably favor stochastic models of failure. There is a great need for interesting theories on fault-tolerant computing where failures occur at random. A distributed system consists of a large number of loosely coupled computing devices (processors) which together perform some computation. One of the earliest general problems in the theory of distributed processing was how to establish consensus in a network of processors where faults may occur. The basic question of this type came to be known as the Byzantine Agreement problem. An overall description of the Byzantine Agreement problem that game theorists may find natural is how to establish common knowledge in the absence of a mechanism that can guarantee reliable information passing. In known examples, where a problem is solved by turning some fact into common knowledge (e.g., in the betraying wives puzzle) there is an instance where all parties involved are situated in one location and the pertinent fact is being announced, thus becoming common knowledge. Interesting and largely unexplored connections with game theory arise in complexity theory. Various measures for the computational complexity of functions are considered in this area, some of which are defined in terms of certain cooperative games.

Chapter 26 Art Auctions ¤ This paper contains a new review of the research of the last decade that has been designed to shed light on how the art auction system works, what it indicates about price formation, and how well it performs. We begin with a short description of the mechanics of the auction system and then organize the remainder of our discussion around two major topics. The first topic concerns how researchers have used auction prices. We begin by discussing the returns to holding art and whether certain classes of art make a better investment. We then discuss studies that have used auction prices to determine the importance of individual works of art and individual artists. We conclude this topic by discussing whether different auction houses achieve systematically different prices. The second topic focuses on studies that examine the influence of the auction mechanism on prices. We begin with a discussion of the Christie's and Sotheby's price fixing case and the role of the competitive behavior of auction houses in the determination of prices. We move on to discuss the role of experts and price estimates in auctions. We then look at whether items that fail at auction subsequently return less than items that have not failed and furthermore discuss sale rates and reserve prices. We conclude this topic by reviewing the extensive literature that has documented and tried to explain why the prices of identical objects are more likely to decline than to increase when multiple units are sold. Subsequent empirical research has tended to document declining prices even when the objects are imperfect substitutes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1>
Chapter 11 The determination of life cycle earnings: A survey ¤ The chapter presents a survey on the determination of life cycle earnings. The chapter describes the theoretical work on the determination of life cycle earnings. The common thread in this work is the notion that workers can influence their earnings through various investment activities. A person who spends time in school or in on-the-job training sacrifices current earnings in the hope of increasing his future earning potential. Consequently, the observed life cycle earnings profiles reflect individual economic choices as well as purely technological or biological processes such as depreciation or aging. There is, however, considerable controversy on the market situation in which investment choices are made. The welfare and policy implications are very different if schooling enhances productivity or is merely used as a mode of transferring income by signalling and screening. In this survey focus is on the human capital approach and on its testable implications to individual earning profiles setting aside the aggregate and policy implications. There are various stylized facts that the theory attempts to explain: a life cycle earnings profile, which is increasing at early ages and is declining toward the end of the working period; a wage profile that tends to increase over the life cycle with a weak tendency for wage reduction toward the end of the working period; an hours of work life cycle profile, which is increasing at early ages and declining at older ages, with the peak occurring earlier than in the earnings or wage profiles.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3>
Chapter 12 Interpreting the Evidence on Life Cycle Skill Formation ¤ This paper presents economic models of child development that capture the essence of recent findings from the empirical literature on skill formation. The goal of this essay is to provide a theoretical framework for interpreting the evidence from a vast empirical literature, for guiding the next generation of empirical studies, and for formulating policy. Central to our analysis is the concept that childhood has more than one stage. We formalize the concepts of self-productivity and complementarity of human capital investments and use them to explain the evidence on skill formation. Together, they explain why skill begets skill through a multiplier process. Skill formation is a life cycle process. It starts in the womb and goes on throughout life. Families play a role in this process that is far more important than the role of schools. There are multiple skills and multiple abilities that are important for adult success. Abilities are both inherited and created, and the traditional debate about nature versus nurture is scientifically obsolete. Human capital investment exhibits both self-productivity and complementarity. Skill attainment at one stage of the life cycle raises skill attainment at later stages of the life cycle (self-productivity). Early investment facilitates the productivity of later investment (complementarity). Early investments are not productive if they are not followed up by later investments (another aspect of complementarity). This complementarity explains why there is no equity-efficiency trade-off for early investment. The returns to investing early in the life cycle are high. Remediation of inadequate early investments is difficult and very costly as a consequence of both self-productivity and complementarity.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2>
Chapter 74 Agriculture Renaissance : Making “Agriculture for Development” Work in the 21 st Century ¤ Agriculture renaissance means the renewed understanding and recommitment to the fundamental role of agriculture in the development process. Operationally it implies different approaches at the country level based on the stage of development. For the least developed countries of the world, it could mean re-engaging agriculture's potential as a driver of overall economic development. While for the emerging economies, it could be small holder inclusion in agricultural commercialization and/or reducing rural-urban income gaps. Food sectors in developing countries are witnessing profound changes driven by: rapid income growth; urbanization; global inter-connectedness; technology access; and climate change. Country typologies, by stage of agricultural transformation, are used to discuss the implications of the changes and the public policy options for the way forward.

Chapter 8. How Has the Monetary Transmission Mechanism Evolved Over Time? ¤ We discuss the evolution in macroeconomic thought on the monetary policy transmission mechanism and present related empirical evidence. The core channels of policy transmission — the neoclassical links between short-term policy interest rates, other asset prices such as long-term interest rates, equity prices, and the exchange rate, and the consequent effects on household and business demand — have remained steady from early policy-oriented models (like the Penn-MIT-SSRC MPS model) to modern dynamic, stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. In contrast, non-neoclassical channels, such as credit-based channels, have remained outside the core models. In conjunction with this evolution in theory and modeling, there have been notable changes in policy behavior (with policy more focused on price stability) and in the reduced form correlations of policy interest rates with activity in the United States. Regulatory effects on credit provision have also changed significantly. As a result, we review the empirical evidence on the changes in the effect of monetary policy actions on real activity and inflation and present new evidence, using both a relatively unrestricted factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) and a DSGE model. Both approaches yield similar results: Monetary policy innovations have a more muted effect on real activity and inflation in recent decades as compared to the effects before 1980. Our analysis suggests that these shifts are accounted for by changes in policy behavior and the effect of these changes on expectations, leaving little role for changes in underlying private-sector behavior (outside shifts related to monetary policy changes).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Chapter 22. Inflation Targeting ¤ Inflation targeting is a monetary-policy strategy characterized by an announced numerical inflation target, an implementation of monetary policy that gives a major role to an inflation forecast that has been called forecast targeting, and a high degree of transparency and accountability. It was introduced in New Zealand in 1990, has been very successful in terms of stabilizing both inflation and the real economy, and as of 2010 has been adopted by about 25 industrialized and emerging-market economies. This chapter discusses the history, macroeconomic effects, theory, practice, and future of inflation targeting.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2>
Chapter 20. Credit Derivatives ¤ This chapter explains how the main types of credit derivatives work and how they are valued. Central to the valuation of credit derivatives is an estimation of the probability that reference entities will default. The chapter discusses both the risk-neutral probabilities of default implied from credit spreads and the real-world (physical) default probabilities calculated from historical data, such as that provided by rating agencies. The academic literature attempting to explain the difference between these two probability estimates is summarized. The characteristics of credit default swaps, which are the most common type of single-name derivatives, are discussed, and procedures used to determine the contract values are explained. A similar presentation is provided for collateralized debt obligations, which are the most common type of multi-name credit derivatives. The chapter ends with a discussion of the economics of the collateralized debt obligation market and the role that these products played in the US financial crisis, which started in 2007.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4508395-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269795-5>
Chapter 12. Financial Intermediaries and Monetary Economics ¤ We reconsider the role of financial intermediaries in monetary economics, and explore the hypothesis that the financial intermediary sector is the engine that drives the financial cycle through fluctuations in the price of risk. In this framework, balance sheet quantities emerge as a key indicator of risk appetite and, hence, for the “risk-taking channel” of monetary policy. We document evidence that balance sheets of financial intermediaries provide a window on the transmission of monetary policy through capital market conditions. Short-term interest rates are found to be important in influencing the size of financial intermediary balance sheets. Our findings suggest that the traditional focus on the money stock for the conduct of monetary policy may have more modern counterparts, and suggest the importance of tracking balance sheet quantities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2>
Chapter 19 Derivatives ¤ The area of derivatives is arguably the most fascinating area within financial economics during the past thirty years. This chapter reviews the evolution of derivatives contract markets and derivatives research over the past thirty years. The chapter has six complementary sections. The first contains a brief history of contract markets. The most important innovations occurred in the 1970s and 1980s, when contracts written on financial contracts were introduced. Concurrent with these important industry innovations was the development of modern-day option valuation theory, which is reviewed in the second and third sections. The key contribution is seminal theoretical framework of the Black-Scholes (1973) and Merton (1973) (“BSM≓) model. The key economic insight of their model is that a risk-free hedge can be formed between a derivatives contract and its underlying asset. This implies that contract valuation is possible under the assumption of risk-neutrality without loss of generality. The final three sections summarize the three main strands of empirical work in the derivatives area. In the first group are studies that focus on testing no-arbitrage pricing relations that link the prices of derivatives contracts with their underling asset and with each other. The second group contains studies that evaluate option empirical performance of option valuation models. The approaches used include investigating the in-sample properties of option values by examining pricing errors or patterns in implied volatilities, examining the performance of different option valuation models by simulating a trading strategy based on under- and over-pricing, and examining the informational content of the volatility implied by option prices. The final group focuses on the social costs and/or benefits that arise from derivatives trading. The main conclusion that can be drawn from the empirical work is that the BSM model is one of the most resilient in the history of financial economics.

Chapter 54 Health over the Life Course ¤ In recent years, significant advances have been made in better understanding the complex relationships between health and development. This reflects the combined effects of methodological innovations at both the theoretical and empirical level, the integration of insights from the biological and health sciences into economic analyses as well as improvements in the quantity and quality of data on population health and socio-economic status. To provide a foundation for discussing these advances, we describe static and dynamic models of the evolution of health over the life course in conjunction with the inter-relationships between health, other human capital outcomes and economic prosperity. Facts about health and development at both the aggregate and individual levels are presented along with a discussion of the importance of measurement. We proceed to review the empirical literature with a goal of highlighting emerging lines of scientific inquiry that are likely to have an important impact on the field. We begin with recent work that relates health events in early life, including in utero, to health, human capital and economic success in later life. We then turn to adult health and its relationship with socio-economic success, exploring the impact of health on economic outcomes and vice versa as well as the links between health and consumption smoothing. Recent evidence from the empirical literature on the micro-level impacts of HIV/AIDS on development is summarized. We conclude that developments on the horizon suggest a very exciting future for scientific research in this area.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213090-6>
The Design of Government Guarantees for Bank Bonds : Lessons from the Recent Financial Crisis ¤ In 2010 authorities have taken the first steps to end some of the public support measures put in place in response to the financial crisis, starting with government guarantees for bond issues. Financial institutions have made extensive use of this tool, which has been effective in avoiding a further tightening of funding conditions, but this type of public support has, nonetheless, raised some concerns. First, the cost of issuing guaranteed bonds has mainly reflected the characteristics of the sovereign guarantor rather than those of the issuer, thus favouring “weak” borrowers with a “strong” sovereign backing. This situation has the potential to distort competition and create incentives for excessive risk taking. Such effects could have been reduced by the choice of a different fee determination mechanism. Second, the continued availability in 2010 of guarantee schemes, despite a declining overall usage, may be alleviating the pressure on some weak financial institutions to address their weaknesses: the average creditworthiness of banks issuing after mid-2009, when market conditions became more favourable, has sharply declined.

Chapter 43 Price Discovery and Allocation in Chains and Networks of Markets ¤ The experiments reported in this chapter explore the interaction of networks of markets. The issue is whether, and how long, chains of markets separated in time, space and participants might behave. The setting can be interpreted in two different ways. One is a system of vertical markets in which tiers of intermediate goods are produced as inputs for the next, higher level on the way to a final consumption good. Another, and perhaps more graphic, interpretation is geographic, in which suppliers are located at one location and consumers are at a different location. They are connected by a series of short transportation hauls that must be undertaken by different transporters. No transporter can undertake a long haul from seller to consumer. Markets exist at the beginning and end of each short haul. That is, the first transporters/middlemen buy from sellers and transport to the first drop-off for sale there.

Chapter 15 Recreation Demand Models ¤ BEGIN Travel cost recreation demand models stem from a simple, but penetrating, insight. Consumption of an outdoor recreation site's services requires the user to incur the costs of a trip to that site. Travel costs serve as implicit prices. These costs reflect both people's distances from recreation sites visited and their specific opportunity costs of time. Today, economic analyses of recreation choices are among the most advanced examples of microeconometric modeling of consumer behavior in economics. The primary focus of this chapter is on the methods used to describe individuals' recreation choices. We are interested in the economic assumptions made in descriptions of behavior and measures of the economic value of amenities. Before developing this summary, in Section 2 we discuss how outdoor recreation fits within consumers' overall expenditures. Section 3 describes how we might ideally like to estimate consumers' preferences for recreation resources and the compromises implied by the models currently being used. Econometric details are deferred until Section 5, after a discussion of the features of recreation data in Section 4. In Section 6 we turn to conceptual issues in welfare measurement. We close in Section 7 with a discussion of a few research opportunities that seem especially important for the future.

Chapter 2. Aspects of the Economics of Organization with Application to Corporate Governance ¤ This chapter provides a critical review and survey of aspects of formal and informal contracting particularly relevant to the study of corporate governance. Two types of modeling, hidden-information agency and informal (relational) contracting that are perhaps under-utilized in governance research are covered, as well as the more commonly used hidden-action agency model. The strengths and weaknesses of these models, their sometimes contradictory predictions, and their relation to empirical work are all touched upon.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4419850-4>
Chapter 7. Property Rights and Invention ¤ We present a selective survey of the economic theory of intellectual property rights. After a brief description of the institutional framework, we discuss policy objectives and some basic welfare tradeoffs in intellectual property design. We consider the extent to which social objectives can be attained without intellectual property protection before passing on to intellectual property right design. We derive conclusions in the simplest, one-time innovation, case then investigate how these conclusions change when innovations build on each other or fit together as complements. Modifications of existing protection and optimal procurement of innovation are considered. Finally, we sketch enforcement and competition policy issues.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059252-2>
Chapter 63 Development Aid and Agriculture ¤ This chapter is motivated by the question of whether development assistance directed at agriculture (agricultural aid) is effective. It argues that development assistance is continually changing as the ascendant visions of strong global leaders interact with theories of economic growth and evidence on the impact of past aid, and that agricultural aid has reflected similar continual changes in its composition and mode of delivery. The chapter briefly summarizes evidence on the contribution of aid to overall economic growth, then reviews the evidence of whether agricultural aid accelerates agricultural or economic development. It reviews evaluations of projects and sets of projects related to agricultural credit, integrated rural development, irrigation, research, extension, and higher education. However, except for the World Bank's Operations Evaluation Department (OED) work, most studies of agricultural aid fail to estimate economic rates of return or contributions to incomes of farmers or national economies. It is impossible to conclude, from the evaluation literature, whether agricultural aid accelerates economic development or not. The chapter shows that donors change the object of their assistance with great frequency. Economic growth takes time, and donors have not stayed committed to key activities for a sufficiently long time to achieve results. Aid to agriculture from nearly all donors fell precipitously beginning in the mid-1980s despite clear evidence that there was a continuing need for broad, long-term support for agriculture in sub-Sahara Africa. This review suggests that those with responsibility for allocating assistance across sectors do not understand the crucial importance of agriculture at the early stages of development, because the urge to fund new approaches dominates decisions rather than judgment of what is needed and what is likely to be effective. However, one may also understand the unwillingness of aid decision makers to place too much credence in the results of impact evaluation studies because there are few consistent results, whether on national economic growth or agricultural growth, and most studies stress the difficulty of attributing agricultural production growth to development assistance.

Chapter 7. Mechanism Design for the Environment ¤ We argue that when externalities such as pollution are nonexcludable, agents must be compelled to participate in a “mechanism” to ensure a Pareto-efficient outcome. We survey some of the main findings of the mechanism-design (implementation-theory) literature – such as the Nash implementation theorem, the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem, the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanism, and the Arrow/d’Aspremont–Gerard–Varet mechanism – and consider their implications for the environment, in particular the reduction of aggregate emissions of pollution. We consider the cases of both complete and incomplete information.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075236-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061619-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1>
Chapter 16 Schools, Teachers, and Education Outcomes in Developing Countries ¤ About 80% of the world's children live in developing countries. Their well-being as adults depends heavily on the education they receive. School enrollment rates have increased dramatically in developing counties since 1960, but many children still leave school at a young age and often learn little while in school. This chapter reviews recent research on the impact of education and other policies on the quantity and quality of education obtained by children in developing countries. The policies considered include not only provision of basic inputs but also policies that change the way that schools are organized. While much has been learned about how to raise enrollment rates, less is known about how to increase learning. Randomized studies offer the most promise for understanding the impact of policies on learning.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2>
One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network for Detection and Mitigation of DDoS Attacks in SDN ¤ In Software-Defined Networking (SDN), the controller plane is an essential component in managing network traffic because of its global knowledge of the network and its management applications. However, an attacker might attempt to direct malicious traffic towards the controller, paralyzing the entire network. In this work, a One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) is used to protect the controller evaluating entropy information. Therefore, the CICDDoS2019 dataset is used to investigate the proposed approach to train and evaluate the performance of the model and then examine the effectiveness of the proposal in the SDN environment. The experimental results manifest that the proposed approach achieves very high enhancements in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) for the detection of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks compared to one of the benchmarking state of the art approaches.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4216132-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011144-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193754-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4010452-7>

Chapter 29. Liquidity Requirements, Liquidity Choice, and Financial Stability ¤ We study a modification of the Diamond and Dybvig (1983) model in which the bank may hold a liquid asset, some depositors see sunspots that could lead them to run, and all depositors have incomplete information about the bank's ability to survive a run. The incomplete information means that the bank is not automatically incentivized to always hold enough liquid assets to survive runs. Regulation similar to the liquidity coverage ratio and the net stable funding ratio (that are soon be implemented) can change the bank's incentives so that runs are less likely. Optimal regulation would not mimic these rules.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8>
Chapter 37 Monopolistic competition ¤ Monopolistic competition is defined as a situation of imperfect competition with some important features: (a) the products sold are differentiated; (b) firms themselves set the price of these goods; (c) the number of sellers is large and each firm disregards the effects of its price decisions on the actions of its competitors; (d) entry is unrestricted and proceeds until profits are reduced to zero or the smallest possible number consistent with the fact that the number of firms is an integer. The chapter discusses that the theory of monopolistic competition poses important and difficult conceptual problems. It focuses on models with a generally large number of price setters and indicates in the conclusion a number of alternative presentations. It introduces a basic model and studies problems of existence of an equilibrium and endogenous product differentiation and finally discusses macroeconomic applications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066472-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Chapter 57 Soil Quality and Agricultural Development ¤ This chapter evaluates soil quality and agricultural development. Estimates of soil erosion, in terms of losses to farm income range from a high of $25 billion per year to a low of $100 million per year. Crosson estimates that the $100 million figure is the most reliable. Crosson notes that this estimate is quite low (roughly a quarter of a percent per year) and argues that the Soil Conservation Service in the US invested heavily in programs to prevent soil erosion. Crosson also notes that soil erosion rates in Europe are even lower than soil erosion rates in the U.S. On a global scale, Crosson uses estimates made by Oldeman and associates at Wageningen University and concludes that global estimates of soil erosion are low (the average overall rate of erosion-based damage is 0.1% per year). A comparison of China and Indonesia, confirmed these estimates. In Sub-Saharan Africa where cropland area is still expanding rapidly, soil erosion rates are higher because of insecure property rights in land.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4704302-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6>
Chapter 5 Repeated games of incomplete information: Zero-sum ¤ This chapter focuses on the repeated games of incomplete information to analyze the strategic aspects of information: When and at what rate to reveal information, when and how to conceal information, and what resources to allocate for acquiring information. Repeated games provide the natural paradigm for dealing with these dynamic aspects of information. The repetitions of the game serve as a signaling mechanism that is the channel through which information is transmitted from one period to another. Most of the work on repeated games of incomplete information was done for two-person, zero-sum games discussed in this chapter. This is not only because it is the simplest and most natural case to start with, but also because it captures the main problems and aspects of strategic transmission of information, which can therefore be studied isolated from the phenomena of cooperation, punishments, incentives, etc. The theory of nonzero-sum repeated games of incomplete information makes extensive use of the notion of punishment which is based on the minmax value borrowed from the zero-sum case.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Chapter 20 Defense in a Globalized World: An Introduction ¤ Since the end of the Cold War, the world remains a dangerous place with new threats: regional conflicts, transnational terrorist networks, rogue states, and weapons of mass destruction (i.e., chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear). The second volume of the Handbook of Defense Economics addresses defense needs, practices, threats, agents, and policies in the modern era of globalization. This new era involves novel technologies, new business practices, and enhanced cross-border flows. Such ever-growing flows mean that military armaments and armies are less equipped to keep out unwanted intruders. This introductory chapter sets the stage for this volume in three ways. First, the chapter identifies how threats have changed since the Cold War. For example, the end of the superpower arms race has brought forth new issues, such as the quelling of local conflicts, the role of economic sanctions, and the challenge of asymmetric warfare. There are also new concerns about military manpower and the role of reservists and civilian contractors during a time when most countries have downsized their forces. Second, the chapter indicates the choice of topics and how these topics differ from those in Volume 1. In particular, we selected chapters on topics not covered in Volume 1 (e.g., civil wars, peacekeeping, trade and peace, and economic sanctions); chapters on past topics where there has been significant advances in knowledge (e.g., conflict, terrorism, arms races, and military manpower); and chapters on topics that reflects the influence of globalization and new threats (e.g., terrorism, trade and peace, and arms industries). Third, the chapter provides a brief overview of each chapter in the volume.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115806-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063255-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065004-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132793-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134037-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134192-2>
Chapter 36 Agent-Based Macro ¤ Acceptance of computer modeling and experimentation has spread slowly at best in economics in large part because agent-based models often seem foreign to the neoclassical core of economics, as that core is understood today. But in its beginnings neoclassical economics was not built from choice theory, did not represent decisions as solutions to constrained optimization problems, made no strong assumptions about the rationality of agents, and did not view the world as always in equilibrium. Agent-based economics can tap into this older neoclassical economics of adaptive behavior and ongoing market processes while circumventing the technical obstacles which forced the forerunners to adopt the “static” method. Agent-based process analysis will finally make it possible to tackle the central problem of macroeconomics, namely, the self-regulating capabilities of a capitalistic economy. Keynes challenged the presumption that flexibility of all prices guaranteed the stability of general equilibrium, arguing that effective demand failures meant that Say's Law did not hold. When supply did not create its own demand, stabilization policy in the form of aggregate demand management was required to restore full employment. In modern general equilibrium based macroeconomics, in contrast, Say's Law always holds, only “frictions” stand in the way of full employment, and stabilization policy lacks any tenable rationalization. Agent-based computational methods provide the only way in which the self-regulatory capabilities of complex dynamic models can be explored so as to advance our understanding of the adaptive dynamics of actual economies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011152-0>
Chapter 8 Strategic analysis of auctions ¤ This chapter describes several forms of auctions, presents the formulations used in the main models, reviews some of the general results and empirical findings, and indicates a few applications. Auctions have been used for millennia, and remain the simplest and most familiar means of price determination for multilateral trading without intermediary market makers such as brokers and specialists. Their trading procedures, which simply process bids and offers, are direct extensions of the usual forms of bilateral bargaining. Auctions also implement directly the demand submission procedures used in Walrasian models of markets. They therefore have prominent roles in the theory of exchange and in studies of the effects of economic institutions on the volume and terms of trade. Their allocative efficiency in many contexts ensures their continued prominence in economic theory. They are also favored in experimental designs investigating the predictive power of economic theories. Auctions are apt subjects for applications of game theory because they present explicit trading rules that largely fix the rules of the game. They present substantive problems of strategic behavior of practical importance. They are particularly valuable as illustrations of games of incomplete information because bidders' private information is the main factor affecting strategic behavior. The simpler forms of auctions induce normal-form games that are essentially solved by applying directly the basic equilibrium concepts of noncooperative game theory, such as the Nash equilibrium, without recourse to criteria for selecting among multiple equilibria. The common-knowledge assumption on which game theory relies is often tenable or innocuous applied to an auction.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8>
Chapter 21 Production and Marketing ¤ Important advancements in agricultural economics have combined the insights of the economic discipline and its analytical paradigm with the practical and scientific knowledge of agriculture. We discuss advancements made in the areas of production and marketing, the characteristics of agricultural economics that distinguish it from general economics, and close with a discussion of the future of agricultural economics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2>
Chapter 12 Redistribution ¤ This paper reviews some of the central issues that arise in thinking about the motives for, politics of, constraints on and measurement of, redistribution. Amongst the themes are: the potential usefulness of apparently inefficient policy instruments in overcoming the self-selection constraints on redistribution and limiting the damage that ill-intentioned policymakers can do; the continued (perhaps increased) ignorance as to the effective incidence of many key taxes and benefits; and, while there are circumstances in which redistribution may plausibly generate efficiency gains, the likelihood that some trade-off between equity and efficiency is inescapable.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013887-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7>
Chapter 5 Poverty Traps ¤ This survey reviews models of self-reinforcing mechanisms that cause poverty to persist. Some of them examine market failure in environments where the neoclassical assumptions on markets and technology break down. Other mechanisms include institutional failure which can, by itself, perpetuate self-reinforcing poverty. A common thread in all these mechanisms is their adverse impact on the acquisition of physical or human capital, and on the adoption of modern technology. The survey also reviews recent progress in the empirical poverty trap literature.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059252-2>
Chapter 8 Simulated and Real Buyers in Posted Offer Markets ¤ This chapter uses the data from three previously published studies to examine the effect of real versus simulated buyers on laboratory outcomes. Real buyers can and occasionally do strategically deviate from full demand revelation. Further, the threat of strategic behavior appears to temper the pricing decisions by sellers. The chapter presents the experimental design and a discussion of demand withholding as a buyer strategy. The chapter concludes by providing results and discussion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1>
Chapter 2. Macroeconomics, Aging, and Growth ¤ Inevitable population aging and slower population growth will affect the economies of all nations in ways influenced by cultural values, institutional arrangements, and economic incentives. One outcome will be a tendency toward increased capital intensity, higher wages, and lower returns on capital, a tendency partially offset when the elderly are supported by public or private transfers rather than assets, and when economies are open, in which case aging will lead to increased flows of capital and labor. Rising human capital investment per child accompanies the falling fertility that drives population aging, and partially offsets slower labor force growth. Research to date finds little effect on technological progress or labor productivity. National differences in labor supply at older ages, per capita consumption of the elderly relative to younger ages, strength of public pension and health care systems, and health and vitality of the elderly all condition the impact of population aging on the economy. Policy responses include increasing the size of the labor force, mainly by raising the retirement age; reducing benefits and/or raising taxes for public transfer programs for the elderly, with concern for deadweight loss and the fair distribution of costs across socioeconomic classes; investing more in children to increase the quality and productivity of the future labor force; and public programs that promote fertility by facilitating market work for women with children.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4334479-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006294-6>
The Implementation and the Effects of Regulatory Reform : Past Experience and Current Issues ¤ This article reviews trends, outcomes and issues in regulatory reform in OECD countries. First, it summarises the evidence on the evolution of regulatory environments and the economy-wide and sectoral effects of reforms (including privatisation) in both competitive and non-competitive industries in the past two decades. Turning to network industries, it then discusses the main policy issues raised by the need to adapt the regulation of the non-competitive segments of these industries to increasing competition in liberalised markets. It focuses on four topics that dominate the debate over regulatory reform: i) the move from command-and-control to incentive-based regulatory approaches relying on the removal of entry barriers in competitive markets, the adoption of price-cap mechanisms and the design of efficient and competitively-neutral charges for accessing the fixed networks of incumbents; ii) the pros and cons of structural measures such as privatisation, and vertical and horizontal separation of formerly integrated monopolies; iii) the ways to ensure that important non-economic objectives, such as universality of service, continue to be achieved in a more competitive environment at a minimum cost for society; and iv) the design of regulatory mechanisms and institutions that encourage best practice regulation.

Chapter 8. Student Loans and Repayment : Theory, Evidence, and Policy ¤ Rising costs of and returns to college have led to sizeable increases in the demand for student loans in many countries. In the USA, student loan default rates have also risen for recent cohorts as labor market uncertainty and debt levels have increased. We discuss these trends as well as recent evidence on the extent to which students are able to obtain enough credit for college and the extent to which they are able to repay their student debts after. We then discuss optimal student credit arrangements that balance three important objectives: (i) providing credit for students to access college and finance consumption while in school, (ii) providing insurance against uncertain adverse schooling or postschool labor market outcomes in the form of income-contingent repayments, and (iii) providing incentives for student borrowers to honor their loan obligations (in expectation) when information and commitment frictions are present. Specifically, we develop a two-period educational investment model with uncertainty and show how student loan contracts can be designed to optimally address incentive problems related to moral hazard, costly income verification, and limited commitment by the borrower. We also survey other research related to the optimal design of student loan contracts in imperfect markets. Finally, we provide practical policy guidance for re-designing student loan programs to more efficiently provide insurance while addressing information and commitment frictions in the market.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2>
Investment: Unlocking Africa's Potential ¤ It is now time to invest in Africa. The prospects are good. Africa is already attracting growing flows of private resources, as a result of its greater political stability and economic reforms. Significant new investors are now engaging in Africa, from within and outside the continent. Development assistance and debt relief alone will not be sufficient to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Africa now needs more and sustainable investment, both domestic and foreign, in order to accelerate economic growth and progress in poverty reduction, and become better integrated into the global economy. We call for the fulfilment of commitments made at African and G8 Summits and other global fora, including support from development partners to help Africa mobilise more investment, and better focus on mobilisible domestic revenue sources and indigenous resources. Areas such as infrastructure, extractive industry, tourism, agribusiness and ICT are particularly important drivers of development, and require support from development partners.

Chapter 35 Cooperative models of bargaining ¤ This chapter discusses cooperative models of bargaining. The axiomatic theory of bargaining originated in a fundamental paper by J.F. Nash. Nash introduced an idealized representation of the bargaining problem and developed a methodology that gave the hope that the undeterminateness of the terms of bargaining could be resolved. The canonical bargaining problem is that faced by management and labor in the division of a firm's profit. Another example concerns the specification of the terms of trade among trading partners. The chapter presents the classic characterizations of the three solutions that occupy center stage in the theory as it stands today: the Nash solution, the KalaiSmorodinsky solution, and the Egalitarian solution. Solutions to abstract bargaining problems, most notably the Nash solution, have been used to solve concrete economic problems, such as managementlabor conflicts, on numerous occasions. The solutions are also used to solve problems in other fields, such as political science, sociology, and economics. The solutions have also been applied in practice to resolve conflicts between different interest groups.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Chapter 4. Financing of Corporations ¤ This review evaluates the four major theories of corporate financing: (1) the Modigliani–Miller theory of capital-structure irrelevance, in which firm values and real investment decisions are unaffected by financing; (2) the trade-off theory, in which firms balance the tax advantages of borrowing against the costs of financial distress; (3) agency theories, in which financing responds to managers’ personal incentives; and (4) the pecking-order theory, in which financing adapts to mitigate problems created by differences in information. These theories are conditional, not general. It is easy to find examples of each theory at work, but otherwise difficult to distinguish the theories empirically. Large, safe firms with mostly tangible assets tend to borrow more. Firms with high profitability and valuable growth opportunities tend to borrow less. Each of these tendencies is consistent with two or more of the major theories of financing. It may be possible to devise sharper tests by exporting the theories to developing economies, where agency and information problems are more severe. Further progress in understanding corporate financing decisions will require a deeper understanding of agency issues when value-maximizing operating and investment decisions cannot be observed or verified. But managers are not just temporary agents motivated by immediate pecuniary compensation or perquisites. Managers specialize their human capital to the firm. Some recent research suggests how financing can support the co-investment of human and financial capital.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269795-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4508395-2>
The Economic Impact of Protracted Low Interest Rates on Pension Funds and Insurance Companies ¤ A period of protracted low interest rates is a feasible, even if not the most likely, scenario going forward and such a scenario would adversely affect pension funds and insurance companies. Protracted low interest rates affect investment opportunities and have a potentially significant adverse effect on life insurance companies and institutions whose liabilities consist of a fixed investment return or benefit promises, such as is the case for defined-benefit pension funds. It cannot be ruled out that the financial institutions affected engage in “gambling for redemption” in an attempt to match the level of return promised to beneficiaries when financial markets were more elevated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Estimating the structural rate of unemployment for the OECD countries ¤ The paper first reviews the conceptual framework underlying different measures of structural unemployment as well as alternative empirical methods that have been used to provide estimates of them. Drawing on this review, it goes on to develop a method for estimating time-varying NAIRUs across a range of OECD countries using a Kalman filter. It then discusses the resulting econometric estimates, and the scope for their further refinement given the associated range of uncertainties. Recent trends in the NAIRU estimates are reviewed: they fell in many countries in the second half of the 1990s, although actual unemployment has remained well above the NAIRU for a majority of countries throughout much of the 1990s, particularly in Europe. Finally, the relevance of such measures to analysing inflation developments and monetary policy is discussed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2>
VANET-based traffic light management for an emergency vehicle ¤ Wireless communications have affected our lifestyle in the last decades. It is helpful to improve quality of life for communities. Communications among vehicles usually take place in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications are aspects of communications in the transportation which are growing rapidly. They can play a pivotal role in the transportation field. Management of traffic lights (TLs) is crucial to control traffic flow especially at an intersection. The goal of this paper is to manage the TLs at an intersection when an emergency vehicle (EV) is approaching. First, we simulate an intersection which includes TLs via simulation of urban mobility (SUMO). Later, we simulate VANETs communication to manage the TLs at the intersection when the EV is coming with the help of objective modular network testbed in C++ (OMNeT++) and vehicles in network simulation (Veins). Finally, the impact of V2I communication on delivery efficiency of the emergency service is investigated. Simulation results show an improvement in delivery efficiency of the emergency service.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274324-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033447-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7713781-4>
Chapter 18 Agent Learning Representation: Advice on Modelling Economic Learning ¤ This chapter presents an overview of the existing learning models in the economic literature. Furthermore, it discusses the choice of models that should be used under various circumstances and how adequate learning models can be chosen in simulation approaches. It gives advice for using the many existing models and selecting the appropriate model for each application.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011152-0>
Chapter 53 Recent developments in public sector labor markets ¤ This chapter reviews recent developments in research on public sector labor markets. Public sector labor markets have two important characteristics which account for the interest in their operation. First, public sector labor markets are large — in most developed countries the public sector workforce accounts for over 15% of total employment. Second, public sector labor markets are different from private sector labor markets. Most importantly, politicians or bureaucrats may have objectives which differ from those of the owners of private sector firms; and the political system can allow scope for achieving those objectives where a market system would not. The introductory sections of the chapter present a simple conceptual framework for thinking about the operation of public sector labor markets, and background information on a range of key characteristics of public sector labor markets such as union structure and the institutional environment for wage bargaining. The main sections summarize a variety of research relating to earnings and employment outcomes in public sector labor markets. First, studies which compare average earnings outcomes of public sector and private sector employees in a range of countries are reviewed. Second, studies of the determinants of earnings of local government employees in the United States are described. Third, various information on the earnings structure and distribution of earnings in the public sector and private sector is presented. Fourth, studies of the level and composition of public sector employment are summarized. A concluding section presents an overview of the main findings and themes from research on public sector labor markets, and suggests topics for future research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127364-3>
Chapter 19 Game and decision theoretic models in ethics ¤ This chapter focuses on the game and decision-theoretic models in ethics. The theory of rational behavior in a social setting can be divided into game theory and ethics. Game theory deals with two or more individuals often having very different interests who try to maximize their own (selfish or unselfish) interests in a rational manner against all the other individuals who likewise try to maximize their own (selfish or unselfish) interests in a rational manner. Ethics deals with two or more individuals often having very different personal interests yet trying to promote the common interests of their society in a rational manner. The chapter discusses the axioms of Bayesian decision theory, an equi-probability model for moral value judgments, axioms for rational choice among alternative social policies, use of von Neumann-Morgenstern utilities in ethics, rule utilitarianism, act utilitarianism, Rawls' and Brock's nonutilitarian theories of justice, and Brock's theory of social justice based on the Nash solution and on the Shapley value.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8>
Chapter 7. Quasi-experimental methods in environmental economics: Opportunities and challenges ¤ This paper examines the application of quasi-experimental methods in environmental economics. We begin with two observations: (i) standard quasi-experimental methods, first applied in other microeconomic fields, typically assume unit-level treatments that do not spill over across units; (ii) because public goods, such as environmental attributes, exhibit externalities, treatment of one unit often affects other units. To explore the implications of applying standard quasi-experimental methods to public good problems, we extend the potential outcomes framework to explicitly distinguish between unit-level source and the resulting group-level exposure of a public good. This new framework serves as a foundation for reviewing and interpreting key papers from the recent empirical literature. We formally demonstrate that two common quasi-experimental estimators of the marginal social benefit of a public good can be biased due to externality spillovers, even when the source of the public good itself is quasi-randomly assigned. We propose an unbiased estimator for the valuation of local public goods and discuss how it can be implemented in future studies. Finally, we consider how to preserve the advantages of the quasi-experimental approach when valuing global public goods, such as climate change mitigation, for which no control units are available.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1>
Chapter 5. International Migration and the Economics of Language ¤ This chapter reports on the “economics of language” for immigrants—that is, the influence of language on the choice of destination among international migrants, the determinants among immigrants of destination language proficiency, and the labor market consequences of that proficiency, as expressed in their earnings. Immigrants tend to take language differences across countries into account when deciding whether to migrate and in the choice of the destination. The propensity to migrate to a particular destination, other variables being the same, is greater the smaller the “linguistic distance” between the migrant's language skills and the dominant language in the destination. The determinants of destination language proficiency are shown to be consistent with a model based on the Exposure to the destination language in the origin and the destination, Efficiency in acquiring destination language proficiency, including education, age at migration and linguistic distance, among other variables, and Economic incentives, including the effects of higher earnings and a longer expected duration of residence. This model is shown to be robust for the several immigrant receiving countries studied. Earnings among immigrants are shown to be greater among those more proficient in the destination language, other variables being the same. The earnings payoff tends to be high, yet this underestimates the total returns as it does not include the social, cultural, and political benefits of destination proficiency or the complementarity of destination language skills and investments in other forms of human capital. The chapter closes with a discussion of some policy issues.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4501977-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069332-6>
Chapter 14 The timing of innovation: Research, development, and diffusion ¤ The analysis of the timing of innovation posits a particular innovation and examines the way the expected benefits, the cost of research and development, and interactions among competing firms combine to determine the pattern of expenditure across firms and over time, the date of introduction, and the identity of the innovating firm. In the case of a sequence of innovations, the expected lifetime of a given innovation and the pattern of technological leadership are also determined endogenously. Given that an innovation has been perfected, the extent and timing of its dissemination into use may be examined. This may depend upon a number of factors, including the existence of rival firms and institutions, which may facilitate or retard the dissemination of innovations. The chapter discusses the issues of innovation production in the context of symmetric noncooperative models. The chapter investigates the extent of dissemination of the innovation, where this dissemination is achieved through licensing.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133311-1>
Development of a test environment for the evaluation of human-technology interaction in cockpits of highly-automated vehicles ¤ This paper presents a technologically independent framework to describe test environments suitable for the examination of the driver take-over task present in highly-automated vehicles. As part of a structural analysis, typical influencing factors and parameters defining the driver take-over task are discussed. According to literature, existing studies examining the driver take-over task make use of various test environments. However, the comparability of their results is not given without a detailed understanding of these. Hence, based on established literature, a technologically independent framework has been developed which can be used to describe the distinct test environments. It turned out, that the referenced models had to be partially restructured in order to be suitable for the description of such test environments. The focus of the present paper lies on their technical implementation characterized by stimulus materials, which have been holistically examined for the driver take-over task. Since stimulus materials provide the foundation of a specification of test environments, this work presents an initial step towards a test specification aiming on making results obtained from examinations of the driver take-over task comparable.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125909-9>
Chapter 14. Risk Adjustment in Competitive Health Plan Markets ¤ In the 1990s many countries have chosen to use prospective payment arrangements for health plans (e.g., health insurers, sickness funds or HMOs) together with health plan competition, as a means of creating incentives to be cost conscious, while preserving quality, innovation and responsiveness to consumer preferences. Risk adjustment is an important mechanism for attenuating problems that threaten the effectiveness of this strategy for resource allocation in health care. Without adequate risk adjustment, competing health plans have incentives to avoid individuals with predictable losses and to select predictably profitable members. This selection and the resulting risk segmentation can have adverse effects in terms of access to care, quality of care and efficiency in the production of care. This chapter first provides a conceptual framework for thinking about risk adjustment. Second, it gives an overview of the progress developing risk adjustment models in recent years. Third, several forms of risk sharing are discussed, which can be used as a tool for reducing selection in case of imperfect risk adjustment. Fourth, an overview is given of the current practice of risk adjustment and risk sharing in 11 countries. Finally some directions for future research are discussed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Chapter 12. User-Generated Content and Social Media ¤ This chapter documents what economists have learned about user-generated content (UGC) and social media. A growing body of evidence suggests that UGC on platforms ranging from Yelp to Facebook has a large causal impact on economic and social outcomes ranging from restaurant decisions to voting behavior. These findings often leverage unique datasets and methods ranging from regression discontinuity to field experiments, and researchers often work directly with the companies they study. I then survey the factors that influence the quality of UGC. Quality is influenced by factors including promotional content, peer effects between contributors, biases of contributors, and self-selection into the decision to contribute. Non-pecuniary incentives, such as “badges” and social status on a platform, are often used to encourage and steer contributions. I then discuss other issues including business models, network effects, and privacy. Throughout the chapter, I discuss open questions in this area.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129410-5>
Competition Law and Policy in South East Europe ¤ Competition policy is a strong building block foundation of market economies. Development of competition policies in South East Europe (“SEE”) aims at creating a level playing field for investment, which is of major importance for the economic progress of the countries in the region. In 2001, a comprehensive programme for building capacities of SEE competition authorities was launched as a contribution to stability, sustainable growth and welfare in the region. Funded by the South East Europe Compact for Reform, Investment, Integrity and Growth, it was organised by the OECD Competition Division in partnership with the competition authorities of Bulgaria, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Slovenia. The long-term objectives of the programme were to strengthen national competition authorities of the region as law enforcers and advocates for economic reform based on competition principles. A major objective was also to support the establishment of intra-regional co-operation in the competition policy area. This concluding report draws on the experiences and the documentation produced by the representatives of SEE competition authorities, and provides an overview of the competition regimes in the SEE countries.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9>
1. Markets ¤ More than anything else in the history of the development of economic thought, experimental economics is about the extended order of markets whose outcomes are not part of the intentions of the participants. It is accurate to say that markets emerged out of the dim past of social and economic exchange as an inscrutable human social propensity to truck, barter and exchange, rather than to describe them as having been invented. Even today, as in the experimental subfield of economic system design and testing, although invention appears to be prominent initially, all designs are subject to continuous change and adaptation in the light of experience and feedback; first in lab testing, then ongoing in the field. For example, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has a book of rules, consisting of a three ring loose-leaf notebook, symbolizing the persistence of change based on experience that characterizes institutions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1>
Chapter 5. Investment Banking and Securities Issuance ¤ This chapter analyzes the securities issuance process, focusing on initial public offerings (IPOs) and seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). The IPO literature documents three empirical patterns: 1) short-run underpricing; 2) long-run underperformance (although this is contentious); and 3) extreme time-series fluctuations in volume and underpricing. While the chapter mainly focuses on evidence from the USA, evidence from other countries is generally consistent with the USA patterns. A large literature explaining the short-run underpricing of IPOs exists, with asymmetric information models predominating. The SEO literature documents 1) negative announcement effects; 2) the setting of offer prices at a discount from the market price; 3) long-run underperformance; and 4) large fluctuations in volume. In addition to long-run underperformance relative to other stocks, there is some evidence that issuers succeed at timing their equity offerings for periods when future market returns are low. When examining a large class of corporate financing activities, including equity offerings, convertible bond offerings, bond offerings, open market repurchases, stock- and cash-financed mergers and acquisitions, and dividend increases or decreases, several patterns emerge. In general, the announcement effects are negative for activities that provide cash to the firm, and positive for activities that pay cash out of the firm. Furthermore, the market generally underreacts, in that long-run abnormal returns are usually of the same sign as the announcement effect. In spite of the large expenditure of resources on analyst coverage, there is little academic work emphasizing the importance of the marketing of financial securities. Only recently have papers begun to focus on the corporate financing implications if firms face variations in the cost of external financing due to the mispricing of securities by the market.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4508395-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269795-5>
Chapter 62 Evaluating Conditional Schooling and Health Programs ¤ We analyze in this chapter the development and evaluation of a new genre of social programs termed conditional cash transfer programs which have become widespread across Latin America and are now extending outside the region. Conditional transfer programs typically link monetary transfers to human capital investment, generally education, health or a combination of both. These transfer programs are considered innovative because they condition the receipt of monetary benefits on such behaviors as regular school attendance and preventive clinic visits. Effectively they are a subsidy to schooling and health, reducing the shadow price of human capital acquisition. We focus here primarily on a case study of Progresa (the Education, Health and Nutrition Program), a Mexican anti-poverty program which has served as a model for the implementation of conditional programs in other countries, and on which most evidence exists on impacts. We also review results from the newer conditional cash transfer programs. The chapter thus analyzes what we know about the success of conditional cash transfer programs as a mechanism for reducing poverty and identifies what research which is still needed in order for broader conclusions to be drawn.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213090-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7>
Equity in Student Achievement Across OECD Countries : An Investigation of the Role of Policies ¤ This paper focuses on inequalities in learning opportunities for individuals coming from different socio-economic backgrounds as a measure of (in)equality of opportunity in OECD countries and provides insights on the potential role played by policies and institutions in shaping countries’ relative positions. Based on harmonised 15-year old students’ achievement data collected at the individual level, the empirical analysis shows that while Nordic European countries exhibit relatively low levels of inequality, continental Europe is characterised by high levels of inequality – in particular of schooling segregation along socio-economic lines – while Anglo-Saxon countries occupy a somewhat intermediate position. Despite the difficulty of properly identifying causal relationship, cross-country regression analysis provides insights on the potential for policies to explain observed differences in equity in education.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2>
Portfolio Effects in Conglomerate Mergers ¤ In the context of conglomerate merger review, portfolio effects seem to refer to the pro- and anti-competitive effects possibly arising when: the parties enjoy market power but not necessarily dominance; and the products joined are complementary or have analogous properties. When complementary products are merged, there is a potential for considerable synergies that could benefit buyers. There is also an increased potential for forced tying, pure bundling, or analogous practices (e.g. full line forcing) that could restrict buyer choice but also lower prices. Under certain strict conditions, consumers could gain in the short run but suffer long term harm from such practices if they eventually result in a sufficient reduction of competitors and capacity in a market. The hypothetical nature of such harm has led some to conclude that instead of prohibiting mergers having potentially harmful portfolio effects, competition agencies should instead take a wait and see attitude. That would involve using abuse of dominance or monopolisation prohibitions to control negative effects should they actually materialise.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7>
Chapter 2. Ecosystem Dynamics ¤ From ecosystems we derive food and fiber, fuel and pharmaceuticals. Ecosystems mediate local and regional climates, stabilize soils, purify water, and in general provide a nearly endless list of services essential to life as we know it. To understand how to manage these services it is essential to understand how ecological communities are organized and how to measure the biological diversity they contain. Ecological communities are comprised of many species, which are in turn made up of large numbers of individuals, each with their own separate ecological and evolutionary agendas. Not all species are equal as regards their role in maintaining the functioning of ecosystems or their resiliency in the face of stress. This chapter explains how ecosystems evolve and function as complex adaptive systems. It examines ecological systems at scales from the small to the large, from the individual to the collective to the community, from the leaf to the plant to the biosphere (including the global carbon cycle). It reviews theoretical and empirical models of ecosystem dynamics, which are highly nonlinear and contain the potential for qualitative and irreversible shifts. It considers applications to forests, fisheries, grasslands, and freshwater lakes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061619-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075236-7>
Chapter 7 Housing subsidies : Effects on housing decisions, efficiency, and equity ¤ This chapter discusses housing subsidies. The American housing market is subject to a mind-boggling array of government interventions by various levels of government. These include: housing codes, that set quality standards that must be met by builders; licensure of real estate brokers and sales people; exclusionary zoning, which stipulates that land in a given area can be used only for certain purposes; open housing laws, that prohibit discrimination in the selling of housing; rent control; interest rate and other regulations on mortgage lending institutions; urban renewal programs, under which communities use their powers of eminent domain to acquire urban land, destroy slums, and sell the land to private developers; real estate taxation; and interventions in the credit market to increase the flow of credit to housing. The chapter focuses on the two most important federal policies toward housing, at least in terms of costs to the government.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4242500-1>
Recent trends in institutional investors statistics ¤ Data to measure and analyse the increasing role of institutional investors in capital markets has been collected and published by the OECD for a number of years. This dataset is now integrated in the framework of the OECD Financial Accounts. This article presents an overview of institutional investors’ assets, their components and their development in the aggregate and by country.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6>
Chapter 11. High-Skilled Immigration in a Globalized Labor Market ¤ The economics literature on the international migration of skilled workers is reviewed and recent policy trends are evaluated. The theoretical implications of skilled migration are discussed within the context of the benefits to the skilled immigrant, the sending country, and the receiving country. The types of immigrant selection mechanisms are also detailed, with emphasis on their advantages and disadvantages. The recent immigration policies of a number of major immigrant-receiving countries such as Canada, the US, and Australia are critically evaluated. The expanded use of skilled temporary foreign workers and international students is discussed, as is and the recent emergence of two-step immigration policies that favor temporary migrants already in the country as sources of permanent immigration. An overview of key results in the literature on the economic performance of skilled immigrants is presented with a particular focus on the wage returns to skill both in terms of regulated and unregulated occupations. The implications of competition among the growing number of countries with skilled immigration policies are considered.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069332-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4501977-0>
Plea bargaining : settlement of cartel cases ¤ Plea agreements or negotiated settlements can be an efficient way to formally dispose of cartel cases. They can provide substantial benefits to competition authorities by allowing them to allocate their resources more efficiently and to increase enforcement activities, thus achieving greater deterrence. Plea agreements have substantial benefits for defendants as well.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Whatever happened to Canada-US economic growth and productivity performance in the information age? ¤ Some of the recent “hype” about how advances in technology are forging a “new economy” has evaporated. Interest in “dot.com” start-up companies in the US has waned with the decline in stock market valuations. Some of the more extravagant claims – in particular, that the “new economy” would see the end to recessions – have been tempered by the recent slowdown in the US economy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2>
Private pensions and policy responses to the financial economic crisis ¤ This article discusses responses to current financial and economic crisis by regulators, supervisors and policy makers in the area of private pensions. These responses are examined in the light of international guidelines, best practices and recommendations to improve the design of private pensions. Policy makers are reminded that private pensions continue to play an important role in a balanced pension system, with security coming from diversity of provision.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Chapter 7 Growth Theory through the Lens of Development Economics ¤ Growth theory has traditionally assumed the existence of an aggregate production function, whose existence and properties are closely tied to the assumption of optimal resource allocation within each economy. We show extensive evidence, culled from the micro-development literature, demonstrating that the assumption of optimal resource allocation fails radically. The key fact is the enormous heterogeneity of rates of return to the same factor within a single economy, a heterogeneity that dwarfs the cross-country heterogeneity in the economy-wide average return. Prima facie, we argue, this evidence poses problems for old and new growth theories alike. We then review the literature on various causes of this misallocation. We go on to calibrate a simple model which explicitly introduces the possibility of misallocation into an otherwise standard growth model. We show that, in order to match the data, it is enough to have misallocated factors: there also needs to be important fixed costs in production. We conclude by outlining the contour of a possible non-aggregate growth theory, and review the existing attempts to take such a model to the data.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059252-2>
Chapter 12 Solidarity Norms and Institutions in Village Societies: Static and Dynamic Considerations ¤ The purpose of this essay is to argue that process-regarding preferences or social norms are pervasive in traditional village communities, yet are subject to gradual erosion under the influence of new forces, particularly population growth and market penetration. This is illustrated with respect to norms regarding the allocation of locally controlled natural resources, such as land, forest, pastures and water spaces. As a matter of fact, a communal system of land rights, together with the accompanying set of norms and preferences, is conceivable only under conditions of high landman ratios resulting in extensive land use patterns. When land becomes intensively exploited, the efficiency costs of equity-oriented arrangements increase significantly. On the other hand, informal insurance arrangements relying on voluntary state-contingent transfers tend to be less effective under the pressure of market integration and the emergence of alternative income-earning opportunities accessible to at least a segment of rural populations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4302876-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020511-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129281-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184535-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057542-1>
Chapter 33. The Political Economy of Government Debt ¤ This chapter critically reviews the literature which explains why and under which circumstances governments accumulate more debt than it would be consistent with optimal fiscal policy. We also discuss numerical rules or institutional designs which might lead to a moderation of these distortions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Improving the efficiency of health care spending : What can be learnt from partial and selected analyses of hospital performance? ¤ There are no ready-made data on hospital outputs and inputs which would allow comprehensive international comparisons of hospital efficiency to be carried out. This paper, therefore, relies on selected evidence to compare hospital efficiency in a sub-set of OECD countries, based on three different approaches relying on, respectively: i) unit costs for standard hospital treatments; ii) overall efficiency levels in a set of paired countries; iii) within-country dispersion in individual hospital efficiency. The analysis suggests substantial cross-country differences in hospital performance. Although country coverage varies between the different approaches, making it difficult to assess the extent to which comparisons provide a consistent picture of national efficiency levels, cross-checks between the different indicator sets tend to support the robustness of the country rankings.

Chapter 22. Strategic Interactions Between Modern Law and Custom ¤ The question of the role of statutory law in social environments permeated by custom and traditional norms is particularly important when the state law aims to correct social inequalities embedded in the custom. The conventional view is that modern law often fails to take root in custom-driven poor societies, especially when the formal law conflicts with the custom. Based on a simple, static analytical model, we argue that from the low activity of modern courts we cannot infer that the statutory law is ineffectual. Indeed, there may be an effective indirect impact exerted through a ‘magnet’ effect of the formal law on the informal rulings of customary authorities. We highlight various factors impinging on this effect and illustrate their operation with a number of examples drawn from the existing literature, as well as from the authors’ own field experience. Another striking result is that pro-poor radicalism may defeat its own purpose: under certain conditions, a moderate law better serves the interests of the poor than a radical law. The same conclusion can actually be reached with the help of a more complex model in which the size of the community subject to customary mediation is itself endogenous, and the benefits and costs of remaining within the customary jurisdiction relative to those of going to the formal court depend themselves on community size. The purpose of the chapter is therefore to open to the instruments of micro-economic analysis a new field: interactions between modern statutory law and custom in the context of developing countries subject to strong and sometimes inegalitarian social norms. It will be argued that the economist’s tools can shed useful light on certain empirical facts and observations of legal anthropologists and other social scientists.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4>
Chapter 16 Credit markets and interlinked transactions ¤ This chapter presents a discussion on credit markets and interlinked transactions. The chapter discusses a general specification of a credit contract, which is then specialized to yield the three main models to have appeared in the literature. In so doing, most of the important themes and ideas are introduced. The chapter discusses some of the relevant evidence that establishes the empirical importance of interlinking. Following a discussion of the reasons for interlinking, the principal-agent and bargaining theoretic approaches are compared and contrasted in the context of resource allocation, innovation, and welfare. The exposition refers to rural life and its principal actors: farmers, laborers, landlords, tenants, moneylenders, and traders. Much of the analysis, however, can be applied readily to urban life, though the balance of emphasis between the problems of hidden information and hidden actions must then be shifted in favor of the former. Two themes identified above recur throughout this chapter and exert considerable influence over its analytical approach and emphasis. First, where information is concerned, there is the distinction between not knowing what sort of person one is dealing with, which may result in adverse selection, and not knowing what actions that person will take if a contract is sealed, which may result in moral hazard. Second, the problems of contractual enforcement and willful, or strategic, default by borrowers are given a prominent place in the analysis. A third theme stems from these departures from the framework of complete and competitive marketsnamely, how the scope for strategic behavior is resolved in equilibrium. The principal-agent formulation appears in a number of guises throughout the chapter. Strategic default has had a prominent place in the analysis of this chapter.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213090-6>
The Missing Martyrs: Why There Are So Few Muslim Terrorists ¤ Rarely does a topic of controversial concern such as “Muslim terrorism” receive the attention of a seasoned specialist with decades of expertise. Such is the greatest strength of Charles Kurzman's latest monograph, The Missing Martyrs. Here, Kurzman interrogates common presumptions that permeate both academic and popular conceptions about Muslim terrorists and their relationship to the Islamic tradition. With a balanced and accessible tone, he polemically—yet empirically—answers a widely held false presumption best, captured in the question “[I]f there are more than a billion Muslims in the world, many of whom supposedly hate the West and desire martyrdom, why don't we see terrorist attacks everywhere, every day?” (7).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049420-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Chapter 14 The employment relationship: Job attachment, work effort, and the nature of contracts ¤ In the U.S. economy, approximately 100 million workers are matched with market work activities on any given day. Millions more are matched with the nonmarket activities of various kinds, including child rearing, the home production of a variety of goods and services, and schooling. Economic efficiency requires that (1) specific individuals and activities be appropriately matched and (2) the individuals, once matched, undertake the activity with an appropriate level of effort or intensity. This chapter discusses the economic forces that influence and define the important aspects of elements of the employment relationship in a market economy. In the chapter, three aspects of the employment relationship are reviewed: (1) the supply of work effort by the employee, (2) the investment in employeremployee match specific skills, and (3) the provision of earnings insurance by the employer. The supply and demand for work effort of individual workers is an obvious and crucial factor in the employment relationship. Employers have preferences about the intensity with which employees undertake their tasks, which may be quite at variance with those of the employees.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9>
Chapter 11. Sovereign Debt ¤ In this chapter, we use a benchmark limited-commitment model to explore key issues in the economics of sovereign debt. After highlighting conceptual issues that distinguish sovereign debt as well as reviewing a number of empirical facts, we use the model to discuss debt overhang, risk-sharing, and capital flows in an environment of limited enforcement. We also discuss recent progress on default and renegotiation; self-fulfilling debt crises; and incomplete markets and their quantitative implications. We conclude with a brief assessment of the current state of the literature and highlight some directions for future research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1>
Chapter 64 Learning in Entry Limit Pricing Games ¤ This chapter examines whether refinements based on forward induction or simple adaptive learning models are better able to capture behavior in signaling game experiments. This chapter also finds that observed behavior is inconsistent with either the equilibrium refinements literature or pure belief-based adaptive learning models. An augmented adaptive learning model in which some players recognize the existence of dominated strategies and their consequences successfully captures the major qualitative features of the data.Equilibrium refinements do quite poorly in capturing our results. The refinements say nothing about the observed dynamics of play and cannot predict observed differences between Treatments I and IB and between Treatments II, III, and IV. The results of Treatment V are completely inconsistent with any refinement to sequential equilibrium. All of these results can be characterized by a simple belief-based learning model augmented to allow for some limited reasoning ability by players.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1>
Chapter 1. Learning About Learning in Dynamic Economic Models ¤ This chapter of the Handbook of Computational Economics is mostly about research on active learning and is confined to discussion of learning in dynamic models in which the system equations are linear, the criterion function is quadratic, and the additive noise terms are Gaussian. Though there is much work on learning in more general systems, it is useful here to focus on models with these specifications since more general systems can be approximated in this way and since much of the early work on learning has been done with these quadratic-linear-gaussian systems. We begin with what has been learned about learning in dynamic economic models in the last few decades. Then we progress to a discussion of what we hope to learn in the future from a new project that is just getting underway. However before doing either of these we provide a short description of the mathematical framework that will be used in the chapter.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5>
Chapter 12 The Walrasian Auction ¤ This chapter examines the robustness of his results in a more general multi-unit per subject setting and systematically investigates the effect of various order flow information and message restriction rules on the performance of the Walrasian auction. This experimental environment allows us to assess the performance of the Walrasian auction where participants have multiple units and where relative competitiveness is variable period to period. This chapter also presents Walrasian auction design and computerized implementation. The chapter presents the mean efficiency and competitive price deviation in the later periods of the experiments. There is no significant difference in efficiency and price between the oral and computerized treatments. The chapter show that the supply and demand match is not correct, and suggests the presence of significant underrevelation on both sides of the market: if either side underreveals to gain an advantage, the other side underreveals to neutralize that advantage.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1>
Chapter 37 Philanthropy ¤ Charity on the English and early American model must be distinguished from philanthropy as it developed in America at the turn of the twentieth century. Philanthropy aims at the systemic eradication of social ills rather than, as does charity, at their amelioration. The general purpose philanthropic foundation became the standard vehicle for effecting this purpose, and made significant contributions to a variety of fields until the Great Depression, though funding for the arts was fairly limited. Much of the role of foundations was assumed by the federal government as it expanded in power and scope after World War II, often adopting the foundation modus operandi as its own. Partly as a result, foundations began to support the arts and culture, and when corporate philanthropy emerged in the 1950s it was also often aimed at the arts and culture. The National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities have been responsible since 1965 for the central government contribution to these fields. Recent changes in the foundation sector include the growth in the number of new, very well endowed foundations; the emergence of conservative foundations; a contraction in the scope of foundation funding, including fewer and smaller grants to the arts and culture; and the rising number of community and family foundations. American philanthropy is undoubtedly responsive to government policy and economic cycles, but there remains despite vicissitudes a unique affinity for philanthropy in the United States, perhaps explained in part by the relative weakness of the American state. In Europe, a different historical tradition and legal framework has given rise to different forms of support for the arts and culture, with a greater role for the state. Recent trends, however, suggest that non-American philanthropy is coming to resemble philanthropy in the United States.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4>
Chapter 6 Arms races and proliferation ¤ Previous analyses of arms races and proliferation are integrated and extended, building from a treatment of the behavioral foundations of weapons acquisitions to a general theory of arms races, with implications for the role of negotiations, the balance of power, the timing of crises, and nuclear proliferation. Recent developments in economic theory are also applied here to the problems of the arms race, nuclear proliferation, and the outbreak of war, yielding a deeper treatment of these phenomena by directly or indirectly treating asymmetric information in bargaining, repeated games that involve threats, and principal-agent problems in decisions on technology and weapons accumulation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132793-7>
Series Editors ¤ The series Handbooks in Economics produces handbooks for various branches of economics, each of which is a definitive source, reference, and teaching supplement for use by professional researchers and advanced graduate students. Each book provides self-contained surveys of the current state of a branch of economics in the form of chapters prepared by leading specialists on various aspects of this branch of economics. These surveys summarize not only received results but also newer developments, from recent journal articles and discussion papers. Some original material is also included, but the main goal is to provide comprehensive and accessible surveys.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2>

Chapter 14 Numerical dynamic programming in economics ¤ This chapter explores the numerical methods for solving dynamic programming (DP) problems. The DP framework has been extensively used in economics because it is sufficiently rich to model almost any problem involving sequential decision making over time and under uncertainty. The chapter focuses on continuous Markov decision processes (MDPs) because these problems arise frequently in economic applications. Although, complexity theory suggests a number of useful algorithms, the theory has relatively little to say about important practical issues, such as determining the point at which various exponential-time algorithms such as Chebyshev approximation methods start to blow up, making it optimal to switch to polynomial-time algorithms. In future work, it will be essential to provide numerical comparisons of a broader range of methods over a broader range of test problems, including problems of moderate to high dimensionality.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011152-0>
Fiscal equalisation ¤ Fiscal equalisation is a transfer of fiscal resources across jurisdictions to offset disparities in revenue raising capacity or public service cost. It covers on average 2.5% of GDP or 5% of total government expenditure across OECD countries. Equalisation reduces fiscal disparities by two-thirds on average and in some countries levels them virtually out. Strong equalisation comes at a price: on average, around 70% of a jurisdiction’s additional tax income must be dedicated to an equalisation fund. The equalisation rate is generally higher for jurisdictions with low fiscal capacity, reducing their tax effort and likely to slow down regional economic convergence. Cost equalisation is larger than revenue equalisation in terms of GDP despite smaller cost disparities, pointing at inefficiencies in the distribution formulae. Fiscal equalisation can be pro-cyclical but most countries succeed in reducing fluctuations of entitlements, sometimes at the cost of sub-central budget needs. Fiscal equalisation is very country specific, and data and analysis must be taken with care.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2>
Use of derivatives for debt management and domestic debt market development : Key conclusions ¤ The Ninth OECD/World Bank/IMF Annual Global Bond Market Forum held on 22-23 May 2007 in Paris, France, highlighted that there has been very sharp growth in the use of derivative instruments in both mature and emerging market countries. The use of derivative instruments is helping public debt managers in their portfolio management operations and in supporting market development. Several institutional and structural impediments, however, remain toward the more active use of derivative products. Most developed market debt managers use derivative instruments for debt management purposes, while this is the case for only a handful of emerging markets. Several emerging markets, though, are taking steps towards developing the legal environment necessary to support derivative markets, and are addressing the challenges posed by illiquidity of the underlying cash market, deficiencies in prudential regulation, and restrictions on market participation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Chapter 26 Optimal economic growth, turnpike theorems and comparative dynamics ¤ This chapter is concerned with the long-term tendencies of paths of capital accumulation that maximize, in some sense, a utility sum for society over an unbounded time span. However, the structure of the problem is characteristic of all economizing over time whether on the social scale or the scale of the individual or the firm. The mathematical methods that are used are closely allied to the old mathematical discipline, calculus of variations. The chapter discusses that the utility function depends on time, as in the standard theory of the calculus of variations. Also the function to be maximized is the sum of utility functions for each period over the future. It is described as a separable utility function over the sequence of future capital stocks and corresponds to the integral of calculus of variations. As the consumption of one period influences the utility of later consumption, the separability assumption is not exact. The treatment of utility in a period as dependent on initial and terminal stocks is not a restriction because the usual assumptions that make utility depend on consumption and consumption on production and terminal stocks implies that an equivalent utility depending on capital stocks exists. The chapter also discusses that the primary sources of the optimal growth model are aggregate savings programs and capital accumulation programs for an economy, the theorems, and methods of the subject find applications in other areas with increasing frequency.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066472-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Chapter 5. The Growth of Cities ¤ Why do cities grow in population, surface area, and income per person? Which cities grow faster and why? To these questions, the urban growth literature has offered a variety of answers. Within an integrated framework, this chapter reviews key theories with implications for urban growth. It then relates these theories to empirical evidence on the main drivers of city growth, drawn primarily from the United States and other developed countries. Consistent with the monocentric city model, fewer roads and restrictions on housing supply hinder urban growth. The fact that housing is durable also has important effects on the evolution of cities. In recent decades, cities with better amenities have grown faster. Agglomeration economies and human capital are also important drivers of city growth. Although more human capital, smaller firms, and a greater diversity in production foster urban growth, the exact channels through which those effects percolate are not clearly identified. Finally, shocks also determine the fate of cities. Structural changes affecting the broader economy have left a big footprint on the urban landscape. Small city-specific shocks also appear to matter, consistent with the recent wave of random growth models.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3>
Regulatory issues related to financial innovation ¤ This note explores various regulatory issues related to financial innovation. It starts from a premise that financial innovations are neither always helpful (or benign) nor always threatening. Innovations have the potential to provide for a more efficient allocation of resources and thereby a higher level of capital productivity and economic growth. Many financial innovations have had this effect. But others have not. Examples of the latter include products that may have been misrepresented to end-users and resulted in delinquencies, bankruptcies or other problems among them, or products that have been inadequately managed with respect to the various credit or market risks they entail. Considerations of problems aside, innovation should be seen as a natural aspect of the workings of a competitive system. Thus, the ideal policy approach is to find an appropriate balance between preserving safety and soundness of the system and allowing financial institutions and markets to perform their intended functions. That approach entails first ensuring that the necessary market-framing and market-perfecting rules are in place and then establishing a proper structure for reviewing financial innovations. Seven steps needed to accomplish this task are outlined in the report.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3>
Tax systems in European Union countries ¤ Despite recent cuts, the tax-to-GDP ratio in most EU countries remains much higher than in other economies. The tax mix is also different, with high tax wedges on labour and a stronger reliance on consumption and environmentally related taxes. While there is not much room for cutting taxes significantly without downsizing public spending, further re-balancing the tax burden away from labour could contribute to better employment performance. Greater reliance on property taxes, which are low by international standards, less use of reduced VAT rates and tax incentives targeted to specific saving vehicles should be considered. EU countries’ experience in reforming their tax system may also provide useful insights for other regions where international integration is deepening. The free movement of goods, people and capital within the EU area, combined with the advent of the single currency, has also affected the design of national tax systems and has brought to the fore a number of international taxation issues.

Chapter 23. The Performance of Alternative Monetary Regimes ¤ This paper compares the performance of economies with different monetary regimes during the last quarter century. The conclusions include: (1) There is little evidence that inflation targeting affects performance in advanced economies, but some evidence of benefits in emerging economies; (2) Europe's monetary union has increased intra-European trade and capital flows, but divergence in national price levels may destabilize output in the future; (3) The monetary analysis of the European Central Bank has little effect on the ECB's policy decisions; and (4) Countries with hard currency pegs experience unusually severe recessions when capital flight occurs.

Chapter 14 Regional energy and environmental analysis ¤ This chapter focuses on regional energy and environmental analysis. A basic feature of economic activity is the extraction of materials from the environment, their transformation during production and consumption, and their final restoration to the environment. The economics of environmental resources focuses on the types, forms, and quantities of materials returned, their destinations, and the laws, institutions and markets governing their return to the environment. Energy economics is concerned with similar issues pertaining to the removal and use of energy resources from the environment. The chapter discusses the meaning of energy and environmental resources and describes their special characteristics that are thought to make the regional implications of their production important. It also discusses the effects of energy markets and the importance of energy rents in the interregional distribution of income and elaborates the role of environmental rents in the interregional distribution. The analysis of the distributional effects of energy and environmental resources is an important example of how regional economics is a fruitful approach. The chapter also describes a number of available formal theoretical and empirical models for the analysis of regional effects of the production and use of energy and environmental resources.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9>
Chapter 2. Field Experiments in Labor Economics ¤ We overview the use of field experiments in labor economics. We showcase studies that highlight the central advantages of this methodology, which include: (i) using economic theory to design the null and alternative hypotheses; (ii) engineering exogenous variation in real world economic environments to establish causal relations and learn about the underlying mechanisms; and (iii) engaging in primary data collection and often working closely with practitioners. To highlight the potential for field experiments to inform issues in labor economics, we organize our discussion around the individual life cycle. We therefore consider field experiments related to the accumulation of human capital, the demand and supply of labor, and behavior within firms, and close with a brief discussion of the nascent literature of field experiments related to household decision making.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9>
Chapter 46 Urban transportation ¤ We use applied microeconomics to examine several salient problems of urban transportation: traffic congestion, air pollution, the costs of motor vehicle accidents and the future of public transportation. Throughout this chapter, we focus on analytic methods and findings that bear on current policy issues, and on the factual basis for policy analysis. We find that the most promising approaches in each case are narrowly targeted to solving market failures, such as the existence of externalities, and that these approaches are unlikely to alter the overall dominance of automobiles in urban passenger transportation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9>
Legal and regulatory aspects of long-term operation of nuclear power plants in OECD member countries ¤ Nuclear power plants are typically designed to operate for 30 to 40 years. Between 2010 and 2020 a large number of nuclear power plants in the world and in OECD member countries, in particular, will reach their 30th or 40th anniversary. 1 As of June 2011, out of 440 nuclear power plants operating in the world, approximately 81% had been in operation for more than 20 years and about 35% for more than 30 years.2 In OECD member countries there are at present 339 nuclear reactors in operation, of which 135 reactors (39.8% of the total number) are over 30 years old and 15 reactors (4.4% of the total number) are over 40 years old. All nuclear reactors in Finland have reached their 30th anniversary while in the United States 56% of all reactors are beyond 30. In the United Kingdom and Germany about 42% of nuclear reactors are older than 30 years while in Canada, France and Japan, the respective percentages in this age bracket amount to 22%, 34% and 30%.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068925-6>
Chapter 8. Dropouts and Diplomas : The Divergence in Collegiate Outcomes ¤ Although collegiate attainment rates have risen in many developed and developing countries over the last three decades, they have remained essentially flat in the United States over the same period. In this chapter, we distinguish various models of degree attainment in the general context of theoretical and empirical specifications of educational attainment. To explain collegiate degree attainment, we consider the roles of student demand, the supply side of the postsecondary education market, and the role of public support in determining outcomes. Although the study of college degree attainment has traditionally focused on demand-side determinants of attainment, including how students finance college attainment and academic preparation, we present here the evidence that supply-side determinants including the level of public subsidies and the associated stratification among colleges and universities are also important determinants of degree attainment. Review of this evidence and research suggests a number of unexplored areas for economic research related to college choice, in-college attainment, and the supply-side determinants of stratification and resources per student.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2>
Chapter 12. Forecasters’ Objectives and Strategies ¤ This chapter develops a unified modeling framework for analyzing the strategic behavior of forecasters. The theoretical model encompasses reputational objectives, competition for the best accuracy, and bias. Also drawing from the extensive literature on analysts, we review the empirical evidence on strategic forecasting and illustrate how our model can be structurally estimated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047390-9>
Chapter 63 Econometric Tools for Analyzing Market Outcomes ¤ This paper outlines recently developed techniques for estimating the primitives needed to empirically analyze equilibrium interactions and their implications in oligopolistic markets. It is divided into an introduction and three sections; a section on estimating demand functions, a section on estimating production functions, and a section on estimating “dynamic” parameters (parameters estimated through their implications on the choice of controls which determine the distribution of future profits). The introduction provides an overview of how these primitives are used in typical I.O. applications, and explains how the individual sections are structured. The topics of the three sections have all been addressed in prior literature. Consequently each section begins with a review of the problems I.O. researchers encountered in using the prior approaches. The sections then continue with a fairly detailed explanation of the recent techniques and their relationship to the problems with the prior approaches. Hopefully the detail is rich enough to enable the reader to actually program up a version of the techniques and use them to analyze data. We conclude each section with a brief discussion of some of the problems with the more recent techniques. Here the emphasis is on when those problems are likely to be particularly important, and on recent research designed to overcome them when they are.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Chapter 8 Regional, interregional and multiregional input-output analysis ¤ This chapter focuses on regional, interregional, and multiregional input-output analysis. Unlike many other branches of regional economics and regional science, the development of regional and interregional models occurred almost contemporaneously with the growth of interest in national-level input-output modeling. In the book, Studies in the structure of the American economy , there is a discussion on regional models, specifically on the theory of interregional models and on some of the empirical and conceptual problems associated with regional analysis. These developments are discussed in more detail in the chapter. It presents some linkages of input-output analysis with other standard modeling techniques, further reinforcing the notion that the input-output framework has a considerable degree of flexibility in its contribution to an understanding of the structure of an economy. The chapter explores in detail the input-output model and its characteristics and provides several extensions of input-output analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4>
How to Foster Investments in Long-Term Assets such as Infrastructure ¤ Mobilising private sector funding is essential in bridging the infrastructure funding gap. This can be done by appropriate regulation, targeted public financial support, and active involvement by institutional investors. Creating an appropriate policy framework and lifting regulatory constraints on long-term investments will foster financial stability of retirement savings systems and enable the development of strategic infrastructure projects that contribute to long-term growth. As capital markets and bank funding have dried up as sources of infrastructure financing after the global financial crisis, finding alternative long-term debt sources is critical. Private infrastructure financing can be promoted by targeted public measures and by building an infrastructure management culture amongst asset managers. Infrastructure investments also require long-term policy planning, with long-term strategic policy frameworks that exceed political cycles and are built on wide political consensus. Stable and accessible programmes of infrastructure projects and public-private partnerships (PPPs) are key in attracting private sector investors, complemented by adequate regulation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Chapter 7 Increasing returns, imperfect markets, and trade theory ¤ This chapter discusses two major issues: explanations of trade patterns and gains from trade. The classical traditions were mainly concerned with gains from trade and other welfare effects. The theory of international trade is surveyed in the presence of economies of scale and monopolistic competition, with an emphasis on predictions of trade patterns and gains from trade. The main ingredient of this logic is that the allocation of productive resources is guided in every country by the reward level of every sector's employed combination of factors of production. Economies of scale, which arise from conglomeration or public intermediate inputs, seem to be country specific, and due to transportation costs within-industry specialization in some stages of production are countries specific. It seems, therefore, that the size of a domestic industry plays a role in the determination of external economies of scale. But it is also clear that some sources of these scale economies affect more than a single industry, which implies cross-industry spillovers of external economies of scale. The chapter provides an overview on the general model of trade in homogeneous products when there are variable returns to scale and free entry into industries.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1>
The policy determinants of investment in tertiary education ¤ The purpose of this article is to discuss how policies can affect investment in tertiary education in ways that would eliminate some of the perceived shortcomings of existing systems, while preserving or (preferably) enhancing equality of access to higher education. To this end, the analysis focuses on the institutional set-up of tertiary education that provides incentives for supplying quality educational services; the private returns from higher education which act to attract prospective students; and, individual funding mechanisms to help overcome the liquidity constraints that may restrict participation in higher education. These mechanisms should also be designed so as to prevent uncertainty about future incomes from unduly deterring investment in tertiary studies by risk-averse individuals.

Highlights of OECD Financial Outreach Activities in 2004 ¤ Following the end of the “Cold War”, the OECD has, since the early 1990s, been conducting “Outreach” activities (i.e. policy dialogue and capacity-building cooperation activities with non-Member economies), first with the Central and Eastern European countries in transition, and now extending to many other emerging economies. These “Outreach” activities have of course included financial sector reform, as the financial sector is often considered one of the key sectors in assisting these economies’ developments. The OECD’s efforts in this area have focused on, and continue to give primary attention to, capital market reform (including corporate governance) as well as insurance and pension market policies and reform on a regional basis; they have been recently targeting Asia, as this...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3>
Chapter 11 First Price Independent Private Values Auctions ¤ The first price sealed bid auction is the market institution in which the high bidder acquires ownership of the auctioned item and pays a price equal to the amount of the highest bid. This market institution is distinguished from the second price sealed bid auction in which the high bidder obtains the auctioned item and pays an amount equal to the second highest bid. Bids in sealed bid auctions are often literally sealed in envelopes but need not be; the essential distinction is from a real time auction in which the time at which bids are submitted during the auction is an essential feature of the market institution. This chapter presents experimental tests, using independent private values, of the consistency of bidding behavior in the first price auction with three nested Nash equilibrium bidding models. The reported tests have various implications for the three nested models. Depending on which test is used, data for only 1/10 of the subjects are consistent with the risk neutral model. This conclusion is the same regardless of whether one conducts the tests with market prices, individual subjects' bids and values, or subjects' expected foregone earnings. Tests with individual subjects' bids and values indicate that data for about 48 of the subjects are consistent with the constant relative risk averse model and data for almost all subjects are consistent with the log-concave model.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1>
Chapter 9. Solution and Estimation Methods for DSGE Models ¤ This chapter provides an overview of solution and estimation techniques for dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models.

Chapter 3. Multidimensional Poverty and Inequality ¤ This chapter examines different approaches to the measurement of multidimensional inequality and poverty. It first outlines three aspects preliminary to any multidimensional study: the selection of the relevant dimensions, the indicators used to measure them, and the procedures for their weighting. It then considers the counting approach and the axiomatic treatment in poverty measurement. Finally, it reviews the axiomatic approach to inequality analysis. The chapter also provides a selective review of the rapidly growing theoretical literature with the twofold aim of highlighting areas for future research and offering some guidance on how to use multidimensional methods in empirical and policy-oriented applications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7>
Chapter 3. Money and Inflation : Some Critical Issues ¤ We consider what, if any, relationship there is between monetary aggregates and inflation, and whether there is any substantial reason for modifying the current mainstream mode of policy analysis, which frequently does not consider monetary aggregates at all. We begin by considering the body of thought known as the “quantity theory of money.” The quantity theory centers on the prediction that there will be a long-run proportionate reaction of the price level to an exogenous increase in the nominal money stock. The nominal homogeneity conditions that deliver the quantity-theory result are the same as those that deliver monetary neutrality, an important principle behind policy formulation. The quantity theory implies a ceteris paribus unitary relationship between inflation and money growth. Simulations of a New Keynesian model suggest that we should expect this relationship to be apparent in time series data, with no heavy averaging or filtering required, but with allowance needed for the phase shift in the relationship between monetary growth rates and inflation. While financial innovation can obscure the relationship between monetary growth and inflation, evidence of a money growth/inflation relationship does emerge from the United States time series and G7 panel data. Various considerations suggest that studies of inflation and monetary policy behavior can benefit from including both interest rates and money in the empirical analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2>
Chapter 36 Political economy of agricultural policy ¤ Explanations are provided for why governments do as they do in agriculture. Alternative frameworks are assessed to explain government policy including collective action and politician-voter interaction models. Several key patterns of policies are analyzed including the “developmental paradox” where the tendency for support to agriculture increases with GDP and decreases with the proportion of the population in agriculture. The chapter also assesses why governments employ inefficient policy instruments in agriculture, why there appears to be a status quo bias, and why policy is biased against trade. Particular emphasis is given on the interaction between redistributive and growth-promoting policies.

Chapter 111 Payoff Scale Effects and Risk Preference Under Real and Hypothetical Conditions ¤ The use of monetary incentives may not affect behavior much in some contexts, or it may simply reduce the dispersion of data around some theoretical prediction. But the experiments indicate that incentive effects may be large and systematic in other contexts. In the absence of a widely accepted theory of when incentives matter, it is probably not advisable to derive scientific conclusions from laboratory studies that do not provide clear, salient motivation. The evidence surveyed here shows that relying on hypothetical payments can yield misleading results in some circumstances. Moreover, social scientists do not have a good feel for when to believe hypothetical choice patterns. Given this, they believe that performance-based incentives should be used in economics experiments, and results motivated by hypothetical incentives should be interpreted with caution.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2>
Chapter 59 Evaluating Anti-Poverty Programs ¤ The chapter critically reviews the methods available for the ex post counterfactual analysis of programs that are assigned exclusively to individuals, households or locations. The emphasis is on the problems encountered in applying these methods to anti-poverty programs in developing countries, drawing on examples from actual evaluations. Two main lessons emerge. Firstly, despite the claims of advocates, no single method dominates; rigorous, policy-relevant evaluations should be open-minded about methodology, adapting to the problem, setting and data constraints. Secondly, future efforts to draw useful lessons from evaluations call for more policy-relevant data and methods than used in the classic assessment of mean impact for those assigned to the program.

Chapter 21. Democracy, Redistribution, and Inequality ¤ In this paper we revisit the relationship between democracy, redistribution, and inequality. We first explain the theoretical reasons why democracy is expected to increase redistribution and reduce inequality, and why this expectation may fail to be realized when democracy is captured by the richer segments of the population; when it caters to the preferences of the middle class; or when it opens up disequalizing opportunities to segments of the population previously excluded from such activities, thus exacerbating inequality among a large part of the population. We then survey the existing empirical literature, which is both voluminous and full of contradictory results. We provide new and systematic reduced-form evidence on the dynamic impact of democracy on various outcomes. Our findings indicate that there is a significant and robust effect of democracy on tax revenues as a fraction of GDP, but no robust impact on inequality. We also find that democracy is associated with an increase in secondary schooling and a more rapid structural transformation. Finally, we provide some evidence suggesting that inequality tends to increase after democratization when the economy has already undergone significant structural transformation, when land inequality is high, and when the gap between the middle class and the poor is small. All of these are broadly consistent with a view that is different from the traditional median voter model of democratic redistribution: democracy does not lead to a uniform decline in post-tax inequality, but can result in changes in fiscal redistribution and economic structure that have ambiguous effects on inequality.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7>
Country Review: El Salvador ¤ The OECD has been active in promoting competition policy among countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and formed a partnership with the Inter-American Development Bank to further this aim. The principal feature of this partnership has been the annual Latin American Competition Forum (LACF), at which senior officials from countries in the region discuss, in roundtable fashion, issues of competition policy of interest to them. Each of the first four Forums featured a peer review of one country in the region. At the fifth Forum held in 2007, work focused on the four Latin American peer review reports which had been produced in the framework of the Latin American Competition Forum (Brazil, Chile, Peru and Argentina) as well as the peer review of Mexico held in the OECD Competition Committee. This work assessed the impact that the peer reviews have had on competition policy and on the competition agencies in the countries concerned. “Peer review” is a core element of OECD work. The mechanisms of peer review vary, but it is founded upon the willingness of a country to submit its laws and policies to substantive questioning by other members of the international community. This process provides valuable insights to the reviewed country and promotes transparency and mutual understanding for the benefit of all.There is an emerging consensus on best practices in competition law enforcement and in applying competition policy principles to regulatory systems. Countries now co-operate regularly in such areas as anticartel enforcement and international mergers. Peer reviews are an important part of this process. The OECD and the IDB are pleased to have participated in this partnership for the promotion of competition policy in Latin America and the Caribbean. This work is consistent with the policies and goals of both organisations. Sound competition policy will promote economic growth and prosperity, bringing benefits to consumers in the region and substantially improving the business climate. Both organisations would like to thank the Government of El Salvador for volunteering to be peer reviewed at the sixth LACF meeting, held in Panama, on 10-11 September 2008. Finally, we want to thank Mr. John Clark, the author of the report, and the many competition officials whose written and oral contributions to the Forum have been so important to its success.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Chapter 11. The Anatomy of Health Insurance ¤ This article describes the anatomy of health insurance. It begins by considering the optimal design of health insurance policies. Such policies must make tradeoffs appropriately between risk sharing on the one hand and agency problems such as moral hazard (the incentive of people to seek more care when they are insured) and supplier-induced demand (the incentive of physicians to provide more care when they are well reimbursed) on the other. Optimal coinsurance arrangements make patients pay for care up to the point where the marginal gains from less risk sharing are just offset by the marginal benefits from reduced provision of low valued care. Empirical evidence shows that both moral hazard and demand-inducement are quantitatively important. Coinsurance based on expenditure is a crude control mechanism. Moreover, it places no direct incentives on physicians, who are responsible for most expenditure decisions. To place such incentives on physicians is the goal of supply-side cost containment measures, such as utilization review and capitation. This goal motivates the surge in managed care in the United States, which unites the functions of insurance and provision, and allows for active management of the care that is delivered. The analysis then turns to the operation of health insurance markets. Economists generally favor choice in health insurance for the same reasons they favor choice in other markets: choice allows people to opt for the plan that is best for them and encourages plans to provide services efficiently. But choice in health insurance is a mixed blessing because of adverse selection the tendency of the sick to choose more generous insurance than the healthy. When sick and healthy enroll in different plans, plans disproportionately composed of poor risks have to charge more than they would if they insured an average mix of people. The resulting high premiums create two adverse effects: they discourage those who are healthier but would prefer generous care from enrolling in those plans (because the premiums are so high), and they encourage plans to adopt measures that deter the sick from enrolling (to reduce their overall costs). The welfare losses from adverse selection are large in practice. Added to them are further losses from premiums that vary with observable health status. Because insurance is contracted for annually, people are denied a valuable form of intertemporal insurance the right to buy health coverage at average rates in the future should they get sick today. As the ability to predict future health status increases, the lack of intertemporal insurance will become more problematic. The article concludes by relating health insurance to the central goal of medical care expenditures better health. Studies to date are not clear on which approaches to health insurance promote health in the most cost-efficient manner. Resolving this question is the central policy concern in health economics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Deregulation, Trade Reform and Innovation in the South African Agriculture Sector ¤ This case study examines the effect of deregulation and trade reform on South Africa’s agriculture sector, which is highly dualistic consisting of a developed commercial sector and a subsistence farming sector. Deregulation and trade reform has led to substantial changes in innovation in the commercial agriculture sector, such as wine and fruit, leading to a large change in composition while innovation seems to have been more limited in subsistence agriculture, which lacks absorption capacity. Legal uncertainties related to land reform may also be a factor which can negatively affect innovation in the commercial farming sector. Keywords: innovation, deregulation, trade reform, South Africa, agriculture, wine, fruit, field crops, foreign investment, absorption capacity.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3>
Chapter 10. Immigration and the Economy of Cities and Regions ¤ In this chapter, we analyze immigration and its effect on urban and regional economies focusing on productivity and labor markets. While immigration policies are typically national, the effects of international migrants are often more easily identified on local economies. The reason is that their settlements are significantly concentrated across cities and regions, relative to natives. Immigrants are different from natives in several economically relevant skills. Their impact on the local economy depends on these skills. We emphasize that to evaluate correctly such impact, we also need to understand and measure the local adjustments produced by the immigrant flow. Workers and firms take advantage of the opportunities brought by immigrants and respond to them trying to maximize their welfare. We present a common conceptual frame to organize our analysis of the local effects of immigration, and we describe several applications. We then discuss the empirical literature that has tried to isolate and identify a causal impact of immigrants on the local economies and to estimate the different margins of response and the resulting outcomes for natives of different skill types. We finally survey promising recent avenues for advancing this research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4239568-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4>
Chapter 2 The location of production activities ¤ This chapter discusses the issue of location for production activities. In general, the availability of resources, the location of population as a source of labor and as potential markets, soil, climate, and technical conditions rule out many locations for any specific economic activity. What remains is a set of feasible locations among which an economic choice is to be made. The main problems facing the location theorists can be listed as spatial demand and supply; spatial pricing and output; locational choice; spatial resource (land) use; and spatial equilibrium of production. The chapter discusses the analysis of spatial monopoly. It describes the spatial structure of three different price policies: mill, uniform, and (spatial) discriminatory pricing. The chapter compares these price policies in the context of two firms competing to attract customers, termed as spatial duopoly. The strategic interdependence between these firms may generate serious difficulties regarding the existence of a (noncooperative) price equilibrium.. The chapter also deals with the concept of spatial oligopoly in a homogeneous space. It considers only the mill pricing and compares three solution concepts: Bertrand price equilibrium (competitive oligopoly), Losch price equilibrium (collusive oligopoly), and Cournot quantity equilibrium.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1>
Chapter 3 Monetary policy regimes and economic performance: The historical record ¤ Monetary policy regimes encompass the constraints or limits imposed by custom, institutions and nature on the ability of the monetary authorities to influence the evolution of macroeconomic aggregates. This chapter surveys the historical experience of both international and domestic (national) aspects of monetary regimes from the nineteenth century to the present. We first survey the experience of four broad international monetary regimes: the classical gold standard 1880–1914; the interwar period in which a short-lived restoration of the gold standard prevailed; the postwar Bretton Woods international monetary system (1946–1971) indirectly linked to gold; the recent managed float period (1971–1995). We then present in some detail the institutional arrangements and policy actions of the Federal Reserve in the United States as an important example of a domestic policy regime. The survey of the Federal Reserve subdivides the demarcated broad international policy regimes into a number of episodes. A salient theme in our survey is that the convertibility rule or principle that dominated both domestic and international aspects of the monetary regime before World War I has since declined in its relevance. At the same time, policymakers within major nations placed more emphasis on stabilizing the real economy. Policy techniques and doctrine that developed under the pre-World War I convertible regime proved to be inadequate to deal with domestic stabilization goals in the interwar period, setting the stage for the Great Depression. In the post-World War II era, the complete abandonment of the convertibility principle, and its replacement by the goal of full employment, combined with the legacy of inadequate policy tools and theory from the interwar period, set the stage for the Great Inflation of the 1970s. The lessons from that experience have convinced monetary authorities to reemphasize the goal of low inflation, as it were, committing themselves to rule-like behavior.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8>
Chapter 13. Social Security and Public Insurance ¤ When the challenges of population aging are being debated, the uncertain future of pension systems is a topic of high priority and large controversy. The aim of this chapter is not to provide a “consensus view” on social security and public insurance in aging populations but to put structure on these debates. We formulate a large set of models which we use for simulation exercises to make the challenges and controversies more transparent. The chapter begins with an institutional view of pension systems and population aging which defines the fundamental accounting restrictions which population aging imposes on individual behavior and policy actions. We also provide a brief survey of pension systems in the real world. We then take a behavioral view and study saving and labor supply decisions in an aging population. The third viewpoint is from macroeconomics and focuses on the feedback effects that occur in general equilibrium. We demonstrate that market reactions to population aging significantly reduce the burden of parametric or systemic pension reform. The chapter ends with a short summary of the main lessons and an outlook where further research is most urgently needed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006294-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4334479-3>
Chapter 64 Plantations Agriculture ¤ Large plantations producing tropical cash crops based on hired labor represent a sharp contrast with small family farms, popularly called peasants in developing economies. The family farm is an old institution that has existed since time immemorial, but the plantation is a new institution introduced by Western colonialism for extracting tropical cash crops for export to home countries. Large-scale operation of the plantation was necessary for internalizing gains from investment in infrastructure needed for opening vast tracts of unused lands. However, where the communities of indigenous smallholders had already been established, family farms proved to be equally or more efficient producers of tropical export crops using the family labor of low supervision costs, relative to plantations based on hired labor. This advantage of family farms rose as population density increased and rural infrastructure improved, whereas not only economic but also social drawbacks of the plantation system loomed. However, reforms aimed to break down plantations to the operation of smallholders by a government's coercive power could be disruptive and inefficient. A better approach might be to support the initiative of the private sector to reorganize the plantation system into a more decentralized system, such as the contract farming system in which an agribusiness enterprise manages the processing/marketing process and contracts with small growers on the assured supply of farm-produced raw materials.

Chapter 27 The Computation of Prices Indices ¤ While there are no significant investment characteristics that inhibit art from being considered as an asset, a major hurdle has long been the lack of a systematic measure of its financial performance. Due to its heterogeneity (each piece is different) and its infrequency of trading (the exact same piece does not come to the market very often), the determination of changes in market value is difficult to ascertain. Two estimation methods are commonly used to construct indices. Repeat-sales regression (RSR) uses prices of individual objects traded at two distinct moments in time. If the characteristics of an object do not change (which is usually so for collectibles), the heterogeneity issue is bypassed. The basic idea of the hedonic regression (HR) method is to regress prices on various attributes of objects (dimensions, artist, subject matter, etc.) and to use the residuals of the regression which can be considered as “characteristic-free prices” to compute the price index. The chapter deals with the basics of hedonic and repeat-sales estimators, and tries to interpret in economic terms what both are trying to achieve. It also goes into some more technical details which may be useful for researchers who want to construct such indices, and gives some guidelines on how to go about collecting data, and the choice between RSR and HR that this induces. Both methods are compared using simulated returns, pointing to which method should be used given the data at hand.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1>
Chapter 25. Monetary Policy in Emerging Markets ¤ The characteristics that distinguish most developing countries, compared to large industrialized countries, include: greater exposure to supply shocks in general and trade volatility in particular, procyclicality of both domestic fiscal policy and international finance, lower credibility with respect to both price stability and default risk, and other imperfect institutions. These characteristics warrant appropriate models. Models of dynamic inconsistency in monetary policy and the need for central bank independence and commitment to nominal targets apply even more strongly to developing countries. But because most developing countries are price-takers on world markets, the small open economy model, with nontraded goods, is often more useful than the two-country two-good model. Contractionary effects of devaluation are also far more important for developing countries, particularly the balance sheet effects that arise from currency mismatch. The exchange rate was the favored nominal anchor for monetary policy in inflation stabilizations of the late 1980s and early 1990s. After the currency crises of 1994–2001, the conventional wisdom anointed inflation targeting as the preferred monetary regime in place of exchange rate targets. But events associated with the global crisis of 2007–2009 have revealed limitations to the choice of CPI for the role of price index. The participation of emerging markets in global finance is a major reason why they have by now earned their own large body of research, but it also means that they remain highly prone to problems of asymmetric information, illiquidity, default risk, moral hazard and imperfect institutions. Many of the models designed to fit emerging market countries were built around such financial market imperfections, and few economists thought this inappropriate. With the global crisis of 2007–2009, the tables have turned: economists should now consider drawing on the models of emerging market crises to try to understand the unexpected imperfections and failures of advanced-country financial markets.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019902-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Chapter 7. The Human Capital Model ¤ This chapter contains a detailed treatment of the human capital model of the demand for health which was originally developed in 1972. Theoretical predictions are discussed, and theoretical extensions of the model are reviewed. Empirical research that tests the predictions of the model or studies causality between years of formal schooling completed and good health is surveyed. The model views health as a durable capital stock that yields an output of healthy time. Individuals inherit an initial amount of this stock that depreciates with age and can be increased by investment. The household production function model of consumer behavior is employed to account for the gap between health as an output and medical care as one of many inputs into its production. In this framework the shadow price of health depends on many variables besides the price of medical care. It is shown that the shadow price rises with age if the rate of depreciation on the stock of health rises over the life cycle and falls with education (years of formal schooling completed) if more educated people are more efficient producers of health. An important result is that, under certain conditions, an increase in the shadow price may simultaneously reduce the quantity of health demanded and increase the quantities of health inputs demanded.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Chapter 19. Cross-Country Evidence of the Multiple Causes of Inequality Changes in the OECD Area ¤ This chapter provides a thorough survey of what recent international (i.e., cross-country) studies can tell us about the multiple causes of income inequality in the OECD area with regard to both levels and trends. The survey covers economics literature in particular but also relevant evidence from sociology and political science. We provide an overview of drivers of inequality in six areas: (i) structural macroeconomic sectoral changes, (ii) globalization and technology change, (iii) labor market and other relevant institutions, (iv) politics and political processes, (v) tax/transfer schemes, and (vi) demographic and other microstructural changes. We find that the literature, while extremely rich in partial analysis of all six areas, provides very few analyses with truly multivariate and multicountry specifications for the joint section of the OECD and EU countries. Suggestions include more cross-discipline reflections on various findings. This is now well facilitated by the spectacular development of data, as well as in relation to methodological harmonization across disciplines.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7>
Chapter 29 Empirical Models of Entry and Market Structure ¤ This chapter surveys empirical models of market structure. We pay particular attention to equilibrium models that interpret cross-sectional variation in the number of firms or firm turnover rates. We begin by discussing what economists can in principle learn from models with homogeneous potential entrants. We then turn to models with heterogeneous firms. In the process, we review applications that analyze market structure in airline, retail, professional, auction, lodging, and broadcasting markets. We conclude with a summary of more recent models that incorporate incomplete information, “set identified” parameters, and dynamics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133311-1>
Chapter Fifteen. Competitive Market Mechanisms as Social Choice Procedures ¤ A competitive market mechanism is a prominent example of a nonbinary social choice rule, typically defined for a special class of economic environments in which each social state is an economic allocation of private goods, and individuals’ preferences concern only their own personal consumption. This chapter begins by discussing which Pareto efficient allocations can be characterized as competitive equilibria with lump-sum transfers. It also discusses existence and characterization of such equilibria without lump-sum transfers. The second half of the chapter focuses on continuum economies, for which such characterization results are much more natural, given that agents have negligible influence over equilibrium prices.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066735-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022393-0>
Chapter 4 Immigrants and Their Schooling ¤ This chapter deals with several salient issues about immigrants to the US and their education. These issues include a comparison of the schooling accomplishments of immigrants compared to the native-born both contemporaneously as well as over time. These comparisons emphasize the considerable diversity in the schooling accomplishments among different immigrant sub-groups and between legal and undocumented migrants. Finally, the recent literature suggests that any concern that educational generational progress among Latino immigrants has lagged behind other immigrant groups is largely unfounded.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2>
Lessons from the Last Financial Crisis and the Future Role of Institutional Investors ¤ The dynamics of the financial crisis were driven by underpricing of risk and lack of transparency, which led to a loss of confidence when the bubble finally burst. Crisis resolution involved massive government interventions that caused a permanent transfer of losses to the public sector as well as sovereign-debt crises that may involve painful solutions. Letting banks fail is a necessary disciplinary factor, but this requires a well-defined “game plan” which did not exist in the crisis. Regulatory reforms underway aim at restoring confidence, but they may hamper the long-term potential of institutional investors. Nevertheless, institutional investors should still be able to provide risk capital – except for perhaps pension funds, which have been weakened by demographic developments. Finally, improving governance and reducing excessive risk-taking are important but challenging tasks. More active and involved shareholders could further these goals, but such participation will be hard to achieve. Therefore, transparent bonus and remuneration plans are perhaps the most important initiatives for preventing future systemic financial crises.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Chapter 7. Forecasting Interest Rates ¤ This chapter discusses what the asset-pricing literature concludes about the forecastability of interest rates. It outlines forecasting methodologies implied by this literature, including dynamic, no-arbitrage term structure models and their macro-finance extensions. It also reviews the empirical evidence concerning the predictability of future yields on Treasury bonds and future excess returns to holding these bonds. In particular, it critically evaluates theory and evidence that variables other than current bond yields are useful in forecasting.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6>
Social Economics : A Brief Introduction to the Handbook ¤ This chapter provides an introduction to social economics, the study, with the methods of economics, of social phenomena in which aggregates affect individual choices. Such phenomena include social norms and conventions, cultural identities and stereotypes, peer and neighborhood effects, etcetera. The aim is to illustrate the intellectual vitality and richness of the recent literature in social economics by organizing its main contributions in a series of surveys. Social economics, for instance, does not lend itself naturally to a classic distinction along the theory/empirical work line, as concepts and measurements are often developed in tight connection with each other. Traditionally, economists have considered preferences as exogenous parameters for the study of individual choice. These self-imposed constraints have traditionally limited the scope of economic theory outside of purely economic phenomena, such as markets. A different approach to the study of the endogenous formation of preferences is to characterize those systems of preferences that are stable under some specific dynamic selection mechanism. Economists have traditionally studied externalities as well as strategic interactions, that is, environments in which the actions of some agents affect either the set of feasible actions available to other agents or their preferences.

Chapter 29 Arms Trade and Arms Races: A Strategic Analysis ¤ In this chapter we present the main characteristics and problems involved in the study of the arms trade: product definition and data, strategic aspects of the arms trade and regulation. We illustrate these aspects using the latest theoretical and empirical literature on arms trade. The papers reviewed illustrate the complexity involved in studying the arms trade. The nature of the exporters interaction in setting export controls and export policies raises the benefits of coordination in both export control and industrial policies. A failure to coordinate in one of these two policies tends to increase the incentives to deviate from an agreement to coordinate in the other policy, therefore, highlighting the importance of a unified approach to arms trade regulation. Issues such as differences in the security perceptions of exporters, the home bias and the characteristics of the competition between exporter firms may all make the implementation of export controls ever more challenging. Interestingly, although uncertainty will generally make matters worse, it may not if it decreases the effort that exporter firms put into producing higher quality weapons. We argue that supply side regulation will not be enough to prevent arms proliferation among initially non-producer countries, even if supply side controls may have a positive impact on the importers' welfare. In addition, we present a model of the arms trade which encompasses many of the strategic aspects of the problem. The model is mainly based on works by [Levine, P., Smith, R.P. (1995). “The arms trade and arms control”. The Economic Journal 105, 471–484; Levine, P., Smith, R.P. (1997a). “The arms trade”. Economic Policy, 337–370. October] and [Dunne, P., García-Alonso, M.D.C., Levine, P., Smith, R.P. (2005). “Military procurement, industry structure and regional conflict”. Discussion Paper 0502, University of Kent]. It describes the process by which optimization by buyers and sellers within a particular supply regime will result in the determination of prices and quantities. Then the collective action problems suppliers face in establishing an arms export control regime are discussed. Finally, we generalize the model to allow for an endogenous number of firms producing distinct military technologies. We use this model to examine the determinants of market structure in the military sector and how this is affected by globalization in the form of an increasing willingness of governments in arms producing countries to import arms.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134037-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115806-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132793-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063255-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134192-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065004-2>
Chapter 19 Agent-Based Models and Human Subject Experiments ¤ This chapter examines the relationship between agent-based modeling and economic decision-making experiments with human subjects. Both approaches exploit controlled “laboratory” conditions as a means of isolating the sources of aggregate phenomena. Research findings from laboratory studies of human subject behavior have inspired studies using artificial agents in “computational laboratories” and vice versa. In certain cases, both methods have been used to examine the same phenomenon. The focus of this chapter is on the empirical validity of agent-based modeling approaches in terms of explaining data from human subject experiments. We also point out synergies between the two methodologies that have been exploited as well as promising new possibilities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011152-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1>

Preface to the handbook ¤ The subject matter of labor economics continues to have at its core an attempt to systematically find empirical analyses that are consistent with a systematic and parsimonious theoretical understanding of the diverse phenomenon that make up the labor market. As before, many of these analyses are provocative and controversial because they are so directly relevant to both public policy and private decision making. In many ways the modern development in the field of labor economics continues to set the standards for the best work in applied economics. It seems likely that the explosive growth in the development and study of modem labor economics throughout the world will be a major development that will continue throughout the next decade.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127364-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8>
The Contribution of the Asset Management Industry to Long-term Growth ¤ The global asset management industry was severely hit by the worldwide financial crisis, but has recovered well from the crisis. The resiliency of the asset management industry can be explained by a more diversified industry and investors turning to greater diversification in asset classes. The asset management industry is a vital source of economic growth as intermediary in the savings-investment channel. The industry is also one of the most important providers of liquidity needed to ensure smooth functioning of capital markets and provides the means for its clients to diversify their portfolios and achieve their investment goals. Asset managers should act as the ‘stewards’ of their clients’ interest. But less ‘sticky’ liabilities tend to create short-termism of asset managers. A sound governance framework, more transparency, better communication with clients and better management of their expectations may be needed to overcome this problem. But clients themselves, at the institutional as well as retail level, will also have to adopt a more long-term view to appropriately evaluate the risk and returns of their portfolios. Vehicles for longterm retail investment need to be developed and support by fiscal and other incentives may be considered.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6>
Chapter 18 Economics of arms trade ¤ The end of the Cold War has increased the relative importance of economic causes and consequences of arms transfers. Unfortunately, there is surprisingly little theoretical and empirical development of the economics of arms trade, making it a sub-field of defense economics ripe for foundational contributions. We offer some preliminary steps in this direction by applying simple international trade models to the arms trade. Fields other than economics have made major contributions to our understanding of arms transfers. We review the sub-literature on arms transfers and foreign policy leverage as well as the sub-literature on the relationship between arms trade and war. The central problem of the arms trade literature, for both economists and geopolitical scientists, is how to go beyond the proliferation of (albeit useful) policy position articles, to a more solid base of theoretical and empirical models. A new theoretical synthesis of economics and geopolitics would represent a major breakthrough, but the development of the economics of arms trade must move beyond its incipient stages for this synthesis to occur. Ultimately, it would be desirable to see theoretical and empirical work on the arms trade, narrow the range of outcomes which are regarded as plausible.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132793-7>
Chapter 11. Does Culture Matter? ¤ This paper reviews the literature on culture and economics, focusing primarily on the epidemiological approach. The epidemiological approach studies the variation in outcomes across different immigrant groups residing in the same country. Immigrants presumably differ in their cultures but share a common institutional and economic environment. This allows one to separate the effect of culture from the original economic and institutional environment. This approach has been used to study a variety of issues, including female labor force participation, fertility, labor market regulation, redistribution, growth, and financial development among others.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066514-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132883-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120990-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027266-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5>
Chapter 112 Rewards and Behavior in First Price Auctions ¤ The trading rules for the first price auction can be summarized as follows. A single object is offered in perfectly inelastic supply to N > 2 bidders. Each bidder submits a single bid for the commodity with the understanding that the commodity will be awarded to the highest bidder at a price equal to the highest bid. This chapter examines the impact on subjects' behavior of substantial increases in the size of expected laboratory payoffs and experience in the context of a first price auction. Bidding behavior in this institution has been investigated by experimental economists for over 20 years. Virtually all studies reveal behavior in which: (1) bidding behavior across subjects is heterogeneous; and (2) subjects consistently bid above the level predicted for risk-neutral agents, behavior which is consistent with as if risk averse.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Introduction to part 1 ¤ This chapter presents an introduction to the handbook on development economics, Part 1. Development, as contrasted with mere growth of the economy, is, according to Schumpeter, a distinct phenomenon, entirely foreign to what may be observed in the circular flow or in the tendency toward equilibrium. In the dominant neoclassical paradigm of the postwar era, Adam Smith's parable of the invisible hand was rigorously restated in terms of the two fundamental theorems of welfare economics. First, under a set of mild restrictions on production technology and individual preferences, the equilibrium of a laissez-faire market economy is a Pareto optimum. Second, given a set of rather restrictive assumptions, including the absence of technological externalities and increasing returns to scale in production of goods, and convexity of consumer preferences, any Pareto optimum is also a competitive equilibrium provided income (or initial endowments) of individuals can be redistributed through lump-sum transfers or other non-distortionary means. In contrast to the neoclassical approach to development, that is a historic and based on virtual time, there is the historical, real-time Marxian approach that is closer to the spirit of Schumpeter's analysis. In this approach, the forces of production, represented by available technology at any point in historical time, and the existing relations of production, represented by the institutions governing ownership and access to the means of production determine equilibrium.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213090-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7>
Chapter 24 CGE Modeling of Environmental Policy and Resource Management ¤ Computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling is an attempt to use general equilibrium theory as a tool for analysis of resource allocation and income distribution issues in market economies. Since the beginning of the 1990s, CGE modeling has been widely used for analysis of environmental policy and natural resource management issues. The purpose of this chapter is to review this branch of CGE modeling. Most existing CGE models are static , but as faster computers and more efficient software have become available, an increasing number of environmental CGE models are dynamic . In addition to the static–dynamic dimension, it is useful to distinguish between single-country, multi-country and global models. Some environmental CGE models are primarily focused on the external effects of production and consumption, while others are designed to elucidate various issues related to the management of natural resources. However, most existing CGE models are focused on externalities, primarily emissions of greenhouse gases. Global “externality” CGE models have been used to estimate the social cost of complying with the Kyoto Protocol, while single-country models, among many other things, have been used for evaluation of the efficiency of emission taxes and other environmental policy instruments. CGE modeling currently is both a field for specialists and an almost standard part of the toolbox of economists concerned with policy-oriented research. A major reason for the widespread use of CGE modeling probably is that a CGE model is an ideal bridge between economic theory and applied policy research. The “bridge” perspective, however, suggests that CGE modeling is a way of using rather than testing economic theory. Yet carefully designed and estimated CGE models have a lot to say about real world economies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1>
Chapter 6. Uncertainty and Imperfect Information in Markets ¤ This chapter deals with uncertainty and incomplete information in markets. It first considers situations in which the contract proposer is the ignorant party with the problem of designing a mechanism that induces the counter party, who is exogenously endowed with his information, to reveal that information in such a way that maximizes the contract proposer’s expected payoff. In contrast to settings of symmetric information, inefficiencies will tend to arise in equilibrium. Also considered is the situation when each side of the transaction is endowed with his or her own payoff-relevant information. Here the focus is on whether and how a social planner could design a contract to achieve efficiency. The following section assumes it is the contract proposer who is endowed with the payoff-relevant information. The quintessential example of this is a seller who knows the quality of the good she seeks to sell. Because she cannot commit fully to not deceive her counter party, inefficiencies arise. The last section examines the problems that arise if the asymmetry of information arises endogenously, because one party’s prior-to-trade actions provide him or her payoff-relevant information.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070864-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135592-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186957-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050133-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120934-5>
Chapter 11. Housing Bubbles ¤ Housing markets experience substantial price volatility, short-term price change momentum, and mean reversion of prices over the long run. Together, these features, particularly at their most extreme, produce the classic shape of an asset bubble. In this chapter, we review the stylized facts of housing bubbles and discuss theories that can potentially explain events like the boom–bust cycles of the 2000s. One set of theories assumes rationality and uses idiosyncratic features of the housing market, such as intensive search and short-selling constraints, to explain the stylized facts. Cheap credit provides a particularly common rationalization for price booms, but temporary periods of low interest rates will not explain massive price swings in simple rational models. An incorrectly underpriced default option can make rational bubbles more likely. Many nonrational explanations for real estate bubbles exist, but the most promising theories emphasize some form of trend chasing, which in turn reflects boundedly rational learning.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4239568-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1>
Chapter 21 The Effects of Collusion in Laboratory Experiments ¤ Even when markets seem to alternate between collusive and non-collusive phases, the price differences are difficult to interpret since a breakdown in collusion may be caused by a demand decrease that would have reduced prices in any case. This makes the laboratory an ideal setting to study factors that facilitate or hinder illegal price fixing. The main result from the experimental economics literature is that the market trading institutions are crucial in determining whether or not collusion will be successful in raising prices above competitive levels. This chapter examined the effects of seller discussions between rounds of a continuous double auction. In particular, the sellers were allowed to come together to a corner of one of the rooms and confer after the close of one trading period and before the start of another. Attempts to collude were as ineffective as they were inevitable. The problem is that each seller has a strong private incentive to defect and lower the asking price during the course of the double auction trading.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2>
Chapter 19 Population dynamics: Equilibrium, disequilibrium, and consequences of fluctuations ¤ This chapter discusses the possibility of long-run economic-demographic equilibrium, examines empirical evidence bearing on the key relationships hypothesized to establish equilibriumthe preventive check, the positive check, and a depressing effect of population growth on real wages reflecting diminishing returns to labor, considers the nature of shocks to the equilibrium system, both short-run and longer runincluding historical examples from Europe. The chapter also presents the economic consequences of demographic fluctuations for savings, consumer demand, labor supply, and related variables. The concept of equilibrium is important for understanding the broad sweep of history, and economic-demographic equilibration leads to statistical traps that are a danger even for the visual interpretation of simple plots of historical data series, because lead-lag relations are often misleading across long cycles. Economic-demographic equilibrium requires that population growth encounters negative feedback of some kind. Fluctuations in the rate of population growth and in the population age distribution can potentially have large effects on the macroeconomy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006292-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123185-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006294-6>
Chapter 7 Theorizing about conflict ¤ The category of conflict encompasses not only war but also crime, litigation, strikes and lockouts, and redistributive politics. Exchange theory and conflict theory constitute two coequal branches of economic analysis, the first based upon contract and mutual gain, the second upon contest for asymmetric advantage. A number of the analytic options for modelling conflict are reviewed. Preferences, opportunities, and perceptions are shown to determine the choice between conflict and settlement. The technology of conflict as an economic activity is surveyed. Two illustrative models are presented, the first involving actual fighting and the other armed peace.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132793-7>
Chapter 24 Agent-based Computational Finance ¤ This chapter surveys research on agent-based models used in finance. It will concentrate on models where the use of computational tools is critical for the process of crafting models which give insights into the importance and dynamics of investor heterogeneity in many financial settings.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011152-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>

Chapter 28. Challenges for Central Banks’ Macro Models ¤ In this chapter, we discuss a number of challenges for structural macroeconomic models in the light of the Great Recession and its aftermath. It shows that a benchmark DSGE model that shares many features with models currently used by central banks and large international institutions has difficulty explaining both the depth and the slow recovery of the Great Recession. In order to better account for these observations, the chapter analyses three extensions of the benchmark model. First, we estimate the model allowing explicitly for the zero lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates. Second, we introduce time variation in the volatility of the exogenous disturbances to account for the non-Gaussian nature of some of the shocks. Third and finally, we extend the model with a financial accelerator and allow for time variation in the endogenous propagation of financial shocks. All three extensions require that we go beyond the linear Gaussian assumptions that are standard in most policy models. We conclude that these extensions go some way in accounting for features of the Great Recession and its aftermath, but they do not suffice to address some of the major policy challenges associated with the use of nonstandard monetary policy and macroprudential policies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8>

The Temelín-Judgement of the European Court of Justice ¤ On 27 October 2009, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) rendered its milestone decision in the so called ÈEZ case which deals with the operation of the Temelín nuclear power plant in the Czech Republic. The nuclear power plant in Temelín has strongly strained the relationship between Austria and the Czech Republic throughout its history, involving not only local communities but also high level politicians, members of parliament and European Union institutions. For the outside world it is difficult to understand that antinuclear politics is part of the Austrian identity. Against the background of this tense relationship, the case was brought before the ECJ, whose judgement shall be analysed in this paper.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068925-6>
Regulation, market structure and performance in air passenger transportation ¤ The paper uses a data base on regulation, market structure and performance in the air passenger transportation industry, to analyse the links among liberalisation, private ownership, competition, efficiency and airfares at national and route levels. Covering the 1996-97 travel season, 21 aggregate indicators have been developed for 27 OECD countries, and 23 micro indicators for 102 air routes connecting 14 major international airports. These data are summarised by means of factor analysis. Controlling for market size, network length and other technological and economic differences, and combining national and route-level characteristics, cross-country and cross-route regressions show that i) productive efficiency increases and fares decline when regulations and market structures become more friendly to competition; ii) productive efficiency is sensitive to actual competitive pressures, as proxied by market concentration; iii) fares react to liberalisation independently from market structure, but in liberal environments their decline is amplified by actual competition between carriers; iv) business and economy fares tend to decline when they are liberalised and market concentration is reduced, but tend to increase when markets are dominated by airline alliances on the route; v) discount fares are affected by the overall market environment at route ends, charter regulations and the actual presence of challenger airlines on the route; and vi) airport congestion and dominance tend to increase fares in time-sensitive market segments.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
Growth effects of education and social capital in the OECD countries ¤ This paper surveys the empirical literature on the growth effects of education and social capital. The main focus is on the cross-country evidence for the OECD countries, but the paper also briefly reviews evidence from labour economics, to clarify where empirical work on education using macro data may be relatively useful. It is argued that on balance, the recent cross-country evidence points to productivity benefits of education that are at least as large as those identified by labour economists. The paper also discusses the implications of this finding. Finally, the paper reviews the emerging literature on the benefits of social capital. Since this literature is still in its early days, policy conclusions are accordingly harder to find.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2>

Chapter 16 Leading Indicators ¤ In this chapter we provide a guide for the construction, use and evaluation of leading indicators, and an assessment of the most relevant recent developments in this field of economic forecasting. To begin with, we analyze the problem of indicator selection, choice of filtering methods, business cycle dating procedures to transform a continuous variable into a binary expansion/recession indicator, and methods for the construction of composite indexes. Next, we examine models and methods to transform the leading indicators into forecasts of the target variable. Finally, we consider the evaluation of the resulting leading indicator based forecasts, and review the recent literature on the forecasting performance of leading indicators.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047390-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6>
Chapter 5. Computational Methods for Derivatives with Early Exercise Features ¤ In this paper we consider various computational methods for pricing American style derivatives. We do so under both jump diffusion and stochastic volatility processes. We consider integral transform methods, the method of lines, operator-splitting, and the Crank-Nicolson scheme, the latter being used to generate the benchmark solution. Overall, we find that the method of lines approach is quite competitive with other methods for the problems considered in this paper. As one goes to higher dimensions it may be necessary to use methods such as the sparse grid approach.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148259-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Chapter 17. Quantile Prediction ¤ This chapter is concerned with the problem of quantile prediction (or forecasting). There are numerous applications in economics and finance where quantiles are of interest. We primarily focus on methods that are relevant for dynamic time series data. The chapter is organized around two key questions: first, how to measure and forecast the conditional quantiles of some series of interest given the information currently available and second, how to assess the accuracy of alternative conditional quantile predictors.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047390-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6>
Review of Competition Law and Policy in the Czech Republic ¤ The Czech Republic competition law is based on familiar European substantive concepts. Features that were appropriate for a transition setting are being revised in anticipation of EU accession. The enforcement body was at one time a separate Ministry; now, the Czech Office for the Protection of Economic Competition is an independent agency. Provisions for exemption are well controlled, and the processes for applying it are working well; however, stronger enforcement powers may be needed to deal with secret cartels. The major challenge of improving competitiveness by completing the reform of the inherited industrial structure requires solving problems of corporate governance and financing. The role of competition policy in that task will be modest.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065839-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121924-7>
Chapter 16 Wealth transfer taxation: a survey of the theoretical literature ¤ The purpose of this paper is to survey the theoretical literature on wealth transfer taxation. The focus is normative: we are looking at the design of an optimal tax structure from the standpoint of both equity and efficiency. The gist of this survey is that the optimal design crucially depends on the assumed bequest motives. Alternative bequest motives are thus analyzed either in isolation or combined. Even though there are as many results as models and as many models as combinations of bequest motives, the general conclusion is that the case for a zero taxation of inheritance is very weak.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057542-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4302876-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129281-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133536-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197971-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020511-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184535-3>
Governance of Banks in China ¤ With the economic reform in the late 1970s, it has been an objective of government policy for Chinese banks to move away from their traditional passive role of executing directives adapted to the active role in resource allocation of banks in a market economy. However, owing to unclear ownership structures and a history of support of regional and industrial policy, most Chinese banks have had difficulty making the transition. This is particularly true for the four large state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs). In 1998-99, a significant effort to strengthen SOCB balance sheets was undertaken, but the results were disappointing. In the most recent phase of the reform, which began in 2003, the authorities concluded that further attempts at rehabilitation of the SOCBs had to address the issue of bank governance......	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5>
Chapter 2. The Economics of International Differences in Educational Achievement ¤ An emerging economic literature over the past decade has made use of international tests of educational achievement to analyze the determinants and impacts of cognitive skills. The cross-country comparative approach provides a number of unique advantages over national studies: It can exploit institutional variation that does not exist within countries; draw on much larger variation than usually available within any country; reveal whether any result is country-specific or more general; test whether effects are systematically heterogeneous in different settings; circumvent selection issues that plague within-country identification by using system-level aggregated measures; and uncover general-equilibrium effects that often elude studies in a single country. The advantages come at the price of concerns about the limited number of country observations, the cross-sectional character of most available achievement data, and possible bias from unobserved country factors like culture. This chapter reviews the economic literature on international differences in educational achievement, restricting itself to comparative analyses that are not possible within single countries and placing particular emphasis on studies trying to address key issues of empirical identification. While quantitative input measures show little impact, several measures of institutional structures and of the quality of the teaching force can account for significant portions of the large international differences in the level and equity of student achievement. Variations in skills measured by the international tests are in turn strongly related to individual labor-market outcomes and, perhaps more importantly, to cross-country variations in economic growth.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2>
Chapter 22 Artistic Labor Markets: Contingent Work, Excess Supply and Occupational Risk Management ¤ This chapter studies how and why artistic labor markets have expanded along a path of unbalanced growth. Long-term employment which nurtures the Baumolian cost disease persists only in large, heavily subsidized and sponsored organizations. The now dominant project-based system of production, with its functional needs for flexibility, relies on short-term assignments. Large parts of the business risk are transferred down onto the workforce in vertically disintegrated organizational settings. Artists and technical workers act mainly as contingent workers, freelancers and independent contractors; labor supply is patterned by repeated and discontinuous alternations between work and unemployment, and workers cycle between multiple jobs inside and outside the arts. Thus artistic labor markets display the main characteristics of a textbook model of imperfect monopolistic competition: excess supply of labor, unbounded differentiation of production, reputational rents, a population of small firms that has been growing as fast as the number of artists. On the supply side, the attractiveness of artistic occupations has to be balanced against the risk of failure that turns ideally non-routine jobs into ordinary or ephemeral undertakings. Learning by doing plays such a decisive role that in many artforms initial training is an imperfect filtering device. Individuals learn to manage the risks of their trade through multiple jobholding, occupational role versatility, portfolio diversification of employment ties, and income transfers from public support, social insurance and social security programs. Ironically, the study of the artists' risk management shows how rationally they behave, although artistic work may be highly idiosyncratic. Thus artists may be seen less like rational fools than like Bayesian actors. How do vertically disintegrated systems of production shape individual careers and organizational behavior? Loose employment relationships do not preclude contractual stability. Employers use reputations as screening devices and signals of employability. Artists learn how to compose balanced sets of recurrent and non-recurrent hiring ties in order to secure a living as well as to increase their human capital. Considerable inequalities in amounts of work and earnings are observed, caused by the skewed distribution of talent and by joint consumption technologies that turn small differences in talent into huge earnings differentials. Inequalities may also trace back to the way a disintegrated labor market operates, since both the allocation of piecemeal work based on reputational rankings and team formation based on selective matchings magnify the power of differences in talent and work opportunity to increase inequality. These factors should not cause the kind of permanent excess supply of labor in the arts that has been noted for decades if the occupational commitment of artists were not combined with the management of business uncertainty through overproduction of infinitely differentiated goods and services.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1>
Chapter 8 Micro data and general equilibrium models ¤ Dynamic general equilibrium models are required to evaluate policies applied at the national level. To use these models to make quantitative forecasts requires knowledge of an extensive array of parameter values for the economy at large. This essay describes the parameters required for different economic models, assesses the discordance between the macromodels used in policy evaluation and the microeconomic models used to generate the empirical evidence. For concreteness, we focus on two general equilibrium models: the stochastic growth model extended to include some forms of heterogeneity and the overlapping generations model enriched to accommodate human capital formation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6>
Chapter 35 Overlapping generations ¤ Competitive equilibria in economies of overlapping generations are different from competitive equilibria in economies that have extended over finitely many periods, finite economies for short. These differences concern the properties of competitive equilibria, such as existence, optimality and determinacy or local uniqueness; and the phenomena compatible with competitive equilibria, such as net aggregate debt or fiat money with a positive price. The chapter discusses that all the variants of the model of overlapping generations allow for infinity of time periods and hence for infinitely many commodities. This infinity of time periods and commodities is not a mathematical curiosity, but rather is central to the economic significance of the model. Consider a pay-as-you-go system of social security. In economic models in which the rationality of individuals is presumed to be unlimited, the fact that no new generation would appear at some point in the very distant future would also lead to the immediate break down of the social security system. In an economy of overlapping generations, the temporal and demographic structure is explicit, which evidently enriches the study of problems such as the transfer of value over time. It also allows the claim that the inability of individuals to trade directly with individuals whose consumption and endowment spans commence after they have perished is the distinguishing feature of economies of overlapping generations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066472-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Chapter 4 Vertical integration: Determinants and effects ¤ The theory of vertical integration is situated at the intersection of the theory of the firm, the theory of contracts, and the theory of markets. A firm can be described as vertically integrated if it encompasses two single-output production processes in which either (1) the entire output of the upstream process is employed as part or all of the quantity of one intermediate input into the downstream process or (2) the entire quantity of one intermediate input into the downstream process is obtained from part or all of the output of the upstream process. This includes the more restrictive criterion that the entire output of the upstream subsidiary be employed as all of the quantity of one intermediate input into the downstream process. There are three broad determinants of vertical integration: technological economies, transactional economies, and market imperfections. Vertical integration may arise from technological economies of integration. In particular, less of the other intermediate inputs may be required to obtain the same output in the downstream process when the firm has integrated one of the upstream processes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133311-1>
Modeling, design and prototyping of a pantograph-based compliant mechanism ¤ The main task of the compliant mechanism synthesis is to generate a pre-defined motion path as accurately as possible. A general approach to the compliant mechanism synthesis is to develop a compliant mechanism based on the rigid-body model by replacing conventional joints with compliant joints, i.e. flexure hinges. Using the example of a mechanism producing a scissors-like motion, in this paper a more specific and iterative synthesis process is implemented for the design of a compliant path-generating mechanism. Based on two symmetric pantograph mechanisms, a kinematic analysis of the multi-link rigid-body model is performed. The final dimensions and link lengths of the rigid-body model are used to implement a compliant mechanism with different flexure hinges. Therefore, several designs are iteratively investigated by means of FEM simulations in order to improve the path accuracy and the opening angle of the scissors-like motion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4774350-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4198914-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4205811-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017233-8>

Chapter 25 The effects of economic regulation ¤ This chapter discusses alternative approaches to measure the effects of economic regulation and reviews the empirical literature employing these approaches. Economic regulation refers to both the direct legislation and administrative regulation of prices and entry into specific industries or markets. It follows conventional treatment in distinguishing economic regulation from a host of other forms of government intervention in markets, including the social regulation of environmental, health and safety practices, antitrust policy, and tax and tariff policies. The measurement issues that discusses arise in the empirical analysis of all types of government regulation; therefore, it have structured the methodological discussion so that it has broad applicability. While the present study is by no means an exhaustive survey of the literature, it includes numerous examples of the use of different types of data and measurement techniques. These are selected to cover a range of industries and time periods sufficient to give the reader a good feeling for what is known, not known, or in dispute. The chapter examines the way alternative theoretical frameworks and empirical methodologies have been applied to study the effects of price and entry regulation on each of: prices, costs, technological change, product quality, and the distribution of income and rents.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133311-1>
Chapter 8 Input-output models, national economic models, and the environment ¤ Pervasive environmental spillovers are replacing the now outmoded bees and apple orchards as the economists' examples of external effects. The materials balance approach underlines the generality of residuals as the normal outcome of the throughput of materials in the course of production and consumption activities. Residuals measured in weight are defined by the difference between the weight of the total material inputs to an activity and the weight of the products that are the objective of the activity, plus the weight of net accumulation of tangible assets in the activity. The chapter reviews that the receiving bodies of Nature, the environmental receptors, play a decisive role in the economic analysis of pollution. It discusses that the receptors provide man with two types of services: residual disposal services and environmental services. The former type relates to the inherent generation of residuals by the materials-processing economy of an industrialized state; the latter type is an omnivorous category of recreation activities such as sport fishing, boating, amenity services, aesthetic values, including the intrinsic value of Nature, and the provision of extraction possibilities from mineral deposits, water, and air.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075236-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014743-5>
Chapter 97 Motivation Theory and Experimental Behavior under the Decision Cost Hypothesis ¤ This chapter compare hypothetical with actual bids of a Treasury bill dealer, and find that the dealer's measure of constant relative risk aversion using actual bid data is four times larger than under hypothetical assessment. This chapter also reports individual decision making experiments in which the incidence of confused behavior is reduced with monetary rewards, but subjects who appear not to be confused behave about the same with or without monetary rewards. This chapter finds that results in the dictator game are affected significantly by monetary incentives and that under no-pay conditions the results in ultimatum games are inconclusive because they fail to be replicable.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1>
Chapter 33 The Arms Industry, Procurement and Industrial Policies ¤ Weapons programs are criticized for cost overruns, delays in delivery and failure to meet their operational requirements. Critics focus on the power and influence of the military–industrial–political complex. This chapter addresses these controversial areas involving arms industries, alternative procurement policies and industrial policy. Arms industries are defined and statistics are presented on the world's arms industries. They can be analyzed as economically strategic industries where both R&amp;D and production quantities are important and lead to decreasing cost industries reflecting economies of scale and learning. A structure-conduct-performance approach is applied. Market conduct is assessed including defense R&amp;D and the role of the military–industrial–political complex. Market performance is reviewed by assessing contract performance, firm productivity and profitability and exports. Governments are central to understanding arms markets and weapons procurement raises both theory and policy issues. There are principal-agent problems and issues of adverse selection, moral hazard, risk sharing and bilateral monopoly. Various types of contract are available, each with different efficiency incentives. Governments can also use their buying power to determine the size, structure and performance of a nation's defense industrial base (DIB). The benefits and costs of a national DIB are assessed and three policy issues and challenges are reviewed. These are the role of competition in arms procurement, its extension to military outsourcing and the profitability of non-competitive contracts. Alternative industrial policies are a further aspect of procurement policy. Guidelines for a defense industrial policy in a military alliance are outlined together with an assessment of European collaborative programs. The Chapter concludes by speculating on the future of the defense firm and proposing an agenda for future research in the field.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115806-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132793-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063255-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134192-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065004-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134037-1>
Private remedies ¤ The OECD Competition Committee debated private remedies in June 2006. The roundtable focused on class actions/collective actions and the interface between private enforcement and public enforcement: • Class Actions/Collective Actions: There is a strong case for the use of class actions/collective actions to raise levels of deterrence and achieve greater compliance with competition laws, as these actions may be the only practical way to ensure that customers with small claims also have their day in court. • Interface between Public and Private Enforcement: There is a widely shared concern that private litigation in competition cases can interfere with leniency programs in cartel cases. There is a trade-off between enabling the victims of a cartel to recover damages and incentives for cartel members to come forward, and no-one really knows with certainty how much protection from private litigation and damage awards is necessary so as not to deter leniency applicants. The prevailing view is that the integrity of leniency programs should be protected by a range of measures that limit a leniency applicant’s exposure to civil damages, but some delegates felt that the current trend provided unnecessary protection to leniency applicants to the detriment of private plaintiffs.

Chapter 7. Diffusion and pricing over the product life cycle ¤ This chapter presents a selective review of a literature in marketing that analyzes diffusion and pricing over the product life-cycle. I primarily focus on empirical work, and on papers that deal with the dynamics of pricing over time. I discuss how recent empirical work has linked outcomes to micro-foundations and accommodated a role for forward-looking consumers and firms. I emphasize a more nuanced perspective of the product life-cycle that has emerged in the literature, as an endogenous outcome arising from the interaction of preferences, expectations, costs, and competition in the market, rather than as an exogenously specified process against which marketing strategies should be optimized.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037589-4>
Chapter 31 The theory of value in security markets ¤ General equilibrium theory is applied wholesale to obtain a theory of value for security markets. The modern theory of value for security markets extends general equilibrium theory in various ways: (1) it explicitly treats general multiperiod trading opportunities under uncertainty and in incomplete markets; (2) it investigates, in remarkable depth, implications of the law of one price that is, of arbitrage-free prices; (3) to represent security returns in convenient and testable ways, it places strong restrictions on preferences and exploits a great deal of probability theory, especially the theories of Markov processes and stochastic integration, separately and together. The chapter discusses that as financial market theory grows, it laps over the boundaries of the general equilibrium paradigm to focus on the process of price formation. The microstructure of security markets has come under increasing scrutiny; the theory of specialist market makers, for example, is gradually being filled out. The need to address asymmetric information, in particular, has led to strategic models of investment behavior. Despite the diverse aims of financial economic theory, the chapter summarizes the developments in finance that rest or build on general equilibrium theory, emphasizing the valuation of financial assets.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066472-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Chapter 43 Incomplete information ¤ In interactive contexts such as games and economies, it is important to take account not only of what the players believe about substantive matters (such as payoffs), but also of what they believe about the beliefs of other players. Two different but equivalent ways of dealing with this matter, the semantic and the syntactic, are set forth. Canonical and universal semantic systems are then defined and constructed, and the concepts of common knowledge and common priors formulated and characterized. The last two sections discuss relations with Bayesian games of incomplete information and their applications, and with interactive epistemology — the theory of multi-agent knowledge and belief as formulated in mathematical logic.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Chapter 56 Focal Points and Bargaining ¤ This chapter focuses on the focal points and bargaining. The idea of a focal point is of great practical importance. However, no consensus exists concerning the manner in which focal points become established or survive after their establishment. At one extreme, some authors emphasize rationality considerations above all else. At the other extreme are authors who argue that social norms are so important that strategic issues can be neglected entirely. Even those who emphasize the importance of social norms are left with unresolved questions. Subjects can be conditioned to begin bargaining against real opponents close to any of the four focal points discussed in the chapter. The equal increments and utilitarian focal points are not stable. The explanation that groups of subjects converge on an exact Nash equilibrium of the discrete game that they actually played fits the data very well. One potential criticism of the above experiments is that the graphical display might have made the process of myopic optimization focal.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2>
Chapter 56: Values of games with infinitely many players ¤ This chapter studies the theory of value of games with infinitely many players. Games with infinitely many players are models of interactions with many players. Often most of the players are individually insignificant, and are effective in the game only via coalitions. At the same time there may exist big players who retain the power to wield single-handed influence. The interactions are modeled as cooperative games with a continuum of players. In general, the continuum consists of a non-atomic part (the “ocean”), along with (at most countably many) atoms. The continuum provides a convenient framework for mathematical analysis, and approximates the results for large finite games well. Also, it enables a unified view of games with finite, countable, or oceanic player-sets, or indeed any mixture of these. The value is defined as a map from a space of cooperative games to payoffs that satisfies the classical value axioms: additivity (linearity), efficiency, symmetry and positivity. The chapter introduces many spaces for which there exists a unique value, as well as other spaces on which there is a value. A game with infinitely many players can be considered as a limit of finite games with a large number of players. The chapter studies limiting values which are defined by means of the limits of the Shapley value of finite games that approximate the given game with infinitely many players. Various formulas for the value which express the value as an average of marginal contribution are studied. These value formulas capture the idea that the value of a player is his expected marginal contribution to a perfect sample of size t of the set of all players where the size t is uniformly distributed on [0,1]. In the case of smooth games the value formula is a diagonal formula: an integral of marginal contributions which are expressed as partial derivatives and where the integral is over all perfect samples of the set of players. The domain of the formula is further extended by changing the order of integration and derivation and the introduction of a well-crafted infinitesimal perturbation of the perfect samples of the set of players provides a value formula that is applicable to many additional games with essential nondifferentiabilities.

Chapter 69 Labor Supply Models: Unobserved Heterogeneity, Nonparticipation and Dynamics ¤ This chapter is concerned with the identification and estimation of models of labor supply. The focus is on the key issues that arise from unobserved heterogeneity, nonparticipation and dynamics. We examine the simple “static” labor supply model with proportional taxes and highlight the problems surrounding nonparticipation and missing wages. The difference-in-differences approach to estimation and identification is developed within the context of the labor supply model. We also consider the impact of incorporating nonlinear taxation and welfare program participation. Family labor supply is looked at from both the unitary and collective perspectives. Finally we consider intertemporal models focusing on the difficulties that arise with participation and heterogeneity.

Chapter 8. Forecasting the Price of Oil ¤ We address some of the key questions that arise in forecasting the price of crude oil. What do applied forecasters need to know about the choice of sample period and about the tradeoffs between alternative oil price series and model specifications? Are real and nominal oil prices predictable based on macroeconomic aggregates? Does this predictability translate into gains in out-of-sample forecast accuracy compared with conventional no-change forecasts? How useful are oil futures prices in forecasting the spot price of oil? How useful are survey forecasts? How does one evaluate the sensitivity of a baseline oil price forecast to alternative assumptions about future oil demand and oil supply conditions? How does one quantify risks associated with oil price forecasts? Can joint forecasts of the price of oil and of U.S. real GDP growth be improved upon by allowing for asymmetries?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6>

Chapter 34 Equilibrium theory in infinite dimensional spaces ¤ This chapter summarizes the account of the extension of the classical general equilibrium model to an infinite dimensional setting. The classical finite dimensional theory, the commodity space is the canonical finite dimensional linear space R n . By contrast, there is no canonical infinite dimensional linear space. Different economic applications require models involving different infinite dimensional linear spaces. The mathematical discipline of functional analysis has already been well developed as a tool for the abstract study of linear spaces. The chapter follows the methodology of functional analysis and attacks the existence problem. Advantage of this method is that it yields general results, capable of application in a wide variety of specific models. An important line of research in classical general equilibrium theory has been the relationship of the core to the set of competitive allocations. In the infinite dimensional setting, an extensive body of work has been developed, which centers around the infinite-dimensional version of the DebreuScarf core convergence theorem.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066472-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>
Chapter 15. Immigration and the Distribution of Incomes ¤ We review research on the impact of immigration on income distribution, surveying studies from a variety of countries. Immigration may affect the skill composition of a country's residents and also, by changing relative factor supplies, its relative factor prices. As background, we provide evidence on immigration to the OECD countries and compare the distribution of native and immigrant educational attainment; we also examine the compositional effects of these changes in the United States. We then discuss the economic theory of the impact of immigration on factor prices, emphasizing substitution and complementarity between natives and immigrants in the labor market. Next, we review research methodologies, including structural and natural experiment approaches, used to estimate the impact of immigration on the native income distribution. We follow by considering the evidence on these questions for several countries, and also examine the impact of emigration on income distribution in the source country.

Chapter 8 The Economics of Fairness, Reciprocity and Altruism Experimental Evidence and New Theories ¤ Most economic models are based on the self-interest hypothesis that assumes that material self-interest exclusively motivates all people. Experimental economists have gathered overwhelming evidence in recent years, however, that systematically refutes the self-interest hypothesis, suggesting that concerns for altruism, fairness, and reciprocity strongly motivate many people. Moreover, several theoretical papers demonstrate that the observed phenomena can be explained in a rigorous and tractable manner. These theories then induced a first wave of experimental research which offered exciting insights into both the nature of preferences and the relative performance of competing fairness theories. The purpose of this chapter is to review these developments, to point out open questions, and to suggest avenues for future research. We also discuss recent neuroeconomic evidence that is consistent with the view that many people have a taste for mutual cooperation and the punishment of norm violators. We further illustrate the powerful impact of fairness concerns on cooperation, competition, incentives, and contract design.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4184535-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4302876-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020511-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129281-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057542-1>
Chapter 15 Drinking from the Fountain of Knowledge: Student Incentive to Study and Learn – Externalities, Information Problems and Peer Pressure ¤ Students face four decision margins: (a) How many years to spend in school, (b) What to study, (c) How much effort to devote to learning per year and (d) Whether to disrupt or assist the learning of classmates. The thousands of studies that have applied human capital theory to the first two questions are reviewed elsewhere in this volume and the Handbook series. This chapter reviews an emerging economic literature on the effects of and determinants of student effort and cooperativeness and how putting student motivation and behavior at center of one's theoretical framework changes one's view of how schools operate and how they might be made more effective. In this new framework students have a dual role. They are both (a) investors/consumers who choose which goals (outputs) to focus on and how much effort to put into each goal and (b) workers getting instruction and guidance from their first-line supervisors, the teachers. A simple model is presented in which the behavior of students, teachers and administrators depends on the incentives facing them and the actions of the other actors in the system. The incentives, in turn, depend upon the cost and reliability of the information (signals) that is generated about the various inputs and outputs of the system. Our review of empirical research support many of the predictions of the model. Student effort, engagement and discipline vary a lot within schools, across schools and across nations and have significant effects on learning. Higher extrinsic rewards for learning are associated the taking of more rigorous courses, teachers setting higher standards and more time devoted to homework. Taking more rigorous courses and studying harder increase student achievement. Post-World War II trends in study effort and course rigor, for example, are positively correlated with achievement trends. Even though, greater rigor and higher standards improve learning, parents and students prefer easy teachers. They pressure tough teachers to lower standards and sign up for courses taught by easy graders. Curriculum-based external exit examinations (CBEEES) improve the signaling of academic achievement to colleges and the labor market and this increases extrinsic rewards for learning. Cross-section studies suggest that CBEEES result in greater focus on academics, more tutoring of lagging students, and higher levels of achievement. Minimum competency examinations (MCE) do not have significant effects on learning or dropout rates but they do appear to have positive effects on the reputation of high school graduates. As a result, students from MCE states earn significantly more than students from states without MCEs and the effect lasts at least eight years. Students who attend schools with studious well-behaved classmates learn more. Disruptive students generate negative production externalities and cooperative hard-working students create positive production externalities. Peer effects are also generated by the norms of student peer cultures that encourage disruptive students and harass nerds. In addition learning is poorly signaled to employers and colleges. Thus, market signals and the norms of student peer culture do not internalize the externalities that are pervasive in school settings and as a result students typically devote less effort to studying than the taxpayers who fund schools would wish.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2>
Chapter 19 Asset prices, consumption, and the business cycle ¤ This chapter reviews the behavior of financial asset prices in relation to consumption. The chapter lists some important stylized facts that characterize US data, and relates them to recent developments in equilibrium asset pricing theory. Data from other countries are examined to see which features of the US experience apply more generally. The chapter argues that to make sense of asset market behavior one needs a model in which the market price of risk is high, time-varying, and correlated with the state of the economy. Models that have this feature, including models with habitformation in utility, heterogeneous investors, and irrational expectations, are discussed. The main focus is on stock returns and short-term real interest rates, but bond returns are also considered.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121333-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8>
Chapter 19. Human Resource Management and Productivity ¤ In this chapter we examine the relationship between Human Resource Management (HRM) and productivity. HRM includes incentive pay (individual and group) as well as many non-pay aspects of the employment relationship such as matching (hiring and firing) and work organization (e.g. teams, autonomy). We place HRM more generally within the literature on management practices and productivity. We start with some facts on levels and trends of both HRM and productivity and the main economic theories of HRM. We look at some of the determinants of HRMrisk, competition, ownership and regulation. The largest section analyzes the impact of HRM on productivity emphasizing issues of methodology, data and results (from micro-econometric studies). We conclude briefly with suggestions of avenues for future frontier work.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127364-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9>
Chapter 13. Managed Care ¤ By 1993, over 70 of all Americans with health insurance were enrolled in some form of managed care plan. The term managed care encompasses a diverse array of institutional arrangements, which combine various sets of mechanisms, that, in turn, have changed over time. The chapter reviews these mechanisms, which, in addition to the methods employed by traditional insurance plans, include the selection and organization of providers, the choice of payment methods (including capitation and salary payment), and the monitoring of service utilization. Managed care has a long history. For an extended period, this form of organization was discouraged by a hostile regulatory environment. Since the early 1980s, however, managed care has grown dramatically. Neither theoretical nor empirical research has yet provided an explanation for this pattern of growth. The growth of managed care may be due to this organizational form's relative success in responding to underlying market failures in the health care system asymmetric information about health risks, moral hazard, limited information on quality, and limited industry competitiveness. The chapter next explores managed care's response to each of these problems. The chapter then turns to empirical research on managed care. Managed care plans appear to attract a population that is somewhat lower cost than that enrolled in conventional insurance. This complicates analysis of the effect of managed care on utilization. Nonetheless, many studies suggest that managed care plans reduce the rate of health care utilization somewhat. Less evidence exists on their effect on overall health care costs and cost growth.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
The Decline in Private Saving Rates in the 1990s in OECD Countries : How Much Can Be Explained by Non-wealth Determinants? ¤ The substantial decline in private-sector saving rates observed in several OECD countries in the late 1990s coincided in several cases with a sharp increase in household financial net worth. This was seen by many observers as evidence that the strong rise in equity and residential property prices during the late 1990s had been treated by households as a permanent increase in wealth, leading to an unsustainable drop in saving and raising fears of an eventual negative wealth effect. Applying estimation techniques for systems of dynamic panel equations, this paper looks at basic determinants of private saving for a sample of 15 OECD countries and finds that the sharp decline in saving observed after 1995 can be largely explained, even in a post-sample fashion, by fundamentals other than financial wealth. Among the determinants, the rise in public-sector saving is found to have contributed the most to the decline in private saving between 1995 and 2000. Based on this investigation, there is little evidence that consumers had gone too far in responding to the stock market boom of the late 1990s, even in countries where private saving rates have fallen to historically low levels. On the other hand, the results suggest that a loosening of fiscal policy may have a limited stimulatory impact on private consumption...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
Environmentally Responsible Food Choice ¤ The purpose of this paper is to review and assess the role of relevant explanatory variables that influence individual purchase decisions for “environmentally responsible” food consumption. In particular, we provide a detailed review of the key empirical studies in the area of consumer demand for those foods which can be broadly considered as environmentally responsible products (ERPs). We give this definition because the choice of ERPs is a consequence of individual concerns towards environmental and health issues and consumers are directly and indirectly responsible for the environmental and health effects of their food consumption choices. The decision to purchase ERPs should reduce negative environmental effects from intensive agricultural practices, helping to preserve a public good like the environment. Consumption of ERPs should also curb health risks from chemicals for all the household members eating the food purchased in the shops. Therefore, the choice of ERPs reflects both “public” and “private” demands.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1>
Chapter 12. Pharmaceutical Innovation ¤ This chapter surveys the costs, risks, and challenges encountered in the progressive discovery and development of new pharmaceuticals. The changing methods by which drugs are discovered, the links between companies and academic science, the changing character of public regulation, and the sharp rise in the cost per new approved drug are analyzed. Determining which new drugs are both efficacious and safe poses classic statistical decision theory problems. Why patents are so important to drug developers is explored. A rent-seeking theory of new drug development is proposed to rationalize the high gross margins but only slightly supranormal returns on investment realized by pharmaceutical companies, and the puzzling economic welfare implications are investigated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059252-2>
The contribution of economic geography to GDP per capita ¤ This article examines how much of the dispersion in economic performance across OECD countries can be accounted for by the proximity to areas of dense economic activity. To do so, various indicators of distance to markets and transportation costs are added as determinants in an augmented Solow model, which serves as a benchmark. Measures of distance to markets are found to have a statistically significant effect on GDP per capita. And the estimated economic impact is far from negligible. The reduced access to markets relative to the OECD average could contribute negatively to GDP per capita by as much as 11% in Australia and New Zealand. Conversely, a favourable impact of around 6-7% of GDP is found in the case of two centrally-located countries: Belgium and the Netherlands. The paper provides also some tentative evidence that spending on R&D and human capital might have a stronger effect on GDP per capita in countries with a higher degree of urban concentration.

Chapter 1. Causal Inference in Urban and Regional Economics ¤ Recovery of causal relationships in data is an essential part of scholarly inquiry in the social sciences. This chapter discusses strategies that have been successfully used in urban and regional economics for recovering such causal relationships. Essential to any successful empirical inquiry is careful consideration of the sources of variation in the data that identify parameters of interest. Interpretation of such parameters should take into account the potential for their heterogeneity as a function of both observables and unobservables.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4239568-9>
Chapter 2 The theory of excess burden and optimal taxation ¤ The theory of excess burden and optimal commodity taxation is one of the oldest subjects of study in public finance, dating back to Dupuit (1844), and yet is also closely associated with the rapid analytical development of the field which commenced in the early 1970s. This chapter presents the chronological development of the concept of excess burden and the related study of optimal tax theory. A main objective is to uncover the interrelationships among various apparently distinct results, so as to bring out the basic structure of the entire problem. The various measures of excess burden, focusing on issues of approximation, informational requirements and aggregation over individuals, and the effects of a more general technology than the commonly supposed one with fixed producer prices are developed. Some of the empirical attempts to estimate various deadweight losses are reviewed. The issue of tax reform, as distinct from de novo tax design.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4242500-1>
Kluwer-EZUL-Test dataset (1) : Monte Carlo Simulations of Adsorbed Solutions in Heterogeneous Porous Materials ¤ We present results of a Monte Carlo simulation study of binary mixtures of ethane and methane in silica gel. The molecular model treats the adsorbent as a matrix of silica microspheres. The adsorption isotherms, adsorption selectivities and isosteric heats of adsorption have been determined for these systems. The results are compared with predictions from the ideal adsorbed solution (IAS) theory and with experiment. The heats of adsorption are accurately described by the IAS theory. The adsorption isotherms are accurately described by the IAS theory at low bulk pressure but the IAS theory overpredicts the density at high bulk pressure. This latter effect is opposite to that observed in bulk mixtures of this type where nonidealities generally lead to a density increase on mixing. The pressure dependence of the selectivity does not exhibit a maximum at low pressure. We discuss this effect in terms of the adsorbent microstructure.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000536-7>
Chapter 62 A Practitioner's Approach to Estimating Intertemporal Relationships Using Longitudinal Data: Lessons from Applications in Wage Dynamics ¤ This chapter presents a unified set of estimation methods for fitting a rich array of models describing dynamic relationships within a longitudinal data setting. The discussion surveys approaches for characterizing the micro dynamics of continuous dependent variables both over time and across individuals, focusing on two flexible sets of empirical specifications: dynamic simultaneous equations models incorporating error-components structures, and autoregressive quantile models. The chapter is motivated by the principle that, whenever possible, estimation methods should rely on routines available in familiar software packages to make them accessible to a wide range of practitioners. Conventional method-of-moments procedures offer a general apparatus for estimating parameters of panel-data specifications, though one must introduce a series of modifications to overcome challenges arising from: (1) use of unbalanced data structures, (2) weighting to account for stratified sampling inherent in survey longitudinal data, (3) incorporation of predetermined variables in estimation, and (4) computational complexities confronted when estimating large systems of equations with intricate intertemporal restrictions. To allow researchers to separate the estimation of longitudinal time-series specifications into manageable pieces, the discussion describes multi-step approaches that estimate subsets of parameters appearing in a single model component (such as the autoregressive or moving-average structure of the error process) without having to estimate all parameters of the entire model jointly. Such procedures offer a powerful set of diagnostic tools for narrowing model choices and for selecting among specifications that fit the underlying data. To illustrate all of the econometric methods outlined in this chapter, the analysis presents a set of empirical applications summarizing the dynamic properties of hourly wages for adult men using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0>

Chapter 8 Insurrections ¤ This essay develops an economic theory of insurrections. The decision-making agents in this theory are an incumbent ruler, a potential leader of an insurrection, and a large number of peasant or worker families. The essay distinguishes insurrections that attempt only to appropriate current income from revolutions, which are insurrections that attempt to effect permanent change in the distribution of income through the appropriation of sovereign power. The analysis shows how the technology of insurrection, together with a discount factor, determines whether there is an insurrection, the allocation of resources among productive activities, soldiering, and insurgency, and the probable outcome of an insurrection.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132793-7>
Chapter 6 Regional economic dynamics ¤ This chapter presents an overview of regional economic dynamics. Static spatial analysis is formally concerned with four reasonably distinct bodies of instantaneous spatial phenomena with their determining strategic variables: (1) locations, or the spatial coordinates of localized economic activities; (2) interaction flows, or the intensity of spatial factor, goods, and information flows among points and/or regions; (3) increases or decreases in the availability of regional goods, factors, or income incident to changes in exogenous variables; and (4) spatial structures, including the areal or curvilinear patterns of economic activities, such as land use patterns, urban structure, transportation networks, and market or supply areas. Strategic variables mean the total of relevant variables that a specific theory or model includes. They divide into endogenous and exogenous variables or parameters. The chapter focuses on the theories and models that deal with changes through the time of phenomena in the same four categories, when such changes are the products of truly dynamic processes. It also presents the most influential work in the dynamics of locations, flows, changes, and structures and presents work in the location and transportation fields.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9>
Chapter 4. Competition Among Schools: Traditional Public and Private Schools ¤ This chapter considers research on the effects of competition between private and public schools. It focuses on three questions: (1) Do children experience higher achievement gains in private school? (2) If so, is this because private schools are more productive? (3) Does competition from private schools raise public school productivity and/or otherwise affect those “left behind”? The chapter shows that unless each of these questions is answered, one cannot form a full assessment on the desirability of private school entry. Voucher experiments suggest that question 1 can be answered in the affirmative for some subgroups and in some contexts. Such work cannot typically isolate channels, however, and hence does not address question 2. Question 3 has been primarily studied by papers on large-scale voucher programs. These suggest that private school entry results in nonrandom sorting of students, but are less clear on the effects. The bottom line is that despite demand for clear, simple conclusions on the effects of competition from private schools, research does not yet provide these.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2>

Chapter 17 The regional impact of defense expenditure ¤ This chapter examines the current state of knowledge regarding the economic impact of defense expenditure at the level of the regional economy from a global perspective. Appropriate theoretical and analytical approaches are identified and selected case studies reviewed. The regional concentration of defense expenditure is explored using a variety of indicators and perceived differences in the economic impact of defense industry decline and military base contraction and closure are evaluated. The chapter considers relevant labor market issues and examines the different impacts to be expected in developing countries. Policy implications are explored in the context of the post-Cold War environment confronting the defense sector.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132793-7>
Chapter 93 Structure Induced Equilibrium in Spatial Committee Games ¤ Markets, auction mechanisms and political institutions all affect outcomes. For students of collective choice, minimal decision making institutions provide a baseline by which we expect outcomes that best can be characterized as chaotic. Such outcomes are rarely predictable and the processes by which they are selected are marked by voting cycles and drifting through the alternative space. More interesting for collective choice theorists are those mechanisms introduced into a minimal institutional setting that in turn brings predictability to outcomes. Almost all institutions charged with making collective choices are richly layered with rules. The United States House of Representatives is one of the more rule-bound institutions that has been studied extensively and empirical scholars take for granted that its outcomes will be predictable and patterned. However, disentangling which structural features matter and when they matter remains a task for theorists. Experimentalists continue to offer examples as to when institutions matter.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2>
Chapter 2. Dynamic Security Design and Corporate Financing* ¤ This essay considers dynamic security design and corporate financing, with particular emphasis on informational microfoundations. The central idea is that firm insiders must retain an appropriate share of firm risk, either to align their incentives with those of outside investors (moral hazard) or to signal favorable information about the quality of the firm’s assets. Informational problems lead to inevitable inefficiencies—imperfect risk sharing, the possibility of bankruptcy, investment distortions, etc. The design of contracts that minimize these inefficiencies is a central question. This essay explores the implications of dynamic security design on firm operations and asset prices.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269795-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4508395-2>
Chapter 26 Liability for medical malpractice ¤ Physicians are traditionally liable under a negligence rule of liability. Economic analysis of liability rules, including malpractice, assumes that the primary function of liability is injury prevention (deterrence). Compensation can be provided more efficiently through other forms of social or private insurance. In theory, a negligence rule creates incentives for efficient care, hence there should be no negligence, no claims and no demand for liability insurance. In practice, the incidence of negligent injury has been estimated at roughly one per hundred hospital admissions in the US and about one in seven physicians is sued per year. These discrepancies between the theory and actual operation of the negligence system arise primarily because of imperfect information on the part of courts, doctors, patients, liability insurers and health insurers. Imperfect information and extensive health insurance lead to biased and uncertain legal standards. Uncertain legal standards create incentives for physicians to practice defensive medicine and incentives for plaintiffs and defendants to invest in litigation, leading to high overhead costs, such that compensation through the malpractice system carries a load of $1.50 per $1.00 of compensation. Nevertheless, the extreme criticisms of the malpractice system are exaggerated. Malpractice premiums are less than 1 percent of total health care costs. There are no comprehensive estimates of defensive medicine costs; in any case such costs are likely to decline with the growth of managed care. Although claim disposition exhibits both Type 1 and Type 2 errors, negligent injuries are much more likely to lead to a claim being filed and payment to the plaintiff than non-negligent injuries, and awards are strongly related to loss incurred. The limited empirical evidence of provider response to liability and the deterrent effect of claims suggests — but cannot prove — that the net benefits of the malpractice system may plausibly be positive. Nevertheless, reforms designed to reduce inappropriate compensation and deter excessive litigation and defensive practice would make the system more cost-effective. The empirical evidence, based primarily in the US, includes studies of malpractice injuries; physician response to liability; trends in claim frequency, severity (size), and claim disposition; and the malpractice insurance market. Analyses of actual and proposed reforms address tort reform, no fault, enterprise liability and optimal liability under managed care. More limited evidence is available on the negligence regimes in Canada and the UK, and the quasi no-fault regimes in Sweden and New Zealand.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Chapter 9 Copyright, Art and Internet: Blessing the Curse? ¤ The new technologies of digitalization and the Internet threaten the market positions of artists and intermediaries. Artists because the technology of production of works may be readily accessible and craftsmanship may no longer be a defining characteristic of art. Intermediaries because their rents are linked to entry barriers in the distribution market. This curse of new technologies may be a blessing in disguise since it also increases the possibilities of production, of distribution and the emergence of new works of art. The system of intellectual protection gives market power to artists and the economic literature has analyzed the tradeoff between the dynamic inefficiency generated by this market power and the need to preserve the incentives for creation. We review this literature and some of its recent applications to artistic, and more generally intellectual, creation. Even if artists can capture perfectly the market value of the future home production by consumers, they may favor a strong copyright regime that prevents consumers from using their home production. Intermediaries and artists may want to limit competition in order to increase the rents brought by the indivisibility of creative ideas. The preferences of artists for strong or weaker form (e.g., licensing of rights for home production) of copyright may be related to their creativity.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4>
Chapter 19 Teacher Supply ¤ This chapter presents an overview of economic models of teacher supply and explains the modeling implications for both cross-section and time series econometric modeling.

A novel planar two-axis leaf-type notch flexure hinge with coincident rotation axes and its application to micropositioning stages ¤ Compliant mechanisms with flexure hinges are well-suited for high-precision applications due to their smooth and repeatable motion. However, the synthesis of planar compliant mechanisms based on notch flexure hinges is mostly limited to the use of single-axis hinges due to the lack of certain multiple-axis flexure hinges. This contribution introduces a novel planar leaf-type notch flexure hinge with two coincident rotation axes based on circular pre-curved leaf springs. A generally suitable hinge geometry is determined through a parametric study using the finite element method (FEM). Finally, the two-axis flexure hinge is applied and investigated for the use in two planar micropositioning stages for the rectilinear guidance of an output link with a large centimeter stroke. The presented two-axis flexure hinge turns out to be a suitable approach to monolithically connect three links of a compliant mechanism in a planar and precise way.

Chapter 14. Modeling the Global EconomyForward-Looking Scenarios for Agriculture ¤ The development of global computable general equilibrium (CGE) models lagged behind development of national models as globally consistent datasets were not readily available and software and hardware were generally not up to the task. As the latter improved and data became more readily available particularly through the efforts of the GTAP consortium the use of global CGE models to examine critical economic policies of an international or a global nature exploded in the 1990s. The catalysts of the use of global CGE models were international trade negotiations in the form of the Uruguay Round and the rising concern over global warming. Over the last two decades global CGE models have expanded in size, complexity and the range of policy issues including bilateral and regional trade agreements, the role of trade preferences, trade in services, international migration, foreign direct investment, cross-border environmental issues, structural transformation, demographics and more. This chapter is focused on work largely undertaken at the World Bank over the last decade using the ENVISAGE model with a focus on long-run dynamics, impacts on agriculture and interactions with climate change.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065341-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210294-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224214-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6>
Chapter 10 Forecasting with Many Predictors ¤ Historically, time series forecasts of economic variables have used only a handful of predictor variables, while forecasts based on a large number of predictors have been the province of judgmental forecasts and large structural econometric models. The past decade, however, has seen considerable progress in the development of time series forecasting methods that exploit many predictors, and this chapter surveys these methods. The first group of methods considered is forecast combination (forecast pooling), in which a single forecast is produced from a panel of many forecasts. The second group of methods is based on dynamic factor models, in which the comovements among a large number of economic variables are treated as arising from a small number of unobserved sources, or factors. In a dynamic factor model, estimates of the factors (which become increasingly precise as the number of series increases) can be used to forecast individual economic variables. The third group of methods is Bayesian model averaging, in which the forecasts from very many models, which differ in their constituent variables, are averaged based on the posterior probability assigned to each model. The chapter also discusses empirical Bayes methods, in which the hyperparameters of the priors are estimated. An empirical illustration applies these different methods to the problem of forecasting the growth rate of the U.S. index of industrial production with 130 predictor variables.

Chapter 6 Repeated games of incomplete information: Non-zero-sum ¤ Non-zero-sum infinitely repeated games with incomplete information are an appropriate model to analyze durable relationships among individuals whose information is not symmetric. The results in the zero-sum case are used explicitly in the non-zero-sum case. In the tradition of the Folk theorem, the characterization of equilibria makes use of individual rationality conditions. In the chapter, the repetition of the game has the effects of an enforcement mechanism and of a signalling mechanism at the same time. Most results available at the moment concern a particular model: there are two players, exactly one of whom is completely informed of the situation (this is called lack of information on one side), with each player observing the actions of the other after every stage (full monitoring). Nash equilibria have been studiedhe main result is a characterization of Nash equilibria in infinitely repeated games with lack of information on one side; the results of the zero-sum case are used to evaluate the individually rational levels of each player. Communication equilibria has also been studied the main theme is that an infinitely repeated game contains enough communication possibilities to obtain the equivalence of different solution concepts. The game (as in Aumann's correlated equilibrium), together with the structure of the repeated game itself, is hopped to be sufficient to obtain the effect of any coordinating device, acting at every stage of the game.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
The current financial crisis : Causes and policy issues ¤ This article treats some ideas and issues that are part of ongoing reflection at the OECD. They were first raised in a major research article for the Reserve Bank of Australia conference in July 2008, and benefited from policy discussion in and around that conference. One fundamental cause of the crisis was a change in the business model of banking, mixing credit with equity culture. When this model was combined with complex interactions from incentives emanating from macro policies, changes in regulations, taxation, and corporate governance, the current crisis became the inevitable result. The paper points to the need for far-reaching reform for a more sustainable situation in the future.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6>
Chapter 27 Strategic Trade Policy ¤ This chapter focuses on the concept of strategic trade policy. The analysis of strategic trade policy is part of a broader research agenda that has been very active since the beginning of the 1980s. Over this period, international trade economists have sought to incorporate oligopoly and other forms of imperfect competition into the formal analysis of international trade and trade policy so as to make contact with important empirical regularities and policy concerns. The chapter defines strategic trade policy as the trade policy that conditions (or alters) a strategic relationship among firms. This definition implies that the existence of a strategic relationship among firms is a necessary precondition for the application of strategic trade policy. The basic game theoretic structure of strategic trade policy is discussed in the chapter. It also focuses on the third-market model, in which rival oligopolistic exporters from two countries compete only in a third market. The chapter develops the basic strategic export subsidies model in this context, along with some of the more important qualifications and extensions. It presents the reciprocal markets model, in which oligopolistic firms in two countries compete in those two countries. The chapter also reviews some of the major calibrated simulations of strategic trade policy.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1>
Publicly provided services and the distribution of households' economic resources ¤ Conventional income distribution statistics subtract taxes from household income but do not take into account the distributional effects of the services financed through these taxes. As many of the functions of government are available to the population free of charge or at a subsidised rate, this means that income distribution figures exaggerate the degree of inequality in the distribution of resources. This article examines the extent to which this is the case, and assesses whether statements about the relative inequality prevailing in different countries are reliable. Estimates of the impact of government services on the static distribution of household income, based on two different approaches, show that publicly-provided goods and services significantly narrow the dispersion of income inequality across countries with only small changes in the ranking of individual countries, and that the effects are larger when looking at the extremes of the distributions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2>
Chapter 2 Defense economics and international security ¤ Defense economics derives from and is embedded in the multi-dimensional array of issues each country must address when providing for its national security. Applying economic concepts and methods, it attempts to evaluate this great diversity of security related questions, and to understand how each country's security interacts and fits in with the security of all nations in the international system. Included in Defense Economics are such overarching questions as: definition of what security actually is; how resource scarcity, distribution, and stage of economic development influences the security obtainable by each nation in the international system; relationships between defense sectors and national economies within and across countries; efficiency in provision of security; incentive structures which promote or resolve conflict; institutional arrangements which promote or retard peace, stability, and equity.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132793-7>
Financial crisis: Deposit insurance and related financial safety net aspects ¤ Government provision of a financial safety net for banks and other financial institutions has been a key element of the policy response to the current financial crisis. In the process, the design of many safety net elements, such as deposit insurance, has been redrawn in many jurisdictions. In particular, governments extended existing guarantees and introduced new ones. While these measures did not address the root causes of the lack of confidence, they were nevertheless helpful in avoiding a further accelerated loss of confidence, thus buying valuable time.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3>
Chapter 12 Welfare Theory and Valuation ¤ Public policies that lead to a reduction in the emissions of air and water pollutants or the protection of sensitive ecosystems presumably increase the well-being of many members of society. Applied welfare economists are accustomed to measuring the welfare effects of policies that invoke price changes. If it is granted that the public good attributes of most dimensions of environmental quality preclude the development of well functioning markets for these service flows, how are the monetary values of changes in environmental quality to be measured? The past twenty to thirty years have seen the rapid development of the economic theory and techniques for measuring the demands for nonmarketed goods, and in this chapter we attempt to sketch out the major results. We review the basic concept of economic welfare and derive measures of welfare change for both changes in prices of market goods and changes in quantities and qualities of nonmarket goods. We then describe the principal economic techniques for estimating the benefits of environmental quality improvements when these improvements either directly affect individuals' well-being or indirectly affect individuals through constraints they face. Perhaps the major class of measurement methods is based on the observation that changes in environmental quality may cause individuals to alter purchases of goods and services that are complements or substitutes for environmental quality in their preference orderings. These revealed preference methods are the primary focus of this chapter. A second major approach to obtaining estimates of the benefits and costs of environmental changes, stated preference methods, are addressed in detail in later chapters. Our treatment of welfare effects places special emphasis on the connection between the underlying economic theory and practical empirical models.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006340-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061616-2>
Chapter 3. Charter Schools : A Survey of Research on Their Characteristics and Effectiveness ¤ The charter school movement is nearing its 25th anniversary, making this an opportune time to take stock of the movement by addressing the following questions: Where do charter schools locate? Who do they serve? Who manages them? Who teaches in them? Most importantly, what are the effects of charter schools on the academic performance of students who enroll in charters and on students who remain in traditional public schools? We review research findings that shed light on these questions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2>
Chapter 8. The Political Economy of Environmental Policy ¤ This chapter provides a review and assessment of the extensive literature on the political determination of environmental regulation. A promising theoretical literature has emerged relatively recently that provides models of the political interaction of government with various interest groups in the setting of environmental standards and the choice of regulatory instruments. A large empirical literature supports such models, finding evidence of the influence of interest groups but also evidence that net social benefits are often an important determinant of environmental policy choices. A later section of the paper takes up the issue of environmental federalism and the large and growing theoretical literature that addresses the so-called competitive “race to the bottom” as various jurisdictions attempt to use environmental policy as an instrument of economic competition. The evidence on all this is sparse, although some recent work in the U.S. is unable to find any support for the race-to-the-bottom hypothesis. The paper concludes with a brief look at the evolution of environmental policy and finds that economics has come to play a growing role both in the setting of standards for environmental quality and in the design of regulatory measures. There seems to be a discernible trend toward more efficient decision-making for environmental protection.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075236-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061619-8>
Chapter 12. Global Applied General Equilibrium Analysis Using the Global Trade Analysis Project Framework ¤ This chapter provides an overview of the first two decades of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) an effort to support a standardized database and computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling platform for international economic analysis. It characterizes GTAP in four different dimensions: institutional innovation, a network, a database and a standardized modeling platform. Guiding principles for the GTAP modeling framework include flexibility, ease of use, transparency, and symmetric treatment of production and utility fundamentals across regions. The chapter reviews core modeling assumptions relating to the regional household, private consumption behavior, welfare decomposition, the Global Bank, treatment of the international trade and transport sector, and imports. Model validation and sensitivity analysis, as well as software issues receive attention as well. The chapter also offers brief overviews of the two major areas of application: international economic integration and global environmental issues. It closes a discussion of future directions for the Project.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065341-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210294-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224214-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5>
Chapter 13. The Pricing of Art and the Art of Pricing: Pricing Styles in the Concert Industry ¤ We document the existence of pricing styles in the concert industry. Artists differ in the extent to which they rely on second- and third-degree price discrimination, and in the probability of their concerts selling out. Most strikingly, artists who use multiple seating categories are more likely to vary prices across markets and less likely to sell out concerts. These patterns are difficult to explain within a standard profit maximization paradigm. The hypothesis that artists differ in their willingness to exploit market power provides a plausible framework for explaining these patterns in artist pricing style.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1>
Chapter 3. Forecasting Output ¤ This chapter surveys the recent literature on output forecasting, and examines the real-time forecasting ability of several models for U.S. output growth. In particular, it evaluates the accuracy of short-term forecasts of linear and nonlinear structural and reduced-form models, and judgmental forecasts of output growth. Our emphasis is on using solely the information that was available at the time the forecast was being made, in order to reproduce the forecasting problem facing forecasters in real-time. We find that there is a large difference in forecast performance across business cycle phases. In particular, it is much harder to forecast output growth during recessions than during expansions. Simple linear and nonlinear autoregressive models have the best accuracy in forecasting output growth during expansions, although the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model and the vector autoregressive model with financial variables do relatively well. On the other hand, we find that most models do poorly in forecasting output growth during recessions. The autoregressive model based on the nonlinear dynamic factor model that takes into account asymmetries between expansions and recessions displays the best real time forecast accuracy during recessions. Even though the Blue Chip forecasts are comparable, the dynamic factor Markov switching model has better accuracy, particularly with respect to the timing and depth of output fall during recessions in real time. The results suggest that there are large gains in considering separate forecasting models for normal times and models especially designed for periods of abrupt changes, such as during recessions and financial crises.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1>
Waste Generation and Recycling ¤ There are two serious failures that arise in the management of solid waste. The first relates to the existence of negative externalities in the individual decision-making over waste generation and disposal. When individuals decide on how much to consume and what to consume, they do not take into account how much waste they produce. Because the external costs of waste generation (such as air and water pollution) are ignored by individuals, more waste is produced and disposed of than is socially optimal. The second serious failure relates to the ways in which waste collection services are typically financed. More often than not, individuals pay for waste disposal in lump sums through general taxes or flat payments to local governments or private collectors. Hence, waste disposal costs are not fully reflected in the prices households face at the margin. Even if these flat charges included both the private and external costs of waste production and disposal, individuals would still face zero prices for additional waste produced, and would thus tend to produce (and dispose of) more waste than if they were to pay for the additional garbage according to its social marginal cost.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3>
Chapter 4. Migration and Education ¤ Sjaastad (1962) viewed migration in the same way as education: as an investment in the human agent. Migration and education are decisions that are indeed intertwined in many dimensions. Education and skill acquisition play an important role at many stages of an individual's migration. Differential returns to skills in origin and destination country are a main driver of migration. The economic success of the immigrant in the destination country is to a large extent determined by his or her educational background, how transferable these skills are to the host country labor market and how much he or she invests in further skills after arrival. The desire to acquire skills in the host country that have a high return in the country of origin may be another important reason for a migration. From an intertemporal point of view, the possibility of a later migration may affect educational decisions in the home country long before a migration is realized. In addition, the decisions of migrants regarding their own educational investment and their expectations about future migration plans may affect the educational attainment of their children. But migration and education are not only related for those who migrate or their descendants. Migrations of some individuals may have consequences for educational decisions of those who do not migrate, both in the home and in the host country. By easing credit constraints through remittances, migration of some may help others to go to school. By changing the skill base of the receiving country, migration may change incentives to invest in certain types of human capital. In addition, migrants and their children may create externalities that influence educational outcomes of nonmigrants in the destination country. This chapter will discuss some of the key areas that connect migration and education.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006664-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036229-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112628-2>
Chapter 60 Game-theoretic analysis of legal rules and institutions ¤ We offer a selective survey of the uses of cooperative and non-cooperative game theory in the analysis of legal rules and institutions. In so doing, we illustrate some of the ways in which law influences behavior, analyze the mechanism design aspect of legal rules and institutions, and examine some of the difficulties in the use of game-theoretic concepts to clarify legal doctrine.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8>
Chapter 72 Total Factor Productivity Growth in Agriculture : The Role of Technological Capital ¤ In this chapter we compute measures of total factor productivity (TFP) growth for developing countries and then contrast TFP growth with technological capital indexes. In developing these indexes, we incorporate schooling capital to yield two new indexes: Invention-Innovation Capital and Technology Mastery. We find that TFP performance is strongly related to technological capital and that technological capital is required for TFP and cost reduction growth. Investments in technological capital require long-term (20- to 40-year) investments, which are typically made by governments and aid agencies and are the only viable escape route from mass poverty.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4704302-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2>
Reflections on Growth Theory ¤ This note contains some general and idiosyncratic reflections on the current state of neoclassical growth theory. It expresses some surprise at the lack of attention both to multi-sector growth models and to multi-country models with trade and capital flows. It also suggests that there might be value in further analysis of some old topics like capital–labor substitution with an expanded definition of capital, and the interaction of growth and medium-run phenomena (or, to put it differently, the interaction of demand-side and supply-side variations).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059252-2>
Chapter 44 Labor markets and economic growth ¤ Among macroeconomists, the shift of research effort is near total, eclipsing the business-cycle focus that had dominated the field for decades. Behind this is a recognition of the enormous welfare implications of sustained economic growth, and a renewed desire to understand the vast differences in living standards among countries, which dates back at least to Smith. What some have called the "neoclassical revival" in growth economics has come to dominate macroeconomic research. Developments in this area should be of particular interest to labor economists because much of the revival of growth economics builds on the theory of human capital. Because human capital is, by definition, embodied skills and knowledge, and because advances in technical knowledge drive economic growth, it follows that human capital accumulation and economic growth are intimately related. This chapter reviews recent developments in growth economics, with a particular focus on labor market and human capital issues.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127364-3>
Chapter 9 Regulation of Health, Safety, and Environmental Risks ¤ This paper provides a systematic review of the economic analysis of health, safety, and environmental regulations. Although the market failures that give rise to a rationale for intervention are well known, not all market failures imply that market risk levels are too great. Hazard warnings policies often can address informational failures. Some market failures may be exacerbated by government policies, particularly those embodying conservative risk assessment practices. Labor market estimates of the value of statistical life provide a useful reference point for the efficient risk tradeoffs for government regulation. Guided by restrictive legislative mandates, regulatory policies often strike a quite different balance with an inordinately high cost per life saved. The risk-risk analysis methodology enables analysts to assess the net safety implications of policy efforts. Inadequate regulatory enforcement and behavioral responses to regulation may limit their effectiveness, while rising societal wealth will continue to generate greater levels of health and safety.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048737-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066510-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117663-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135492-8>
Chapter 6. The economics of brands and branding ¤ Consumer goods industries tend to be dominated by a small number of nationally-branded goods. In many cases, brands are one of the few sources of differentiation between otherwise physically undifferentiated products. In this chapter we survey the literature on the role of consumer branding and brand preferences in driving consumer demand. We also discuss the incentives for firms to invest in and build brands on the supply side. Finally, we discuss the measurement of the economic value of brands as intangible assets.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037589-4>
Chapter Thirteen. Intellectual Property, Information Technology, Biomedical Research, and Marketing of Patented Products ¤ Intellectual property rights are viewed as essential to medical innovation, but very often involve social costs due to patent monopolies and other inefficiencies. We review the positive theory of innovation in health care, as it relates to the determination of innovation demand and supply. The positive theory is related to a host of competing normative models of intellectual property, including patent races, cumulative or sequential innovation, and the implications of health insurance. We also discuss how intellectual property can be used to solve a variety of production externalities that afflict health care, including network externalities, underprovision of marketing, and inefficient provision of diagnostic information. Finally, we discuss novel approaches to protecting intellectual property, including rewards, innovation subsidies, and publicly provided health insurance.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>

4. Games ¤ This chapter reﬂects attempts to improve upon it and advance our understanding of why it works. The question becomes whether or not the principles of Nash equilibrium can be viewed in the behavior as modification of the attitudes or whether the attitudes themselves induce fundamentally different principles of behavior that can replace the strategic behavior of game theory. The substance of the papers is that strategic behavior is a deep and reliable property of human behavior in conﬂict environments. A sophisticated experienced weighted learning model is compared to reinforcement learning and weighted fictitious play across a variety of games. The structure of these models is discussed together with interpretations of the measured parameters and areas of potential improvement.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8>
Pension Information : The Annual Statement at a Glance ¤ The world’s allegedly shortest mail correspondence took place in 1862.

The letter read: « ? » and the publishers’ reply « ! ».	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
Acknowledgements ¤ This chapter presents an acknowledgement by the author to various other people, such as Orley Ashenfelter and Alan Kruege from the Industrial Relations Section at Princeton, for the help in consistently acting to ensure the very best outcome for the major projects described in this volume.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4>
Tax Ratios on Labour and Capital Income and on Consumption ¤ This paper presents revised tax ratios based on more realistic assumptions than those used in a previous study applying the same approach (based on tax revenue statistics and national accounts data) to measuring the effective tax burden. Although the levels of the revised tax ratios are sometimes quite different from those previously found, the two data sets are generally highly correlated. The paper also presents a sensitivity analysis of relaxing some remaining unrealistic assumptions for countries and periods where that is possible. It is found that this often has a large effect on the tax ratios, especially for capital, and the two data sets are sometimes no longer highly correlated. This highlights the need to use these ratios in conjunction with other indicators, such as average effective tax rates, to corroborate the story they tell.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014957-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4>
Chapter 22 Predatory Pricing: Rare Like a Unicorn? ¤ Despite the discovery of predatory intent in several widely cited antitrust cases, many industrial organization economists have argued that predatory pricing is irrational and rarely observed. The argument is that pricing below cost in order to drive competitors out of the market will be irrational for two reasons: (1) there are more profitable ways (e.g., acquisitions) to eliminate competitors, and (2) future price increases will result in new entry. Decisions in antitrust cases have often resulted from documented predatory intent, which is sometimes attributed to an irrational motive for management to eliminate rivals. In the absence of a smoking gun, arguments turn on AreedaTurner cost-based tests, which are difficult to apply given the multi-product nature of most business operations. For these reasons, the issue of predatory pricing is a natural topic for laboratory studies where costs are induced directly.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2>
Chapter 5. The Empirics of Agglomeration Economies ¤ We propose an integrated framework to discuss the empirical literature on the local determinants of agglomeration effects. We start by presenting the theoretical mechanisms that ground individual and aggregate empirical specifications. We gradually introduce static effects, dynamic effects, and workers’ endogenous location choices. We emphasize the impact of local density on productivity, but we also consider many other local determinants supported by theory. Empirical issues are then addressed. The most important concerns are about endogeneity at the local and individual levels, the choice of a productivity measure between wages and total-factor productivity, and the roles of spatial scale, firms’ characteristics, and functional forms. Estimated impacts of local determinants of productivity, employment, and firms’ location choices are surveyed for both developed and developing economies. We finally provide a discussion of attempts to identify and quantify specific agglomeration mechanisms.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4239568-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121573-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182752-1>
Chapter 8. Financial Intermediation ¤ The savings/investment process in capitalist economies is organized around bank-like financial intermediaries (“banks”), making them a central institution of economic growth. These intermediaries borrow from consumer/savers and lend to companies that need resources for investment. In contrast, in capital markets investors contract directly with firms, creating marketable securities. The prices of these securities are observable, while financial intermediaries are opaque. Why are banks so pervasive? What are their roles? Are banks inherently unstable? Must the government regulate them? In this chapter we survey the last 15 years’ of theoretical and empirical research on these issues We begin with theories and evidence on the uniqueness of banks. Key issues include monitoring or evaluating borrowers, providing liquidity, combining lending and liquidity provision as a commitment mechanism, and the coexistence of banks and markets. We then examine interaction between banks and borrowers in more detail, focusing on the pros and cons of dynamic bank–borrower relationships, the relationship between loan structure and monitoring, and between banking sector structure and monitoring, “credit cycles” and capital constraints, and the role of “non-traditional” bank activities such as equity investment. We then turn to research on banking panics and the stability of the banking system, focusing on the incidence of banking panics internationally and historically, the causes of panics, the role of bank coalitions in forestalling panics, and whether banks are inherently flawed. This leads to questions concerning government regulation of banks. Here, we focus on possible moral hazard problems emanating from deposit insurance and on the roles of bank corporate governance and capital requirements. We conclude with a summary of our current understanding and directions for future research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4508395-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4269795-5>
Chapter 14. The Complexity of Computing Equilibria ¤ In one of the most influential existence theorems in mathematics, John F. Nash proved in 1950 that any normal form game has an equilibrium. More than five decades later, it was shown that the computational task of finding such an equilibrium is intractable, that is, unlikely to be carried out within any feasible time limits for large enough games. This chapter develops the necessary background and formalism from the theory of algorithms and complexity developed in computer science, in order to understand this result, its context, its proof, and its implications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056243-8>
Chapter 1 Neoclassical Models of Endogenous Growth: The Effects of Fiscal Policy, Innovation and Fluctuations ¤ Despite its role as the centerpiece of modern growth theory, the Solow model is decidedly silent on some of its basic questions: Why is average growth in per capita income so much higher now than it was 200 years ago? Why is per capita income so much higher in the member countries of the OECD than in the less developed countries (LDC) of the world? In this chapter we review the recent literature on endogenous growth. We concentrate on convex models and we restrict attention to the case in which markets are competitive. After a brief review of the basic mechanisms that produces growth, we concentrate on three topics: the impact of fiscal policies on growth, the role of innovation and the relationship between uncertainty and growth.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128160-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059252-2>
Chapter 7. Search in Macroeconomic Models of the Labor Market ¤ This chapter assesses how models with search frictions have shaped our understanding of aggregate labor market outcomes in two contexts: business cycle fluctuations and long-run (trend) changes. We first consolidate data on aggregate labor market outcomes for a large set of OECD countries. We then ask how models with search improve our understanding of these data. Our results are mixed. Search models are useful for interpreting the behavior of some additional data series, but search frictions per se do not seem to improve our understanding of movements in total hours at either business cycle frequencies or in the long-run. Still, models with search seem promising as a framework for understanding how different wage setting processes affect aggregate labor market outcomes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9>
Chapter 17 Spatial price analysis ¤ Agricultural commodities are typically produced over an extensive spatial area and are costly to transport relative to their total value. These characteristics yield a complex set of spatial price linkages which are often studied to gain insights into the performance of markets. An extensive literature has addressed a wide range of issues relating to spatial price linkages. Issues relate to market conduct and performance, regional and international trade relationships, efficiency, and developing economy market performance. This chapter reviews issues related to economic and empirical models of spatial price linkages. The relative weaknesses and merits of each approach are identified.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6>
Chapter 12. Gender Inequality ¤ The chapter examines how the various dimensions of economic inequality between men and women are analyzed today. Beyond the gender wage gap—a central issue—and of course the still far from equal sharing of housework, the chapter also reviews research on gender inequality in access to self-employment, the gender gap in pensions, and the emerging topic of a gender gap in wealth, attempting to highlight the paths between the various facets of gender inequality. Throughout the review, much attention is paid to measurement issues, the scope of empirical evidence, and to limitations due either to the small number of large and comparable data sets or to conventional approaches that limit the possibilities to compare men and women.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013898-7>
Chapter 1 Labor supply of men: A survey ¤ This chapter presents a survey on the labor supply of men. This survey of male labor supply covers the determinants of whether men work for pay in the labor market and, if so, the determinants of their hours of work. The chapter also discusses the work behavior of men prior to their retirement from the labor force. Moreover, even though there are noteworthy investigations into the labor supply of men in many different countries, this survey is restricted almost entirely to the Anglo-American literature. The chapter identifies the major time-series and cross-section empirical regularities in male labor supply behavior. It is these that any economic theory should be designed to address. The chapter presents the canonical static model of labor supply and then immediately proceeds to deal with the problems in applying this model at the aggregative level. The static model is amended to handle the situation of nonlinear budget constraints. The chapter concludes with an outline of the most popular life-cycle model of labor supply. The chapter also addresses the issues in and results from the estimation of the static model. Problems in specifying the model are first considered and then the results are presented from the U.S. nonexperimental literature, the British literature, and the U.S. experimental literature. The chapter also discusses the estimates from the applications of the life-cycle model. END	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3>

Chapter 26 Terrorism: An Empirical Analysis ¤ The chapter surveys the empirical literature concerning the measurement of terrorism, effectiveness of counterterrorism policies, the economic consequences of terrorism, and the economic causes of terrorism. In Section 2, terrorist incidents are grouped according to incident type, victim, and location. It is shown that terrorism began a steady decline in all regions (except for Eurasia) during the early to mid-1990s. However, the severity of the typical incident has been increasing over time. Also, several different data sets are compared in order to judge the reliability of alternative methods of obtaining and coding the data. Section 3 discusses a number of empirical studies that measure the effects of counterterrorism policies on the overall level of terrorism and on the various subcomponents of the overall series. In accord with the rational-actor model, an increase in the “relative price” of one type of terrorist activity induces a substitution out of that activity and into the now relatively less-expensive activity. Logistically similar activities display the greatest substitution possibilities. Moreover, periods of high-terrorism seem to be less persistent than periods with less terrorism. This is consistent with the notion that terrorists face a resource constraint. Section 4 pays special attention to the changes in terrorism due to the events of September 11, 2001 (9/11) and the resulting changes in counterterrorism policy. It is shown that the post-9/11 counterterrorism policies hampered al-Qaida's ability to direct logistically complex operations such as assassinations and hostage takings. The main influence of 9/11 has been on the composition, and not the overall level of terrorism. There has been a ratcheting-up of serious terrorist attacks against the US targets so that Americans are safer at home, but not abroad, following 9/11 and the enhanced homeland security. Section 5 surveys a number of empirical papers that attempt to estimate the macroeconomic and microeconomic costs of terrorism. Papers surveyed in the first part of the section indicate that the overall macroeconomic costs of terrorism are low. However, it is argued that the methodological complexities of estimating the macroeconomic costs of terrorism on a cross-section of widely disparate nations are nearly insurmountable. The macroeconomic costs of terrorism are best measured on a country-by-country basis. The second part of the section summarizes empirical studies of the microeconomic costs of terrorism on tourism, net foreign direct investment, international trade flows, and financial markets in selected countries. Section 6 considers the economic determinants of terrorism. Particular attention is paid to the common presumption that terrorism is caused by a lack of economic opportunities. Conclusions and directions for future research are contained in Section 7.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132793-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115806-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065004-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134037-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134192-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063255-6>
Chapter 19. Econometric Methods for the Analysis of Assignment Problems in the Presence of Complementarity and Social Spillovers ¤ Concern over the distributional effects of policies which induce changes in peer group structure, or associational redistributions (Durlauf, 1996c), motivates a substantial body of theoretical and empirical research in economics, sociology, psychology, and education. A growing collection of econometric methods for characterizing the effects of such policies are now available. This chapter surveys these methods. I discuss the identification and estimation of the distributional effects of partner reassignment in one-on-one matching models, the average outcome and inequality effects of segregation, and treatment response in the presence of spillovers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027266-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066514-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132883-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120990-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5>
Chapter 5 Intergenerational and interhousehold economic links ¤ This chapter discusses two theoretical frameworks that economists use to analyze links between households. The first is based on altruistic preferences and the second framework falls under the heading transactions cost approach. Altruistic and non-altruistic transfers can link together households, most likely households of different generations within the same family line. The relatives may find advantages to engaging in joint production or purchasing services from one another outside of markets. One implication certainly is that not all intra-household interactions need involve altruism. A second is that it cannot be assumed that measured monetary flows passing among relatives necessarily constitute transfersas opposed to payments for goods and services or for subsequent repayment with interest. A third is that transactionscost formulations may be most applicable, where participant incomes and sums transacted are low. Although, this chapter analyzes altruism and exchange separately, in practice the two may often accompany one anotherwith altruism reducing enforcement difficulties in interfamily exchanges.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123185-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006294-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006292-2>
Chapter 1. Migration Theory ¤ This chapter provides a comprehensive expository survey and synthesis of the theoretical determinants of migration. Early work beginning with Adam Smith, running through the pioneering research of Larry Sjaastad in the 1960s, and continuing through the end of the twentieth century established the broad themes that persist in the literature. Migration is an act of human capital investment. Whether migration occurs across internal or international borders is largely irrelevant from a theoretical standpoint, as both types of flows are primarily driven by a desire to exploit geographic variation in the return to labor. We go on to show that while the earliest models treated migration as a static decision determined by exogenous wages that vary across different levels of human capital, more recent models emphasize the endogenous and dynamic nature of the migration decision and wages. We conclude the chapter with suggestions of further extensions of the human capital/migration model.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069332-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4501977-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120730-0>
Chapter 15. Forecasting with Bayesian Vector Autoregression ¤ This chapter reviews Bayesian methods for inference and forecasting with VAR models. Bayesian inference and, by extension, forecasting depends on numerical methods for simulating from the posterior distribution of the parameters and special attention is given to the implementation of the simulation algorithm.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059787-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047390-9>
Chapter 21. The Importance of Segregation, Discrimination, Peer Dynamics, and Identity in Explaining Trends in the Racial Achievement Gap ¤ After decades of narrowing, the achievement gap between black and white school children widened in the 1990s a period when the labor market rewards for education were increasing. This presents an important puzzle for economists. In this chapter, I investigate the extent to which economic models of segregation, information-based discrimination, peer dynamics, and identity can explain this puzzle. Under a reasonable set of assumptions, models of peer dynamics and identity are consistent with the time-series data. Segregation and models of discrimination both contradict the trends in important ways.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120990-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132883-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066514-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027266-7>
Chapter 60 Past Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture ¤ This paper examines the likely impact on agriculture of the climate change which has already taken place between 1960 and 2000. Accumulating greenhouse gases have caused global temperatures to rise approximately 0.25 °C during this period and for precipitation patterns to shift. Using cross-sectional and crop simulation evidence, temperature, precipitation, and carbon dioxide response functions are used to calculate the impacts on agriculture. Temperature and precipitation changes together have caused estimated global impacts ranging from a loss of 0.05% to a gain of 0.9% of agricultural GDP. Including carbon fertilization effects, historic climate change is estimated to have caused a 2–4% increase in global production. Given the rapid increase in agricultural production over the last 40 years, the contribution of climate change to the overall growth of agriculture has been small, contributing between 2.6% and 5.4% of overall growth. This effect has been larger in mid to high latitude countries where climate change is estimated to have caused 4–7% of historic agricultural growth and smaller in low latitude countries where the climate change has contributed between 0.6% and 3% of the growth. Future climate changes which are expected to be much larger, may well have very different effects than past climate changes. Future changes may continue to be slightly beneficial to global agriculture up to about 2.5 °C, but they will eventually become harmful and cause reductions in global production.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4704302-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5>
Chapter 4. Now-Casting and the Real-Time Data Flow ¤ The term now-casting is a contraction for now and forecasting and has been used for a long time in meteorology and recently also in economics. In this chapter we survey recent developments in economic now-casting with special focus on those models that formalize key features of how market participants and policymakers read macroeconomic data releases in real-time, which involves monitoring many data, forming expectations about them and revising the assessment on the state of the economy whenever realizations diverge sizeably from those expectations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4358095-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066399-1>
Chapter 37 A synthesis of agricultural trade economics ¤ Government intervention in agricultural sectors in both developed and developing countries has resulted in huge distortions in international markets. We describe the types of policies used in the agricultural sector and summarize quantitative measures that suggest their importance. Agricultural trade economists have tried to measure these distortions, to explain their causes, and to recommend policy reform. The discipline has been primarily empirical, relying chiefly on econometric and synthetic models and to a lesser extent on historical analysis and case studies. A review of attempts to measure trade elasticities, exchange rate effects, and market power illustrates the empirical questions that agricultural trade economists have studied and their results. A summary of empirical political economy models shows how these have been used to explain the types and the levels of government intervention. We then use U.S. grain trade policy in the 1970s and 1980s to illustrate in more detail the kinds of policies that agricultural economists have studied, and their assessments of these policies. In a theoretical section we outline several important ideas that underpin the empirical work in the discipline: the theory of comparative advantage, the theory of the second best, and the Principle of Targeting. We review the theory of trade policy for a country large enough to alter its terms of trade, and assess its relevance to agricultural trade. We also discuss the extent to which uncertainty and missing insurance markets might justify trade policy. In a concluding section we comment on the contribution that agricultural economists have made to trade reform and the manner in which changes in markets are likely to cause a change in the focus of the discipline.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6>
Chapter 26 Environmental implications of non-environmental policies ¤ This chapter seeks to understand the linkages between non-environmental polices and the environment, with a particular focus on taxation and subsidies. In order to understand the quite complex literature on this subject, we draw on the theory of the second best and the theory of optimal taxation. The thrust of the chapter is that there are multiple objectives and interactions among the various policies employed to meet them. In retrospect, one can always ‘do better’ in, say, improving efficiency and environmental quality without worsening the income distribution. What is interesting is to understand what the environmental impacts of the non-environmental policies have been and what lessons one can learn about the formulation of similar policies in the future. That is the central purpose of the chapter. Section 2 examines subsidies in agriculture and transport, as well as policies relating to trade liberalization, privatization, and public infrastructure investment. Section 3 is devoted specifically to energy subsidies. It reviews the results of partial- and general-equilibrium studies on energy subsidies, including environmental impacts (in particular, carbon emissions). Section 4 presents a general-equilibrium model in which energy subsidies and other taxes in the economy are reduced in a revenue-neutral fashion. Two important general-equilibrium effects, the revenue-recycling effect and the tax-interaction effect, are introduced in this section. Sections 5 and 6 continue the discussion of revenue-neutral fiscal policy changes, focusing on the substitution of environmental taxes for other taxes, in particular taxes on labor. This is the “double dividend” debate. Section 5 presents the theory, while Section 6 presents empirical evidence for the European Union. The latter section focuses primarily on employment effects, not welfare effects (the “employment double dividend” vs. “gross welfare dividend”). Section 7 summarizes the main points of the chapter.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061638-1>
Chapter 12. Taxation, Pensions, and Demographic Change ¤ This chapter provides a review of some implications of demographic shift arising from population aging for fiscal policy, taxation policy, and social security settings. The key implications of population aging that have been forthcoming from the many national and international macroeconomic modeling studies are presented. These implications are that population aging will put significant stress on governments’ fiscal situations under current policy settings. Consideration of policy options to accommodate population aging leads to examination of age-dependent taxation, the means testing of social security benefits, general taxation and pension design, and the analysis of taxation policy over time. The chapter concludes with some comments on the nature of the literature reviewed and on possible directions for future research.

Chapter 42 Policy-related developments in agricultural economics: Synthesis of handbook volume 2 ¤ Extension of factual and analytical work to policy issues has been a feature of agricultural economics from its beginnings, but only in recent decades have these efforts become part of the scientific core of what agricultural economists do. At the same time, the range of policy analysis has expanded to cover environmental economics, issues in rural economic development, and the range of market imperfections and economic analysis of politics. This chapter reviews the accomplishments and remaining tasks to be undertaken, as discussed in Volume 2 of this Handbook.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034402-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073993-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079351-5>
Chapter 40 The analysis of labor markets using matched employer-employee data ¤ Matched employer-employee data contain information collected from households and individuals as well as information collected from businesses or establishments. Both administrative and sample survey sources are considered. Both longitudinal and cross-sectional applications are discussed. We review studies from 17 different countries using 38 different systems for creating the linked data. We provide a detailed discussion of the methods used to create the linked datasets, the statistical and economic models used to analyze these data, and a comprehensive set of results from the different countries. We consider compensation structure, wage and employment mobility, and the relation between firm outcomes and worker characteristics in detail. Matched employer-employee data provide the empirical basis for further refinements of the theory of workplace organization, compensation design, mobility and production; however, the arrival of these data has been relatively recent.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127364-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3>
Chapter Sixteen. Equity in Health and Health Care ¤ We discuss the conceptual foundations of measuring (in)equity in health and health care. After an overview of the recent developments in the measurement of socioeconomic inequalities and in racial disparities, we show how these partial approaches can be seen as special cases of the more general social choice approach to fair allocation and equality of opportunity. We suggest that this latter framework offers many new analytical possibilities and is sufficiently rich to accommodate various ethical views. We emphasize that horizontal and vertical equity are intricately linked to each other. We then argue that a focus on overall well-being is necessary to put the partial results on health (care) inequity into a broader perspective, and we discuss the pros and cons of various methods to evaluate the joint distribution of health and income: multidimensional inequality indices, dominance approaches, the use of happiness measures, and finally the concept of equivalent income. Throughout the chapter the theoretical analysis is complemented with an overview of recent empirical results.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130935-2>
Chapter 6 Value and the Valuation of Art in Economic and Aesthetic Theory ¤ Artistic value played a minor role in classical philosophy, but moved to center stage in 18th century aesthetic theory and also played a role in moral philosophy. The value of Art and the process of its valuation has remained an indispensable subject of modern aesthetics, while economists have excluded these topics from consideration. Recent attention to “external effects” has opened new ways of interpreting artistic value in a manner consistent with economic theory. Sections 1–5 narrate historical positions in both disciplines, many of which have left their imprint on current analysis. Sec- tions 6–8 focus on the contemporary discussion of artistic values and their logic of evaluation in economics and in aesthetics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4315813-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4268059-1>
Chapter 4 Growth and development in trade models ¤ Growth and development are used interchangeably. Growth has the connotation of simply more of everything, while development is taken to refer to some qualitative transformation or structural shift. In practice, the development aspect of trade theory arises from the attempt to address problems regarded as of major significance for the less developed countries of the world economy. These have ranged from the infant industry problem of Hamilton and list to the terms of trade problem. The insights and concerns of these critics of orthodox doctrine have led to a number of attempts, sympathetic and otherwise, to handle these issues analytically. This chapter provides an overview on Ricardian theory and considers some neglected aspects of Ricardo's ideas on trade and growth, based on his analysis of the distributive shares. It discusses Arthur Lewis three-good Ricardian model of the terms of trade and Emmanuel's concept of unequal exchange. It also reviews neoclassical theory, which contains the major mainstream literature on growth and trade, with discussions on comparative statics, dynamics, and the concept of immiserizing growth and foreign investment. It also discusses various theoretical aspects of trade and development issues, including analyses of infant industry protection, two-gap models, the open dual economy, and an extensive discussion of recent work on NorthSouth models.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065365-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065468-0>
Chapter 49 New developments in the economic analysis of retirement ¤ The world's population is living longer but retiring earlier, and vast numbers of adults now spend as much as a third of their lifetimes relying on public and private retirement benefits. Consequently, labor economists are deeply interested in the forces driving retirement behavior, seeking to understand why people leave their jobs at young ages, how employers respond to an aging workforce, how government programs often induce job-leaving, and the economic consequences of retirement for individuals and society. This chapter examines new developments in retirement economics, focusing first on retirement trends and retiree wellbeing. We next turn to theoretical developments in the retirement literature where new models have enriched our understanding of the role of worker heterogeneity and uncertainty about health and productivity shocks. Lastly, we review some of the lessons that may drawn from the empirical analysis of retirement patterns undertaken over the last decade, showing how natural experiments and exciting new longitudinal datasets afford new opportunities to learn about the demand for and supply of older workers. We conclude that future researchers would do well to explore how retirement decisions are made in a household context, and to integrate saving as well as consumption in the labor supply decision. In addition we argue that much remains to be learned about how workers form expectations regarding their future retirement wellbeing, and about how they adapt when expectations need to be adjusted due to changes in economic, health, family, and other circumstances.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122827-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127364-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4322126-9>
Chapter 19 An updated review of industrial organization: Applications of experimental methods ¤ Real markets are easy to create. The difficult part is creating a market that demonstrates a point that remains valid upon replication in other subject pools and by other experimenters. Because market behavior is sensitive to both individual preferences and to the details of the structure of the institutional arrangements, the experimenter must avoid contaminating these variables with poorly developed experimental procedures. If the experimental procedures do not control these variables adequately, attempts to replicate the results may fail, because the experimenter has unknowingly failed to conduct the same experiment. The laboratory experiments in economics have been motivated by the theories of industrial organization. The chapter reviews the question regarding the relevance of laboratory methods. Several common criticisms of experimental methods are outlined in the chapter. The recent explosion of professional interest in experimental methods reflects, in part, recognition that experimental methods provide a source of shared experience for scholars who are developing and evaluating theories about complicated, naturally occurring processes. While laboratory processes are simple in comparison to naturally occurring processes, they are real processes in the sense that real people participate for real and substantial profits and follow real rules in doing so.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133311-1>
Chapter 101 The Endowment Effect ¤ The emergence of empirical evidence suggesting divergence between the willingness- to-accept (WTA), for the sale of an object, and the willingness-to-pay (WTP), for the purchase of an object, has resulted in two explanations. Further they argue that the endowment effect will not apply when the goods are purchased for resale and not for use; there is no endowment effect for the retail firm, only for the consumer purchasing the firm's good. Similarly, they argue that the endowment effect does not apply to the exchange of tokens (or rights) to which private redemption values, or induced values have been assigned by the experimenter. Given the explanations for the divergence between the average WTA and WTP the experimental literature focused on direct choice tests of these (theoretical) explanations, and there examination in market contexts.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015999-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139716-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252654-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124477-1>
OECD Financial Outreach Activities in 2003 ¤ Following the end of the “Cold War”, the OECD has, since the early 1990s, been conducting “Outreach” activities (i.e. cooperation including technical assistance activities with non-Member economies), first with the Central and Eastern European countries in transition and now extending to many economies especially in Asia...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068097-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067488-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073788-3>
