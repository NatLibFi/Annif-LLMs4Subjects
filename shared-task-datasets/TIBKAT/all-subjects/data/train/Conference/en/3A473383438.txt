Learner support in open, distance and online learning environments
New contexts for distance education, and the opportunities for better quality and increased quantity of interaction among and with learners place new demands on learner support practitioners and systems to adapt to new circumstances and develop practices that reflect current views of teaching and learning, address the challenges presented by a particular context, and take advantage of the opportunities offered by new technologies while remaining committed to the values and traditions of social justice upon which learner support in ODL is based. In this volume, active practitioners and leading authors discuss their ideas, research, and approaches in order to provide both those new to the field and experienced distance educators with a broad view of learner support concepts, practices, and opportunities in open, distance, and online learning today. The book has four major sections: visions and retrospectives: broad views of the history and future of learner support; strategies for success: an examination of practice in a variety of contexts; planning and management: issues and evolving practice; keynote addresses: voices from leaders on vision, values, management, and research.
