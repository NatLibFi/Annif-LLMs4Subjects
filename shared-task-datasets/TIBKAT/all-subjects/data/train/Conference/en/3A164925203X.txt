Genetic Programming : 4th European Conference, EuroGP 2001 Lake Como, Italy, April 18â€“20, 2001 Proceedings
This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 4th European Conference on Genetic Programming, EuroGP 2001, held at Lake Como, Italy in April 2001. The 17 revised full papers and 13 research posters presented were carefully reviewed and selected during a rigorous double-blind refereeing process out of 42 submissions. All current aspects of genetic programming are addressed, ranging from theoretical and foundational issues to applications in a variety of fields such as robotics, artificial retina, character recognition, financial prediction, digital filter and electronic circuit design, image processing, data fusion, and bio-sequencing
