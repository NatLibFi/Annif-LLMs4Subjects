Scientific Computing in Electrical Engineering : SCEE 2014, Wuppertal, Germany, July 2014
Part I Device Modelling, Electric Circuits and Simulation -- Part II Computational Electromagnetics -- Part III Coupled Problems -- Part IV Model Order Reduction -- Part V Uncertainty Quantification.
This book is a collection of selected papers presented at the 10th International Conference on Scientific Computing in Electrical Engineering (SCEE), held in Wuppertal, Germany in 2014. The book is divided into five parts, reflecting the main directions of SCEE 2014: 1. Device Modeling, Electric Circuits and Simulation, 2. Computational Electromagnetics, 3. Coupled Problems, 4. Model Order Reduction, and 5. Uncertainty Quantification. Each part starts with a general introduction followed by the actual papers. The aim of the SCEE 2014 conference was to bring together scientists from academia and industry, mathematicians, electrical engineers, computer scientists, and physicists, with the goal of fostering intensive discussions on industrially relevant mathematical problems, with an emphasis on the modeling and numerical simulation of electronic circuits and devices, electromagnetic fields, and coupled problems. The methodological focus was on model order reduction and uncertainty quantification. <this book="" will="" appeal="" to="" mathematicians="" and="" electrical="" engineers.="" it="" offers="" a="" valuable="" starting="" point="" for="" developers="" of="" algorithms="" programs="" who="" want="" learn="" about="" recent="" advances="" in="" other="" fields="" as="" well="" open="" problems="" coming="" from="" industry.="" moreover,="" be="" use="" representatives="" industry="" with="" an="" interest="" new="" program="" tools="" mathematical="" methods.
