Non-Stable Universe: Energetic Resources, Activity Phenomena, and Evolutionary Processes : proceedings of an international symposium dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the Byurakan Astrophysical Observatory (BAO) held at National Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Armenia (NAS RA), Yerevan and Byurakan Astrophysical Observatory (BAO), Byurakan, Armenia 19-23 September 2016
Many astrophysical processes and phenomena prove that our Universe is very dynamic. The study of the instability of stellar and extragalactic objects has always been the main direction of research at the BAO. This symposium brought together solar, Galactic, extragalactic, and theoretical astronomers with involvement in astronomical surveys to report and discuss important results and major advances related to instability phenomena in the Universe. The meeting topics included energy sources, instability and activity phenomena, cosmic evolutionary processes, and future projects and surveys that will reveal more about our changing universe. This volume will be useful for researchers in the fields of stars and nebulae, galaxies and cosmology, theory, and astronomical surveys -- Publisher description
