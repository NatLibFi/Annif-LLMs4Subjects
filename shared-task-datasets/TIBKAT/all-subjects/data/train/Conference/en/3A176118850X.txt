Auszeiten : temporale Ã–konomien des Luxus in Literatur und Kultur der Moderne
"Luxury, understood as a relative and ambivalent category of abundance and excess, refers to not just a material but also a temporal measure or excess--because, according to the conventional view, time is the actual luxury of the present day. The contributions in this volume examine compelling dimensions of this correlation since the Enlightenment from an interdisciplinary perspective with an emphasis on literary studies."--Publisher's website
