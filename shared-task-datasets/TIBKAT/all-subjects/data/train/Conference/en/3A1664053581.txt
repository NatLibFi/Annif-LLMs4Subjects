Decadence in the age of modernism
"This edited collection of literary theory and criticism proves that the Decadence movement had a longer-lasting influence on literature and aesthetics than has traditionally been accepted. Decadent principles and aesthetics continued to exert a compelling influence on the next generation of writers, from high Modernists (Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, and D. H. Lawrence) to late Decadents (Ronald Firbank and the Sitwells) to writers of the Harlem Renaissance (Bruce Nugent and Carl Van Vechten). This collection offers a multifaceted critical revision of how Modernism evolved out of, and coexisted with, the Decadent movement, which Modernism was often keen to discredit and supersede"--
