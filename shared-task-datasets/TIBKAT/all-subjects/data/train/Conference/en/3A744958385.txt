RoManSy 9 : Proceedings of the Ninth CISM-IFToMM Symposium on Theory and Practice of Robots and Manipulators
This book comprises the proceedings of one of the most important international conferences in robotics. The individual contributions focus primarily on mechanical engineering and control and are unique in describing work completed in Eastern and Central European Countries and the former USSR. The annual symposia play an important role in the development of the theory and practice of manipulators, walking machines, robots, and the papers present significant contributions from experts in the field. The connection between biomechanics, robotics, and other related sciences is examined, as well as the biomechanical aspects currently applied in the theory and practice of manipulators and robots. The book is divided into sections covering mechanics, synthesis and design, sensing, control of motion, mobile robots and walking machines, application and performance evaluation
