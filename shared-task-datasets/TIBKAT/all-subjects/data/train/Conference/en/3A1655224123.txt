Prospects in Complex Geometry : Proceedings of the 25th Taniguchi International Symposium held in Katata, and the Conference held in Kyoto, July 31–August 9, 1989
In the Teichmüller theory of Riemann surfaces, besides the classical theory of quasi-conformal mappings, vari- ous approaches from differential geometry and algebraic geometry have merged in recent years. Thus the central subject of "Complex Structure" was a timely choice for the joint meetings in Katata and Kyoto in 1989. The invited participants exchanged ideas on different approaches to related topics in complex geometry and mapped out the prospects for the next few years of research
