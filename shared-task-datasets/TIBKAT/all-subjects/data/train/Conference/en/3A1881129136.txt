Algebraic and topological aspects of representation theory : virtual AMS Special Session on Geometric and Algebraic Aspects of Quantum Groups and Related Topics, November 20-21, 2021
This volume contains the proceedings of the virtual AMS Special Session on Geometric and Algebraic Aspects of Quantum Groups and Related Topics, held from November 20â€“21, 2021. Noncommutative algebras and noncommutative algebraic geometry have been an active field of research for the past several decades, with many important applications in mathematical physics, representation theory, number theory, combinatorics, geometry, low-dimensional topology, and category theory. Papers in this volume contain original research, written by speakers and their collaborators. Many papers also discuss new concepts with detailed examples and current trends with novel and important results, all of which are invaluable contributions to the mathematics community.
