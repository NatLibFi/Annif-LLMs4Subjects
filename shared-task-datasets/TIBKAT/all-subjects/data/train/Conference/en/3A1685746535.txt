This book constitutes the refereed post-conference proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Big data Technologies and Applications, BDTA 2016, held in Seoul, South Korea, in November 2016. BDTA 2016 was collocated with the First International Workshop on Internet of Things, Social Network, and Security in Big Data, ISSB 2016 and the First International Workshop on Digital Humanity with Big Data, DiHuBiDa 2016. The 17 revised full papers were carefully reviewed and selected from 25 submissions and handle theoretical foundations and practical applications which premise the new generation of data analytics and engineering
