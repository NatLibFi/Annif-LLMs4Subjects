This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 11th Annual Symposium on Combinatorial Pattern Matching, CPM 2000, held in Montreal, Canada, in June 2000. The 29 revised full papers presented together with 3 invited contributions and 2 tutorial lectures were carefully reviewed and selected from 44 submissions. The papers are devoted to current theoretical and algorithmic issues of searching and matching strings and more complicated patterns such as trees, regular expression graphs, point sets and arrays as well as to advanced applications of CPM in areas such as Internet, computational biology, multimedia systems, information retrieval, data compression, and pattern recognition
