Recent Advances in AI Planning : 5th European Conference on Planning, ECPâ€™99, Durham, UK, September 8-10, 1999. Proceedings
This book constitutes the thoroughly refereed post-proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Planning, ECP'99, held in Durham, UK, in September 1999. The 27 revised full papers presented together with one invited survey were carefully reviewed and selected for inclusion in the book. They address all current aspects of AI planning and scheduling. Several prominent planning paradigms are represented, including planning as satisfiability and other model checking strategies, planning as heuristic state-space search, and Graph-plan-based approaches. Moreover, various new scheduling approaches and combinations of planning and scheduling methods are introduced
