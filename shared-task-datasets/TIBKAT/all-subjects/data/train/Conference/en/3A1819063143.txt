Proceedings of 2021 International Conference on Medical Imaging and Computer-Aided Diagnosis (MICAD 2021) : medical imaging and computer-aided diagnosis
Medical Imaging -- Computer Aided Detection/Diagnosis -- Machine learning and Deep learning -- Others.
This book covers virtually all aspects of image formation in medical imaging, including systems based on ionizing radiation (x-rays, gamma rays) and non-ionizing techniques (ultrasound, optical, thermal, magnetic resonance, and magnetic particle imaging) alike. In addition, it discusses the development and application of computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) systems in medical imaging. Also there will be a special track on computer-aided diagnosis on COVID-19 by CT and X-rays images. Given its coverage, the book provides both a forum and valuable resource for researchers involved in image formation, experimental methods, image performance, segmentation, pattern recognition, feature extraction, classifier design, machine learning / deep learning, radiomics, CAD workstation design, humanâ€“computer interaction, databases, and performance evaluation. .
