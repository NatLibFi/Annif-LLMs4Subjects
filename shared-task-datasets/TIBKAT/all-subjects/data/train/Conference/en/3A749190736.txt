The purpose of this book is to contribute to improved understanding of interstellar physics and chemistry. The most recent results in the field of millimeter, submillimeter and infrared astronomy are presented, with an emphasis on galactic and extragalactic interstellar molecular spectroscopy. The topics are treated both in the form of review articles and short communications. The presentation guides the newcomer to the most advanced topics both in the astrophysical and in the technical development, as well as covering the history of the subject. As a comprehensive overview the book will be useful for researchers and postgraduates
