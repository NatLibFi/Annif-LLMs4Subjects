Microscopy of semiconducting materials : proceedings of the 14th conference, April 11 - 14, 2005, Oxford, UK
The 14th conference in the series focused on the most recent advances in the study of the structural and electronic properties of semiconducting materials by the application of transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The latest developments in the use of other important microcharacterisation techniques were also covered and included the latest work using scanning probe microscopy and also X-ray topography and diffraction.
Organised in conjunction with the Royal Microscopical Society, Oxford, the Institute of Physics, London and the Materials Research Society, USA. This series focuses on the advances in the study of the structural and electronic properties of semiconducting materials by the application of transmission and scanning electron microscopy
