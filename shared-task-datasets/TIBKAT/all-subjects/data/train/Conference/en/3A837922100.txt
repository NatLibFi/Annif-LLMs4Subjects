Unified field mechanics : natural science beyond the veil of spacetime : proceedings of the IX Symposium Honoring Noted French Mathematical Physicist Jean-Pierre Vigier : Morgan State University, USA, 16-19 November 2014
"Unified Field Mechanics, the topic of the 9th international symposium honoring noted French mathematical physicist Jean-Pierre Vigier cannot be considered highly speculative as a myopic critic might surmise. The 8th Vigier Symposium proceedings "The Physics of Reality" should in fact be touted as a companion volume because of its dramatic theoretical Field Mechanics in additional dimensionality. Many still consider the Planck-scale zero-point field stochastic quantum foam as the 'basement of reality'. This could only be considered true under the limitations of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory. As we enter the next regime of Unified Field Mechanics we now know that the energy-dependent Einstein-Minkowski manifold called spacetime has a finite radius beyond which a large-scale multiverse beckons. So far a battery of 14 experiments has been designed to falsify the model. When the 1st is successfully performed, a revolution in Natural Science will occur! This volume strengthens and expands the theoretical and experimental basis for that immanent new age."--
