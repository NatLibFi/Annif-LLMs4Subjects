Noncommutative differential geometry is a novel approach to geometry, aimed in part at applications in physics. The strategy is to formulate usual differential geometry in a somewhat unusual manner, using in particular operator algebras and related concepts, so as to be able to plug in noncommuntativity in a natural way. Algebraic tools such as K-theory and cyclic cohomology and homology play an important role in this field
