Discrete geometry and mathematical morphology : second international joint conference, DGMM 2022, Strasbourg, France, October 24-27, 2022, proceedings
This book constitutes the proceedings of the Second IAPR International Conference on Discrete Geometry and Mathematical Morphology, DGMM 2022, which was held during October 24-27, 2022, in Strasbourg, France. The 33 papers included in this volume were carefully reviewed and selected from 45 submissions. They were organized in topical sections as follows: discrete and combinatorial topology; discrete tomography and inverse problems; multivariate and PDE-based mathematical morphology, morphological filtering; hierarchical and Graph-Based Models, Analysis and Segmentation; discrete geometry - models, transforms, and visualization; learning based morphology to Mathematical Morphology; and distance transform. The book also contains 3 invited keynote papers
