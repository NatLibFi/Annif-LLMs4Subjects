This proceedings volume contains peer-reviewed, selected papers and surveys presented at the conference Spectral Theory and Mathematical Physics (STMP) 2018 which was held in Santiago, Chile, at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile in December 2018. The original works gathered in this volume reveal the state of the art in the area and reflect the intense cooperation between young researchers in spectral theory and mathematical physics and established specialists in this field. The list of topics covered includes: eigenvalues and resonances for quantum Hamiltonians; spectral shift function and quantum scattering; spectral properties of random operators; magnetic quantum Hamiltonians; microlocal analysis and its applications in mathematical physics. This volume can be of interest both to senior researchers and graduate students pursuing new research topics in Mathematical Physics.
