Low-Dimensional Systems : Interactions and Transport Properties Lectures of a Workshop Held in Hamburg, Germany, July 27â€“28, 1999
This book covers recent advances relating to electronic transport properties of interacting low-dimensional systems. Detailed articles written by leading experts allow newcomers and advanced students to us is as a modern textbook, including many references for further study. Topics are interactions and new phases in one-dimensional systems and the identification of power laws in transport and optical properties, carbon nanotubes, non-equilibrium transport in zero and one dimension, spin-related effects, and novel effects in two-dimensional systems under quantum Hall conditions
