Artificial intelligence research and development : proceedings of the 22nd International Conference of the Catalan Association for Artificial Intelligence
"Artificial intelligence has now become an indispensible tool at the centre of problem-solving in a huge range of digital technologies, and remains one of the most vibrant topics for discussion and research. This book presents a compilation of the articles presented at the 22nd (2019) edition of the International Conference of the Catalan Association for Artificial Intelligence (CCIA), held in Mallorca, Spain, from 23 - 25 October 2019. This annual conference is an international event that serves as a meeting point for researchers into artificial intelligence based in the area of the Catalan speaking territories and for researchers from around the world. The book is divided into 8 sections. The first contains summaries of the 3 invited talks presented at the conference: 'New methods for fusing information and the computational brain', by Javier Fernandez; 'From correlation to imagination: Deep generative models for artificial intelligence' by Joan Serr√†; and 'Explainable AI' by Anna Monreale. The remaining 7 sections contain 47 papers covering ethics and E-governance; machine learning; constraints and SAT, optimization and fuzzy; data science, recommender systems and decision support systems; agent-based and multi-agent systems; computer vision; and sentiment analysis and text analysis. The book provides an overview of the latest developments in the field, and as such will be of interest to all those whose work involves the study and application of artificial intelligence"--
