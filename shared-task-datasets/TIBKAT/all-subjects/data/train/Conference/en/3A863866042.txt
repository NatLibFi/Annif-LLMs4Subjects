Cataract epidemiology : international forum on advanced techniques in lens and cataract research, Kanazawa, June 6 - 8, 1995
This volume of ‘Developments in Ophthalmology’ provides an extensive insight into current research on cataract epidemiology with a special emphasis on UV-related cataract risk assessment. In addition to substantial results of epidemiological studies from India, China, Australia (Melbourne), Korea, Bulgaria (Sofia) and Japan, the improvement and standardization of classification techniques are thoroughly discussed in order to be able to adequately convey and compare the different findings. UV-radiation as a trigger in the development of cataract is amply described in the scientific literature. The book presents a new and accurate model for the complex measurement of UV-exposure of the eye and allows a more realistic calculation of the actual risk of damage to the eye. Reports on age-dependent alterations in the transparency and scattering light intensity of the human lens as well as special approaches to localize cataract complete this important publication for ophthalmologists and epidemiologists working in the field of ophthalmology.
