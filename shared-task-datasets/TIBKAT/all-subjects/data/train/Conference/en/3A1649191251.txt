Topics in Cryptology — CT-RSA 2003 : The Cryptographers’ Track at the RSA Conference 2003 San Francisco, CA, USA, April 13–17, 2003 Proceedings
This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the Cryptographers' Track at the RSA Conference 2003, CT-RSA 2003, held in San Francisco, CA, USA, in April 2003. The 26 revised full papers presented together with abstracts of 2 invited talks were carefully reviewed and selected from 97 submissions. The papers are organized in topical sections on key self-protection, message authentication, digital signatures, pairing based cryptography, multivariate and lattice problems, cryptographic architectures, new RSA-based cryptosystems, chosen-ciphertext security, broadcast encryption and PRF sharing, authentication structures, elliptic curves and pairings, threshold cryptography, and implementation issues
