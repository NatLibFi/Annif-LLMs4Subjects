Defense against Bioterror : Detection Technologies, Implementation Strategies and Commercial Opportunities
A critical assessment of state-of-the-art of emerging ('breakthrough') biosensor technologies that will allow for the rapid identification of biological threat agents in the environment and human population. Identification of directions for future research, and to promote close working relationships between scientists from different countries and with different professional experience. The volume is devoted to a comprehensive overview of the current state of biological weapons threat; challenges confronting biodetection technologies and systems; ongoing research and development; and, future requirements. Biosensor technologies including detection platforms, networked alarm-type biodetector systems, implementation strategies, electro-optical and electrochemical biosensors.
