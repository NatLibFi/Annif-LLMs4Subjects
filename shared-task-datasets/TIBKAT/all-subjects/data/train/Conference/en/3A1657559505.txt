Domain Decomposition Methods in Science and Engineering XXIII
This book is a collection of papers presented at the 23rd International Conference on Domain Decomposition Methods in Science and Engineering, held on Jeju Island, Korea on July 6-10, 2015. Domain decomposition methods solve boundary value problems by splitting them into smaller boundary value problems on subdomains and iterating to coordinate the solution between adjacent subdomains. Domain decomposition methods have considerable potential for a parallelization of the finite element methods, and serve a basis for distributed, parallel computations
