Nietzsche als Dichter : Lyrik - Poetologie - Rezeption
"While researchers have mostly focused on Nietzsche the thinker, this volume turns its attention to Nietzsche the poet. It examines a substantial corpus of poetry and poetic fragments that have been largely neglected by researchers to date. Linguistic, aesthetic, and poetological reflections offer additional insight into Nietzsche's by no means uncomplicated relationship to art and poetry."--
