Written by world-renowned leaders in the fields of clinical electrophysiology and arrhythmology, the volume has represented since many years a biannual update on the most recent advances in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. The main chapters deal with atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, diagnosis and management of ventricular arrhythmias, risk stratification and prevention of sudden death in post-MI patients. The systematic and didactic approach to each topic makes the book a very useful tool for physicians working in the field.
