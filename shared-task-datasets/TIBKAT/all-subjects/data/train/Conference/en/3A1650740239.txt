High Performance Computing in Science and Engineering '10 : Transactions of the High Performance Computing Center, Stuttgart (HLRS) 2010
This book presents the state-of-the-art in simulation on supercomputers. Leading researchers present results achieved on systems of the High Performance Computing Center Stuttgart (HLRS) for the year 2010. The reports cover all fields of computational science and engineering, ranging from CFD to computational physics and chemistry to computer science, with a special emphasis on industrially relevant applications. Presenting results for both vector systems and microprocessor-based systems, the book makes it possible to compare the performance levels and usability of various architectures. As HLRS operates the largest NEC SX-8 vector system in the world, this book gives an excellent insight into the potential of vector systems, covering the main methods in high performance computing. Its outstanding results in achieving the highest performance for production codes are of particular interest for both scientists and engineers. The book includes a wealth of color illustrations and tables.
