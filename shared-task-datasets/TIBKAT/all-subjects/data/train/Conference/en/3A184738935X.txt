Code-Based Cryptography : 10th International Workshop, CBCrypto 2022, Trondheim, Norway, May 29â€“30, 2022 : revised selected papers
This book constitutes the proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Code-Based Cryptography, CBCrypto 2022, which was held during May 29-30, 2022 in Trondheim, Norway. The 8 papers presented in this volume were carefully reviewed and selected from 23 submissions. These contributions span all aspects of code-based cryptography, from design to software and hardware implementations, works about recent NIST PQC standardization candidates, side channel analysis, and improved decoding techniques.
