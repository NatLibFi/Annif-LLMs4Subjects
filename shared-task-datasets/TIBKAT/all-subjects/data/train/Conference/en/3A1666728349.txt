New Tools for Nonlinear PDEs and Application
This book features a collection of papers devoted to recent results in nonlinear partial differential equations and applications. It presents an excellent source of information on the state-of-the-art, new methods, and trends in this topic and related areas. Most of the contributors presented their work during the sessions "Recent progress in evolution equations" and "Nonlinear PDEs" at the 12th ISAAC congress held in 2017 in Växjö, Sweden. Even if inspired by this event, this book is not merely a collection of proceedings, but a stand-alone project gathering original contributions from active researchers on the latest trends in nonlinear evolution PDEs
