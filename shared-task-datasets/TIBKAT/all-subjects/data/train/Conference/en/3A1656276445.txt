Was war deutsches Judentum? : 1870â€“1933
German Judaism experienced an extraordinary phase of development and diversification between 1870 and 1933. Berlin became a hub for emigration and immigration, and important trends, such as Reform Judaism, were disseminated from there throughout the world. This volume assembles essays about this phenomenon by prominent authors, among them Atina Grossman, Michael A. Meyer, Shulamit Volkov, and Liliane Weissberg.
