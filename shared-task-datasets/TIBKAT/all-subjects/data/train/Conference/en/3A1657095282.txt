Partial Differential Equations and Geometric Measure Theory : Cetraro, Italy 2014
This book collects together lectures by some of the leaders in the field of partial differential equations and geometric measure theory. It features a wide variety of research topics in which a crucial role is played by the interaction of fine analytic techniques and deep geometric observations, combining the intuitive and geometric aspects of mathematics with analytical ideas and variational methods. The problems addressed are challenging and complex, and often require the use of several refined techniques to overcome the major difficulties encountered. The lectures, given during the course "Partial Differential Equations and Geometric Measure Theory'' in Cetraro, June 2-7, 2014, should help to encourage further research in the area. The enthusiasm of the speakers and the participants of this CIME course is reflected in the text
