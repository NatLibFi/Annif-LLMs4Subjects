Digital human modeling and applications in health, safety, ergonomics and risk management / Vincent G. Duffy ; Part 1
This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 14th Digital Human Modeling & Applications in Health, Safety, Ergonomics & Risk Management (DHM) Conference, held as part of the 25th International Conference, HCI International 2023, which was held virtually in Copenhagen, Denmark in July 2023.  The total of 1578 papers and 396 posters included in the HCII 2023 proceedings was carefully reviewed and selected from 7472 submissions.    The DHM 2023 method focuses on different areas of application and has produced works focused on human factors and ergonomics based on human models, novel approaches in healthcare and the application of artificial intelligence in medicine. Interesting applications will be shown in many sectors. Work design and productivity, robotics and intelligent systems are among this year's human-machine modeling and results reporting efforts
