Introduction to Complex Plasmas : [This book is based on tutorial lectures given at the Graduate Summer Institute on "Complex Plasmasʺ at the Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ (USA) from July 30 to August 8, 2008. The workshop was jointly organized by the SFB-TR24 Fundamentals of Complex Plasmasʺ Greifswald/Kiel (Germany) and Stevens]
Complex plasmas differ from traditional plasmas in many ways: these are low-temperature high pressure systems containing nanometer to micrometer size particles which may be highly charged and strongly interacting. The particles may be chemically reacting or be in contact with solid surfaces, and the electrons may show quantum behaviour. These interesting properties have led to many applications of complex plasmas in technology, medicine and science.Yet complex plasmas are extremely complicated, both experimentally and theoretically, and require a variety of new approaches which go beyond standard plasma physics courses. This book fills this gap presenting an introduction to theory, experiment and computer simulation in this field. Based on tutorial lectures at a very successful recent Summer Institute, the presentation is ideally suited for graduate students, plasma physicists and experienced undergraduates.
