Differential Geometry and Differential Equations : Proceedings of a Symposium, held in Shanghai, June 21 â€“ July 6, 1985
The DD6 Symposium was, like its predecessors DD1 to DD5 both a research symposium and a summer seminar and concentrated on differential geometry. This volume contains a selection of the invited papers and some additional contributions. They cover recent advances and principal trends in current research in differential geometry
