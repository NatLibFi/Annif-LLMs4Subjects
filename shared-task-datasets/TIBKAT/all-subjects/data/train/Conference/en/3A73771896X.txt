Herodots Quellen - die Quellen Herodots : [Tagung ... vom 27.10. bis 28.10.2011 an der Philipps-Universit√§t Marburg]
At the Philipps-University of Marburg in 2011, a conference about the importance of German historian Detlev Fehling's "The references in Herodotus" (1971) was held. Fehling's understanding of Herodotus' positions and sources is analyzed as the struggles for Herodotus' historical truth is sought. Fehling's basic positions affect the research of ancient history, classical philology and its antiquity-scientific disciplines lasting until today. The contributions of the associated anthology analyze leading representatives of Herodotus research from different disciplines. Fehling's research contribution offers not only a synthesis of the current discussions about Herodotus' sources, but also an important starting point for further study of the father of history
