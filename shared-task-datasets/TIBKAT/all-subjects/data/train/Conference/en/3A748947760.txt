Thermal Analysis in the Geosciences
The application of thermal analysis is outlined by 18 contributions, writtenby experts in the various fields of geosciences. Emphasis was laid on the determination of minerals and technical products, kinetic parameters and calorific values in glass and ceramics technology, characterization of raw materials (e.g. clays, industrial minerals), in quality control and performance assessment, but also in environment protection from soil and water pollution, using re-evaluated existing and new data and improved combined modern methods. This book is addressed to practitioners, scientistsand students in mineralogy/crystallography, applied geology, material sciences, and environmental sciences
