Parallel Computational Fluid Dynamics 2008 : Parallel Numerical Methods, Software Development and Applications ; [Parallel CFD 2008, the twentieth in the high-level international series of meetings featuring different aspect of parallel computing in computational fluid dynamics and other modern scientific domains was held May 19-22, 2008 in Lyon, France]
This book collects the proceedings of the Parallel Computational Fluid Dynamics 2008 conference held in Lyon, France. Contributed papers by over 40 researchers representing the state of the art in parallel CFD and architecture from Asia, Europe, and North America examine major developments in (1) block-structured grid and boundary methods to simulate flows over moving bodies, (2) specific methods for optimization in Aerodynamics Design, (3) innovative parallel algorithms and numerical solvers, such as scalable algebraic multilevel preconditioners and the acceleration of iterative solutions, (4) software frameworks and component architectures for parallelism, (5) large scale computing and parallel efficiencies in the industrial context, (6) lattice Boltzmann and SPH methods, and (7) applications in the environment, biofluids, and nuclear engineering.
