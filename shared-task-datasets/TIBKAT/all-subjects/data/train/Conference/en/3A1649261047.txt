Embedded Software : First International Workshop, EMSOFT 2001 Tahoe City, CA, USA, October 8â€“10, 2001 Proceedings
With the omnipresence of micro devices in our daily lifes embedded software has gained tremendous importance in both science and industry. This volume contains 34 invited papers from the First International Workshop on Embedded Systems. They present latest research results from different areas of computer science that are traditionally distinct but relevant to embedded software development (such as, for example, component based design, functional programming, real-time Java, resource and storage allocation, verification). Each paper focuses on one topic, showing the inter-relationship and application to the design and implementation of embedded software systems
