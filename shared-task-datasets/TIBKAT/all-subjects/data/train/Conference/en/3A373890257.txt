Metaheuristics for multiobjective optimisation : [this volume originated from the Workshop on Multiobjective Metaheuristics ... in Paris on November 4 - 5, 2002]
The success of metaheuristics on hard single-objective optimization problems is well recognized today. Many real-life problems require, however, taking into account several conflicting points of view corresponding to multiple objectives. The use of metaheuristic optimization techniques for multi-objective problems is the subject of this volume. The book includes selected surveys, tutorials and state-of-the-art research papers in this field, first presented at a free workshop, jointly organized by the French working group on Multi-objective Mathematical Programming (PM2O) and the EURO working group on Metaheuristics in December 2002. It is the first book which considers simultaneously various metaheuristics and various kind of problems (combinatorial problems, real situations, non-linear problems?) applied to multiple objective optimization. Metaheuristics used are genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, simulated annealing, scatter search, etc. Problems concern timetabling, vehicle routing, etc. Methodological aspects like quality evaluation are also covered by the book.
