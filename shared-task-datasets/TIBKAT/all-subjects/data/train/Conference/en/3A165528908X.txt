Interpolation Spaces and Allied Topics in Analysis : Proceedings of the Conference held in Lund, Sweden, August 29 – September 1, 1983
The theory of interpolation spaces — its origin, prospects for the future -- An interpolation theorem for modular spaces -- Some aspects of the minimal, Möbiusinvariant space of analytic functions on the unit disc -- A non-linear complex interpolation result -- A remark about Calderón's upper s method of interpolation -- The coincidence of real and complex interpolation methods for couples of weighted Banach lattices -- The K functional for (H1, BMO) -- A relation between two interpolation methods -- Harmonic interpolation -- Higher order commutators of singular integral operators -- On interpolation between H1 and H? -- Interpolation theory and duality -- The K-functional for symmetric spaces -- Applications of interpolation with a function parameter to Lorentz, Sobolev and besov spaces -- On the smoothness of fourier transforms -- Rearrangements of BMO functions and interpolation -- Descriptions of some interpolation spaces in off-diagonal cases -- N.B. - Some of these problems were prepared already for the 1982 conference.
