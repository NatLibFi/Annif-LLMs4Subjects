Morphodynamics 2015 : numerical methods of water-soil boundary layers under currents and waves : workshop proceedings, September 22nd, 2015, Hamburg, Germany
Text Konferenzank√ºndigung: The characterization of processes at the boundary layer between river bed and free water area due to hydrodynamic load is still a present problem. Complex influences and nonlinear behavior even on micro scale level make the estimation difficult. Thereby the importance of morphodynamic forecasts to estimate the sediment transport in rivers and coastal areas remains unaffected.In the last years several approaches in numerical methods have been made to describe the interaction in the transition zone. The methods are as multifarious as different and deal with diverse scales and physical correlations. Independently the method results show improvements on accuracy, sensitivity and reliability. The workshop should give an overview about the present numerical methods which are used for reproduction of short and long term morphodynamic at the boundary layer of water and riverbed. The current state of research should be discussed just like opportunities by the obtained knowledge.
