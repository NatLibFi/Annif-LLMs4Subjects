Genetic Programming Theory and Practice VII : [the work described in this book was first presented at the Seventh Workshop on Genetic Programming, Theory and Practice, organized by the Center for the Study of Complex Systems at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 14-16 May 2009]
Genetic Programming Theory and Practice VII presents the results of the annual Genetic Programming Theory and Practice Workshop, contributed by the foremost international researchers and practitioners in the GP arena. Contributions examine the similarities and differences between theoretical and empirical results on real-world problems, and explore the synergy between theory and practice, producing a comprehensive view of the state of the art in GP application. Application areas include chemical process control, circuit design, financial data mining and bio-informatics, to name a few. About th
