Recent advances in adsorption processes for environmental protection and security : [proceedings of the NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Recent Advances in Adsorption Processes for Environmental Protection and Security, Kyiv, Ukraine, 9 - 12 September 2006]
The purpose of the Workshop was to bring together researchers and engineers working in adsorption-related fields, to share knowledge on the latest advances on adsorption processes for environmental security and protection, as well as to cross-link and disseminate to the scientific community the main results and achievements of recent NATO Science-for-Peace (SfP) projects on environmental security and protection. The topics covered by the Workshop include recent theoretical and experimental developments on environmental adsorption, adsorption processes, as well as synthesis and tailoring of novel adsorbents, including the assessment of materials and processes. The published material provides a comprehensive and up-to-date report on adsorption and colloids phenomena, carbon materials and adsorbents for various industrial applications, ecological safety and antiterrorism. Because rapidly-developing areas in nanotechnology for fine chemistry, air quality, and environmental protection, are based on the synthesis and modification of the adsorbents, special attention is given to synthesis and chemical tailoring of porous materials to achieve desired properties as adsorbents and separation media.
