Modern computational science 10 : lecture notes from the 2nd international summer school, Oldenburg, August 9 - 20, 2010
The International Summer School "Modern Computational Science", held at University of Oldenburg in August 2010, grew out of the idea to improve the knowledge  and skills of advanced undergraduate and graduate (including PhD) students by providing both a thorough introduction to computational methods as well as examples of state-of-the-art applications to current research problems. The first part of the present volume of lecture notes deals with basic methods and tools like data structures, algorithms, software engineering, data analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations. The remaining parts are devoted to more advanced topics like semiparametric regression or the analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations using amplitude equations. Applications of computational methods to problems in bioinformatics, computational fluid dynamics, ecological communities, oceanography, and quantum chemistry are discussed. <engl.>
