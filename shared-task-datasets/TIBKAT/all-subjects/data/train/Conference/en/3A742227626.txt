Religion and society in the 21st century : [conference proceedings of the Berlin Symposium "Religion and Society in the 21st Century"]
This volume focuses on religion from a trans-cultural perspective. Its aim is to suggest new ways of seeing how religions might coexist peacefully within different societies of the 21st century. Can secular culture be the path to convince different religions to endorse a shared ideal of peaceful co-existence? The chapters take into consideration the socio-political implications of religions in Asian, African, Latin-American and European contexts.
