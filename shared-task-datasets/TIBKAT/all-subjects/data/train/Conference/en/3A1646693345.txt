Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks : 14th Turkish Symposium, TAINN 2005, Izmir, Turkey, June 16-17, 2005, Revised Selected Papers
The Turkish Artificial Intelligence and Neural Network Symposium (TAINN) is an annual meeting where scientists present their new ideas and algorithms on artificial intelligence and neural networks with either oral or poster presentation. The TAINN- Turkish Conference on AI and NN Series started in 1992 at Bilkent University in Ankara, envisioned by various researchers in AI and NN then at the Bilkent, Middle East Technical, Bo aziçi and Ege universities as a forum for local researchers to get together and communicate. Since then, TAINN has been held annually around early summer. This year the 14th TAINN conference was organized by the EE and CE departments of the zmir Institute of Technology with an emphasis on international contributions. Among the 75 papers, 41 were accepted for oral presentation and 12 for poster presen-tation. In addition to the presentations, invited lectures were given by Burhan Türk en (Knowledge/Intelligence Systems Laboratory, University of Toronto) and Joerg Siekmann (German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence DFKI, Saarland University), providing us with new developments in the field. We are very grateful to the contributions of such pioneer scientists.
