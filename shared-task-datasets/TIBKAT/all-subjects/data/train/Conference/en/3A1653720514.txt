Advances in Global Optimization
This proceedings volume addresses advances in global optimization-a multidisciplinary research field that deals with the analysis, characterization, and computation of global minima and/or maxima of nonlinear, non-convex, and nonsmooth functions in continuous or discrete forms. The volume contains selected papers from the third biannual World Congress on Global Optimization in Engineering & Science (WCGO), held in the Yellow Mountains, Anhui, China on July 8-12, 2013. The papers fall into eight topical sections: mathematical programming; combinatorial optimization; duality theory; topology optimization; variational inequalities and complementarity problems; numerical optimization; stochastic models and simulation; and complex simulation and supply chain analysis
Part I: Mathematical Programming -- Part II: Combinatorial Optimization -- Part III: Duality Theory -- Part IV: Topology Optimization -- Part V: Variational Inequalities and Complementarity Problems -- Part VI: Numerical Optimization -- Part VII: Stochastic Models and Simulation -- Part VIII: Complex Simulation and Supply Chain Analysis
