Control Theory of Infinite-Dimensional Systems
This book presents novel results by participants of the conference “Control theory of infinite-dimensional systems” that took place in January 2018 at the FernUniversität in Hagen. Topics include well-posedness, controllability, optimal control problems as well as stability of linear and nonlinear systems, and are covered by world-leading experts in these areas. A distinguishing feature of the contributions in this volume is the particular combination of researchers from different fields in mathematics working in an interdisciplinary fashion on joint projects in mathematical system theory. More explicitly, the fields of partial differential equations, semigroup theory, mathematical physics, graph and network theory as well as numerical analysis are all well-represented.
