Around Glare : A New Aircraft Material in Context
During September 24-26, 2001, the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering of the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands organised the Glare - the New Material for Aircraft Conference, an international conference on the relationship between design, material choice and application of aircraft materials with respect to new developments in industry. Eminent representatives from the aircraft manufacturing world, including manufacturers, airlines, airports, universities, governments and aviation authorities, were present at this conference to meet and exchange ideas - see the group photo on the next two pages. The fact that the conference was held just two weeks after ‘September 11, 2001’ put things in a rather unique perspective. The aim of the conference was to illustrate the many unique applications of the Glare family of fibre metal laminates and to provide for the exchange and distribution of information regarding this material in order to stimulate their acceptance and promote further application. The introduction of fibre metal laminates into the commercial aviation market took about 20 years’ time. Introducing new technologies should not be taken lightly, however; the aircraft industry is by nature rather conservative and innovations must therefore be proven – a paradox actually – in all possible ways before they can be introduced in real aircraft structures. Not only do technical aspects play a role in this respect; historical, cultural, economical and political issues are equally important.
