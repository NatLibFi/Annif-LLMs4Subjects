Jets at all scales : proceedings of the 275th Symposium of the International Astronomical Union held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, September 13 - 17, 2010
"Research on all aspects of jet physics has made dramatic progress in recent years. Numerical simulations, semi-analytical models, and observations across the entire electromagnetic spectrum have shed new light on the formation, collimation, propagation, interaction, and radiation of astrophysical jets on all scales. The proceedings of IAU Symposium 275 present an up-to-date account of our current knowledge of jets and outflows in different astronomical situations, covering a vast range of phenomena, from protostellar jets up to extragalactic jets. Reviews by the leading scientists in the field set the context for lively discussions and contributed papers on the most varied aspects of jet physics, fostering links between these usually disparate areas."--Back cover
