This series of books, which is published at the rate of about one per year, addresses fundamental problems in materials science. The contents cover a broad range of topics from small clusters of atoms to engineering materials and involve chemistry, physics, and engineering, with length scales ranging from Ã…ngstromsup to millimeters. The emphasis is on basic science rather than on applications. Each book focuses on a single area ofcurrent interest and brings together leading experts to give an up-to-date discussion of their work and the work ofothers. Each article contains enough references that the interested reader can accesstherelevant literature. Thanks aregiven to the Center forFundamental Materials Research atMichigan State University forsupportingthis series. M.F. Thorpe, Series Editor E-mail: thorpe@pa.msu.edu EastLansing,Michigan, September, 1995 PREFACE This book records selected papers given at an interdisciplinary Symposium on Access in Nanoporous Materials held in Lansing, Michigan, on June 7-9, 1995. Broad interest in the synthesis of ordered materials with pore sizes in the 1.0-10 nm range was clearly manifested in the 64 invited and contributed papers presented by workers in the formal fields of chemistry, physics, and engineering. The intent of the symposium was to bring together a small number ofleading researchers within complementary disciplines to share in the diversity of approaches to nanoporous materials synthesis and characterization.
