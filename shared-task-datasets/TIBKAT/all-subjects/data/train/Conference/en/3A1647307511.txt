New Trends of Surgery for Stroke and its Perioperative Management
In July 2004 specialists in neurosurgery, neuroradiology, neurology and neurointensive care discussed recent trends at the 2nd Swiss Japanese Joint Conference on Cerebral Stroke Surgery, held in Zurich, Switzerland. New concepts were worked out during the conference and are published in this volume. The book starts with the topic intracranial aneurysms, discussing microsurgical and endovascular treatment modalities, as well as new surgical approaches. Further chapters deal with the management of unruptured aneurysms and with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Practical guidelines for vasospasm treatment are given. Together with contributions about arteriovenous malformations and fistulas, cerebral revascularization techniques and surgery related to the intracranial venous system a comprehensive overview about stroke surgery is given with an interdisciplinary approach. The book will be of interest for all specialists involved in therapy of cerebrovascular disease.
