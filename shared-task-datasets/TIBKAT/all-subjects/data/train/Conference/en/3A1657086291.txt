Advanced Materials : Proceedings of the International Conference on “Physics and Mechanics of New Materials and Their Applications”, PHENMA 2017
This book presents selected peer-reviewed contributions from the 2017 International Conference on “Physics and Mechanics of New Materials and Their Applications”, PHENMA 2017 (Jabalpur, India, 14–16 October, 2017), which is devoted to processing techniques, physics, mechanics, and applications of advanced materials. The book focuses on a wide spectrum of nanostructures, ferroelectric crystals, materials and composites as well as promising materials with special properties. It presents nanotechnology approaches, modern environmentally friendly piezoelectric and ferromagnetic techniques and physical and mechanical studies of the structural and physical–mechanical properties of materials. Various original mathematical and numerical methods are applied to the solution of different technological, mechanical and physical problems that are interesting from theoretical, modeling and experimental points of view. Further, the book highlights novel devices with high accuracy, longevity and extended capabilities to operate under wide temperature and pressure ranges and aggressive media, which show improved characteristics, thanks to the developed materials and composites, opening new possibilities for different physico-mechanical processes and phenomena.
