Capitalism on trial : explorations in the tradition of Thomas E. Weisskopf
This volume presents a collection of essays honoring Professor Thomas E. Weisskopf, one of the most prominent contributors to the field of radical economics. Beginning his academic career at Harvard before moving to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Professor Weisskopf has spent the past forty years exploring through highly innovative and rigorous research the questions of economic equality, social justice and environmental responsibility. The chapters in this book reflect the main subjects of Professor Weisskopfs work and seek to foster continued innovation in these research areas.  The diverse contributions to this volume explore the impressive range of Professor Weisskopfs research themes. These include the economics of developing countries, US imperialism, Marxian crisis theory, contemporary economic history and institutional development, affirmative action policies, and the potential of socialism as an alternative to capitalism for developing non-exploitative societies. In addition to 26 chapters by leading economists, this book also includes a chapter by Professor Weisskopf himself, in which he reflects on his own career in economics as well as the state of the U.S. and global economies. The volume also includes a full bibliography listing Professor Weisskopfs publications.  Students, professors and researchers working in any branch of economics will find much of interest in this set of wide-ranging studies building from the themes advanced by Thomas Weisskopf.
