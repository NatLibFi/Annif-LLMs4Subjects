Materials with Complex Behaviour : Modelling, Simulation, Testing, and Applications
The increasing demand for materials with superb properties in all types of technical applications requires the development of advanced materials and respective tools to characterise and predict the material properties and behaviour. This monograph highlights the latest developments and trends in advanced materials and their properties, the modelling and simulation of non-classical materials and structures, and new technologies for joining materials
