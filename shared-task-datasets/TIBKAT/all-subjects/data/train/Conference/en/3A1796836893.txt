Structural integrity cases in mechanical and civil engineering
A Review of Shear Wall Location Response in High-Rise RCC Structures as a Result of Earthquake Effect -- Review on Coastal Liquefaction at Sabah Bays -- Fatigue detection on Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer material using fiber Bragg grating sensor.
This book covers most of the damage mechanism in the scope of mechanical engineering and civil engineering. The failure pattern of various materials and structures is mainly discussed. The sub-topics covers fatigue damage, fatigue crack initiation and propagation, life prediction techniques, computational fracture mechanics, dynamic fracture, damage mechanics and assessment, non-destructive test (NDT), concrete failure assessment, failure on soil structures, structural durability and reliability, structural health monitoring, construction damage recovery, and any relevant topics related to failure analysis. .
