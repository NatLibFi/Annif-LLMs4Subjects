Loyal subversion? : caricatures from the Personal Union between England and Hanover (1714 - 1837) ; [Symposium "Loyal Subversion? ..." was held in the rebuilt Herrenhausen Palace in Hanover on February 21-23, 2013]
Verlagsinfo: Caricatures as an institutionalized form of political perception? The political constellation of the personal union between England and Hanover lasted for 123 years. The figure of a foreign king became a determining factor and was in itself a historical condition for the emergence and the development of caricatures in England after the Glorious Revolution. The contributors of the volume show that, as a political weapon of the opposition and as an institution of public opinion, the caricatures affected the establishment. Is the visual criticism of the rulers more than a loyal subversion of their subjects?
