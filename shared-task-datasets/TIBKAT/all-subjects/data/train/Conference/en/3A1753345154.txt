Design and development of aerospace vehicles and propulsion systems : Proceedings of SAROD 2018
Mach Number Effect on Aeroacoustic Characteristics of Compressible Jet Due To Chevron -- Parametric Study of Turbulent Flow Past a Compression Decompression Ramp -- Validation of Numerical Analysis Results for Pusher Configured Turboprop Engine Air Intake -- Aero-Elastic Analysis of High Aspect Ratio UAV Wing - Based on Two-Way Fluid Structure Interaction -- Numerical Study of Effect of Adjacent Blades Oscillation in a Compressor Cascade -- Effect of Incoming Wakes on Losses of a Low Pressure Turbine of a Gas Turbine Engine -- Effect of Axial Location on the Performance of A Control Jet In A Supersonic Cross Flow.
This book presents selected papers presented in the Symposium on Applied Aerodynamics and Design of Aerospace Vehicles (SAROD 2018), which was jointly organized by Aeronautical Development Agency (the nodal agency for the design and development of combat aircraft in India), Gas-Turbine Research Establishment (responsible for design and development of gas turbine engines for military applications), and CSIR-National Aerospace Laboratories (involved in major aerospace programs in the country such as SARAS program, LCA, Space Launch Vehicles, Missiles and UAVs). It brings together experiences of aerodynamicists in India as well as abroad in Aerospace Vehicle Design, Gas Turbine Engines, Missiles and related areas. It is a useful volume for researchers, professionals and students interested in diversified areas of aerospace engineering.
