Relationships between the state and the university
All over the world, universities and higher education face criticism, and a strong claim for accountability. There are no easy solutions for the problems of higher education. The university should get back its role as an agency for intellectual development and scholarly performance. However, without an opening towards the needs of society these goals will not become accomplished. The Oldenburg Conference of 1990 provided some insights into a small sector of the field. It was rather early in a debate that has become more virulent since then. <dt.>
