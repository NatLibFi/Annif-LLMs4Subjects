Constitutive Models for Rubber XI is a comprehensive compilation of both the oral and poster contributions to the European Conference on Constitutive Models for Rubber. This 11th edition, held in Nantes (France) 25-27th June 2019, is the occasion to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the ECCMR series. Around 100 contributions reflect the state-of-the-art in the mechanics of elastomers. They cover the fields of: Material testing Constitutive modelling and finite element implementation Micromechanical aspects, and Durability (failure, fatigue and ageing) Constitutive Models for Rubber XI is of interest for developers and researchers involved in the rubber processing and CAE software industries, as well as for academics in nearly all disciplines of elastomer mechanics and technology
