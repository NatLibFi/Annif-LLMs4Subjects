Numerical Analysis of Multiscale Problems
The 91st London Mathematical Society Durham Symposium took place from July 5th to 15th 2010, with more than 100 international participants attending. The Symposium focused on Numerical Analysis of Multiscale Problems and this book contains 10 invited articles from some of the meeting's key speakers, covering a range of topics of contemporary interest in this area. Articles cover the analysis of forward and inverse PDE problems in heterogeneous media, high-frequency wave propagation, atomistic-continuum modeling and high-dimensional problems arising in modeling uncertainty. Novel upscaling and preconditioning techniques, as well as applications to turbulent multi-phase flow, and to problems of current interest in materials science are all addressed. As such this book presents the current state-of-the-art in the numerical analysis of multiscale problems and will be of interest to both practitioners and mathematicians working in those fields.
