Discrete integrable systems : [... contains ten courses based on the lectures delivered at the International School on Discrete Integrable Systems, ... which was held in Pondicherry, India, from February 2 to February 14, 2003]
This volume consists of a set of ten lectures conceived as both introduction and up-to-date survey on discrete integrable systems. It constitutes a companion book to "Integrability of Nonlinear Systems" (Springer-Verlag, 2004, LNP 638, ISBN 3-540-20630-2). Both volumes address primarily graduate students and nonspecialist researchers but will also benefit lecturers looking for suitable material for advanced courses and researchers interested in specific topics. TOC:Three Lessons on the Painlevé Property and the Painlevé Equations.- Sato Theory and Transformation Groups.- A Unified Approach to Integrable Systems.- Special Solutions of Discrete Integrable Systems.- Discrete Differential Geometry. Integrability as Consistency.- Discrete Lagrangian Models.- Symmetries of Discrete Systems.- Discrete Painlevé Equations: a Review.- Special Solutions for Discrete Painlevé Equations.- Ultradiscrete Systems (Cellular Automata).- Time in Science: Reversibility vs. Irreversibility
