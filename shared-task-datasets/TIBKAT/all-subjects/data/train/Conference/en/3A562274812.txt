Fifth International Conference on Coordinated and Multiple Views in Exploratory Visualization : CMV '07 : 2 - 2 July 2007, ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland ; associated and co-located with International Conference on Information Visualization (IV07)
Annotation, The CMV approach enables users to view their results in different forms, to gain insight through manipulation, and to try out different scenarios. Displaying information in multiple forms enables users to see information from various angles, while manipulation enables them to pose questions, test hypotheses, and validate theories. CMV techniques are certainly well-established and wide-reaching, but specific challenges remain. CMV 2007 covers recent progress and future opportunities in the investigation of CMV techniques and their application to exploratory visualization and visual analytics.Contents: Visual Exploration; Theory and Techniques; Applications and Toolkits
