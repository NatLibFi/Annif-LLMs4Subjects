Algebraic and proof-theoretic aspects of non-classical logics : papers in honor of Daniele Mundici on the occasion of his 60th birthday
Edited in collaboration with FoLLI, the Association of Logic, Language and Information, this book constitutes the third volume of the FoLLI LNAI subline. The 17 revised papers of this Festschrift volume - published in honour of Daniele Mundici on the occasion of his 60th birthday - include invited extended versions of the most interesting contributions to the International Conference on the Algebraic and Logical Foundations of Many-Valued Reasoning, held in Gargnano, Italy, in March 2006. Daniele Mundici is widely acknowledged as a leading scientist in many-valued logic and ordered algebraic s
