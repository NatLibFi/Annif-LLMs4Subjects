Optimization in Industry
Optimization in Industry comprises a collection of papers presented at the third US United Engineering Foundation's 'Optimization in Industry' Conference. The main thrust of this, the third conference of the series is related to engineering optimization including both manufacture and parametric design. The papers included explore the relationships between well-established deterministic optimization methods and the emerging stochastic and mainly population-based search and optimization algorithms. A mix of approaches across a wide range of engineering disciplines is included. It illustrates the manner in which various techniques can be utilised either in a stand-alone manner or within hybrid systems to give best performance in terms of optimal design and computational efficiency. The papers span scientific, application, awareness/information dissemination and industrial requirements areas. They provide information on available search and optimization techniques and their application to specific design problems and across the field of manufacturing generally. Papers identifying and dealing with problems of incorporating novel optimization techniques within day-to-day design practice and industrial software requirements are also included. The book will thus be of interest to both the industrial and academic communities
