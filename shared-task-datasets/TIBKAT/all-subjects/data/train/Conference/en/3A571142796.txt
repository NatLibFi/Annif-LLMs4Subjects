Estuarine and coastal modeling : proceedings of the Tenth International Conference ; November 5 - 7, 2007, Newport, Rhode Island
"Estuarine and Coastal Modeling" contains 56 papers on state-of-the-art developments and applications of models to bays, sounds, lagoons, estuaries, embayments, bights, and coastal seas. These papers were presented at the 10th International Conference held November 5-7, 2008, in Newport, Rhode Island. The conference included 20 oral sessions and one poster session focusing on the application of models to problems in hydrodynamics, water quality, and sediment transport. Topics discussed include: finite-volume methods; shelf sea modeling; estuarine and coastal modeling in Florida; nearshore circulation and dispersion; bay and estuarine circulation; modeling methods; observing, modeling, and visualization systems; trajectory modeling; sediment transport; storm surge and coastal inundation; and modeling of releases. This proceedings will be a valuable reference for students and practitioners involved in the field of estuarine and coastal engineering.
