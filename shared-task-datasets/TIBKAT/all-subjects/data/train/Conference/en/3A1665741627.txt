Brecht und das Fragment
While the readership and criticism are still based on Brecht's finished works, from the perspective of the archive hardly anything of his literary work is finished. Brecht's research has also been insufficiently preoccupied with the unfinished and often makes a sharp distinction between the whole piece and the fragment. The present volume asks whether this difference can be maintained using poetry, film, notebooks, plays and theater models. Here it becomes clear that for Brecht incompetence was not a failure. The collective creation of many texts and performances, their experimental character and their unconditional reference to history and society make incompletion a requirement. These works thus correspond to the double temporality of the fragment, which is always both: ruin and draft
