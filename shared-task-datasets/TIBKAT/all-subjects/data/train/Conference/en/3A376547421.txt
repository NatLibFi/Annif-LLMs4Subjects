Algebraic transformation groups and algebraic varieties : proceedings of the Conference Interesting Algebraic Varieties Arising in Algebraic Transformation Group Theory held at the Erwin Schr√∂dinger Institute, Vienna, October 22 - 26, 2001
The book covers topics in the theory of algebraic transformation groups and algebraic varieties which are very much at the frontier of mathematical research. The contributors are all internationally well-known specialists, and hence the book will have great appeal to researchers and graduate students in mathematics and mathematical physics. TOC:1.
