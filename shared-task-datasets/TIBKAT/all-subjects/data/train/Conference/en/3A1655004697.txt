Monte Carlo and Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods 2002 : Proceedings of a Conference held at the National University of Singapore, Republic of Singapore, November 25â€“28, 2002
This book represents the refereed proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Monte Carlo and Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods in Scientific Computing which was held at the National University of Singapore in the year 2002. An important feature are invited surveys of the state of the art in key areas such as multidimensional numerical integration, low-discrepancy point sets, computational complexity, finance, and other applications of Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo methods. These proceedings also include carefully selected contributed papers on all aspects of Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo methods. The reader will be informed about current research in this very active area
