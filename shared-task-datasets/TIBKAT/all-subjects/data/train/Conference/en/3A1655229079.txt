Functional Analysis and Related Topics, 1991 : Proceedings of the International Conference in Memory of Professor Kôsaku Yosida held at RIMS, Kyoto University, Japan, July 29–Aug. 2, 1991
In these proceedings of the international conference held in Kyoto in memoryof the late Professor K saku Yosida, twenty six invited speakers display in their many facets of functional analysis and its applications in the research tradition of Yosida's school. Many of the topics are related tolinear and non-linear partial differential equations, including the Schr|dinger equations, the Navier-Stokes equations and quasilinear hyperbolic equations. Several of the papers are survey articles, the others are original (unpublished) and refereed research articles. Also included is a full listing of the publications of K. Yosida. Recommendedto students and research workers looking for a bird's-eye view of current research activity in functional analysis and its applications. FROM THE CONTENTS: K.
