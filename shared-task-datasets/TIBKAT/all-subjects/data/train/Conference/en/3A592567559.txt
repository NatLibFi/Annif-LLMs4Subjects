Kulturtopographie des deutschsprachigen Südwestens im späteren Mittelalter : Studien und Texte
Literary historians, paleographers and historians use case studies to discuss ways in which an approach based on the history of transmission can be expanded using aspects from the history of reception and from intermediality to penetrate the literary and cultural relief of a landscape, its 'cultural topography'. The studies are based primarily on extant manuscripts and their life in various historical and institutional contexts in the south-west German language area in the 14th century
