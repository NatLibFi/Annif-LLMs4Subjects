Ergodic Theory and Negative Curvature : CIRM Jean-Morlet Chair, Fall 2013
Focussing on the mathematics related to the recent proof of ergodicity of the (Weil-Petersson) geodesic flow on a nonpositively curved space whose points are negatively curved metrics on surfaces, this book provides a broad introduction to an important current area of research. It offers original textbook-level material suitable for introductory or advanced courses as well as deep insights into the state of the art of the field, making it useful as a reference and for self-study.  The first chapters introduce hyperbolic dynamics, ergodic theory and geodesic and horocycle flows, and include an English translation of Hadamard's original proof of the Stable-Manifold Theorem. An outline of the strategy, motivation and context behind the ergodicity proof is followed by a careful exposition of it (using the Hopf argument) and of the pertinent context of Teichm√ºller theory. Finally, some complementary lectures describe the deep connections between geodesic flows in negative curvature and Diophantine approximation
