Advances in computational intelligence / Ignacio Rojas, Gonzalo Joya, Andreu Catala, editors ; Part 2
This two-volume set LNCS 14134 and LNCS 14135 constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 17th International Work-Conference on Artificial Neural Networks, IWANN 2023, held in Ponta Delgada, Portugal, during June 19-21, 2023.  The 108 full papers presented in this two-volume set were carefully reviewed and selected from 149 submissions.  The papers in Part I are organized in topical sections on advanced topics in computational intelligence; advances in artificial neural networks; ANN HW-accelerators; applications of machine learning in biomedicine and healthcare; and applications of machine learning in time series analysis. The papers in Part II are organized in topical sections on deep learning and applications; deep learning applied to computer vision and robotics; general applications of artificial intelligence; interaction with neural systems in both health and disease; machine learning for 4.0 industry solutions; neural networks in chemistry and material characterization; ordinal classification; real world applications of BCI systems; and spiking neural networks: applications and algorithms
