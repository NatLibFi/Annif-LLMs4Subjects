Macro to micro : examining architectural finishes
The papers in this volume were presented by paint analysts, painters and decorators, architectural and art conservators, preservation architects, heritage managers, materials scientists etc. at the International Architectural Paint Research Conference held in New York City in 2017. The built environment in which architectural finishes are found is one that is constantly changing. Styles go out of fashion, use changes, and new finishes are applied.

Architectural Paint Research aims to further our knowledge of materials and techniques not only of paints and varnishes but also gilding, decorative plasterwork and stucco, wood finishes and wallpapers
