Sustainable irrigation and drainage IV : management, technologies and policies ; [Fourth International Conference on Sustainable Irrigation and Drainage: Management, Technologies and Policies ; held at University of South Australia in Adelaide]
With fresh water becoming an increasingly precious commodity, and the prospect of becoming a source of the same type of political instability that is now associated with energy shortages, sustainable use of water resources is becoming more and more important. One of those uses is for irrigation. Sustainable Irrigation Management, Technologies and Policies IV addresses various aspects of irrigation. It includes not only the scientific and technical aspects of the management of water resources, but also matters the economics and policy aspects. Containing papers presented at the Fourth International Conference on the subject, the book covers the topics such as; Irrigation management; Irrigation modelling; Irrigation systems and planning; Economic incentives and instruments; Groundwater resources and contamination; Climate change effects; Water trade; Economics of irrigation; Governance for sustainable irrigation; International issues; Drainage; Water quality and remediation; Water Re-use. -- back cover
