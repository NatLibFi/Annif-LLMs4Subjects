Der Reformator Martin Luther 2017 : eine wissenschaftliche und gedenkpolitische Bestandsaufnahme
There is broad historical awareness for Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation in Germany, Europe, and the ‘West’ as a whole, but given the persistent myths about the persona and work of this reformer, there is a need for a radical re-historicization of Luther and his reception. This compendium seeks to stimulate such a reevaluation in order to place the 500-year commemoration of the Protestant Reformation on sound historical footing.
