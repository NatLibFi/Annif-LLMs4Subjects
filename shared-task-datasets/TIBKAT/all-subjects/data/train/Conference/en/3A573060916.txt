Faith and power : women in Islam
Women in Islam explores a rich history that has often been overlooked or deliberately ignored. Examining the lives of these women, and the attitudes shown towards them, the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia is also able to provide a physical dimension with artefacts from a wide range of times and places. Jewellery, clothing and the accoutrements of power bring new vigour to the lives of forgotten queens, consorts and wielders of influence from behind the throne.
