Co-ownership of action: trajectories of elements
A wooden Japanese house slated for demolition will instead be moved to Venice for exhibition. Yet the house put on display will not appear in its original form. Dismantled for shipping, it will be reassembled on-site in new configurations created by architects and artisans from Japan, who will add new or local materials and other elements in the process. In other words, the exhibition of the house will be a fantastical installation that combines old and new in a composite of creative efforts by multiple designers and craftsmen. This book, edited by architect Kozo Kadowaki, explores the project in detail. 00Exhibition: Biennale Architettura, Venice, Italy (29.08 - 29.11 2020)
