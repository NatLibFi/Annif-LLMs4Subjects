The globalisation of English and the English language classroom
Klappentext: The English language is the medium of globalisation and it is itself deeply affected by globalisation. As a result, the teaching and learning dimension of English as a tool for global communication needs rethinking – especially in the traditional English language classroom, which is still largely based on Anglo-American language norms and contents. The articles of this volume reflect the ongoing international discussion with regard to the use and acquisition of English in a world-wide context. The contributions cover four essential domains of this discussion: 1. Political, Cultural and Sociolinguistic Dimensions, 2. Teaching and Learning English in a Global Context: “Old” and “New” Standards, 3. Learners in Primary, Secondary and Higher Education: Focus on Europe and 4. Teacher Education. The volume goes beyond the language teaching context and approaches the globalisation of English from several perspectives.
