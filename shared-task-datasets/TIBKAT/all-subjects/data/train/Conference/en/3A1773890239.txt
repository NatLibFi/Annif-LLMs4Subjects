Analog Circuit Design contains the contribution of 18 tutorials of the 11th Workshop on Advances in Analog Circuit Design. This book is number 11 in this successful series of Analog Circuit Design, providing valuable information and excellent overviews of analog circuit design, CAD, and RF systems. These books can be seen as a reference to those people involved in analog and mixed signal design. The idea is to discuss in each book three specific up-to-date topics on new and valuable design ideas in the area of analog circuit design. Each topic is discussed by six experts in that field and state of the art information is shared and overviewed. In this 11th edition the topics are Structured-Mixed-Mode Design, Muti-Bit Sigma-Delta Converters and Short Range RF Circuits.
