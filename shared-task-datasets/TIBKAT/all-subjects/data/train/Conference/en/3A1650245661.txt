This book covers the results of the 11th and 12th Tera?op Workshop and continued a series initiated by NEC and the HLRS in 2004. As part of the Tera?op Workbench, it has become a meeting platform for scientists, application developers, international experts and hardware designers to discuss the current state and future directions of supercomputing with the aim of achieving the highest sustained application perf- mance. The Tera?op Workbench Project is a collaboration between the High Perf- mance Computing Center Stuttgart (HLRS) and NEC Deutschland GmbH (NEC HPCE) to support users to achieve their research goals using High Performance Computing. The ?rst stage of the Tera?op Workbench project (2004–2008) c- centrated on user’s applications and their optimization for the 72-node NEC SX-8 installation at HLRS. During this stage, numerous individual codes, developed and maintained by researchers or commercial organizations, have been analyzed and - timized. Several of the codes have shown the ability to outreach the TFlop/s thre- old of sustained performance. This created the possibility for new science and a deeper understanding of the underlying physics.
