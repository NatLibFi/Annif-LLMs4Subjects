QSO Absorption Lines : Proceedings of the ESO Workshop Held at Garching, Germany, 21-24 November 1994
These proceedings contain the papers presented at the ESO workshop on "QSO Absorption Lines". The papers summarize the current state of understanding and review the new observations, especially from HST and Keck, as well as the theoretical insights. The different sections address the following topics: damped Lyman-alpha systems, abundances, absorption lines from gas in our Galaxy, metal-rich systems at low and intermediate redshifts, BAL QSOs and quasar environment, Lyman-alpha systems at low and high redshifts, large-scale structure, the UV background, and formation of absorbing systems. The book is meant for graduate students and researchers
