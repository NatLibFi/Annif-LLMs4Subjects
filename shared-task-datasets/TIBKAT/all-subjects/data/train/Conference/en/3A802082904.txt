Labour markets, institutions and inequality : building just societies in the 21st century
Labour market institutions, including collective bargaining, the regulation of employment contracts, and pension and other social protection policies, are instrumental for improving the well-being of workers and their families as well as societies. Yet in many countries, these institutions have been eroded; in other countries, they do not exist. This edited volume examines the importance of these institutions for ensuring equitable income distribution, including with empirical examples from both developed and developing countries. It also analyses the connections between macroeconomic policies and inequality as well as how specific groups – women, migrant workers, youths – are affected by labour market institutions.
