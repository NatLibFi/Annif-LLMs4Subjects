Open form : space, interaction, and the tradition of Oskar Hansen ; [initiated during the Exhibition 1,2,3 ... Avant-Gardes (Open Form #2), June 7 - July 21, 2007, at KÃ¼nstlerhaus Stuttgart]
Oskar Hansens (19222005) theoretical concept of open form was developed in the context of international debates around late-modern architecture in the 1950s. Open form assumed that no artistic expression is complete until it has been appropriated by its users or beholders. In the following decades, the concept became a key principle of performance and film art, and led to the development of process-oriented and interdisciplinary artistic techniques. Hansens concept revolutionized the traditional means of artistic communication.0This publication examines the impact of Hansens ideas within contemporary visual culture and the redefined role of the viewer since the 1960s. The book includes in-depth interviews with some of the most important protagonists of experimental art in Poland, who investigate the historical impact of the open form. Other contributions comment on the theorys influence on a younger generation of artists. Visual material by Hansen and the artists complete this extensive volume.
