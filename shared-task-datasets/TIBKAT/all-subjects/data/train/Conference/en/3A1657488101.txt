From Capital Surges to Drought : Seeking Stability for Emerging Economies
This book analyzes the new trends in capital flows to emerging markets since the Asian crisis, their determinants and policy implications. It explains why such flows have declined so dramatically in recent years, emphasising both structural and cyclical factors. Senior bankers, regulators, and well-known academics explain the behaviour of different players. The book breaks new ground by showing in detail how such behaviour has contributed to the decline of flows and their volatility. The book suggests what coping mechanisms developing countries could adopt to deal with crisis situations; what measures should be taken at the national and international levels to make recipient countries less vulnerable to international financial instability; how such instability can be reduced; and what can be done on the source countries to encourage larger more stable capital flows to developing countries
