4th International Conference on Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics (AHFE) 2012 : [21 - 25 July 2012; proceedings] / [ed. Gavriel Salvendy ...] ; [3]: Advances in cognitive engineering and neuroergonomics
"Preface This book brings together a wide-ranging set of contributed articles that address emerging practices and future trends in cognitive engineering and neuroergonomics. Both aim to harmoniously integrate human operator and computational system, the former through a tighter cognitive fit and the latter a more effective neural fit with the system. The chapters in this book uncover novel discoveries and communicate new understanding and the most recent advances in the areas of workload and stress, activity theory, human error and risk, and neuroergonomic measures, as well as associated applications. The book is organized into two main sections, one focused on cognitive engineering, with 5 subsections, and the other on neuroergonomics, with 2 subsections, including: "--
