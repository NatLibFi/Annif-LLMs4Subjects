Proceedings of the National Aerospace Propulsion Conference : select proceedings of NAPC 2020
This book presents the select proceedings of the 3rd National Aerospace Propulsion Conference (NAPC 2020). It discusses the recent trends in the area of aerospace propulsion technologies covering both air-breathing and non-air-breathing propulsion. The topics covered include state-of-the-art design, analysis and developmental testing of gas turbine engine modules and sub-systems like compressor, combustor, turbine and alternator; advances in spray injection and atomization; aspects of combustion pertinent to all types of propulsion systems and nuances of space, missile and alternative propulsion systems. The book will be a valuable reference for beginners, researchers and professionals interested in aerospace propulsion and allied fields.
