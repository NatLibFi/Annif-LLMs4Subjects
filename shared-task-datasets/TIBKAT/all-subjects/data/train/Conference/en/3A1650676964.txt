A Primer in Density Functional Theory
Density functional theory (DFT) is by now a well-established method for tackling the quantum mechanics of many-body systems. Originally applied to&nbsp;compute properties of atoms and simple molecules, DFT has quickly become a work horse for more complex applications in the chemical and materials sciences. The present set of lectures, spanning the whole range from basic principles to relativistic and time-dependent extensions of the theory, is the ideal introduction for graduate students or nonspecialist researchers wishing to familiarize themselves with both the basic and most advanced techniques in this field
