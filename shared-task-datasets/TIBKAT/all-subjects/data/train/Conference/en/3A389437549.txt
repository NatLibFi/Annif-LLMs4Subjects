Monetary policy and unemployment : the US, Euro-area, and Japan ; [papers presented at a conference hosted by the Economics Dept. and the Center for Economic Policy Analysis of the New School University held from Nov. 22-23, 2002]
"Written in the spirit of the long time Yale Professor, James Tobin, who has held the view that monetary policy is not neutral, this volume provides an analysis of the different economic performances exhibited by the USA, the Euro-area, and Japan in the last decade. Through addressing the potential role monetary policy has on economic growth and unemployment, this book also discusses the new policy rules that, perhaps, should have been and should be used in the future to improve the economic performance of the three regions." "This book will be of great interest to both undergraduate and graduate economic students, academics, and practitioners."--Jacket
