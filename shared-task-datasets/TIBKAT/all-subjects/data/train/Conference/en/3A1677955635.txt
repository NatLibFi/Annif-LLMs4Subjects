Distributed computing and artificial intelligence, 16th international conference
This book features the outcomes of the 16th International Conference on Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence 2019 (DCAI 2019), which is a forum to present applications of innovative techniques for studying and solving complex problems in artificial intelligence and computing. The exchange of ideas between scientists and technicians from both the academic and industrial sectors is essential to facilitate the development of systems that can meet the ever-increasing demands of today’s society. This book brings together lessons learned, current work and promising future trends associated with distributed computing, artificial intelligence and their application to provide efficient solutions to real-world problems. The book includes 29 high-quality and diverse contributions in established and emerging areas of research presented at the symposium organized by the Osaka Institute of Technology, Hiroshima University, University of Granada and University of Salamanca, which was held in Ávila, Spain, from 26th–28th June 2019
