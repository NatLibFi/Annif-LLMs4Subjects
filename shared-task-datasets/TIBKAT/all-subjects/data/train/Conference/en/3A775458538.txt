Nonlinear Dynamics in Solids
This is the second volume in a sequence of books covering especially interesting and ambitious schools of the German Physical Society held at the Physics Center, Bad Honnef. It presents the current state of research on nonlinear dynamics in solids. Up to now, almost all experimental results on nonlinear dynamics of spatio-temporal phenomena come from hydrodynamic systems. These reviews focus on nonlinear dynamical phenomena in semiconductors, nonlinear optical systems, ferromagnetic systems, and spatially chaotic structures in solids. All are written at a level that makes them accessible to students with an undergraduate education in physics or mathematics
