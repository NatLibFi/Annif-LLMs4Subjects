Nonlinear and Adaptive Control : NCN4 2001
The objective of the EU Nonlinear Control Network Workshop was to bring together scientists who are already active in nonlinear control and young researchers working in this field. This book presents selectively invited contributions from the workshop, some describing state-of-the-art subjects that already have a status of maturity while others propose promising future directions in nonlinear control. Amongst others, following topics of nonlinear and adaptive control are included: adaptive and robust control, applications in physical systems, distributed parameter systems, disturbance attenuation, dynamic feedback, optimal control, sliding mode control, and tracking and motion planning
