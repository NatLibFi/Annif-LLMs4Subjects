Advances in dynamic games : applications to economics, finance, optimization, and stochastic control ; [based on presentations at the 9th International Symposium on Dynamic Games and Applications held in Adelaide, South Australia in December 2000]
This bookfocuses on various aspects of dynamic game theory, presenting state-of-the-artresearch and serving as a guide to the vitality and growthof the field and its applications. The selected chapters, written by experts in their respective disciplines,are an outgrowth of presentationsoriginally given atthe 9th International Symposium of Dynamic Games and Applications. Featured throughout are useful toolsfor researchers and practitioners who use game theory for modeling in many disciplines. Major topics covered include: * repeated and stochastic games * differential dynamic games * optimal stopping games * applications of dynamic gamesto economics, finance, and queuing theory * numerical methods and algorithms for solving dynamic games * Parrondo's games and related topics Avaluablereference forpractitioners and researchers in dynamic game theory, the book and itsdiverseapplications will also benefit researchers and graduate studentsin applied mathematics, economics, engineering, systems and control, and environmental science.
