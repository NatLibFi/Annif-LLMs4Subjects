Solar and Extra-Solar Planetary Systems : Lectures Held at the Astrophysics School XI Organized by the European Astrophysics Doctoral Network (EADN)in The Burren, Ballyvaughn, Ireland, 7â€“18 September 1998
Both the high level of activity in worldwide space exploration programmes and the discovery of extra-solar planets have spurred renewed interest in the physics and evolution dynamics of solar systems. The present book has grown out of a set of lectures by leading experts in the field within the framework of the well-known EADN summer schools. It addresses primarily graduate students and young researchers but will be equally useful for scientists in search of a comprehensive tutorial account that goes beyond the material found in standard textbooks
