Complex Analysis Joensuu 1987 : Proceedings of the XIIIth Rolf Nevanlinna-Colloquium, held in Joensuu, Finland, Aug. 10â€“13, 1987
The articles in this volume are for the most part research articles related mainly to the theory of quasiconformal and quasiregular mappings, Riemann surfaces and potential theory. They have resulted from talks delivered at the 13th Nevanlinna Colloquium, which was also a celebration of the 80th birthday of Lars V. Ahlfors: hence many articles in this volume reflect his mathematical interests
