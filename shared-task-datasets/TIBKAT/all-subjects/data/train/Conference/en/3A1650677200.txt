Current Trends in Relativistic Astrophysics : Theoretical, Numerical, Observational
The present volume contains the expanded lectures of a meeting on relativistic astrophysics, the goal of which was&nbsp;to&nbsp;provide a modern introduction to specific aspects of the field&nbsp;for young researchers,&nbsp;as well as for&nbsp;nonspecialists from related areas. Particular emphasis is placed&nbsp;on the&nbsp;theory of black holes and evolution, relativistic stars and jet hydrodynamics, as well as the production and detection of gravitational waves. The book is complemented by further contributions and animation supplied on the accompanying CD-ROM
