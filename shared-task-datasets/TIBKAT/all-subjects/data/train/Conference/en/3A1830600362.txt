Frontiers of algorithmic wisdom : International Joint Conference, IJTCS-FAW 2022, Hong Kong, China, August 15-19, 2022 : revised selected papers
This book constitutes the proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Theoretical Computer Science-Frontier of Algorithmic Wisdom (IJTCS-FAW 2022), for the 16th International Conference on Frontier of Algorithmic Wisdom (FAW) and the third International Joint Conference on Theoretical Computer Science (IJTCS), held in Hong Kong, China, in August 15-19 2022.FAW started as the Frontiers of Algorithmic Workshop in 2007 at Lanzhou, China, and was held annually from 2007 to 2021 and published archival proceedings. IJTCS, the International joint theoretical Computer Science Conference, started in 2020, aimed to bring in presentations covering active topics in selected tracks in theoretical computer science.To accommodate the diversified new research directions in theoretical computer science, FAW and IJTCS joined their forces together to organize an event for information exchange of new findings and work of enduring value in the field.In addition to four keynote speakers, 26 invited speakers and 19 contributed speakers, IJTCS-FAW2022 organized Forums for undergraduate research, young PhD graduates, young TCS faculty members, female researchers, as well as a forum in Conscious AI and a CSIAM Forum in blockchain.The 19 full papers presented in this book were carefully reviewed and selected from 25 submissions. They were organized in topical sections as follows: Algorithmic Game Theory; Game Theory in Block Chain; Frontiers of Algorithmic Wisdom; Computational and Network Economics
