Imitate Anacreon! : Mimesis, Poiesis and the Poetic Inspiration in the Carmina Anacreontea
Main description: Despite their rich tradition, the Carmina Anacreontea transmitted in the Palatine Anthology have received little scholarly attention. This neglect is linked to questions concerning their authenticity. Long read as poems by the ancient lyricist Anacreon, they are now regarded instead as imitations of Anacreontic lyricism. This volume presents the latest findings on the language, poetology, tradition, and reception of this lyrical collection.
Preserved in the Anthologia Palatina, the Carmina Anacreontea have enjoyed widespread reception. The sixty short poems on different sympotic topics such as love, wine, and song were composed predominantly during the Imperial Age in imitation of Anacreon's archaic lyric. This volume presents the latest scholarship on this collection and explores the poetics of imitation by focusing on aspects of mimesis, poiesis, and poetic inspiration.
