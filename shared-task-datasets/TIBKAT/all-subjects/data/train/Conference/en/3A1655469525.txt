Fractal Geometry and Stochastics II
The combination of fractal geometry and stochastic methods can be used to create convincing models in many different areas of science such as biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics and physics. The present book deals with the mathematical theory needed for this purpose. It contains contributions by outstanding mathematicians and is meant to highlight the principal directions of research in the field. The contributors were the main speakers at the conference Fractal Geometry and Stochastics II held at Greifswald/Koserow, Germany, in August 1998. The book is addressed to mathematicians and scientists who are interested in any of the following topics: · fractal dimensions · fractal measures and multifractals · self-similar and self-affine fractals · random fractals · stable processes · ergodic theory and dynamical systems · harmonic analysis and stochastic processes on fractals The readers will be introduced to the most recent results and problems on these subjects and also be treated to an overview of their historical development. Both researchers and graduate students will benefit from the clear expositions
