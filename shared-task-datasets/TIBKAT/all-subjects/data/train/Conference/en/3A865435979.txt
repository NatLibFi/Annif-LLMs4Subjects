Pikarische Erz√§hlverfahren : zum Roman des 17. und 18. Jahrhunderts
"For the first time, this volume systematically addresses the persistence of picaresque themes as a contoured genre extending beyond the brief history of the picaresque novel. It examines individual elements, their discursive structural forms and epistemic assumptions, and analyzes in acute historical detail their adoption and further development in various generic and discursive contexts in the 17th and 18th century."--
