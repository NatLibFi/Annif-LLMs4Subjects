Typecasting : an assembly of iconic, forgotten and new Vitra characters
"During Milan's Design Week 2018, the Vitra exhibition 'Typecasting' curated by Robert Stadler was presented in La Pelota, a former sports hall. 200 objects from the Vitra archives, the current collection and new prototypes were arranged in a film-set-like display. In addtion to a generous photographic documentation, this publication critically investigates how design evolves under the influence of social media. In fact, by presenting objects as characters, 'Typecasting' is as much about furniture as it is about us. Whereas furniture's practical function is a given, its representational role has grown dramatically. Furniture and objects have become props for self-staging online. With contributions by Jan Boelen, Hella Jongerius, Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec, Simon Denny, Konstantin Grcic, Lena Henke, Mark Lee, Alice Rawsthorn and many others." -- Klappentext
