Computing Science and Statistics : Statistics of Many Parameters: Curves, Images, Spatial Models
This volume comprises the proceedings of Interface '90. This was a major conference devoted to providing a forum for the interaction between statisticians, computer scientists, and research workers engaged in computing techniques for the analysis of data. Many of the world's leading researchers attended the conference and consequently, papers presented at the conference reflect the current vitality of this fast growing area of research. As a result, this volume will provide a comprehensive and up-to-date account of many aspects of research in this field which many researchers whose work lies in this area will find invaluable. Topics covered include: bootstrap techniques, curve and density estimation, spatial statistics and image reconstruction, Bayesian computing, time series analysis, and many others
