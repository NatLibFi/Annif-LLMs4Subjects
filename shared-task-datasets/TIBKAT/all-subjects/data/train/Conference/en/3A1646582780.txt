Motor Control and Learning
The title, Motor Control and Learning, reflects a focus on the effects of development, aging, and practice on the control of human voluntary movement. These issues have been at the center of attention of the motor control community, but no book has addressed all of these issues under one cover in the context of contemporary views on the control of human voluntary movement. Motor Control and Learning will fill that void. This book emphasizes the links between progress in basic motor control research and applied areas such as motor disorders and motor rehabilitation. The content has been written by established scientists in the areas of both theoretical/experimental motor control and its applications. The authors have written in a reader-friendly style, focusing more on large, general issues than on their particular research. As a result, the book is relevant to both professionals in the areas of motor control, movement disorders, and motor rehabilitation, and to students who are starting their careers in one of these actively developed areas.
