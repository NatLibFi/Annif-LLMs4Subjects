Racializing humankind : interdisciplinary perspectives on practices of 'race' and racism
Debates on historical and contemporary racism have recently become the subject of increasing public interest. The Black Lives Matter movement as well as the Covid-19 pandemic have underlined the importance and urgent necessity of examining racism in society from a multidisciplinary angle. The many facets of racism in the past and present also challenge the way we deal with history (“historical culture”) in a globalized world.Rather than focusing on the history of ideas and its discursive development, this volume will focus on the practices of actors. It examines how and which practices, especially practices of comparing, are constitutive in the construction of ‘race’ and manifestations of racism. This edited volume brings together interdisciplinary contributions from history, sociology, political science, American studies, literary studies, and media studies. An important focus lies on the social asymmetries created by racialization, including inequalities and violence. The chapters foreground historical and contemporary practices of racism and discuss their appearance in different epochs and locations.
