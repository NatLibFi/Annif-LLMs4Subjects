Stability and buffering capacity of the geosphere for long-term isolation of radioactive waste : applications to crystalline rock ; workshop proceedings, Manchester, United Kingdom, 13 - 15 November 2007
Geological settings selected as potential host formations for the deep geological disposal of radioactive waste are chosen for, among other assets, their long-term stability and buffering capacity against destabilising events and processes. These proceedings present the outcomes of a geosphere stability workshop, held in November 2007, that focused on crystalline and other types of hard, fractured rocks. The workshop underscored the fact that many such rocks are intrinsically stable environments that evolve extremely slowly and provide good buffering against external events and processes. The
