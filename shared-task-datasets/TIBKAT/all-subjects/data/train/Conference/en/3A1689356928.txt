Gross ideas : tales of tomorrow's architecture
"This book of original short stories, written by architects, engineers, and novelists, explores the architecture of the near future glimpsed through the lens of fictional characters, places and buildings. What will the architecture of the future be like? How will cities change with environmental breakdown? How will people travel once cars are ancient history? What will buildings look like when bricks and mortar are no longer instruments of financial accumulation?"--Publisher's website
