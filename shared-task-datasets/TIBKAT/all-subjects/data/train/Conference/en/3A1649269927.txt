Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods : International Conference, TABLEAUX 2002 Copenhagen, Denmark, July 30 â€“ August 1, 2002 Proceedings
This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the International Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods, TABLEAUX 2002, held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in July/August 2002.The 20 revised full papers and two system descriptions presented together with two invited contributions were carefully reviewed and selected for inclusion in the book. All current issues surrounding the mechanization of logical reasoning with tableaux and similar methods are addressed. Among the logic calculi investigated are linear logic, temporal logic, modal logics, hybrid logic, multi-modal logics, fuzzy logics, Goedel logic, Lukasiewicz logic, intermediate logics, quantified boolean logic, and, of course, classical first-order logic
