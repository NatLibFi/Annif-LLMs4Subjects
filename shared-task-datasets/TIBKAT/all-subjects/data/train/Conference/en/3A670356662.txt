Judith Turner - seeing ambiguity : photographs of architecture ; [parallel to this publication the University of Michigan Museum of Art (UMMA) in Ann Arbor is arranging an exhibition on the work of Judith Turner entitled Tracing Ambiguity: The Photographs of Judith Turner [9.6. - 2.9.2012]

Through her eyes, the subject is decomposed and recreated, assuming a new meaning. The photographs are quiet, yet dynamic, beautifully framed compositions. Architects have commented that she exposes elements of their work they never imagined existed.
