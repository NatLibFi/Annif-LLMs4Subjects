During the current economic crisis recurring questions on the validity of the liberal economic system have resurfaced concerning the role of the state and the free market, the proactive use of fiscal policies, economic nationalism, and environmental sustainability. However, due to the depth and scope of the crisis new emphasis is being placed on these issues. This book attaches great importance to the specific consequences for the European Union by addressing critical themes surrounding its role in the new era of global economic governance. These include the coherence of common monetary policy with national fiscal policies, new financial regulation and supervision, and the future sustainability of national rescue plans and their compatibility with ambitious targets, such as those addressing climate change
