H∞-Control Theory : Lectures given at the 2nd Session of the Centro Internazionale Matematico Estivo (C.I.M.E.) held in Como, Italy, June 18–26, 1990
The fundamental problem in control engineering is to provide robust performance to uncertain plants. H -control theory began in the early eighties as an attempt to lay down rigorous foundations on the classical robust control requirements. It now turns out that H -control theory is at the crossroads of several important directions of research space or polynomial approach to control and classical interpolation theory; harmonic analysis and operator theory; minimax LQ stochastic control and integral equations. The book presents the underlying fundamental ideas, problems and advances through the pen of leading contributors to the field, for graduate students and researchers in both engineering and mathematics.
