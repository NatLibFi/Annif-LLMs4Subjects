This book contains rewiev articles presenting the current status of high-temperature superconductivity research. The articles cover synthesis issues, materials properties and most fundamental theoretical problems. Applications of high- temperature superconductors are also reflected in several contributions. The book addresses researchers working in fundamental research in solid-state physics as well as engineers developing new materials for industrial applications
