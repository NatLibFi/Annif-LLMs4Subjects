New Paradigms in Subsurface Prediction : Characterization of the Shallow Subsurface Implications for Urban Infrastructure and Environmental Assessment
Characterisation of the shallow subsurface provides civil, geotechnical and environmental applications with precise definitions of geomechanical and geohydrological properties. Over the past decade, the rapid pace of technological innovation has outstripped the ability of many researchers and potential users to evaluate and adopt promising new characterisation methods. Modern information technologies and information management concepts provide the basis of new paradigms and applications. This book defines future research needs for geological modelling and ground characterisation, including better dialogue between data provides and users and faster, better and less expensive methods for the creation and dissemination of subsurface characterisations.
