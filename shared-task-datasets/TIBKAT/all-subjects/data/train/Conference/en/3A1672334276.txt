New trends in allergy and atopic eczema : 6 tables
Allergy and allergic diseases have increased in prevalence worldwide during the last decade. Relevant determinants influencing the development of allergic inflammation come from the environment and are either enhancing (e.g. environmental pollutants both indoors and outdoors) or protective (e.g. parasite infestations causing early stimulation of the immune system). In spite of considerable progress in experimental allergology and immunology, there is still a great discrepancy between theoretical knowledge and practical performance in the routine treatment of patients with allergies. The development of new therapeutic and preventive strategies for the future management of allergy is dependent on a better understanding of the pathomechanisms and molecular pathways involved. Based on an international symposium, this volume summarizes the latest findings in epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical aspects of allergic diseases such as asthma, food allergy, and, especially, atopic eczema. Risk factors for the development of allergies and novel treatment strategies are carefully evaluated. This update is essential reading for anyone interested in allergy: doctors working in the clinical fields of dermatology, pneumology, internal medicine, pediatrics, ENT, epidemiology and public health, as well as researchers in molecular genetics, immunobiology, food and nutrition sciences, and pharmacology.
