Modern computational science 09 : lecture notes from the international summer school Oldenburg, August 16 - 28, 2009
With hardware costs continuing to fall and the ongoing development of sophisticated algorithms and software packages, computational methods play an ever-increasing role in many areas of pure and applied science. The present volume comprises lecture notes from the International Summer School 'Modern Computational Science', held at the University of Oldenburg in August 2009. The first part provides a thorough introduction into basic methods and tools of scientific computing (data structures, programming techniques, software engineering, data analysis, ordinary and partial differential equations, etc.). The following parts deal with recent developments in computational science and discuss applications in computational fluid dynamics, quantum chemistry, computational biology. neuroscience, statistical physics, and engineering. <engl.>
