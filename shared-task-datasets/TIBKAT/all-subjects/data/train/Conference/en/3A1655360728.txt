Computational Optimal Control
There is public agreement that all resources should be used sparingly both from the point of view of economy and ecology. Therefore optimization is the tool of choice in controlling industrial and economic processes. This book collects the reviewed papers of the ninth IFAC Workshop on Control Applications of Optimization, which took place in Munich in September 1992. Highlights from the ensuing discussions have been incorporated by the authors. The volume reflects the state of the art in the application of finite and infinite dimensional optimization to open and closed loop control problems. Its spectrum ranges from the- oretical foundations of the proposed methods and numerical implementations of algorithms to applications to real world problems. Emphasis lies on the solution of practical industrial problems in aerospace, mechanical and electrical engineer- ing, manufacturing technology and economic and manage- ment systems. Among the theoretical papers are contributions from non- linear programming (interior point methods, large structured problems, nonsmooth problems, and vector-valued criteria) and optimal control (multipoint boundary value problems, state and control constraints, feedback solutions, differen- tial-algebraic systems and differential games)
