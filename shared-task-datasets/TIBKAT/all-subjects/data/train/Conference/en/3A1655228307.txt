Séminaire de Probabilités XXVI
All the papers contained in the volume are original, fully refereed researchpapers. They represent a fairly broad spectrum of the research activity in probability theory, which was done internationally in 1990-1991, with particular emphasis on Markov processes and stochastic calculus. The latter subject keeps growing, and some important new developments, included in the volume, concern anticipative stochastic integrals, and new applications of the enlargements of filtrations to the study of zeros of martingales.
