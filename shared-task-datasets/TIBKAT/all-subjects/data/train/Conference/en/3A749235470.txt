Algebraic Computing in Control : Proceedings of the First European Conference Paris, March 13-15, 1991
Some algebraic, combinatorial and algebraic-differential me- thods have beenused in recent years in order to solve many problems in control theory, by effective algorithms. Imple- mentation of these algorithms generally involves algebraic computation systems and tools. Software realizations are al- ready developed in an increasing number of research centres. The goal of the "First European Conference on Algebraic Com- puting in Control" has been to present the main actual me- thods for analysis and control of systems which naturally lead to the use of algebraic computing. The maintopics and themes are as follows: mathematic tools in control theory that lead to effective algorithms, algebraic computing tools, that are available in the field of control theory, software realizations in control involving algebraic computing
