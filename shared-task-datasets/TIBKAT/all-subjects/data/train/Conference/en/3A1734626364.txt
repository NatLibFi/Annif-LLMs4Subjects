Algorithms and Architectures for Parallel Processing : 20th International Conference, ICA3PP 2020, New York City, NY, USA, October 2–4, 2020, Proceedings, Part III
This three-volume set LNCS 12452, 12453, and 12454 constitutes the proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Algorithms and Architectures for Parallel Processing, ICA3PP 2020, in New York City, NY, USA, in October 2020. The total of 142 full papers and 5 short papers included in this proceedings volumes was carefully reviewed and selected from 495 submissions. ICA3PP is covering the many dimensions of parallel algorithms and architectures, encompassing fundamental theoretical approaches, practical experimental projects, and commercial components and systems. As applications of computing systems have permeated in every aspects of daily life, the power of computing system has become increasingly critical. This conference provides a forum for academics and practitioners from countries around the world to exchange ideas for improving the efficiency, performance, reliability, security and interoperability of computing systems and applications. ICA3PP 2020 focus on two broad areas of parallel and distributed computing, i.e. architectures, algorithms and networks, and systems and applications.
