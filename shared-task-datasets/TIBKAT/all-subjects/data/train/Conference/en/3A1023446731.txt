The shape of the division of labour : nations, industries and households
How is work divided up in the household, within an industry, a nation or between continents? What are the dynamics of the division of labour? The wide-ranging contributions to this book explore these questions from technological, capital and political perspectives. They include in-depth studies of gender, the firm, countries' economic specializations, ICTs, foreign direct investment and agriculture. In this book, ten distinguished contributors-- economists, scholars and practitioners-- take stock of the shape of the division of labour and provide useful policy recommendations
