Micronutrient deficiencies during the weaning period and the first years of life : [... 54th Nestl√© Padiatric Nutrition Workshop, wich took place in October 2003 in Sao Paulo...]
Throughout the developing world, children are suffering from the severe consequences micronutrient deficiencies have on their healthy development. However, early malnutrition is not a problem confined to that part of the world. It may also affect infants born prematurely, children living in poverty and new immigrants to developed countries. Written by leading investigators and clinicians, this publication begins with a review of the epidemiology of micronutrient deficiencies. Further chapters deal with stable isotope methods in research, new etiological aspects such as the impact of micronutrient interactions, bioavailability and infectious diseases, as well as the effects of socio- and geopolitical factors. Another section focuses on the implications of micronutrient deficiencies and psycho-motor development, immune function and bone growth, with regard also to the economic impact. Finally an update on specific strategies to address micronutrient deficiencies is provided.This publication will be of great assistance to pediatricians, clinical investigators, health workers and nutritionists engaged in the prevention and treatment of micronutrient deficiencies
