Bio-resources: feeding a sustainable chemical industry : London, UK 19-21 June 2017
"With increasing pressure in Europe, the USA and elsewhere to move towards bio-based chemicals, it is essential that the bio-economy is underpinned by sound and well-debated science and technology and that we embrace key chemical technologies including catalysis. This volume addresses some of the critical issues in this field by bringing together experts from different but complementary areas of the chemical sciences. The topics covered include: bio-based materials, bio-based chemicals, conversion technologies, feedstocks and analysis."--
