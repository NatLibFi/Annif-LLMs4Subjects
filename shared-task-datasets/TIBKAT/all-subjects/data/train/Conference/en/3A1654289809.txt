Visualisation of the intensity and phase dynamics of semiconductor lasers via electric field reconstructions -- Coarsening dynamics of umbilical defects in inhomogeneous medium -- Spreading, Nonergodicity, and Selftrapping: a puzzle of interacting disordered lattice waves -- Nonlinear dynamics of Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers: deterministic chaos and random number generation -- Experimental observation of front propagation in Lugiato-Lefever equation in a negative diffractive regime and inhomogeneous Kerr cavity -- Splitting, hatching and transformation of the repetition rate in a mode locked laser -- Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Nonlinear Systems: an Overview and a Simple Model -- Experimental Spatiotemporal Chaotic textures in a Liquid Crystal Light Valve with optical feedback.
This book presents recent advances, new ideas and novel techniques related to the field of nonlinear dynamics, including localized pattern formation, self-organization and chaos. Various natural systems ranging from nonlinear optics to mechanics, fluids and magnetic are considered. The aim of this book is to gather specialists from these various fields of research to promote cross-fertilization and transfer of knowledge between these active research areas. In particular, nonlinear optics and laser physics constitute an important part in this issue due to the potential applications for all-optical control of light, optical storage, and information processing. Other possible applications include the generation of ultra-short pulses using all-fiber cavities.
