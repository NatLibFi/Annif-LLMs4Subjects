Time series analysis and applications to geophysical systems : [collection of papers presented during the Workshop on Time Series Analysis and Applications to Geophysical Systems, at the University of Minnesota from November 12 - 15, 2001]
Time series methods are essential tools in the analysis of many geophysical systems. This volume, which consists of papers presented by a select, international group of statistical and geophysical experts at a Workshop on Time Series Analysis and Applications to Geophysical Systems at the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) at the University of Minnesota from November 12-15, 2001 as part of the IMA's Thematic Year on Mathematics in the Geosciences, explores the application of recent advances in time series methodology to a host of important problems ranging from climate change to seismology. The works in the volume deal with theoretical and methodological issues as well as real geophysical applications, and are written with both statistical and geophysical audiences in mind. Important contributions to time series modeling, estimation, prediction, and deconvolution are presented. The results are applied to a wide range of geophysical applications including the investigation and prediction of climatic variations, the interpretation of seismic signals, the estimation of flooding risk, the description of permeability in Chinese oil fields, and the modeling of NOx decomposition from thermal power plants.
