Knowledge discovery in inductive databases : third international workshop, KDID 2004, Pisa, Italy, September 20, 2004 ; revised selected and invited papers
This book constitutes the thoroughly refereed joint postproceedings of the Third International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery in Inductive Databases, KDID 2004, held in Pisa, Italy in September 2004 in association with ECML/PKDD. Inductive Databases support data mining and the knowledge discovery process in a natural way. In addition to usual data, an inductive database also contains inductive generalizations, like patterns and models extracted form the data. This book presents 9 revised full papers selected from 23 submissions during two rounds of reviewing and improvement together with one invited paper. Various current topics in knowledge discovery and data mining in the framework of inductive databases are addressed
