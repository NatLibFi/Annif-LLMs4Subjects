The first ever book on the applications of fullerenes and nanotubes. World's experts on the industrial use of these new forms of carbon contributes chapters, that are based on lectures given in a large workshop held on February 2001, and expanded thereafter. The contents are intended for those who are interested in the exploration of industrial applications of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes.
