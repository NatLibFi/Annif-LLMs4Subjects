International Workshop on Advanced Information Systems for Enterprises, 2008 : IWAISE '08 ; 19 - 20 April 2008, Constantine, Algeria ; proceedings
"The International Workshop on Advanced Information Systems for Enterprises (IWAISE'08) explores trends in the development of advanced information systems for enterprises and investigates various research issues of this domain. Its scope ranges from methods and tools for the specification and the development of advanced information systems to case studies. The engineering of information systems in organizations and companies becomes an emerging domain that encompasses multi-disciplinary topics, such as the modeling of business processes or the development of enterprise ontologies and architectures. Furthermore, the field of information systems is changing fundamentally through the technologies of information and communication. Now, the use of standards continues to transform rapidly how businesses, applications and data are done or exchanged around the world. All these electronic technologies and software have led to a development of new models, and a redefinition of relations between companies and processes. This workshop aims to bring together researchers, developers and enterprise communities to share their experiences and to discuss research issues in developing and deploying advanced information systems for enterprises. The workshop's focus will encompass theoretical and practical methodologies, resolving technologies of modeling, specification, integration, management, sharing, interoperability/cooperation, and verification/validation."--Http://ww2.lifl.fr/iwaise08/cfp.html
