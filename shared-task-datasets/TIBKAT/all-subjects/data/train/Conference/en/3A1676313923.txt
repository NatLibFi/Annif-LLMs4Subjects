Nuclei in the Cosmos XV
Cosmology and big bang nucleosynthesis -- Stellar contributions to the chemical evolution, hydrostatic and explosive nucleosynthesis -- Neutrino and nucleus interaction in the cosmos -- Physics of nuclei far from stability -- Synthesis of heavy elements -- Direct observation of nucleosynthesis in stars -- Study of extra terrestrial materials -- Nucleosynthesis in extreme environments -- Techniques, tools and facilities for nuclear astrophysics -- Nuclear data for astrophysical applications -- Special topic: particle astrophysics and rare events in cosmos
These peer-reviewed NIC XV conference proceedings present the latest major advances in nuclear physics, astrophysics, astronomy, cosmochemistry and neutrino physics, which provide the necessary framework for a microscopic understanding of astrophysical processes. The book also discusses future directions and perspectives in the various fields of nuclear astrophysics research. In addition, it also includes a limited number of section of more general interest on double beta decay and dark matter
