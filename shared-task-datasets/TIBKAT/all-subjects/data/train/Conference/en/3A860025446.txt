Dingkulturen : Objekte in Literatur, Kunst und Gesellschaft der Vormoderne
"This volume features contributions on premodern literature, art, and society, written from the perspectives of object theory. It reflects in particular on theories of gift-exchange, as well as the concepts of agency and interconnections between humans and objects. Related fields of study that contribute to the discussions are historical narratology as well as the phenomena of artificiality and aesthetics."--
