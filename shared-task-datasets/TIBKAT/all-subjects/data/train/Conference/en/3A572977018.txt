22nd Annual IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science, 2007 : LICS 2007 ; 10 - 14 July 2007, Wroc≈Çaw, Poland
Annotation, LICS is an annual international symposium on theoretical and practical topics in computer science focusing on the field of logic. The proceedings looks at finite model theory, formal aspects of program analysis, formal methods, logical aspects of computational complexity, logics in AI, logics of programs, and logic programming. LICS 2007 also concentrates on the latest research on automata theory, automated deduction, categorical models and logics, concurrency and distributed computation, constraint programming, constructive mathematics, database theory, and domain theory.Contents: Type Theory; Computational Proof Theory; Security; Timed and Stochastic Systems; Verification; Constraints; Proof Complexity; Finite Model Theory; Concurrency and Process Calculi; Semantics of Programming Languages; Game Semantics; Linear Logic; Topology and Computable Mathematics
