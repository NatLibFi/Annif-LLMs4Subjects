Regionalism, economic integration and security in Asia : a political economy approach
The prospects and value of economic integration and regionalism in Asia are increasingly evident in what could turn out to be ‘the Asian Century’. It is within this context that this important book explores the critical economic issues, security concerns and political themes pertinent to Asia in general, and to East Asia in particular. The book features contributions by both Asian and Western scholars who take an interdisciplinary approach encompassing economics, political science and culture. They address various issues including the application of European experiences to Asia, and blend regional country perspectives with broader external views from Russia and the US. In conclusion, the book suggests a tentative roadmap and future directions for an Asian community asserting the importance of cultural and value studies.
