Genetic variation and dietary response : [... papers presented at the International Conference on 'Genetic Variation and Nutrition' held in June 1989 in Washington, DC] ; 4 tables
This timely volume focuses on genetics and nutrition, and their interaction in the development of chronic diseases. Knowledge of genetic susceptibility to disease will not only help to identify those at higher risk for disease but also to ascertain their response to diet. The prospect of targeting specific dietary treatment at those predicted to gain the most therapeutic benefit clearly has important clinical and economic consequences, particularly in diseases of high prevalence. This book is unique in considering genetic variation in susceptibility to disease, and the importance of specific diets in influencing lipid levels in cardiovascular disease and bone density in osteoporosis. The contributions emphasize that dietary response is dependent on the genetic variant and that specific dietary recommendations rather than universal ones are needed for the prevention and management of chronic diseases. Bringing together vital information for the first time, this book is important reading for physicians, nutritionists, dietitians, geneticists, physiologists, molecular biologists, food technologists and policymakers
