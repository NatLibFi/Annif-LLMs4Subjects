Domain decomposition methods in science and engineering XXV
Part I Plenary Talks (PT) -- Part II Talks in Minisymposia (MT) -- Part III Contributed Talks and Posters (CT).
These are the proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Domain Decomposition Methods in Science and Engineering, which was held in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada in July 2018. Domain decomposition methods are iterative methods for solving the often very large systems of equations that arise when engineering problems are discretized, frequently using finite elements or other modern techniques. These methods are specifically designed to make effective use of massively parallel, high-performance computing systems. The book presents both theoretical and computational advances in this domain, reflecting the state of art in 2018.
