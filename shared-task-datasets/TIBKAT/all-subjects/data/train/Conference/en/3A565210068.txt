Structural aspects of the East Asian crisis
The once booming dynamic economies in Asia were drawn into a whirlpool of business failures and economic devastation following the flotation of the Thai baht in July 1997, and the consequent collapse of asset prices and currency depreciations in several East Asian countries. High growth in these emerging market economies had masked important structural weaknesses that eventually triggered the economic slump now referred to as the Asia Crisis. To address the structural measures needed to restore sustained economic growth and stability in the crisis-affected countries, this book brings forth analyses and recommendations on the crisis from internationally respected economists and policy makers and the OECD.
