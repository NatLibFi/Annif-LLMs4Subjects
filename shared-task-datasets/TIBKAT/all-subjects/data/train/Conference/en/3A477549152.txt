Switching and learning in feedback systems : European Summer School on Multi-Agent Control, Maynooth, Ireland, September 8 - 10, 2003 ; revised lectures and selected papers
This book presents the outcome of the European Summer School on Multi-Agent Control, held in Maynooth, Ireland in September 2003. The past decade witnessed remarkable progress in the area of dynamic systems with the emergence of a number of powerful methods for both modeling and controling uncertain dynamic systems. The first two parts of the book present tutorial lectures by leading researchers in the area introducing the reader to recent achievements in switching and control and on Gaussian processes. The third part is devoted to the presentation of original research contributions in the area; among the topics addressed are car control, bounding algorithms, networked control systems, the theory of linear systems, Bayesian modeling, and surveying multi-agent systems
