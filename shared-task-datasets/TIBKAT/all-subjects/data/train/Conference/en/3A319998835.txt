Gender in transition in Eastern and Central Europe : proceedings
Ten years after the demise of socialism, eastern and western European scholars met to investigate the transformation processes in Eastern, Central and South Eastern Europe with regard to gender relations. The participants of the conference on,, Gender in Transition in Central and Eastern Europe" addressed a variety of issues such as the relationship between Western theory and Eastern practice, the contributions of women in the transformed and still transforming societies to international feminist thought, and the discursive production of femininities and identities in the context of both global and local politics. They looked into the hierarchies of gender on the job market and discussed the political participation of woman along with the institutionalisation of Women's and Gender Studies within the academia. The joint efforts in analysis and discussion resulted in an exciting discourse that bridges the gap between the scholarly communities across the world. The conference proceedings offer valuable insights into the shared features as well as differences of gender relations in transformation processes.
