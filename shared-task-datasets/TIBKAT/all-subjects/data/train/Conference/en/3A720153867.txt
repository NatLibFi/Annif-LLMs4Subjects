The protection of human rights at the beginning of the 21st century : colloquium in honour of Professor Dr. Dr. Dr. h.c. mult. Georg Ress on the occasion of his 75th birthday
"The individual papers deal with a breadth of current and fundamental questions of the protection of human rights in general and through the European Court of Human Rights in particular. Topics ranged from human rights and sovereign immunity, to procedural issues of mass claims proceedings, to first assessments of the process that would lead to the Interlaken Declaration of 2010 only a couple of weeks after the colloquium, with its significance for the future development of the European Court of Human Rights. There can be no doubt - and this book is ample evidence - that the various contributions and the discussions on the day adequately reflected the significance of the occasion."P. 7
