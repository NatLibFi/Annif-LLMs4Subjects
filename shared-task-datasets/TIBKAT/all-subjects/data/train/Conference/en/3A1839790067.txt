“Medicine and Mobility in Nineteenth-Century British Literature, History, and Culture is a welcome and timely addition to the debates touching on the theme of mobility as it was developed through literature, medicine, and history of the nineteenth century. Truly interdisciplinary in their approaches, these dynamic essays encourage us to think afresh about mobility as a central feature of the modern condition.” —Professor Andrew Mangham, Department of English Literature, University of Reading “This volume gathers major international names in nineteenth-century scholarship to address full-frontally the relation of transport and medical cultures in a period when both were evolving symbiotically. In a series of engaging historicising chapters, the book amply demonstrates the necessity of its interdisciplinary logic, opening up possibilities for further Victorian, medical humanities and mobilities research bridges.” —Dr Matthew Ingleby, Department of English, Queen Mary University of London Medicine and Mobility in Nineteenth-Century British Literature, History, and Culture analyses the cultural and literary histories of medicine and mobility as entangled processes whose discourses and practices constituted, influenced, and transformed each other. Presenting case studies of novels, poetry, travel narratives, diaries, ship magazines, skin care manuals, asylum records, press reports, and various other sources, its chapters identify and discuss diverse literary, historical, and cultural texts, contexts, and modes in which medicine and mobility intersected in nineteenth-century Britain, its empire, and beyond, whereby they illustrate how the paradigms of mobility studies and the medical humanities can complement each other.
