Science Perspectives for 3D Spectroscopy : Proceedings of the ESO Workshop held in Garching, Germany, 10 - 14 October 2005
This volume contains the proceedings of the last conference ever on integral-field spectroscopy. A daring statement, indicating that integral-field spectroscopy has evolved into a mature technique a common user utility for astronomical research. Nowadays many integral-field spectrographs are installed on 4m to 8-10m class telescopes around the world. While many of those instruments are referred to in this volume, the book is explicitly not dedicated to technical issues, but is focusing on the scientific questions that can be answered with integral-field spectroscopy. These range from solar system studies all the way to high redshift surveys.
This volume contains the proceedings of possibly the last conference ever on integral-field spectroscopy. The contributors, noted authorities in the field, focus on the scientific questions that can be answered with integral-field spectroscopy, ranging from solar system studies all the way to high redshift surveys. Overall readers get a state-of-the-science review of astronomical 3D spectroscopy.
