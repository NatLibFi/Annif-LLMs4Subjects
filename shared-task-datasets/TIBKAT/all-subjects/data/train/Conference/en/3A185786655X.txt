Non-associative algebras and related topics : NAART II, Coimbra, Portugal, July 18-22, 2022
This proceedings volume presents a selection of peer-reviewed contributions from the Second Non-Associative Algebras and Related Topics (NAART II) conference, which was held at the University of Coimbra, Portugal, from July 18â€“22, 2022. The conference was held in honor of mathematician Alberto Elduque, who has made significant contributions to the study of non-associative structures such as Lie, Jordan, and Leibniz algebras. The papers in this volume are organized into four parts: Lie algebras, superalgebras, and groups; Leibniz algebras; associative and Jordan algebras; and other non-associative structures. They cover a variety of topics, including classification problems, special maps (automorphisms, derivations, etc.), constructions that relate different structures, and representation theory. One of the unique features of NAART is that it is open to all topics related to non-associative algebras, including octonion algebras, composite algebras, Banach algebras, connections with geometry, applications in coding theory, combinatorial problems, and more. This diversity allows researchers from a range of fields to find the conference subjects interesting and discover connections with their own areas, even if they are not traditionally considered non-associative algebraists. Since its inception in 2011, NAART has been committed to fostering cross-disciplinary connections in the study of non-associative structures.
