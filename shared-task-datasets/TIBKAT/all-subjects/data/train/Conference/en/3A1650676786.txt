Physics of Rotating Fluids : Selected Topics of the 11th International Couette-Taylor Workshop Held at Bremen, Germany, 20â€“23 July 1999
This book is devoted to recent developments in the field of rotating fluids, in particular the study of Taylor--Couette flow, spherical Couette flow, planar Couette flow, as well as rotating annulus flow. Besides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art, possible future directions in this research field are investigated. The first part of this volume presents several new results in the classical Taylor--Couette system covering diverse theoretical, experimental and numerical work on bifurcation theory, influence of boundary conditions, counter-rotating flows, spiral vortices and many others. The second part focuses on spherical Couette flows, including isothermal flows, thermal convective motion, as well as magnetohydrodynamics in spherical shells. The remaining parts are devoted to Goertler vortices, rotating annulus flows, as well as superfluid Couette flows. The present book will be of interest to all researchers and graduate students working actively in the field
