Advances in knowledge discovery and management : Volume 8
This book highlights novel research in Knowledge Discovery and Management (KDM), gathering the extended, peer-reviewed versions of outstanding papers presented at the annual conferences EGC2017 & EGC2018. The EGC conference cycle was founded by the International French-speaking EGC society ("Extraction et Gestion des Connaissances") in 2003, and has since become a respected fixture among the French-speaking community. In addition to the annual conference, the society organizes various other events in order to promote exchanges between researchers and companies concerned with KDM and its applications to business, administration, industry and public organizations. Addressing novel research in data science, semantic Web, clustering, and classification, the content presented here will chiefly benefit researchers interested in these fields, including Ph.D./M.Sc. students, at public and private laboratories alike
