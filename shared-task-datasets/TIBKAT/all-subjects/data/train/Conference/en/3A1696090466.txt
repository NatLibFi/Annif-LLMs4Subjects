"After a long time of neglect, Artificial Intelligence is once again at the center of most of our political, economic, and socio-cultural debates. Recent advances in the field of Artificial Neural Networks have led to a renaissance of dystopian and utopian speculations on an AI-rendered future. Algorithmic technologies are deployed for identifying potential terrorists through vast surveillance networks, for producing sentencing guidelines and recidivism risk profiles in criminal justice systems, for demographic and psychographic targeting of bodies for advertising or propaganda, and more generally for automating the analysis of language, text, and images. Against this background, the aim of this book is to discuss the heterogenous conditions, implications, and effects of modern AI and Internet technologies in terms of their political-dimension: What does it mean to critically investigate efforts of net politics in the age of machine learning algorithms?"--Back cover
The recent explosion in interest in both the democratization of data and artificial intelligence (AI) brings important questions to the fore: How democratic is AI? How to explore the political aspects of modern machine learning if many computer scientists consider AI technologies a black box fundamentally opaque to human understanding? And how does this affect questions of accountability and political agency?This timely collection discusses the complex political dimensions of internet and AI technologies, seeking to elucidate possible avenues of democratizing AI. This includes technological strategies such as an 'Explainable AI', but also the questions of political and/or critical concepts which guide the technological process of making modern AI technology more accessible as well as suitable ways of democratizing AI beyond a purely abstract understanding of transparency and accountability
