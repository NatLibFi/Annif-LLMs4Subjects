Biomimetic and biohybrid systems : 11th International Conference, Living Machines 2022, virtual event, July 19-22, 2022 :  proceedings
This book constitutes the proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Biomimetic and Biohybrid Systems, Living Machines 2022, held as virtual event, in July 19-22, 2022. The conference was held virtually due to the COVID-19 crisis.The 30 full papers and 8 short papers presented were carefully reviewed and selected from 48 submissions. They deal with research on novel life-like technologies inspired by the scientific investigation of biological systems; biomimetics; and research that seeks to interface biological and artificial systems to create biohybrid systems
