"Disgust is an essential human emotion, relatively neglected even in recent scholarship taking the "emotional turn." Fifteen essays by historians and literary scholars examine disgust in theory and practice. Topics range from medicine, drama, oratory, historiography, fiction, biography, to the status of witches, eunuch priests, and theatrical professionals."--
