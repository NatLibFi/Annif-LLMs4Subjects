Approaches to world literature
The present volume introduces new considerations on the topic of 'World Literature'. The essays revolve around the question of what, specifically in today's rapidly globalizing world, may be the productive implications of the concept of World Literature, which was first developed in the 18th century and then elaborated on by Goethe. Joachim Küpper, FreieUniversität, Berlin, Germany.
