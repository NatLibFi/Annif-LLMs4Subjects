Dynamical Systems : Lectures Given at the 2nd Session of the Centro Internazionale Matematico Estivo (C.I.M.E.) held in Montecatini Terme, Italy, June 13â€“22, 1994
This volume contains the lecture notes written by the four principal speakers at the C.I.M.E. session on Dynamical Systems held at Montecatini, Italy in June 1994. The goal of the session was to illustrate how methods of dynamical systems can be applied to the study of ordinary and partial differential equations. Topics in random differential equations, singular perturbations, the Conley index theory, and non-linear PDEs were discussed. Readers interested in asymptotic behavior of solutions of ODEs and PDEs and familiar with basic notions of dynamical systems will wish to consult this text
