Agriculture and Biodiversity : Developing Indicators for Policy Analysis
This book is a collection of papers from the OECD meeting on Agri-biodiversity Indicators held jointly with the EU and international organisations in November 2001, in Zurich-Rechkenhols, Switzerland. A key outcome was to establish a common agri-biodiversity framework that helps understand the complexity of agri-biodiversity linkages. Papers cover the following topics; agricultural genetic resources, wild species, ecosytems, linking habitats to species and an overview of agri-biodiversity indicators. It includes a set of recommendations to OECD with respect to agri-biodiversity.
