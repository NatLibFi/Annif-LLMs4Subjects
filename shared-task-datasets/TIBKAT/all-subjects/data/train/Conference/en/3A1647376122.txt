This volume contains papers presented at TRUST 2008, the ?rst international conference on Trusted Computing and Trust in Information Technologies, held in March 2008 in Villach, Austria. The aim of the conference was to create a joint scienti?c and networking platform covering the core issues of trust in IT systems and trusted computing and to bridge the gaps between international research groups and projects in closely related ?elds. The organizers received 43 submissions from 17 countries. Each of the s- mittedpaperswasreviewedbythreereviewers.Basedonthesereviews13papers were selected as suitable for the conference and the authors were asked to p- sent their work.
