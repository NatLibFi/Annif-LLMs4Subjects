The spectral energy distributionof galaxies ; proceedings of the 284th symposium of the International Astronomical Union held at the University of Central Lancashire, Preston, United Kingdom, September 5-9, 2011
"Recent observational developments are providing the first truly panchromatic view of galaxies, extending from the radio to TeV gamma-rays. This is motivating the development of new models for the interpretation of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies in terms of the formation, evolution and emission of stellar and accretion-driven sources of photons, the interaction of the photons with the gaseous and dust components of the interstellar medium, and high-energy processes involving cosmic rays. IAU Symposium 284 details progress in the development of such models, their relation to fundamental theory, and their application to the interpretation of the panchromatic emission from the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, connecting the latter with models for the evolution of the SEDs of distant galaxies, and the extragalactic background light. IAU S284 is a useful resource for all researchers working with the copious amounts of multiwavelength data for galaxies now becoming available."--Cover p. [4]
