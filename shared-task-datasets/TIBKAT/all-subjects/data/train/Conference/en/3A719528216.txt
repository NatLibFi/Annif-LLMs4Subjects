Yes is more : an archicomic on architectural evolution ; [on the occasion of the Yes is More Exhibition - Close up: BIG at Danish Architecture Center in Copenhagen, 21 February - 31 May 2009]
"Yes is More is the easily accessible but unremittingly radical manifesto of Copenhagen-based architectural practice Bjarke Ingels Group, or BIG. Unlike a typical architectural monograph, this book uses the comic book format to express its radical agenda for contemporary architecture. It is also the first comprehensive documentation of BIGsÌ• trailblazing practicewhere method, process, instruments and concepts are constantly questioned and redefined."--
