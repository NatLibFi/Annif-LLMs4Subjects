This three-volume set of LNCS 14086, LNCS 14087 and LNCS 14088 constitutes - in conjunction with the double-volume set LNAI 14089-14090- the refereed proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Intelligent Computing, ICIC 2023, held in Zhengzhou, China, in August 2023. The 337 full papers of the three proceedings volumes were carefully reviewed and selected from 828 submissions. This year, the conference concentrated mainly on the theories and methodologies as well as the emerging applications of intelligent computing. Its aim was to unify the picture of contemporary intelligent computing techniques as an integral concept that highlights the trends in advanced computational intelligence and bridges theoretical research with applications. Therefore, the theme for this conference was "Advanced Intelligent Computing Technology and Applications". Papers that focused on this theme were solicited, addressing theories, methodologies, and applications in science and technology
