Die deutschen Dominikaner und Dominikanerinnen im Mittelalter
"The Dominican is generally considered the preeminent monastic Order of the medieval era, not only for its intellectual tradition but also for its ministry of the soul. This volume presents contemporary writings from various disciplinary perspectives on questions of innovation and tradition in the medieval context and considers both the Orders of friars as well as of nuns on questions of knowledge as power and on knowledge of self and the other."--
