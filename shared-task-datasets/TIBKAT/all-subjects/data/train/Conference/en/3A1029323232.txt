Out-of-equilibrium physics of correlated electron systems
Master equation versus Keldysh Green's functions for correlated quantum systems out of equilibrium -- Towards an understanding of superconductors and correlated materials out-of-equilibrium: mean-field approaches -- Electronic structure of correlated materials out of equilibrium: non-equilibrium dynamical mean-field theory -- Ultrafast optical control of complex quantum materials
This book is a wide-ranging survey of the physics of out-of-equilibrium systems of correlated electrons, ranging from the theoretical, to the numerical, computational and experimental aspects. It starts from basic approaches to non-equilibrium physics, such as the mean-field approach, then proceeds to more advanced methods, such as dynamical mean-field theory and master equation approaches. Lastly, it offers a comprehensive overview of the latest advances in experimental investigations of complex quantum materials by means of ultrafast spectroscopy
