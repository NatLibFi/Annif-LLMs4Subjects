Urban resilience, changing economy and social trends : coping with socio-economic consequences of the crisis in Athens, Greece
The development of resilient cities is the crucial factor for sustainable development. In the events of crisis or hazards (such as extreme societal events or financial crises), cities should be able to fulfil their societal and economic duties in the long term. In many cities, the question arises how and with which measures resilience can be increased and how strategies for successul sustainable urban development can be implemented. The publication summarises the contributions of the Summer School 2018 in Athens that focused on the development and discussion of approaches and strategies coping with social and economic outcomes of the economic crisis in a centrally-located neighbourhood of the city of Athens - Exarcheia. The Summer School is a central cornerstone of the University partnership for joint educational and research activities at the Leibniz University of Hannover (Faculty o Architecture and Landscapes) and the National Technical University Athens (School of Architecture). It is funded by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) as part of the project "Resilience as Challenge for European Cities (HeKris): Developing urban planning strategies and concrete projects".
