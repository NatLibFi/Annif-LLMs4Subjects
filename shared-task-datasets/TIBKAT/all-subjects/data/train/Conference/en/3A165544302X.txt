High Performance Scientific and Engineering Computing : Proceedings of the International FORTWIHR Conference on HPSEC, Munich, March 16-18, 1998
This volume contains the proceedings of an international conference on high performance scientific and engineering computing held in Munich in March 1998 and organized by FORTWIHR, the Bavarian Consortium for High Performance Scientific Computing. The 38 contributions cover engineering applications for numerical simulation from the fields fluid flow, optimal control, crystal growth and semiconductor technology, as well as numerical simulation in astrophysics or quantum chemistry. In contrast to related collections, the reader gets a really interdisciplinary spectrum of the state of the art of selected topics of scientific computing with recent results of research groups from applied mathematics, computer science, engineering, physics and chemistry
