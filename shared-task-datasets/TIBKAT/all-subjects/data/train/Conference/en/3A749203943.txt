Optimal Control of Partial Differential Equations : Proceedings of the IFIP WG 7.2 International Conference Irsee, April 9-12, 1990
The purpose of the Conference on Optimal Control of Partial Differential Equations was to bring together leading experts in this field and to exchange ideas and information about recent advances in control theory connected with partial differential equations. The papers collected in these Proceedings are mainly research papers in which new results are presented. Out of a broad spectrum of topics the problem of exact controllability played a central role, and also shape control was given some special attention. Nonlinear problems were mainly treated under the aspect of optimality whereas identification problems and also numerical aspects were considered only treated marginally
