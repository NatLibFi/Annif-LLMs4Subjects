Shared Encounters
With contributions from leading researchers in the field, this book explores the creation and support of those conditions that lead to meaningful and persisting shared encounters. It considers the creation of social settings and 'places' through shared behavior, and evaluates the types of exchanges as well as content, location, evaluation and use. In particular it concentrates on how technologies can be used for spontaneous shared interactions
