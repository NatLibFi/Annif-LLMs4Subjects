SAPONI - Spaces and Projects of National Importance : [... this book came out of a Symposium Trilogy on Spaces and Projects of National Importance (SAPONI) held at ETH Zurich ... 2008, 2009 and 2010]
Spaces and Projects of National Importance (SAPONI) are not only important for the respective spatial areas, they are also in the interest of the entire nation, and, sometimes of European interest as well. Over a three years period a series of different symposia with high-level spatial planners from all over Europe had been focusing on these strategic spaces and projects. The book sums up the findings of these issues which can have "far-reaching consequences and chances that could be used - or they could be lost" like the leader of the workshop-series, Prof. Bernd Scholl, points out.
