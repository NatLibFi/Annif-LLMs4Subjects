New Developments in High Temperature Superconductivity : Proceedings of the 2nd Polish-US Conference Held a Wrocław and Karpacz, Poland, 17–21 August 1998
This volume presents the latest developments in the field of high temperature superconductivity. It focusses on microscope description, physical properties, and materials and applications. The talks presented have been extensively edited and updated in order to present a valuable resource not only for the advanced reader, but also for a larger readership seeking reviews of current problems in high temperature superconductivity. These proceedings are a follow-up of a previous meeting which has been published as Volume 475 of the Lecture Notes in Physics
