Public policy and the income distribution
Over the last forty years, rising national income has helped reduce poverty rates, but this has been accompanied by an increase in economic inequality.

In Public Policy and the Income Distribution, editors Alan Auerbach, David Card, and John Quigley assemble a distinguished roster of policy analysts to confront the key questions about the role of government policy in altering the level and distribution of economic well being.
