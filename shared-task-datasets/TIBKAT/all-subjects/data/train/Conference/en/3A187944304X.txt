Entrepreneurship, industrial location and economic growth
This book examines the interrelations between entrepreneurship, industrial location and economic growth. Thus, it covers a wide range of topics, including: the economic impact of entrepreneurship; industry dynamics; growth and survival of firms; firm location and globalisation patterns; and agglomeration and growth. The chapters in the book demonstrate the need to adopt a broad perspective that combines insights from different strands of literature if we are to better understand these complex economic phenomena. In addition, the original empirical evidence from a range of different countries provides a sound foundation for developing appropriate guidance for policymakers. The contributions in this book will appeal to practitioners and policymakers interested in entrepreneurship, industrial location and industry dynamics. It will also be of interest to economic geographers, environmental scientists and local planners
