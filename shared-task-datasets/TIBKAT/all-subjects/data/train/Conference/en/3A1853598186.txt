Applied analysis, optimization and soft computing : ICNAAO-2021, Varanasi, India, December 21-23
This book contains select contributions presented at the International Conference on Nonlinear Applied Analysis and Optimization (ICNAAO-2021), held at the Department of Mathematics Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi, India, from 21â€“23 December 2021. The book discusses topics in the areas of nonlinear analysis, fixed point theory, dynamical systems, optimization, fractals, applications to differential/integral equations, signal and image processing, and soft computing, and exposes the young talents with the newer dimensions in these areas with their practical approaches and to tackle the real-life problems in engineering, medical and social sciences. Scientists from the U.S.A., Austria, France, Mexico, Romania, and India have contributed their research. All the submissions are peer reviewed by experts in their fields.
