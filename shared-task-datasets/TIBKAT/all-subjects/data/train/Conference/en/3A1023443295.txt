Applied evolutionary economics and the knowledge-based economy
pt. 1. Knowledge and cognition -- pt. 2. Studies of knowledge-based industries -- pt. 3. The geographical dimension of knowledge-based economies -- pt. 4. Measuring and modelling for knowledge-based economies
This book focuses on knowledge-based economies and attempts to analyze dynamic innovation driven processes within those economies. It shows that evolutionary economics, and in particular the strand of applied industry and innovation studies often called Neo-Schumpeterian economics, has left the nursery of new academic approaches and is able to offer important insights for the understanding of socio-economic processes of change and development having a strong impact on economic reality all over the world. The contributions are summarized under four major sections--knowledge and cognition, studies of knowledge-based industries, the geographical dimension of knowledge-based economies and measuring and modelling for knowledge-based economies--and give a broad overview of the prolific research being undertaken in applied evolutionary economics
