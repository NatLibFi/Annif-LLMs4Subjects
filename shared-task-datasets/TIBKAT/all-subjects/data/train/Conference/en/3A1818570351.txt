Current Trends in Analysis, its Applications and Computation : Proceedings of the 12th ISAAC Congress, Aveiro, Portugal, 2019
This volume contains the contributions of the participants of the 12th ISAAC congress which was held at the University of Aveiro, Portugal, from July 29 to August 3, 2019. These contributions originate from the following sessions: Applications of dynamical systems theory in biology, Complex Analysis and Partial Differential Equations, Complex Geometry, Complex Variables and Potential Theory, Constructive Methods in the Theory of Composite and Porous Media, Function Spaces and Applications, Generalized Functions and Applications, Geometric & Regularity Properties of Solutions to Elliptic and Parabolic PDEs, Geometries Defined by Differential Forms, Partial Differential Equations on Curved Spacetimes, Partial Differential Equations with Nonstandard Growth, Quaternionic and Clifford Analysis, Recent Progress in Evolution Equations, Wavelet theory and its Related Topics.
