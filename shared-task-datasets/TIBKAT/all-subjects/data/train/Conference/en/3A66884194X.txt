STAIRS 2010, proceedings of the Fifth Starting AI Researchers' Symposium
"This book contains revised versions of most of the peer-reviewed papers presented at the Fifth Symposium for Artificial Intelligence Researchers (STAIRS), which took place in Lisbon, Portugal, in conjunction with the 19th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI) and the Sixth Conference on Prestigious Applications of Intelligent Systems (PAIS) in August 2010. STAIRS is an international meeting which aims to support AI researchers from all countries at the beginning of their career, and PhD students or those who have held a PhD for less than one year. It offers doctoral students and young post-doctoral AI fellows a unique and valuable opportunity to gain experience in presenting their work in a supportive scientific environment, where they can obtain constructive feedback on the technical content of their work as well as advice on how to present it, and where they can also establish contacts with the broader European AI research community. The topics cover a broad spectrum of subjects in the field of AI: learning and classification, ontologies and the semantic web, agent programming and planning, logic and reasoning, economic approaches, games, dialogue systems, user preferences and recommender systems. Offering an opportunity to glimpse the current work of the AI researchers of the future, this book will be of interest to anyone whose work involves the use of artificial intelligence and intelligent systems."--Publisher description
