Fremde Welten : Wege und RÃ¤ume der Fantastik im 21. Jahrhundert
"Until recently, scholars were hesitant to take the fantastic seriously. But since the 1990s, the increasing presence of the fantastic in mass media has spurred growing academic interest in the subject. This book discusses that new interest and brings together recent research in various disciplines. It provides an overview of current approaches and debates in the research of the fantastic. By taking stock of the present state of this young discipline, it also helps to ensure its future."--Summary provided by EBL (EBook Library)
