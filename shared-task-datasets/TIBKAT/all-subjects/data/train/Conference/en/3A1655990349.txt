Imams in Western Europe : developments, transformations, and institutional challenges
As European Muslims and Muslims in the Middle East diverge, imams in Europe have emerged as major agents of religious authority who shape Islamâ€™s presence in Western societies. This volume examines the theoretical and practical questions concerning the evolving role of imams in Europe. To what extent do imams act as intermediaries between European states and Muslim communities? Do states subsidize imam training? How does institutionalization of Islam differ between European states?
