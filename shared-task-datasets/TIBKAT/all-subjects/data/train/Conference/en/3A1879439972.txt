Globalisation and SMEs in East Asia
The 1997 financial and economic crisis in East Asia provided the catalyst for an important reappraisal of the Small and Medium sized Enterprise (SME) sector across the region. In this timely book, a distinguished group of contributors discusses the role of SMEs in the globalisation of the East Asian economies, and assess how the financial crisis has impacted on them. They focus on a number of key aspects of SMEs in the region, including: * financing issues * the role of entrepreneurship * the diffusion of technology in the region * Chinese small businesses * SME requirements for information technology * the opportunities afforded by electronic commerce * regional labour markets and their impact on SMEs. Globalisation and SMEs in East Asia will appeal to academics and researchers of Asian economies and studies, globalisation and those interested in industrial organisation
