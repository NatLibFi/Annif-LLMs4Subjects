Argumentation in multi-agent systems : first international workshop, ArgMAS 2004, New York, NY, USA, July 19, 2004 : revised selected and invited papers
The theory of argumentation is a rich, interdisciplinary area of research involving philosophy, communications studies, linguistics, psychology, and logics. Its techniques have found a wide range of applications in both theoretical and practical branches of artificial intelligence and computer science. Multi-agent systems theory has picked up argumentation inspired approaches and specifically argumentation-theoretic results from many different areas. Researchers in argumentation and multi-agent systems are currently enjoying a unique opportunity&nbsp;to integrate the various understandings of argument into a coherent and core part of the functioning of autonomous computational systems. This book originates from the First International Workshop on Argumentation in Multi-Agent Systems, ArgMAS 2004, held in New York, NY, USA in July 2004. Besides 12 selected revised full papers taken from the workshop, 4 additional papers by key people in the area to round off overall coverage of the relevant topics. The papers address the following main topics: foundations of dialogues, belief revision, persuation and deliveration, negotiation, and strategic issues
