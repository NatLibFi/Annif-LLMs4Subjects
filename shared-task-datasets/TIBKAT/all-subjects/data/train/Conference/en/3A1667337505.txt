Consumer culture theory
The twentieth volume of Research in Consumer Behavior presents twelve chapters, selected from the best papers submitted at the 13th annual Consumer Culture Theory Conference held in Denmark in June 2018. Aligned with the conference's thematic emphasis on storytelling, the contributors' research stories open the eyes and minds of readers to thought-provoking ideas, theories, and contexts.This book will allow researchers and graduate students working in the area of consumer research and marketing to explore three narrative lines that were prevalent during the conference: 'Objects and their doings', 'Glocalization', and 'Constituting Markets'. The volume concludes with an awarded paper by Brown, who takes a critical look at the quality of storytelling in the CCT tradition and helps us learn from the great storytellers of the past.
