China in the Global Economy focuses on the theme of twin transitions occurring in the Chinese economy: the transition from a centrally planned economic system to a market oriented one, and from an agrarian to a modern industrialised society. China's exporters face unprecedented competition in the world market and the flow of foreign direct investment has fallen restraining the growth of the domestic economy. These new challenges have fuelled debate on the perspective of the Chinese economy and its role in the global economy
