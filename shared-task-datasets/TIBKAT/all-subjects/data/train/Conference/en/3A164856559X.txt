New Smart Materials via Metal Mediated Macromolecular Engineering
Control over macromolecular architecture and resulting material properties has been a central goal of polymer chemistry. There has been much interest in developing new synthetic routes to prepare smart materials with novel compositions and topologies for various applications. The considerable progress in the metal mediated macromolecular engineering over the past decade has had a major impact on the development of well-defined macromolecular architectures and the synthesis of smart materials. Particularly, remarkable strong developments have been observed for the synthesis of smart materials v
