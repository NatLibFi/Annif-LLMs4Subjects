Lectures on flavor physics : [written versions of some selected lectures delivered at the "41. Internationale Universitätswochen für Theoretische Physik" in Schladming, Austria during the period February 22nd-28th, 2003]
This volume contains the edited versions of some selected lectures delivered at the famous "Schladming Winter School", devoted to "Flavor Physics" in the present case. Flavor physics is one of the hot topics in contemporary elementary particle physics, because it relates to fundamental questions like the origin fo masses, the size and strength of CP violation and the oscillations between various neutrino species. This volume will be useful for graduate students wishing to get more acquainted with fhe field as well as for lecturers in search of material for seminars of special lectures and courses in quantum field theory. TOC:Light-Quark Dynamics.- The Anomalous Magnetic Moment of the Muon: a Theoretical Introduction.- CP Violation in B and K Decays: 2003.- Heavy Quark Physics.- Neutrino Physics--Theory
