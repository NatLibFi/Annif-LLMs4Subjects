Antarctic palaeoenvironments and earth-surface processes : [11th International Symposium on Antarctic Earth Sciences (ISEAS) held in Edinburgh, Scotland, 10-16 July 2011 ; review papers]
The volume highlights developments in our understanding of the palaeogeographical, palaeobiological, palaeoclimatic and cryospheric evolution of Antarctica. It focuses on the sedimentary record from the Devonian to the Quaternary Period. It features tectonic evolution and stratigraphy, as well as processes taking place adjacent to, beneath and beyond the ice-sheet margin, including the continental shelf. --
