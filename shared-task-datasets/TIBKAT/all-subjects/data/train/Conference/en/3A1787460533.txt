Anti-differentiation and the calculation of Feynman amplitudes
This volume comprises review papers presented at the Conference on Antidifferentiation and the Calculation of Feynman Amplitudes, held in Zeuthen, Germany, in October 2020, and a few additional invited reviews. The book aims at comprehensive surveys and new innovative results of the analytic integration methods of Feynman integrals in quantum field theory. These methods are closely related to the field of special functions and their function spaces, the theory of differential equations and summation theory. Almost all of these algorithms have a strong basis in computer algebra. The solution of the corresponding problems are connected to the analytic management of large data in the range of Giga- to Terabytes. The methods are widely applicable to quite a series of other branches of mathematics and theoretical physics.
