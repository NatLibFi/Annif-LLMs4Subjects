Global women's entrepreneurship research : diverse settings, questions and approaches
Global Women’s Entrepreneurship Research responds to recent calls from academic researchers and policy analysts alike to pay greater attention to the diversity and heterogeneity among women entrepreneurs. Drawing together studies by 26 researchers affiliated with the DIANA International Research Network, this collection contributes to a richer and more robust understanding of the field. -- Part I: ‘Diverse Settings’ introduces research set in a range of contexts, from those rarely examined to those representing more familiar terrains. Part II: ‘Diverse Questions’ explores new questions and reframes old questions in fresh, innovative ways. Part III: ‘Diverse Approaches’ features studies with distinct methodological approaches that reflect and extend the rigour and creativity of research in this field. Together, the research assembled in this volume significantly advances knowledge about women’s entrepreneurship around the world.
