Frontiers in materials research
This book covers recent progress in advanced materials research as reviewed by forefront researchers in contributions which would also be suitable for researchers and postgraduates in a related field. It starts with comprehensive reviews of exotic materials for electronic devices, such as wide gap semiconductors and organic materials. They are followed by recent topics on eco- and bio-friendly materials, which attract more and more attention in the materials research community. Atomic scale characterization and control of nanostructured materials are discussed in later chapters that review the general possibilities for precise control of structures and properties in the developments of advanced materials.
