Aspects of computation and automata theory with applications
"Comprehensive and original collection of cutting-edge topics on automata theory, computational complexity and recursion theory. The contributors are expert researchers in these fields and both contribute new scientific results and ideas for future directions The articles are an interdisciplinary mix dealing with computations from the concrete level of the theory of finite automata through the theoretical limits explored in recursion theory and also cover the middle in between with excursions into game theory and parameterized complexity"--
