Cattle husbandry in Eastern Europe and China : structure, development paths and optimisation ; [3rd workshop on Eastern Europe, held in Bratislava, Slovakia, 2012 ... as part of the annual EAAP meeting ; contributions]
This book presents an analysis of the dairy and associated sector developments in Eastern Europe and China. The transition in cattle husbandry in Eastern Europe, resulting in enormous structural changes, but not in an increased production volume, is different from emerging countries, like China, where traditional small scale farming goes together with the remodelling or start of mega farms. Capacity building by means of cooperation appears to be hindered by historical experience. Farm development paths were studied in more depth in Poland, Lithuania and Slovenia using detailed farmer surveys. Farmers' strategies, availability of resources, and opportunities and threats were analysed, and interactive group trainings in strategic management were part of the analysis. The results are presented here. Although farmers showed similar wishes concerning farm development, the local environment and policies determines the degree of achievement. Farm fragmentation, the high percentage of rented land and availability of suitable labour are major constraints. Future EU policies are a concern but new technologies are embraced. This book is a must for those interested in the transition in Eastern Europe. It is indispensable to consultants, marketers, companies, farm leaders and government officials in agriculture
