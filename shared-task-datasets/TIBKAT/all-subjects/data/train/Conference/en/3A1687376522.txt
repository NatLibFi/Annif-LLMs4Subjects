Bridging the Mississippi : spans across the Father of Waters
"Over two hundred bridges cross the Mississippi River along its 2,300-mile meandering route from Lake Itasca, Minnesota, to the Gulf of Mexico. In "Bridging the Mississippi," photographer Philip Gould documents seventy-five significant spans in rural, small-town, and metropolitan settings. Taken from the riverbank, the air, the river, and the bridge itself, the photos offer a unique view of the Mississippi River through the frame of its many manmade crossings. The three-part photographic journey starts in New Orleans and heads up river, bridge by bridge, to the source in a voyage of discovery: the lower Mississippi, from New Orleans to Cairo, IL, where the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers join; the upper river, from Cairo to Minneapolis, where commercial navigation ends; and from the Twin Cities to river's headwaters. Gould's images reflect historical, architectural, and engineering detail, as well as dramatic beauty. His use of two unconventional photographic devices-the drone and a panoramic camera-capture stunning vertical views and horizontal expanses. In her riveting introduction, Margot Hasha explores the Mississippi's geological demands, the struggle between riverboats and railroads, engineering challenges, and sociological and economic benefits. For eleven of the bridges, she paints a profile of their specific history, design, and community. Varied in their style and vintage, the Mississippi River bridges play supporting roles in the nation's life. Philip Gould's astonishing album of these architecturally distinctive and historically significant structures is a tribute to nature and humans alike"--
