New library buildings in Europe : documentation 2010
This book brings together information about the latest academic library building projects from across Europe. New attractive buildings and huge renovation projects are presented in this documentation which continues the tradition established by Professor Elmar Mittler (formerly Director of the State and University Library GÃ¶ttingen), who was the first chairman of the LIBER Architecture Group. The publication of this book coincides with the 15th LIBER Architecture Group Seminar which will take place in Madrid in April 2010. In addition to hearing about the latest developments in planning and design and offering visits to new library buildings, the Seminar provides an occasion to debate ideas and meet colleagues from institutions across Europe. I hope that the projects in this book will provide ideas for your own work and that they will also stimulate your interest in new library architecture and the creative use of space.
