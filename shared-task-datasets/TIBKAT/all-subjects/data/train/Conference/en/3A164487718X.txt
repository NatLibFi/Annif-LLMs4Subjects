Willy Brandt and international relations : Europe, the USA, and Latin America, 1974-1992
While there are many books that deal with Brandt's foreign policy as West German Chancellor, Willy Brandt and International Relations is the only book to deal with Brandt's politics as elder statesman between 1974 and 1992. The editors have assembled a group of authors from Germany, the USA, Latin America and Europe to assess Brandt's important role in global affairs during the waning decades of the Cold War. The chapters follow Brandt beyond his resignation as Chancellor in 1974, after which he continued his position as chairman of Social Democratic party and became chairman of the Socialist International. His international politics were above all focused on Europe, Latin America and the United States. He was keen on finding new partners in the 'Third World' such as Latin America and the Caribbean, leading to conflicts with the U.S. administration which caused problems for West German foreign policy. The authors also examine global challenges that occurred after 1989, such as Brandt's handling of German unification, the Kuwait crisis of 1991 and the first Gulf War.
