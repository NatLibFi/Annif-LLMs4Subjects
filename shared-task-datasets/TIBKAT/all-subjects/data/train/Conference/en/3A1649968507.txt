Single Molecule Spectroscopy in Chemistry, Physics and Biology : Nobel Symposium
Written by the leading experts in the field, this book describes the development and current state of the art in single molecule spectroscopy. The application of this technique, which started 1989, in physics, chemistry and biosciences is displayed.
By selecting the ?rst week of June 2008 for the Nobel Symposium 'Single Molecular Spectroscopy in Chemistry, Physics and Biology', Rudolf Rigler, Jerker Widengren and Astrid Grasl ¨ und have once again won the top prize for Meeting Organizers, providing us with a Mediterranean climate on top of the warm hospitality that is unique to Sweden. The S? anga Sab ¨ y Conference Center was an ideal place to spend this wonderful week, and the comfort of this beautiful place blended perfectly with the high calibre of the scienti?c programme. It was a special privilege for me to be able to actively participate in this meeting on a ?eld that is in many important ways complementary to myownresearch. Iwasimpressedbytheinterdisciplinarywaysinwhichsingle molecule spectroscopy has evolved and is currently pursued, with ingredients originating from physics, all branches of chemistry and a wide range of b- logical and biomedical research. A beautiful concert by Semmy Stahlhammer and Johan Ull´ en further extended the interdisciplinary character of the s- posium. I would like to combine thanks to Rudolf, Jerker and Astrid with a glance into a future of other opportunities to enjoy top-levelscience combined with warm hospitality in the Swedish tradition.
