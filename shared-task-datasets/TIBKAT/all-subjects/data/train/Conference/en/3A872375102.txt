Carbon capture and storage : Sheffield, United Kingdom, 18-20 July 2016
This volume brings together the work of researchers from both the chemical sciences and energy and process engineering communities in the field of carbon capture and storage. The global generation of power depends heavily on coal-fired power plants; in 2008 nearly half of electricity was generated via coal combustion. This is expected to drop as a percentage but rise in absolute terms by 2035. Moreover, industrial processes such as the production of cement or iron emit CO2 as an intrinsic part of the process. As fossil fuels will remain part of the global energy mix for some time, carbon capture and storage is a "must develop" technology for reducing carbon emissions. Carbon capture and storage is currently being tested at the megawatt scale, and chemists and chemical engineers are working together to incorporate new technologies into viable processes. Recent advances in modelling can be used to produce large-scale models of power plants and capture equipment. Meanwhile, developments in the use of CO2 as a platform chemical are leading to new questions, such as whether CO2 capture and storage and CO2 utilisation are competitors, and what factors could influence the choice of one over the other
