This book constitutes the thoroughly refereed post-conference proceedings of the Third SKLOIS (State Key Laboratory of Information Security) Conference on Information Security and Cryptology, Inscrypt 2007 (formerly CISC), held in Xining, China, in August/September 2007. The 33 revised full papers and 10 revised short papers presented together with 2 invited papers were carefully reviewed and selected from 167 submissions. The papers are organized in topical sections on digital signature schemes, block cipher, key management, zero knowledge and secure computation protocols, secret sharing, stream cipher and pseudorandomness, boolean functions, privacy and deniability, hash functions, public key cryptosystems, public key analysis, application security, system security and trusted computing, and network security.
