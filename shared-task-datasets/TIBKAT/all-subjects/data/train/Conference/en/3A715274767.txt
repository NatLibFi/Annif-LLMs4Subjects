Financial sector regulation for growth, equity and stability : proceedings of a conference organised by the BIS and CAFRAL in Mumbai, 15 - 16 November 2011
The financial crisis has demonstrated the need to better understand the complex interactions between the financial system and the real economy. While stability has become the main focus of the regulatory changes, the implications for growth and equity are also important. To think through these issues and provide an emerging market perspective, CAFRAL, in collaboration with the Bank for International Settlements, organised an international conference of central banks and regulators on "Financial regulation and its implications for growth equity and stability in the post crisis world" in Mumbai on 15th and 16th November 2011.
