Symmetry and heterogeneity in high temperature superconductors : [proceedings of the NATO Advanced Study Research Workshop on Symmetry and Heterogeneity in High Temperature Superconductors, Erice, Sicily, Italy, October 4 - 10, 2003]
Talks about quantum mechanism that allows the macroscopic quantum coherence of a superconducting condensate to resist to the attacks of high temperature. This book presents the experimental results on nanoscale phase separation and the two component scenario in high Tc in doped cuprate and the lower symmetry in the superconducting elements
