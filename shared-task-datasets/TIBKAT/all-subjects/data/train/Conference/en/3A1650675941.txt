Sound-Flow Interactions
The coupling between acoustic waves and fluid flow motion is basically nonlinear, with the result that flow and sound modify themselves reciprocally with respect to generation and propagation properties. As a result this problem is investigated by many different communities, such as applied mathematics, acoustics and fluid mechanics. This book is the result of an international school which was held to discuss the foundation of sound--flow interactions, to share expertise and methodologies, and to promote cross-fertilization between the different disciplines involved. It consists essentially of a set of pedagogical lectures and is meant to serve not only as a compact source of reference for the experienced researcher but also as an advanced textbook for postgraduate students, and nonspecialists wishing to familiarize themselves in depth, at a research level, with this fascinating subject
