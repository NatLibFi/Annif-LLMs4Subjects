Precision agriculture '15 : papers presented at the 10th European Conference on Precision Agriculture, Volcani Center, Israel, 12-16 July 2015
Precision agriculture is now 'main stream' in agriculture and is playing a key role as the industry comes to terms with the environment, market forces, quality requirements, traceability, vehicle guidance and crop management. Research continues to be necessary - and needs to be reported and disseminated to a wide audience. These proceedings contain reviewed papers presented at the 10th European Conference on Precision Agriculture, held at the Volcani Centre, Israel. The papers reflect the wide range of disciplines that impinge on precision agriculture - technology, crop science, soil science, agronomy, information technology, decision support, remote sensing and others. The broad range of research topics reported will be a valuable resource for researchers, advisors, teachers and professionals in agriculture long after the conference has finished
