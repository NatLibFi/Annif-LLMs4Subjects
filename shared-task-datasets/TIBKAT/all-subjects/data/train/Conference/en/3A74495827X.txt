Modeling and Control of Systems : in Engineering, Quantum Mechanics, Economics and Biosciences Proceedings of the Bellman Continuum Workshop 1988, June 13-14, Sophia Antipolis, France
Part I of this book accounts for new developments concerning robustness, systems with two time scales and related treatments utilizing singular perturbation analysis. Part II is mainly concerned with systems in which uncertainty comes out through quantum mechanical rules; that is, with quantum filtering and control and nondemolition measurements. These are essential steps on the way from quantum physics to quantum technology. Part III reports recent results in mathematical economics, in the framework of dynamic optimization. Part IV is concerned with applications of Bellman's approach to biological systems and ecosystems. Part V is devoted to computational bearings
