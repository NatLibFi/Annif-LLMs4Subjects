EU accession - financial sector opportunities and challenges for Southeast Europe : with 41 tables
KfW has been involved in the financial sector development of the current accession countries for almost fifteen years. Since the mid-1990s, KfW has been promoting the financial sector and private enterprise of Southeast Europe through its support of, and cooperation with, microfinance and commercial banks and microfinance NGOs. In November 2003, KfW organised a high-level symposium that brought together a distinguished international group of central bankers, commercial bankers, entrepreneurs, academic advisors, policymakers, and representatives of development finance organizations and donor agencies to examine the future of financial sector development in Southeast Europe. In this book, which compiles, synthesises and expands upon the findings of this symposium, these leaders explore ways to strengthen the SEE banking sector, further promote SMEs, and improve access to financial services in the region. Experts and decision-makers assess the opportunities and challenges presented by the EU accession process and Basel II, and offer candid insight into expanding role of the private sector in developing SEE's financial landscape. The perspectives presented this book will prompt discussion and intellectual exchange that will serve as a new starting point for further successful cooperative initatives
