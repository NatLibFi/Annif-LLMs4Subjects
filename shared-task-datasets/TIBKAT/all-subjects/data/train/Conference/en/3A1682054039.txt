Review of the incidence of the sulfate attack in spain. evaluation of field concrete cases -- Investigation on the combined interaction of sulfate and acidic attack on concretes exposed to aggressive environments -- External Sulphate Attack on recycled concrete: assessment of the influence of recycled aggregate -- Influence of temperature and aggressive solutions in the formation of thaumasite and ettringita in standard and commercial mortars -- Influence of thermal preconditioning on the mechanism of external sulfate attack -- Influence of specimen size on the expansion of Portland cement mortars immersed in sodium sulphate solution -- An alternative method to evaluate the sulfate resistance of cementitious binders -- New approach for testing SR cements -- A fast testing method for discriminating hardened cement paste reactivity with external sulfate -- The uses of finely grounded materials to mitigate the external sulphate attack on cementitious materials -- Damage evolution in cement mortar with and without ground coal bottom ash due to sulfate attack
This volume gathers contributions from the final workshop of the RILEM TC-251-SRT "Sulfate Resistance Testing" on External Sulfate Attack (TESA 2018), held on May 24-25, 2018 at IETcc-CSIC, Madrid, Spain. One of the Technical Committee’s main events, it addressed various aspects of external sulfate attack in concrete structures and test methods. The workshop promoted technical discussions and debates on ideas on these topics, with a focus on evaluating the resistance of concrete exposed to ESA. It also provided a forum for participants from around the globe to share their experiences and research on concrete structures affected by external sulfate attack and on test methods. The book discusses the latest advances in research related to ESA and new developments in test methods, and features real-world case studies of concrete structures affected by external sulfate attack in various countries. It also presents new studies linking field cases and lab tests, including 12 contributions on 3 main themes: mechanisms of alteration in external sulfate attack; field aspects of external sulfate attack; and testing to evaluate the resistance of concrete to external sulfate attack
