Topics in Artificial Intelligence : 5th Catalonian Conference on AI, CCIA 2002 Castellón, Spain, October 24–25, 2002 Proceedings
This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 5th Catalonian Conference on Artificial Intelligence, CCIA 2002, held in Castellón, Spain in October 2002. The 37 revised full papers presented were carefully reviewed and selected from 77 submissions. The papers are organized in topical sections on reasoning models, constraint satisfation, machine learning and classification, multi-agent systems, and computer vision and robotics.
