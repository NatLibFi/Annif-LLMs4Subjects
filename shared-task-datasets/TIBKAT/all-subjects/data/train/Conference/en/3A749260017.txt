Domain-Specific Program Generation : International Seminar, Dagstuhl Castle, Germany, March 23-28, 2003. Revised Papers
Program generation holds the promise of helping to bridge the gap between application-level problem solutions and efficient implementations at the level of today's source programs as written in C or Java. Thus, program generation can substantially contribute to reducing production cost and time-to-market in future software production, while improving the quality and stability of the product. This book is about domain-specific program generation; it is the outcome of a Dagstuhl seminar on the topic held in March 2003. After an introductory preface by the volume editors, the 18 carefully reviewed revised full papers presented are organized into topical sections on - surveys of domain-specific programming technologies - domain-specific programming languages - tool support for program generation - domain-specific techniques for program optimization
