Pediatric adrenal diseases : workshop, May 16-18, 2010, Turin (Italy)
Written by experts and specialized investigators, this book presents a detailed overview of the recent progress in our understanding of the adrenal cortex and its pivotal roles in homeostasis. Genes, molecules and cell compartments directly or indirectly involved in the complex steroidogenesis pathway as well as the resulting end-hormones glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and androgens are analyzed. Furthermore, the defects of the genes responsible both for common and rare adrenal disorders are presented. The interactions of the adrenal cortices with the adrenal medulla and their importance in the integration of adrenocortical and adrenomedullary function are discussed. The complex molecular pathophysiology of congenital adrenal hyperplasia is presented; long-term effects of the disorder and the still controversial antenatal therapy are examined. Finally, expert review chapters discuss autoimmune Addison disease and the adrenoleukodystrophy/adrenomyeloneuropathy syndrome.Presenting novel research findings in adrenal gland physiology and pathophysiology, this book is a useful tool not only for pediatric endocrinologists, but also for clinicians and researchers studying human development, organogenesis, mitochondrial biology, nuclear receptors, stress biology and pharmacology
