As found : experiments in preservation
"Architecture in Flanders and Brussels reflects a unique position in dealing with the existing built environment. Although the experimental approaches vary with different design methodologies, the audacity of the interventions remains, whether it is a medieval structure or a twentieth-century building. This book focuses on seven experimental approaches in preservation today: ensemble, void, reconfiguration, inside out, traces, mirror and nuance. These are explored through essays, realized projects and international references"--publisher's description
