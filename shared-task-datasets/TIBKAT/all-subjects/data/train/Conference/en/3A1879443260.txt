Global divergence in trade, money and policy
Although the globalization of markets and the rapid growth in worldwide information technologies supports harmonization and integration between countries, substantial differences still exist throughout the world. Global Divergence in Trade, Money and Policy explores the disparities between a range of countries, arguing that their differences are a major factor in international tensions, and will remain a substantial problem for many decades to come. The book analyses the implications of disparities in the areas of economic power, institutional structures, per capita income, international trade, exchange rate systems, financial markets, monetary policy issues, the development of monetary unions and welfare. Case studies encompassing Asia, India, Greece, Mexico, the US and EU accession countries illustrate how differently the globalization process is regarded and valued by countries depending on their own particular circumstances. Exploring the role of different countries in the processes of globalization and shedding light on the issues surrounding economic divergences, this book will strongly appeal to economists with a special interest in globalization, development and international trade
