High Magnetic Fields : Applications in Condensed Matter Physics and Spectroscopy
The quantum Hall effect, low-dimensional systems, vortices and superconductivity, high-resolution NMR and EPR spectroscopy - all these and many other landmark contributions of high-magnetic-field physics to solid state science, analytical chemistry and structural biology are presented in this book. Each chapter describes the key concepts and future prospects in the corresponding field. The text can be read at different levels: researchers will find depth and insight, while students will come to understand the basic concepts. This book, written by leading scientists, will serve as a reference work on high-magnetic-field science for many years to come
