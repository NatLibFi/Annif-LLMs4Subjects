Long and Short Term Variability of Climate
The book deals with natural climate variations during the last 600,000 years. Among the topics astronomical influence on paleoclimates, climate and environment, natural CO2-variants based on investigations of ice curves and climatic information from wood density are the most important. This long and short term variability is the base for modelling and prediction of anthropogenically induced climatic changes
