Discourse and perspective in cognitive linguistics : [selected rev. papers read at the 4th bi-annual International Cognitive Linguistics Conference held in Albuquerque at the University of New Mexico, July 16 - 21, 1995]
Cognitive models, perspectives and the construction of situated meaning have always been core concepts in cognitive linguistics. The papers in this volume present applications of those concepts to the study of discourse phenomena like the use and interpretation of metaphors, modal expressions, focus particles, tag questions, indirect speech acts, and iconographic textual references. The book also includes two studies focusing on cognitive processes involved in discourse production.
