War and remembrance : World War II and the Holocaust in the memory politics of post-socialist Europe
Providing a comprehensive and engaging account of World War II remembrance and memory politics in East-Central and Eastern Europe this volume uses a comparative approach to examine the phenomena of cultural memory in a pan-European overview. Ranging in scope from various post-Soviet states such as Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, and Georgia to the East-Central and South-Eastern European post-socialist countries of Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary, Serbia, and Croatia, this book provides new insights into the ways in which World War II remembrance is reflected in the memory politics, historical studies, culture and literature of the respective countries. The volume focuses mostly on state memory narratives and their public reception as well as museums, memorials and monuments as controversial objects of cultural memory
