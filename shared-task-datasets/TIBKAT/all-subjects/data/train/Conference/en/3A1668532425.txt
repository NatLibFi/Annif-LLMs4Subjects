Private International Law in Mainland China, Taiwan and Europe
Over the last decades, private international law has become the target of intense codification efforts. Inspired by the stimulating initiatives taken by some European countries, by the Brussels Convention and the Rome Convention, numerous countries in other regions of the world started to enact comprehensive legislation in the field. Among them are Taiwan and mainland China. Both adopted statutes on private international law in 2010. In light of the rising significance of the mutual economic and societal relations between the jurisdictions involved and of the legal innovations laid down in the new instruments, the Max Planck Institute for Comparative and International Private Law convened scholars to present the conflict rules adopted in Europe, in mainland China and in Taiwan across a whole range of private law subjects. This book collects the papers of the conference and presents them to the public, together with English translations of the acts of Taiwan and mainland China.Survey of contentsPart 1: Jurisdiction, Choice of Law, and the Recognition of Foreign Judgments in Recent Legislation  Jin Huang: New Perspectives on Private International Law in the People's Republic of China –  Rong-Chwan Chen: Jurisdiction, Choice of Law and the Recognition of Foreign Judgments in Taiwan –  Stefania Bariatti: Jurisdiction, Choice of Law and the Recognition of Foreign Judgments in Recent EU Legislation Part 2: Selected Problems of General Provisions  Weizuo Chen: Selected Problems of General Provisions in Private International Law: The PRC Perspective –  Rong-Chwan Chen: General Provisions in the Taiwanese Private International Law Enactment 2010 –  Jürgen Basedow: The Application of Foreign Law – Comparative Remarks on the Practical Side of Private International Law Part 3: Property Law  Huanfang   Du: The Choice of Law for Property Rights in Mainland China: Progress and Imperfection – Yao-Ming Hsu: Property Law in Taiwan-  Louis d'Avout: Property Law in Europe Part 4: Contractual Obligations  Qisheng He: Recent Developments of New Chinese Private International Law With Regard to Contracts –  David J.W.
