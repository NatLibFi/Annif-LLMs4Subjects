Codes, Systems, and Graphical Models
Coding theory, system theory, and symbolic dynamics have much in common. Among the central themes in each of these subjects are the construction of state space representations, understanding of fundamental structural properties of sequence spaces, construction of input/output systems, and understanding the special role played by algebraic structure. A major new theme in this area of research is that of codes and systems based on graphical models. This volume contains survey and research articles from leading researchers at the interface of these subjects
