Large scale inverse problems : computational methods and applications in the earth sciences
This book is thesecond volume of three volume series recording the 'Radon Special Semester 2011 on Multiscale Simulation  Analysis in Energy and the Environment' taking place in Linz, Austria, October 3-7, 2011. The volume addresses the common ground in the mathematical and computational procedures required for large-scale inverse problems and data assimilation in forefront applications.
