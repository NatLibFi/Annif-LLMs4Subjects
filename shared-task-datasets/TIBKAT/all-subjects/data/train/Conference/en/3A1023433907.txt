pt. 1. Accidents, path dependency and strategic action -- pt. 2. Institutions and endogenous dynamics -- pt. 3. Patterns of emergence and growth -- pt. 4. Cluster emergence and emergence of cluster politics
This book rigorously explores the critical, initial stage of cluster emergence in which the seeds for further growth are sown. Whether economic growth actually occurs, however, ultimately depends on various regional conditions and the processes in place
