Sustaining growth and performance in East Asia : the role of small and medium sized enterprises
pt. 1. General and macro aspects -- pt. 2. Internal (micro) aspects -- pt. 3. Strategic aspects -- pt. 4. Policy aspects
This third book in the series focuses on how small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) contribute to achieving and sustaining growth and performance in their economies, as well as the ways in which governments can assist and enhance that contribution. This is of particular concern given the trauma suffered by East Asian economies in the wake of the financial and economic crisis of 1997-98
