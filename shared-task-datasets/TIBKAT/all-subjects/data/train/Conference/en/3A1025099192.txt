Future Islands : the New Zealand Exhibition, Biennale Architettura 2016
"Future Islands - just New Zealand's second national exhibition at a Venice Architecture Biennale - is lyrical and evocative. By presenting New Zealand architecture as a grouping of metaphorical islands, an imagined archipelago encompassing a variety of approaches and responses to the fluid and uncertain conditions of contemporary practice, it establishes New Zealand as innovative, creative, forward-thinking and bold."--Publisher's description
