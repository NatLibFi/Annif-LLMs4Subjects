Model Checking Software : 8th International SPIN Workshop Toronto, Canada, May 19–20, 2001 Proceedings
This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 8th International SPIN Workshop held in Toronto, Canada, in May 2001. The SPIN model checker is one of the most powerful and popular systems for the analysis and verification of distributed and concurrent systems. The 13 revised full papers presented together with one invited survey paper and three invited industrial experience reports were carefully reviewed and selected from 26 submissions. Besides foundational issues of program analysis and formal verification, the papers focus on tools for model checking and practical applications in a variety of fields.
