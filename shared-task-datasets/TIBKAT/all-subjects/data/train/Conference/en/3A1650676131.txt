Statistical and Dynamical Aspects of Mesoscopic Systems : Proceedings of the XVI Sitges Conference on Statistical Mechanics Held at Sitges, Barcelona, Spain, 7â€“11 June 1999
Initially a subfield of solid state physics, the study of mesoscopic systems has evolved over the years into a vast field of research in its own right. Keeping track its rapid progress, this book provides a broad survey of the latest developments in the field. The focus is on statistics and dynamics of mesoscopic systems with special emphasis on topics like quantum chaos, localization, noise and fluctuations, mesoscopic optics and quantum transport in nanostructures. Written with nonspecialists in mind, this book will also be useful to graduate students wishing to familiarize themselves with this field of research
