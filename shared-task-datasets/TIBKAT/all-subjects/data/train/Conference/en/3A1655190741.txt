Holomorphic Dynamics : Proceedings of the Second International Colloquium on Dynamical Systems, held in Mexico, July 1986
The objective of the meeting was to have together leading specialists in the field of Holomorphic Dynamical Systems in order to present their current reseach in the field. The scope was to cover iteration theory of holomorphic mappings (i.e. rational maps), holomorphic differential equations and foliations. Many of the conferences and articles included in the volume contain open problems of current interest. The volume contains only research articles
