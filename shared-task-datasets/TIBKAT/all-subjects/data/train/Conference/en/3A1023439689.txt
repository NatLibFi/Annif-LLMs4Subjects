Contemporary issues in sports economics : participation and professional team sports
The development of sports economics has exploded in recent years, and this well-researched and relevant book explores some of the most critical themes. Contemporary Issues in Sports Economics examines topics that have previously received little attention in the literature, such as the determinants and social impacts of sports participation including the link to crime levels. The distinguished authors also discuss some of the less investigated aspects of professional team sports, including: sports betting, financing and governance; the impact of low scoring matches on competitive balance and fan appeal in European football; and the effect on player transfers of a luxury tax on club payrolls in Major League Baseball.
