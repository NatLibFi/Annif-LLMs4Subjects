Functional Analysis : Proceedings of the Seminar at the University of Texas at Austin 1987–89
The papers in this volume yield a variety of powerful tools for penetrating the structure of Banach spaces, including the following topics: the structure of Baire-class one functions with Banach space applications, operator extension problems, the structure of Banach lattices tensor products of operators and Banach spaces, Banach spaces of certain classes of Fourier series, uniformly stable Banach spaces, the hyperplane conjecture for convex bodies, and applications of probability theory to local Banach space structure.

Ball: Normed spaces with a weak-Gordon-Lewis property.- S.J. Szarek: On the geometry of the Banach-Mazur compactum.- P.
