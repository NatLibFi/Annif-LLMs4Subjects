Gender and protest : on the historical and contemporary interrelation of two social phenomena
For centuries women and other "gendered minorities" had to protest to gain equality. Their demands were often matched by counter-protest from conservative forces within historical societies that intended to return to "old orders" or "good old times." The present volume will take a closer look at the interrelationship between gender and protest and analyze in detail how gender-related perspectives stimulated protests and initiated historical changes. Through historical case studies that range from antiquity until modern times, specialists from different countries and disciplines discuss reasons for protest, gender as a factor that stimulated social conflicts, and the power of gendered protests of the past with regards to their impact and long-term impact until today
