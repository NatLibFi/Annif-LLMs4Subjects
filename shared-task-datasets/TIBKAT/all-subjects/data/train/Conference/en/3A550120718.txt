Nanoscaled semiconductor-on-insulator structures and devices : [proceedings of the NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Nanoscaled Semiconductor-on-Insulator Structures and Devices, Big Yalta, Ukraine, 15 - 19 October 2006]
The book details many of the key issues associated with the scaling to nano-dimensions of silicon-on-insulator structures. Some papers offer new insight particularly at the device/circuit interface as appropriate for SOI which is fast becoming a mainstream technology. One of the key issues concerns mobility degradation in SOI films less than about 5nm. The advantages of combining scaled SOI devices with high permittivity (k) dielectric indicates that potential solutions are indeed available down to the 22nm node even with 5nm SOI films. A further key issue and potential ???show stopper??? for
