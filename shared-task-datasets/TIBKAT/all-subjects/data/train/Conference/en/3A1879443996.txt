Competition and regulation in utility markets
This volume is the latest in an annual series, published in association with the Institute of Economic Affairs and the London Business School, which provides an up-to-date review of the state of utility regulation in Britain, with some relevant overseas comparisons. The book, edited and with an introduction by Colin Robinson, covers many of the major issues and significant developments in the field of regulation and competition policy. In each case, essays by expert contributors are followed by the views of the sector regulator. This volume will prove invaluable to practitioners, policymakers and lawyers involved in monopoly regulation, regulatory reform and deregulation
