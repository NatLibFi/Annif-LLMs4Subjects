Regulating utilities : new issues, new solutions
Every year the Institute of Economic Affairs and the London Business School publish a volume of essays about Britain's system of utility regulation, with additional discussion of regulation in other countries. The book is a must for those interested in regulation, because it is an up-to-date review of the major issues in the field and includes the views of the sector regulators and the general competition authorities
