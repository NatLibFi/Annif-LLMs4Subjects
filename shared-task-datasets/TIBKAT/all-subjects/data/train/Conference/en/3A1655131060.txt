Hodge Theory : Proceedings of the U.S.-Spain Workshop held in Sant Cugat (Barcelona), Spain June 24â€“30, 1985
Over the past 2O years classical Hodge theory has undergone several generalizations of great interest in algebraic geometry. The papers in this volume reflect the recent developments in the areas of: mixed Hodge theory on the cohomology of singular and open varieties, on the rational homotopy of algebraic varieties, on the cohomology of a link, and on the vanishing cycles; L -realization of the intersection cohomology for the cases of singular varieties and smooth varieties with degenerating coefficients; applications of cubical hyperresolutions and of iterated integrals; asymptotic behavior of degenerating variations of Hodge structure; the geometric realization of maximal variations; and variations of mixed Hodge structure.
