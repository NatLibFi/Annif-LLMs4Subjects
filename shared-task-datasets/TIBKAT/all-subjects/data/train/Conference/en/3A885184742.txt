Fluvial landscapes in the Roman world
This volume is the result of a conference organized with the Oxford Roman Economy Project held at All Souls College at the University of Oxford in June, 2014. The conference aimed to explore the social and environmental context of rivers in the Roman world, especially how Roman activity influenced hydrological activity and how, in turn, hydrological activity influenced Roman life. Specialists in the history, archaeology and environment of the Roman world came together and discussed their research and methods in order to foster discussions about the future direction of interdisciplinary research on ancient rivers. The results of this discussion, presented here, demonstrate a variety of approaches to the study of ancient rivers as well as their historical significance
