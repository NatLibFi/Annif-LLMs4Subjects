This publication offers cutting-edge information about basic neurochemical and neuroimmunological research as well as clinical studies of immunological disarrangements and immunological dysfunctions in psychiatric disorders. The first part deals with psychoimmunological hypotheses and findings concerning mechanisms of underlying immunomodulation. The second part describes immunological characteristics of schizophrenia, depression and Alzheimers disease. Furthermore, the clinical section presents novel considerations for immunological treatment strategies based on the reported immune patterns of some psychiatric disorders.Psychiatrists and immunologists in the clinic, and researchers in basic sciences will also find this book essential reading.
