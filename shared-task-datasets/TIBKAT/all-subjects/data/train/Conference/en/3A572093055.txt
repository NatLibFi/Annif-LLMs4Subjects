Analog circuit design : high-speed clock and data recovery, high-performance amplifiers, power management ; [revised contributions of all speakers of the 17th Workshop on Advances in Analog Circuit Design (AACD) ; held at the University of Pavia]
"Analog Circuit Design contains the contribution of 18 tutorials of the 17th workshop on Advances in Analog Circuit Design. Each part discusses a specific to-date topic on new and valuable design ideas in the area of analog circuit design. Each part is presented by six experts in that field and state of the art information is shared and overviewed. This book is number 17 in this successful series of Analog Circuit Design, providing valuable information and excellent overviews of: High-Speed Clock and Data Recovery - Chaired by Prof. M. Steyaert, Catholic University Leuven; High-Performance Amplifiers Chaired by Prof. Arthur van Roermund, Eindhoven University of Technology; Power Management - Chaired by Herman Casier, AMI Semiconductor Fellow" "Analog Circuit Design is an essential reference source for analog circuit designers and researchers wishing to keep abreast with the latest development in the field. The tutorial coverage also makes it suitable for use in an advanced design."--BOOK JACKET
