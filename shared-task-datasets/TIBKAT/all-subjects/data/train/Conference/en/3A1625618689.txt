Decommissioning of offshore geotechnical structures : conference proceedings : COME 2017, March 28th-29th, 2017 Hamburg, Germany
Since the offshore energy sector has experienced a boost during the past years, the number of maritime constructions has increased. Simultaneously, the diversity of geotechnical structure types has been expanded by various research and technical developments. Nowadays, several foundation types for e.g. offshore wind energy plants or oil- and gas platforms exist. However, to this day, the focus of scientific works on offshore construction has been set on installation processes and logistics management. The conference on maritime energy focuses this time on natural environment aspects and especially on decommission of offshore geotechnical structures after usage. Professionals from industry and science are invited to discuss ecological and economical aspects of installation and decomposition of maritime geotechnical structures such as foundations of offshore oil- and gas platforms, offshore wind plants, sea cables and pipelines with respect to marine habitat. The main topics are: installation processes and time dependent soil-structure interaction phenomena as part of a life cycle strategy; ecological based design of geotechnical structures; decommissioning of geotechnical structures.
