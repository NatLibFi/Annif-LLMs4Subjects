Machine Learning: ECML 2003 : 14th European Conference on Machine Learning, Cavtat-Dubrovnik, Croatia, September 22-26, 2003. Proceedings
This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 14th European Conference on Machine Learning, ECML 2003, held in Cavtat-Dubrovnik, Croatia in September 2003 in conjunction with PKDD 2003. The 40 revised full papers presented together with 4 invited contributions were carefully reviewed and, together with another 40 ones for PKDD 2003, selected from a total of 332 submissions. The papers address all current issues in machine learning including support vector machine, inductive inference, feature selection algorithms, reinforcement learning, preference learning, probabilistic grammatical inference, decision tree learning, clustering, classification, agent learning, Markov networks, boosting, statistical parsing, Bayesian learning, supervised learning, and multi-instance learning
