Chapter 9. Analysis of Numerical Errors
This paper provides a general framework for the quantitative analysis of stochastic dynamic models. We review the convergence properties of some numerical algorithms and available methods to bound approximation errors. We then address the convergence and accuracy properties of the simulated moments. We study both optimal and non-optimal economies. Optimal economies generate smooth laws of motion defining Markov equilibria, and can be approximated by recursive methods with contractive properties. Non-optimal economies, however, lack existence of continuous Markov equilibria, and need to be simulated by numerical methods with weaker approximation properties.
