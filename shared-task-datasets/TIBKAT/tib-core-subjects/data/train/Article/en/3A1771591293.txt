Optimization of compliant path-generating mechanisms based on non-linear analytical modeling
Monolithic compliant mechanisms are often used in precision engineering applications for path-generating tasks due to their many advantages. They are mostly realized with concentrated compliance in form of notch flexure hinges and achieve their motion due to bending of the hinges. This contribution presents the non-linear analytical modeling of compliant mechanisms with power function-based notch flexure hinges and their efficient optimization of the elasto-kinematic path-generating properties using MATLAB. Different planar mechanisms are analytically characterized with the theory for large deflections of curved rod-like structures. A verification of the analytical model is exemplified by FEM simulations for a four-hinge Watt mechanism as a point guidance mechanism and for a 12-hinge pantograph mechanism as a plane guidance mechanism. Further, the exponents of the power function contours for each hinge are individually optimized on the example of an Evans and a Roberts mechanism. This is achieved with the goal of minimizing the straight-line deviation of their coupler points realizing a stroke of 10 mm.
