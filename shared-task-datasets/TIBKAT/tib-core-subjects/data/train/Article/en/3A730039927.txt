Gender and Economic Empowerment in Africa
It is time to deliver for women and girls. Africaâ€™s growth and development agenda can only succeed if the continent is able to draw on all its resources and talents, and if women are able to participate fully in economic, social and political life. This will require intensified efforts to eliminate discrimination and promote equal rights. The strong commitment which has been demonstrated by African governments needs to be complemented by strong support from the wider international community, within the framework of a clear allocation of responsibilities, and the clear mapping out of specific steps and measures.
