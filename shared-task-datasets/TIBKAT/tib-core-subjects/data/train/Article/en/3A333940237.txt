Kluwer-EZUL-Testdatensatz (1) : Monte Carlo Simulations of Adsorbed Solutions in Heterogeneous Porous Materials
We present results of a Monte Carlo simulation study of binary mixtures of ethane and methane in silica gel. The molecular model treats the adsorbent as a matrix of silica microspheres. The adsorption isotherms, adsorption selectivities and isosteric heats of adsorption have been determined for these systems. The results are compared with predictions from the ideal adsorbed solution (IAS) theory and with experiment. The heats of adsorption are accurately described by the IAS theory. The adsorption isotherms are accurately described by the IAS theory at low bulk pressure but the IAS theory overpredicts the density at high bulk pressure. This latter effect is opposite to that observed in bulk mixtures of this type where nonidealities generally lead to a density increase on mixing. The pressure dependence of the selectivity does not exhibit a maximum at low pressure. We discuss this effect in terms of the adsorbent microstructure.
