Chapter 89 Intrinsic Motivation in a Public Good Environment
This chapter discusses that the subjects differ in social value orientation as measured in the pre-test. This chapter also describes that the contributions in the first periods of the public good game are positively correlated to the value orientation. The success of social interaction in the public good game inï¬‚uences the orientation towards group members (social ties).is described in this chapter. This chapter states that the subjects in 4-person groups discriminate between group members: a social tie is positively correlated with the contributions of the other. However, most relations are not symmetric. Apparently individual differences in social value orientation and reaction patterns can lead to complex group-dynamics.
