Chapter 47 Preferences and Property Rights in Ultimatum and Dictator Games
The results demonstrated in this chapter quite clearly the impact of property rights on the shared expectations about appropriate proposer behavior in both ultimatum and dictator games.

The norm of equality applies and both players assume that is the operating norm.
