Debt Markets : Policy Challenges in the Post-Crisis Landscape
Discussions at the 11th OECD-WBG-IMF Global Bond Market Forum focused on four key areas: i) the impact of crisis-related measures and the potential implications of exit; ii) the measurement of sovereign risk; iii) the determinants of investor demand; and iv) debt managersâ€™ response to the crisis. Overall, participants felt that the steps taken to stabilise financial conditions had generally been effective and that conditions in financial markets were normalising. However, discussions highlighted a number of ongoing risks including: i) while credible consolidation plans were needed, fiscal and monetary policy would be tightened too soon; ii) managing investor uncertainty would prove critical in managing risk in the near-term; and (iii) regulatory changes might lead to a deterioration in conditions in primary and secondary markets and otherwise aggravate the challenges facing debt managers.
