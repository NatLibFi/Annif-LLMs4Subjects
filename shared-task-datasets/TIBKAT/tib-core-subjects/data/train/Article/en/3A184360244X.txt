VANET-based traffic light management for an emergency vehicle
Wireless communications have affected our lifestyle in the last decades. It is helpful to improve quality of life for communities. Communications among vehicles usually take place in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications are aspects of communications in the transportation which are growing rapidly. They can play a pivotal role in the transportation field. Management of traffic lights (TLs) is crucial to control traffic flow especially at an intersection. The goal of this paper is to manage the TLs at an intersection when an emergency vehicle (EV) is approaching. First, we simulate an intersection which includes TLs via simulation of urban mobility (SUMO). Later, we simulate VANETs communication to manage the TLs at the intersection when the EV is coming with the help of objective modular network testbed in C++ (OMNeT++) and vehicles in network simulation (Veins). Finally, the impact of V2I communication on delivery efficiency of the emergency service is investigated. Simulation results show an improvement in delivery efficiency of the emergency service.
