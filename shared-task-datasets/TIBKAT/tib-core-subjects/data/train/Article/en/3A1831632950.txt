Chapter 57 Differences in the Economic Decisions of Men and Women: Experimental Evidence
This chapter reviews the results from public goods, ultimatum, and dictator experiments for evidence of systematic differences in the behavior of men and women. While the results do not offer consistent evidence of behavioral differences between men and women, there are some intriguing patterns in the data. No significant evidence of systematic differences in the play of men and women is evident in those settings where subjects are exposed to risk. In those settings where risk is absent, systematic differences are revealed. This finding is conditioned by the level of risk.
