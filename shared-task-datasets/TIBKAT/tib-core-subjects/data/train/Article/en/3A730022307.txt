Improving Financial Literacy : Analysis of Issues and Policies
In 2003, the OECD established the Financial Education Project in response to the increasing interest of its member countries in improving the financial literacy of their consumers. Phase one of this project has culminated in the publication of the first major study of financial education at the international level. This book, Improving Financial Literacy: Analysis of Issues and Policies (OECD, 2005, forthcoming), contributes to the development of consumer financial literacy by providing information to policymakers on effective financial education programmes and by facilitating the sharing of experience in the field of financial education and awareness.
