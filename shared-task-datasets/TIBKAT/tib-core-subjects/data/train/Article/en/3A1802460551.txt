Development of user-centred interaction design patterns for the International Data Space
This paper describes a set of methods for the development of user-centred interaction design patterns (IDP) based on the International Data Space (IDS). The IDS is to be understood as a virtual market place where data and products can be bought and sold as well as related contracts concluded. Based on the existing reference model of the IDS, new types of user interfaces (UI) will be created for this purpose. It is important for the developers of the UI’s that the users and the associated core tasks are known, so that the interactions can be designed in a user-friendly interface. IDP’s are intended to support developers in developing applications. The patterns are design patterns and represent proven solutions for frequently occurring problems for the developers when designing the UI. They also provide design alternatives and can effectively support communication between potential end users and developers.
