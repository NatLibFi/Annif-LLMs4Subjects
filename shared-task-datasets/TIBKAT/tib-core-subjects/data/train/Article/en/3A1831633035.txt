Chapter 49 Social Distance and Reciprocity in Dictator Games
This chapter defines various social distances as the degree of reciprocity that people believe is inherent within a social interaction. The greater the social distance, or isolation, between a person and others, the weaker is the scope for reciprocal relations. This chapter conjecture that the FHSS-V treatment defines a minimal increase in the social distance between proposer and recipient, as compared with the FHSS-R treatment. At the other pole, which we use to define the maximal social distance, the experiment is operated double blind, meaning that the procedures make it evident to all subjects that the experimenter, who makes and retains no record of the data by subject name, and any person who subsequently sees the data, can never know who made what decision. The objective of this procedure is to remove all social context in a manner that is transparent to the subjects.
