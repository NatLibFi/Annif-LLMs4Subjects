1. Markets
More than anything else in the history of the development of economic thought, experimental economics is about the extended order of markets whose outcomes are not part of the intentions of the participants. It is accurate to say that markets emerged out of the dim past of social and economic exchange as an inscrutable human social propensity to truck, barter and exchange, rather than to describe them as having been invented. Even today, as in the experimental subfield of economic system design and testing, although invention appears to be prominent initially, all designs are subject to continuous change and adaptation in the light of experience and feedback; first in lab testing, then ongoing in the field. For example, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has a book of rules, consisting of a three ring loose-leaf notebook, symbolizing the persistence of change based on experience that characterizes institutions.
