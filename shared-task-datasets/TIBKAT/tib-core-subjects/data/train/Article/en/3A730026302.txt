Mapping innovative finance for development mechanisms
This article aims to offer an OECD benchmark for regular monitoring and assessment of innovative financing for development (IFD), focusing on the relation of IFD with official development assistance (ODA) and aid effectiveness. This article looks at IFD from the perspective of both policy makers and investors from the public sector who are acting in the wider public interest. It presents coherent, compact and comparable information about various mechanisms that allows them to generate and mobilise new resources for development so that they can leverage other resources through the “catalytic” use of their own funding powers. To do so, this article includes an extensive mapping table that covers a range of IFD mechanisms.
