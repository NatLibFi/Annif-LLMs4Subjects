Chapter 5 Predictive Density Evaluation
This chapter discusses estimation, specification testing, and model selection of predictive density models. In particular, predictive density estimation is briefly discussed, and a variety of different specification and model evaluation tests due to various authors including Christoffersen and Diebold [Christoffersen, P., Diebold, F.X. (2000). “How relevant is volatility forecasting for financial risk management?”. Review of Economics and Statistics 82, 12–22], Diebold, Gunther and Tay [Diebold, F.X., Gunther, T., Tay, A.S.

Extensions of some existing techniques to the case of out-of-sample evaluation are also provided, and asymptotic results associated with these extensions are outlined.
