Chapter 106 The Recognition Heuristic and the Less-Is-More Effect
This chapter focuses on the recognition heuristic and the less is the more effect. Instead of being unboundedly rational, it is ecologically rational, that is, reasonable with respect to some environments but not others. There are domains in which the recognition heuristic will not work. A wise organism will only apply the rule in domains where recognition is strongly correlated with the criterion. (If this correlation is negative, then the rule should be reversed, and the unrecognized object should be chosen.) There are situations in which the recognition heuristic cannot be applied, for instance, when all objects are recognized. There are domains in which people will not apply it, for example, when they suspect that they are being asked a trick question. And there will be individual differences: different people use different heuristics at different times.
