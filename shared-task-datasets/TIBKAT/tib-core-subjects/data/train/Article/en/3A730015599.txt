Investment: Unlocking Africa's Potential
It is now time to invest in Africa. The prospects are good. Africa is already attracting growing flows of private resources, as a result of its greater political stability and economic reforms. Significant new investors are now engaging in Africa, from within and outside the continent. Development assistance and debt relief alone will not be sufficient to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Africa now needs more and sustainable investment, both domestic and foreign, in order to accelerate economic growth and progress in poverty reduction, and become better integrated into the global economy. We call for the fulfilment of commitments made at African and G8 Summits and other global fora, including support from development partners to help Africa mobilise more investment, and better focus on mobilisible domestic revenue sources and indigenous resources. Areas such as infrastructure, extractive industry, tourism, agribusiness and ICT are particularly important drivers of development, and require support from development partners.
