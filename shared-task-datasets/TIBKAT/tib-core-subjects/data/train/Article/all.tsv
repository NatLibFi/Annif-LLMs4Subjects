Schäden durch Pilze an Fachwerkgebäuden ¤ "Fachwerke sind besonders an den stark bewitterten Fassaden aufgrund der großen Anzahl von feuchtevariablen Fugen durch holzzerstörende Pilze bedroht; andere Bereiche des Fachwerks, oder auch Gefahren durch holzzerstörende Insekten, sollen hier nicht betrachtet werden."	<gnd:4004927-9> <gnd:4404729-0> <gnd:4046076-9> <gnd:4049600-4> <gnd:4071095-6> <gnd:4011455-7> <gnd:4025741-1>

Modellierung sektorenübergreifender Systemdienstleistungen bei gekoppelt betriebenem Strom- und Gassektor ¤ Aufgrund der steigenden Einspeisung elektrischer Leistung durch erneuerbare Energieanlagen und der gleichzeitig voranschreitenden schrittweisen Abschaltung von konventionellen Kohlekraftwerken, steigen die Anforderungen an eine zuverlässige, kostengünstige und klimafreundliche Bereitstellung von Flexibilitäten zum Erhalt der Systemstabilität. Mit der Gesamtsystembetrachtung aus Strom- und Gassektor können durch die Kopplung neue Freiheitsgrade erschlossen werden. In diesem Beitrag wird vorgestellt, wie eine sektorenübergreifende Erbringung von Systemdienstleistungen vom Strom- zum Gasnetz in einem dynamischen Energiesystemmodell im Zeitbereich der Mittelzeitdynamik abgebildet werden kann. Anhand von numerischen Fallstudien wird am Beispiel von Thüringen für verschiedene Szenarien ausgewertet, inwiefern durch eine sektorenübergreifende Betrachtung Flexibilitätspotenziale realisiert und die Betriebsgrenzen und somit die Stabilitätsbedingungen beider Sektoren eingehalten werden können.	<gnd:4068598-6>
Optimierung eines parametrischen Fundamentalmodells zur Kraftwerkseinsatzplanung ¤ Die Strompreisprognose stellt eine wichtige sehr Eingangsgröße für die Optimierung der eigenen Position am Strommarkt dar. Mit ihrer Hilfe lassen sich Handelserlöse vergrößern und Risiken minimieren. Für die Prognose kommen dabei verschiedene Verfahren zum Einsatz. Eine Modellierungsmethode sind die sogenannten Fundamentalmodelle (FM). In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird ein neuer Ansatz vorgeschlagen und untersucht, der einen Beitrag zur Verbesserung der Prognosegüte von datensparsamen FM leistet. Diese Verbesserung betrifft insbesondere die Güte des zu prognostizierenden Kraftwerkseinsatzes, welcher eine signifikante Zwischengröße bei der Strompreisprognose mit FM darstellt. Die Arbeit ist folgendermaßen aufgebaut: Abschnitt 1 liefert eine kurze Einführung und Übersicht zum Thema der Strompreisprognose. Der Abschnitt 2 erläutert das Funktionsprinzip eines FM, bevor im Abschnitt 3 das weiterentwickelte Modell beschrieben wird. Im Abschnitt 4 werden die Ergebnisse einer exemplarischen Untersuchung vorgestellt und in Abschnitt 5 evaluiert.	<gnd:4068598-6>
Simulationsbasiertes Deep Reinforcement Learning für Modulare Produktionssysteme ¤ Modulare Produktionssysteme sollen die traditionelle Fließbandproduktion in der Automobilindustrie ablösen. Die Idee dabei ist, dass sich hochgradig individualisierte Produkte dynamisch und autonom durch ein System flexibler Arbeitsstationen bewegen können. Dieser Ansatz stellt hohe Anforderungen an die Planung und Organisation solcher Systeme. Da jedes Produkt seinen Weg durch das System frei und individuell bestimmen kann, kann die Implementierung von Regeln und Heuristiken, die die Flexibilität des Systems zur Leistungssteigerung ausnutzen, in diesem dynamischen Umfeld schwierig sein. Transportaufgaben werden in der Regel von fahrerlosen Transportsystemen (FTS) ausgeführt. Daher bietet die Integration von KI-basierten Steuerungslogiken eine vielversprechende Alternative zu manuell implementierten Entscheidungsregeln für den Betrieb der FTS. In diesem Beitrag wird ein Ansatz für den Einsatz von Reinforcement Learning (RL) in Kombination mit Simulation vorgestellt, um FTS in modularen Produktionssystemen zu steuern. Darüber hinaus werden Untersuchungen zu dessen Flexibilität und Skalierbarkeit durchgeführt.	<gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4055072-2> <gnd:4059205-4>

The Ending of the Multi-Fibre Agreement and Innovation in the Sri Lankan Textile and Clothing Industry ¤ This case study analyses the effect that the end of the Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) has had on innovation in the Sri Lankan textile and clothing sector. The ending of the quota system under the MFA led to an increase in the US and EU markets which has motivated a large number of innovations in the Sri Lankan textile and clothing sector. Some large companies have become a total services provider, while others are trying to establish their own brands. Product innovations with foreign partners, process innovations such as introduction of CAD/CAM, and various marketing and organisational innovations have been implemented.

Chapter 100 The Endowment Effect: Evidence of Losses Valued More than Gains ¤ The early empirical evidence of a wide disparity between people's valuations of gains and losses appeared in results of contingent valuation studies in which respondents were asked both how much they would be willing to pay to prevent a loss of an environmental or other amenity, and what sum they would demand to accept its loss. The results of experiments testing people's valuations of gains and losses have been consistent in showing that individuals value losses far more than otherwise fully commensurate gains. This leads to smaller gains from trade and fewer voluntary market transactions than would be the case with valuation equivalence. The valuation disparity also suggests greater caution in assessing welfare losses, predicting market outcomes, and may well imply different policy designs.	<gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8>
Chapter 9 The Performance of Double-Auction and Posted-Offer Markets with Advance Production ¤ This chapter summarizes the price performance of double-auction and posted-offer markets generated in 120 laboratory sessions and more than 1800 trading periods. It shows that the mean contract price differences between double auction and posted offer institutions, which are common in production-to-demand markets, narrow with production in advance of sale. Furthermore, the consideration of inventory carryover in advanceproduction markets results in a further reduction of contract prices. At this point, price performance differences between the two trading institutions disappear. The efficiency of the posted-offer institution is improved significantly, however, if sellers are permitted a second price posting in each trading period. Although this is very different from the continuous price posting and contract formation by both buyers and sellers characteristic of the double-auction institution, it ultimately leads to comparable efficiency levels in both double-auction and posted-offer markets when production is in advance of sale, inventories may be carried from period to period, and traders are experienced.	<gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4124477-1>
Residential Energy Demand ¤ This paper provides a concise review of the empirical literature on residential energy demand. It also discusses the findings in the reviewed literature and their implications for the choice of policy instruments. While there is a plethora of studies on the technical possibilities, i.e. the potential energy savings that new technologies allow, it is plain that energy consumption also depends on our attitudes, preferences and income as well as relative prices1. Therefore, this review is based on the idea that energy demand is essentially driven by human behaviour and our main task is then to explore a range of empirical evidence that sheds useful light on our limited objective. Indeed, the literature on energy demand is impressively rich; already in the early years of the 1980s there were more than 2 500 papers available on this topic (Joerges, 1988 cited in Weber, undated). This brief review will focus mainly on the economics domain, a limitation to be true, although pointers will be given to findings in related fields.	<gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4113450-3>
Gender and Economic Empowerment in Africa ¤ It is time to deliver for women and girls. Africa’s growth and development agenda can only succeed if the continent is able to draw on all its resources and talents, and if women are able to participate fully in economic, social and political life. This will require intensified efforts to eliminate discrimination and promote equal rights. The strong commitment which has been demonstrated by African governments needs to be complemented by strong support from the wider international community, within the framework of a clear allocation of responsibilities, and the clear mapping out of specific steps and measures.	<gnd:4113450-3> <gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4066493-4>
Chapter 14. Variable Selection in Predictive Regressions ¤ This chapter reviews methods for selecting empirically relevant predictors from a set of N potentially relevant ones for the purpose of forecasting a scalar time series. First, criterion-based procedures in the conventional case when N is small relative to the sample size, T , are reviewed. Then the large N case is covered. Regularization and dimension reduction methods are then discussed. Irrespective of the model size, there is an unavoidable tension between prediction accuracy and consistent model determination. Simulations are used to compare selected methods from the perspective of relative risk in one period ahead forecasts.	<gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4047390-9> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4059787-8>
Guarantee Arrangements for Financial Promises : How Widely Should the Safety Net be Cast? ¤ Guarantees have become the preferred instrument to address many financial policy objectives. The incidence of financial sector guarantee arrangements that address specific policy objectives, such as supporting financial stability, protecting consumers and influencing credit allocations, has increased markedly over the past decades and additional schemes are under consideration. This report identifies considerations regarding consistency and affordability that policymakers should take into account before introducing additional guarantee arrangements. One of them is that the safety net cannot be expanded without limits. In fact, as regards the strength of the net of government-supported guarantees for financial promises, the wider that net is cast (without altering its other key parameters), the thinner it becomes.	<gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4068097-6>
Novel approaches for measuring and predicting particulate emissions from automotive brakes and tires ¤ Traffic-related emissions are strongly criticised by the public because they con-tribute to climate change and are classified as hazardous to health. Combustion engine emissions have been regulated by limit values for almost three decades. There is currently no legal limit for non-exhaust emissions, which include par-ticulate brake and tire wear and resuspension. As a result, the percentage of total vehicle emissions has risen continuously. Since some of the particles can be as-signed to the size classes of particulate matter (≤ 10 µm), these sources of par-ticulate matter are of particular relevance to human health. To predict the amount of particles emitted as a function of the driving situation or driving condition, a comprehensive database must be prepared and transferred to a prediction model. This makes it possible to simulate environmental pollution in multivalent traffic scenarios. At present, no approaches have been described in the literature by whose application the emission indicators can be effectively pre-dicted. Furthermore, the mechanisms of brake and tire particle formation are as-sociated with highly stochastic phenomena that cannot be captured by traditional deterministic modelling tools. Therefore, machine learning algorithms are used in the present work to identify branched correlations between tribological properties, pad composition and operating conditions. Different experimental methods are presented to determine brake and tire particle emission models. In addition, an approach is presented which reduces the amount of emitted parti-cles on the basis of a situation-dependent driving condition control, especially with regard to future semi-autonomous and autonomous mobility systems.	<gnd:4153583-2> <gnd:4165423-7>
The surge in borrowing needs of OECD governments : Revised estimates for 2009 and 2010 Outlook ¤ OECD governments are facing ongoing, unprecedented challenges in raising smoothly large volumes of funds at lowest possible cost, while balancing refinancing-, repricing- and interest rate risks. Amidst continued uncertainty about the pace of recovery as well as the timing and sequencing of the steps of the exit strategy, gross borrowing needs of OECD governments are expected to reach almost USD 16 trillion in 2009, up from an earlier estimate of around USD 12 trillion. The tentative outlook for 2010 shows a stabilising borrowing picture at around the level of USD 16 trillion. A looming additional challenge is the risk that when the recovery gains traction, yields will start to rise. Although there are signs that issuance conditions are becoming tougher, most OECD debt managers have been successful in financing the surge in funding needs. Less successful auctions can therefore best be interpreted as “single market events” and not as unambiguous evidence of systemic market absorption problems. The future could become more challenging though, given that rising issuance is occurring in tandem with increasing overall debt levels and debt service costs. In response, sovereign debt managers, with the essential support of the fiscal authorities, need to implement a timely and credible medium-term exit strategy to avoid future "crowding out" and systemic issuance problems, while reducing government borrowing costs.	<gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4067488-5>
Chapter 1 Computable general equilibrium modelling for policy analysis and forecasting ¤ This chapter describes computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling and the history of its development. The chapter illustrates the computation of solutions for CGE models and reviews its achievements, failures, and potential. The model illustrated in the chapter can be used in two ways: as a single-period model suitable for comparativestatic analyses; and as a model for multi-period forecasting. Before CGE models, there were inputoutput models that emphasized inputoutput linkages among industries. CGE models go beyond inputoutput models by linking industries via economy-wide constraints including constraints on the size of government budget deficits; constraints on deficits in the balance of trade; constraints on the availability of labor, capital, and land; and constraints arising from environmental considerations, such as air and water quality. Much of CGE modeling has been concerned with the welfare implications of proposed policy changesfor example, changes in protection, changes in taxes, and changes in environmental regulations. Many interesting welfare results have been obtained, especially in the analysis of tax changes.	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4011152-0> <gnd:4112736-5>
Chapter 77 Pre-testing International Climate Change Policies: Methods and Results ¤ A subset of the world's countries may wish to commit themselves to stringent emission targets in an attempt to inﬂuence other countries to follow suit, thereby bringing about a significant reduction in the threat to the global climate. Moreover, if the pioneering countries were to connect a tradable quota system to these commitments, they would be in a position to provide information not only about the practicability and efficiency properties of this policy instrument but also about the general economic implications of the commitments made. If the set of countries were small, which seems quite likely in the case of pioneering agreements, this action could reveal, in particular, how efficient a small market for quota trade would be. Furthermore, it could also show, for a set of similarly developed countries as the only participants, whether the common presumption that their costs would be too similar for any significant amount of trade gains to arise were in fact correct.	<gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4252654-1>
Chapter 4. Assessment and Estimation of Risk Preferences ¤ This chapter surveys the rapidly growing literature in which risk preferences are measured and manipulated in laboratory and field experiments. The most commonly used measurement instruments are: an investment task for allocations between a safe and risky asset, a choice menu task for eliciting probability indifference points, and a pricing task for eliciting certainty equivalents of a lottery. These methods are compared in a manner that will help the practitioner decide which one to use, and how to deal with methodological issues associated with incentives, stakes, and the structure of choice menus. Applications involve using inferred risk preferences to document demographic effects, e.g. gender, and to explain the effects of risk aversion on observed behavior in economic in settings, e.g. bargaining, auctions, and contests. Some suggestions for evaluating the separate effects of utility curvature and probability weighting are provided.	<gnd:4070864-0> <gnd:4135592-1> <gnd:4186957-6> <gnd:4050133-4> <gnd:4120934-5>
Peace and Security in Africa ¤ More action is needed, by both Africa and the wider international community. Building peace and security is essential, both for economic development and for poverty reduction. Leadership is being taken by Africa itself. The number of conflicts has fallen. But even so, one-fifth of the population of Africa still live in conflict zones. More action is needed both to strengthen and support Africa’s own efforts to bring peace to the continent, and to tackle the wider global drivers of conflict, including the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, and the trade in conflict resources.	<gnd:4113450-3> <gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4066493-4>
Chapter 10. Experimental Evaluations of Policy Instruments ¤ Experimental methods have recently been used to evaluate environmental policy instruments, in particular – and most suitably, it seems – emissions trading programs of various designs. Some studies have focused on domestic emissions trading programs, while others have focused on international programs, in particular ones related to greenhouse gases. Much emphasis has been put on investigating the implications of market power in emissions trading. Other topics of the experimental studies reviewed here include the relative merits of different policy instruments (permits, taxes, standards), and the possibility of eliminating the need for conventional environmental policy through application of the Coase theorem.	<gnd:4061619-8> <gnd:4075236-7> <gnd:4061638-1> <gnd:4078523-3> <gnd:4164199-1>
Improving Financial Literacy : Analysis of Issues and Policies ¤ In 2003, the OECD established the Financial Education Project in response to the increasing interest of its member countries in improving the financial literacy of their consumers. Phase one of this project has culminated in the publication of the first major study of financial education at the international level. This book, Improving Financial Literacy: Analysis of Issues and Policies (OECD, 2005, forthcoming), contributes to the development of consumer financial literacy by providing information to policymakers on effective financial education programmes and by facilitating the sharing of experience in the field of financial education and awareness.	<gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4073788-3>
The interaction between the ship repair, ship conversion and shipbuilding industries ¤ Shipyards can undertake a variety of activities, not all related to the construction of new vessels. While there are yards that are largely dedicated to new buildings, and others dedicated to ship repair and maintenance, in practice that distinction is blurred, as both activities can be undertaken in most yards. This report examines the interaction between these yards, in particular how feasible it is for yards to move from one activity to the other, or perhaps to engage in both at the same time. The relevance of this is that if there are few barriers for yards to move between activities, then this will have an impact on the availability of shipbuilding capacity to meet expansions or contractions of new-building demand.	<gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4113450-3>
Lessons from the financial market turmoil : Challenges ahead for the financial industry and policy makers ¤ This financial crisis, ending a period of search for yield and increased risktaking,has triggered various policy responses, ranging from more ad-hoc measures initially to more structured and co-ordinated financial sector rescue actions as the crisis evolved. Lessons drawn so far should help to devise longer-term, more encompassing and more consistent policies. Various reforms are being proposed by the financial industry as well as by official authorities and international standard-setting bodies, many of which arrive at similar conclusions regarding the causes of and remedies for the crisis. Shortcomings in risk management, including compensation schemes, governance structures, liquidity and counterparty risk, need to be addressed.	<gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4068097-6>
Chapter 6 Fairness and Short Run Price Adjustment in Posted Offer Markets ¤ This chapter hypothesizes that any short-run failure of markets to clear depends upon buyers knowing that increased profits result from higher prices. In the absence of this knowledge buyers may give in quickly to the equilibrating tendencies of the market. The chapter suggests that fairness' in our context is best characterized as affecting agent expectations and not their utility functions. That is, buyers feel that price increases resulting from cost increases should not produce higher profits for sellers. Sellers, accepting this norm of fair treatment, do not initially attempt to raise prices and extract higher profit. In the absence of obtaining utility from being fair, over time, sellers gradually raise prices and reap higher profits. This adaptation to a higher price is due to the competitive behavior of both buyers and sellers. Some buyers realize that there are gains (higher consumer surplus) from trade from buying at slightly higher prices.	<gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4252654-1>
Chapter 27. Generational Policy and Aging in Closed and Open Dynamic General Equilibrium Models ¤ This chapter examines the micro- and macroeconomic effects of generational policies using closed and open general equilibrium dynamic life-cycle models. The models illustrate the broad array of demographic, economic, and policy issues that can be simultaneously incorporated within todays computable models of economic growth. The list includes country-specific tax, spending, social security, healthcare policy, deficit policy age-cohort- and country-specific mortality, age-specific fertility, age-specific morbidity, lifespan uncertainty, age- and skill-specific emigration and immigration, earnings inequality driven by skill differences and idiosyncratic labor earnings uncertainty, capital adjustment costs, international trade, international capital flows, trade specialization, and trade policy. The chapter begins with the benchmark dynamic overlapping generations (OLG) simulation model of Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987), discusses various advances in OLG simulation modeling and then presents two applications. The first is a closed-economy model, calibrated for Germany, that features idiosyncratic labor earnings uncertainty and changes in demographics. After running the model through a number of policy simulations, we turn to an open-economy model, featuring five regions (the US, Europe, Japan and other Asian countries, China, and India) producing six goods, some of which are traded. We use this model to quantify how economies will transition over time, how wage inequality will evolve, how tax rates will change in light of societal aging and how various unilateral and multilateral policy reforms impact the six regions.	<gnd:4079351-5> <gnd:4224214-9> <gnd:4210294-7> <gnd:4065341-9> <gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4066493-4>
Chapter 98 Intertemporal Choice under Habit Formation ¤ The fundamental question addressed in this research is the degree to which models of optimal intertemporal choice are good descriptions of non-interactive individual intertemporal behavior in the presence of habit formation. The existence of loss avoidance does, however, not explain why subjects consume too much in the first few periods. This chapter conjecture that overconsumption during the first periods is driven by cognitive limitations. If subjects are unable to compute the aggregate present value of future costs which is associated with each level of consumption, they face a form of subjective uncertainty. Hence, psychologically relevant features of the decision problem play an important role. This chapter also presents the fact that the present benefits of consumption are relatively large, immediately available, and thus unambiguously given is likely to be of psychological relevance because it renders present benefits highly salient.	<gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4015999-1>
The SME Financing Gap: Theory and Evidence ¤ Many commentators have postulated a “financing gap” for small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs), meaning that there are significant numbers of SMEs that could use funds productively if they were available, but cannot obtain finance from the formal financial system. This article summarises an OECD report (OECD, 2006) on this topic which seeks to determine how prevalent such a gap may be – both in OECD countries and non-member economies – and recommends measures to foster an improved flow of financing to SMEs.	<gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4073788-3>
Chapter 89 Intrinsic Motivation in a Public Good Environment ¤ This chapter discusses that the subjects differ in social value orientation as measured in the pre-test. This chapter also describes that the contributions in the first periods of the public good game are positively correlated to the value orientation. The success of social interaction in the public good game inﬂuences the orientation towards group members (social ties).is described in this chapter. This chapter states that the subjects in 4-person groups discriminate between group members: a social tie is positively correlated with the contributions of the other. However, most relations are not symmetric. Apparently individual differences in social value orientation and reaction patterns can lead to complex group-dynamics.	<gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4139716-2>
Systemic Financial Crises : How to Fund Resolution ¤ Systemic financial crises are a recurrent phenomenon, and despite regulatory efforts they are likely to occur again. This report compares the ex ante funding of deposit insurance schemes in a selection of countries, highlighting the “funding gap” left by these arrangements in the recent systemic financial crisis. To fill that gap, different approaches have been adopted across countries in the recent crisis. Where support for the financial sector was provided as part of policy response to the crisis, new taxes have been adopted to generate revenues ex post, although the specific approaches have differed. While there is no single solution in this regard, this report finds that ex ante funded systemic crisis resolution funds, together with strengthened failure resolution powers, are in principle adequate to help fill the gap.

Chapter 13. Electric Power Markets in Transition: Agent-Based Modeling Tools for Transactive Energy Support ¤ Electric power systems consist of large numbers of heterogeneous participants interacting within an intricate layered network of economic and operational relationships. Decision-making in these systems has been extensively decentralized in many industrialized countries over the past twenty years in an attempt to increase their reliability and efficiency. Given the high negative impact of power disruptions, these decentralization efforts have typically been preceded by extensive sensitivity studies with empirically-based computational models. This chapter discusses the current and potential use of agent-based computational modeling to develop novel transactive energy system (TES) designs for electric power systems. TES designs are decentralized market-based designs that permit electric power systems to operate more fully in accordance with basic economic principles while maintaining overall system reliability and efficiency.	<gnd:4112736-5> <gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4132280-0>
Chapter 10. Environmental Risk and Uncertainty ¤ Environmental risks may comprise the most important policy-related application of the economics of risk and uncertainty. Many biases in risk assessment and regulation, such as the conservatism bias in risk assessment and the stringent regulation of synthetic chemicals, reflect a form of ambiguity aversion. Nevertheless, there is evidence that people can learn from warnings and risk information, such as Toxics Release Inventory data, consistent with Bayesian models. The fundamental uncertainties with respect to environmental risks are coupled with irreversibilities, making sequential decisions and adaptive behavior desirable. Uncertainties over the benefits and costs of mitigating environmental risks pose challenges for any regulator, but insights drawn from the instrument choice literature can inform the design and implementation of welfare-maximizing environmental pollution control policies. The problem of mitigating climate change risks motivates a series of illustrations of how uncertainty affects policy.	<gnd:4186957-6> <gnd:4050133-4> <gnd:4135592-1> <gnd:4070864-0> <gnd:4120934-5>
Chapter 14 Valuing the Environment as a Factor of Production ¤ This chapter explores the theory and practice of measuring the economic costs and benefits of environmental changes that influence production, both in the context of firms and of households. The theory uses models of household and firm decision making to map the influence of environmental changes to changes in human welfare. The goal is to measure, by compensating or equivalent changes in incomes, the welfare effects on people, in their roles as owners of firms, owners of factors of production, and consumers. The developing country context is most common for valuing the environment as an input, because agriculture and natural resource extraction are so much more important than in industrialized countries. When households or firms produce goods for sale on the market, and the environment influences the costs of production, we show the circumstances when one can use information embodied in the supply curve of the marketed good or the demand curve for an input into the production of the good to extract welfare measures for environmental change. When the environment affects the cost of production of goods households produce and consume, we show the restrictions on production technology that will permit welfare measure for changes in the environment. We also look at circumstances that permit the calculations of bounds for the exact welfare measures. We explore welfare measurement under a variety of institutional structures, including government support for agricultural commodities and open-access fisheries. Exact welfare measurement makes extensive demands for data. Because these demands are not often met in practice, researchers resort to a variety of approximations of welfare measures. We assess these approximations, comparing them with the more exact measures.	<gnd:4061616-2> <gnd:4006340-9> <gnd:4061638-1>
Chapter 5. Contribution of Computable General Equilibrium Modeling to Policy Formulation in Developing Countries ¤ This chapter reviews the experience of computable general equilibrium (CGE) models from the perspective of how they have, or have not, influenced public policy in developing countries. The paper describes different classes of empirical models from small, stylized to large, multisectoral applied models; from static equilibrium models to dynamic, perfect-foresight models and identifies the characteristics of models best suited to address different policy problems in developing countries. The paper then discusses the different ways CGE models have been and are being used in policy formulation, the types of questions they have addressed, and the lessons learned from past experience. Finally, the paper suggests that, in light of the changing nature of policy making in developing countries, in the future CGE models should be used differently, moving from a purely technocratic exercise used by policy makers to providing an accessible empirical framework that can contribute to a widespread public debate.	<gnd:4210294-7> <gnd:4065341-9> <gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4224214-9> <gnd:4079351-5> <gnd:4358095-6>
Chapter 11. Technological change and the Environment ¤ Environmental policy discussions increasingly focus on issues related to technological change. This is partly because the environmental consequences of social activity are frequently affected by the rate and direction of technological change, and partly because environmental policy interventions can themselves create constraints and incentives that have significant effects on the path of technological progress. This chapter summarizes current thinking on technological change in the broader economics literature, surveys the growing economic literature on the interaction between technology and the environment, and explores the normative implications of these analyses. We begin with a brief overview of the economics of technological change, and then examine theory and empirical evidence on invention, innovation, and diffusion and the related literature on the effects of environmental policy on the creation of new, environmentally friendly technology. We conclude with suggestions for further research on technological change and the environment.	<gnd:4061619-8> <gnd:4078523-3> <gnd:4164199-1> <gnd:4061638-1> <gnd:4075236-7>
Chapter 16. Copula Methods for Forecasting Multivariate Time Series ¤ Copula-based models provide a great deal of flexibility in modeling multivariate distributions, allowing the researcher to specify the models for the marginal distributions separately from the dependence structure (copula) that links them to form a joint distribution. In addition to flexibility, this often also facilitates estimation of the model in stages, reducing the computational burden. This chapter reviews the growing literature on copula-based models for economic and financial time series data, and discusses in detail methods for estimation, inference, goodness-of-fit testing, and model selection that are useful when working with these models. A representative data set of two daily equity index returns is used to illustrate all of the main results.	<gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4047390-9> <gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4059787-8>
Chapter 15. A Global Approach to Energy andtheEnvironment : The G-Cubed Model ¤ G-Cubed is a multi-country, multi-sector, intertemporal general equilibrium model that has been used to study a variety of policies in the areas of environmental regulation, tax reform, monetary and fiscal policy, and international trade. It is designed to bridge the gaps between three areas of research econometric general equilibrium modeling, international trade theory, and modern macroeconomics by incorporating the best features of each. This chapter describes the theoretical and empirical structure of the model, summarizes its applications and contributions to the literature, and discusses two example applications in detail.	<gnd:4210294-7> <gnd:4065341-9> <gnd:4079351-5> <gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4224214-9> <gnd:4066493-4>
Fostering Long-term Investment and Economic Growth Summary of a High-Level OECD Financial Roundtable ¤ As the OECD is celebrating its 50th anniversary, member countries are exiting from the biggest post-war financial and economic crisis and are trying to put their economies back onto strong, sustainable footing. While financial reforms should provide for a better, more sustainable balance between stability and growth, measures to strengthen the savings-investment channel should foster sustainable growth and development. These issues were explored at a High-Level OECD Financial Roundtable and are summarised in this article. Covered are the topics of financial reform to foster stability and long-term growth, the contribution of institutional investors to long-term growth, and creating a better environment for the financing of business innovation and green growth. With strained public sector finances, private capital needs to fill the funding gap for infrastructure and other long-term projects. Appropriate regulatory incentives to overcome short-termism, as well as risk-sharing arrangements e.g. via publicprivate partnerships, are needed in order to encourage market-based, long-term investment and risk capital financing. Better transparency, information and investor education can also play a role in enhancing long-term savings and investment.	<gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4067488-5>
Trade and Innovation : A Synthesis ¤ This study examines the role of trade and investment in technology transfer, the effects of competition in trade and investment on innovation, and economies of scale. It also examines global value chains as an organisational innovation in its own right, which is supported by a freer trade and investment environment.

Chapter 2. Rationality and Dynamic Consistency Under Risk and Uncertainty ¤ For choice with deterministic consequences, the standard rationality hypothesis is ordinality, i.e., maximization of a weak preference ordering. For choice under risk (resp. uncertainty), preferences are assumed to be represented by the objectively (resp. subjectively) expected value of a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function. For choice under risk, this implies a key independence axiom; under uncertainty, it implies some version of Savage’s sure-thing principle. This chapter investigates the extent to which ordinality, independence, and the sure thing principle can be derived from more fundamental axioms concerning behavior in decision trees. Following Cubitt (1996) , these principles include dynamic consistency, separability, and reduction of sequential choice, which can be derived in turn from one consequentialist hypothesis applied to continuation subtrees as well as entire decision trees. Examples of behavior violating these principles are also reviewed, as are possible explanations of why such violations are often observed in experiments.	<gnd:4120934-5> <gnd:4070864-0> <gnd:4135592-1> <gnd:4186957-6> <gnd:4050133-4>
Chapter 48 Prompting Strategic Reasoning Increases Other-regarding Behavior ¤ The current cultural norms with regard to sharing, cooperation, trust, and punishment are the result of 23 million years of evolution and adaptation. During most of those 23 million years, humans lived in small interactive groups and developed behaviors and strategies to promote cooperation and social exchange within the group. Within such groups, humans were expected to share with one another and to cooperate to advance the group. This is clear in contemporary studies of extant huntergatherer societies. Today, experimental subjects bring many of the same behaviors and strategies to the laboratories. This results in far more cooperative and sharing behavior in first-time decisions than standard game theory would predict. Prompting not only does not help; it makes the results once again like what are observe in the random/divide treatment, the treatment that started so many psychologists and economists wondering about the standard economics rationality assumption.	<gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4066528-8>
Chapter 11. Prediction Markets for Economic Forecasting ¤ Prediction markets – markets used to forecast future events – have been used to accurately forecast the outcome of political contests, sporting events, and, occasionally, economic outcomes. This chapter summarizes the latest research on prediction markets in order to further their utilization by economic forecasters. We show that prediction markets have a number of attractive features: they quickly incorporate new information, are largely efficient, and are impervious to manipulation. Moreover, markets generally exhibit lower statistical errors than professional forecasters and polls. Finally, we show how markets can be used to both uncover the economic model behind forecasts, as well as test existing economic models.	<gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4066399-1>
Chapter 7. Regional Computable General Equilibrium Modeling ¤ Over the past three decades the field of regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling has flourished, growing from a handful of top-down, single-region and low-dimensioned multiregional models, to a mature field, in which output of large-scale general-purpose multiregional CGE models has become a standard input to policy deliberations in a growing number of countries. Researchers have ensured that innovations in theory, data construction and model application have matched growth in both computing power and the appetite of government decision makers for expanding levels of policy-relevant regional and sectoral detail. This chapter focuses on the development of the field, its current state, and its accomplishments in elucidating important research questions and policy issues in regional economics. We begin by discussing the development of regional CGE modeling as a subdiscipline of CGE modeling, expanding on the distinguishing attributes of regional CGE models. We then discuss policy applications of regional CGE models, demonstrating the power of such models to answer important policy questions and providing an application-driven motivation for our discussion of the innovations in the field. We consider the key theoretical features of multiregional CGE models, identifying the many ways researchers have modeled the behavior of economic agents in a multiregional context. The paucity of data at the regional level suitable for CGE modeling has long been a constraint and so we discuss methods for populating a multiregional models database. We then undertake simulations with a large-scale CGE model and show how output of the model can be communicated in a way that does not presume knowledge of the details of the underlying model. We note that effective communication of the results of regional CGE modeling studies, based on a correct interpretation of the model mechanisms which underlie them, is a prerequisite for its acceptance in policy circles.	<gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4210294-7> <gnd:4224214-9> <gnd:4065341-9> <gnd:4079351-5> <gnd:4066493-4>
Chapter 18 The Classical Experiments on Cournot Oligopoly ¤ The oligopolistic market used in Fouraker and Siegel's experiments is as simple as it can be, the purpose comparing the results of two treatments is clearly stated, while the problems confronted and the solutions applied are not different from today's. It is instructive to note how in a matter of a few years, simplification is preferred to realism. In Fouraker and Siegel, firms are identical one-person onedecision units, and the inverse demand function is linear in current quantities. Clearly, the purpose of Fouraker and Siegel's experiments was to study human behavior, not to decipher the complexities of oligopolistic markets or the behavior of complex organizations. Fouraker and Siegel view oligopolies as an example of human conflict between cooperation and defection. Their goal is to infer useful generalizations from the experiments of the effects of information conditions on the resolution of this conflict. While Fouraker and Siegel also consider Bertrand competition, we focus here on their symmetric Cournot games, with subjects randomly and anonymously matched at the start of the experiment deciding the amount of output they bring to the market. The market is characterized by a linear demand function, while marginal costs are zero at all output levels, and there are no fixed costs.	<gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8>
Chapter 14. Modeling a Heterogeneous World ¤ This chapter takes as its starting point the idea that any model of the economy must have heterogeneous agents. Such agents together form a complex adaptive system where the aggregate behavior emerges from the interaction between the individuals. Such systems do not lend themselves to being modeled analytically. We use three examples to illustrate how one is obliged to use agent based models to capture the dynamics of such systems. For our first example, the Marseille fish market, we show how to move beyond the most simplistic theoretical model we have to move to a computational approach. We then look at the effect of a potential shock to a financial market, and finally at the heterogeneity of the financial system. The last two expose the futility of trying to develop a complete analytical model. We argue for specific models for specific cases. This is a more engineering approach but perhaps a more realistic one.	<gnd:4112736-5> <gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4132280-0>
Mapping innovative finance for development mechanisms ¤ This article aims to offer an OECD benchmark for regular monitoring and assessment of innovative financing for development (IFD), focusing on the relation of IFD with official development assistance (ODA) and aid effectiveness. This article looks at IFD from the perspective of both policy makers and investors from the public sector who are acting in the wider public interest. It presents coherent, compact and comparable information about various mechanisms that allows them to generate and mobilise new resources for development so that they can leverage other resources through the “catalytic” use of their own funding powers. To do so, this article includes an extensive mapping table that covers a range of IFD mechanisms.	<gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4113450-3>

Chapter 20. Advances in Forecast Evaluation ¤ This chapter surveys recent developments in the evaluation of point forecasts. Taking West’s (2006) survey as a starting point, we briefly cover the state of the literature as of the time of West’s writing. We then focus on recent developments, including advancements in the evaluation of forecasts at the population level (based on true, unknown model coefficients), the evaluation of forecasts in the infinite sample (based on estimated model coefficients), and the evaluation of conditional versus unconditional forecasts. We present original results in a few subject areas: the optimization of power in determining the split of a sample into in-sample and out-of-sample portions; whether the accuracy of inference in evaluation of multi-step forecasts can be improved with judicious choice of heteroskedasticity-and-autocorrelation estimator (it can); and the extension of West’s (1996) theory results for population-level, unconditional forecast evaluation to the case of conditional forecast evaluation.	<gnd:4047390-9> <gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4059787-8>
Chapter 61 Logit Equilibrium Models of Anomalous Behavior: What to do when the Nash Equilibrium Says One Thing and the Data Say Something Else ¤ Every experimentalist will sooner or later come across a situation in which results from initial baseline treatments conform nicely to the Nash equilibrium, but subsequent changes in parameters push the data in ways not predicted by Nash. This may happen when one begins by giving theory its best shot, reserving stress tests for later. Such tests often involve changing a parameter that, on the basis of intuition, is likely to alter behavior, but which has no effect on the Nash equilibrium. The dilemma is based on a situation in which two vacationers have purchased identical objects, which are then lost on the ﬂight home. The airline tells them to fill out claim forms independently, with the promise that both claims will be paid if they match. Otherwise, both travelers are only reimbursed at the lower of the claims, with a small penalty for the high claimant and an equally small reward for the low claimant. Even with a very low penalty and reward, each person has an incentive to undercut any anticipated common claim amount, and so the only Nash equilibrium (in pure or mixed strategies) is at the lowest possible claim.	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4124477-1>
Sovereign wealth & pension fund issues ¤ Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) are pools of assets owned and managed directly or indirectly by governments to achieve national objectives. These funds have raised concerns about: i) financial stability; ii) corporate governance and iii) political interference and protectionism. At the same time governments have formed other large pools of capital to finance public pension systems, i.e. Public Pension Reserve Funds (PPRFs). SWFs are set up to diversify and improve the return on foreign exchange reserves or commodity revenue, and to shield the domestic economy from fluctuations in commodity prices. PPRFs are set up to contribute to financing pay-as-you-go pension plans. The total of SWF pools is estimated at around USD 2.6 trillion in 2006/7, and is getting bigger rapidly, owing to current exchange rate policies and oil prices. The total amount for PPRFs is even larger, around USD 4.4 trillion in 2006/7, if the US Trust Fund is included (USD 2.2 trillion if excluded). SWFs and PPRFs share some characteristics, hence give rise to similar concerns. However, their objectives, investment strategies, sources of funding and transparency requirements differ. There is concern about strategic and political objectives of SWFs, and their impact on exchange rates and asset prices. But SWFs also provide mechanisms for breaking up concentrations of portfolios that increase risk. Enhancing governance and transparency of SWFs is important, but such considerations have to be weighed against commercial objectives.	<gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4068097-6>
Chapter 1. Axiomatic Foundations of Expected Utility and Subjective Probability ¤ This chapter provides a critical review of the theories of decision making under risk and under uncertainty and the notion of choice-based subjective probabilities.

Economic opening and the demand for skills in developing countries : A review of theory and evidence ¤ A policy reform such as trade liberalisation can accelerate structural change in an economy, causing an exogenous shift in relative factor demands. For some developing countries, the result may be an increase in skills demand associated with the adoption of newly available foreign technology and lower-cost imported capital goods. This demand shift may be permanent or only temporary, but in either case the skills supply should eventually increase in response to higher returns. One concern, however, is that with an initially highly skewed distribution of education the skilled labour supply adjustment may be prolonged; likewise any transitional increase in skill-based wage inequality.	<gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4113450-3>
Chapter 106 The Recognition Heuristic and the Less-Is-More Effect ¤ This chapter focuses on the recognition heuristic and the less is the more effect. Instead of being unboundedly rational, it is ecologically rational, that is, reasonable with respect to some environments but not others. There are domains in which the recognition heuristic will not work. A wise organism will only apply the rule in domains where recognition is strongly correlated with the criterion. (If this correlation is negative, then the rule should be reversed, and the unrecognized object should be chosen.) There are situations in which the recognition heuristic cannot be applied, for instance, when all objects are recognized. There are domains in which people will not apply it, for example, when they suspect that they are being asked a trick question. And there will be individual differences: different people use different heuristics at different times.	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4015999-1>
Chapter 102 The Becker–DeGroot–Marschak Mechanism is not Generally Incentive-Compatible in Practice ¤ Experimentalists have been so sure of the incentive compatibility of this mechanism in practice that they often explicitly inform their subjects that it is in the respondents' interest to report their true reservation prices, or words to that effect. However, as is reported here, it turns out that behavior is not fully determined by these incentives alone and that, contrary to the incentives provided, the choice of upper bound of the buyout price range tends to inﬂuence the seller prices that subjects state. Thus, studies which have used upper bounds clearly exceeding what real buyers could consider paying may have produced biased estimates of seller reservation prices.	<gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4139716-2>
Technologie und Kommunikation : Innovationsschübe vor dem Hintergrund der Außenbeziehungen Altägyptens ¤ What effect do spatial mobility and migrations have on the diffusion of knowledge? In this volume, papers dealing with the topic have been collected from various culture-historical and theoretical disciplines. Chronologically they range from non-literate cultures to an insight into contemporary research on economic innovation. The interdisciplinary contributions reveal in different ways the relationships between spatial mobility and the transfer of knowledge, thus allowing the phenomenon to be structured in both historical and non-literate ages.	<gnd:4076600-7> <gnd:4033596-3> <gnd:4001480-0> <gnd:4027089-0> <gnd:4066559-8> <gnd:4165992-2>
Chapter 3. Property Rights, Public Goods and the Environment ¤ We delineate the various ways in which rights to environmental and other resources can be assigned to individuals or groups. We then examine models of individual and group interactions, drawing out their implications for the ways in which resources will be utilized and managed under various rights assignments. Resources are classified into various groups (such as “collective” and “private”) depending on the type of rights assignment that is most appropriate, and we critically examine situations in which it is claimed that certain combinations of rights and rules of behavior will lead to an “ideal” allocation of the associated resources. We argue that in all but a very limited set of circumstances, efficient allocations will require at the least some form of social intervention, and we discuss both formal and informal models of social organization toward this end. Various distortions are identified that may arise when incorrect assignments of rights are utilized. We discuss various practical ways of correcting for these distortions using instruments such as taxes, quotas, and markets for pollution permits.	<gnd:4075236-7> <gnd:4078523-3> <gnd:4164199-1> <gnd:4061619-8> <gnd:4061638-1>
Chapter 19. Forecasting Binary Outcomes ¤ Binary events are involved in many economic decision problems. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in diverse disciplines in developing models for forecasting binary outcomes. We distinguish between two types of forecasts for binary events that are generally obtained as the output of regression models: probability forecasts and point forecasts. We summarize specification, estimation, and evaluation of binary response models for the purpose of forecasting in a unified framework that is characterized by the joint distribution of forecasts and actuals, and a general loss function. Analysis of both the skill and the value of probability and point forecasts can be carried out within this framework. Parametric, semi-parametric, non-parametric, and Bayesian approaches are covered. The emphasis is on the basic intuitions underlying each methodology, abstracting away from the mathematical details.	<gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4059787-8> <gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4047390-9>
Ghana: Agriculture is Becoming a Business ¤ Ghana’s agricultural sector has two faces. On the one hand, Ghana continues to face food security problems due to stagnating productivity in the food crop sector and undeveloped internal food markets. On the other hand, horticultural exports have been increasing and recent investments in cocoa and pineapple processing can been seen as signs of an emerging modern agricultural sector. The horticultural sector currently receives a lot of attention from donors and the Ghanaian government. The examination of several large donor projects in this sector reveals that donors are increasingly taking a value chain approach and trying to link smallholder farmers to exporters via outgrower schemes. Donors are also making an effort to connect their projects with other ongoing interventions. However, donor approaches vary according to donor preferences, and multi-donor programmes would probably be a better solution. While the current focus of donors and the Ghanaian government in the horticultural sector is welcome, it bears the risk of leaving the north of Ghana, where food crop production and poverty are concentrated, further behind. Food crops should receive more attention not only to resolve Ghana’s food security problem but also to take advantage of growing demand from Ghana’s middle-income class, which provides the opportunity for developing a local food industry.	<gnd:4113450-3> <gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4066399-1>
Methods of usability testing for users with cognitive impairments ¤ One challenge of the user-centered development of accessible information systems is the conduction of cognitively impaired persons in usability tests. The paper gathers existing guidelines for the application of usability testing with cognitively impaired people and shows empirical values for modified usability tests based on a case study. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of on site and remote usability testing are presented in a comparative study. Especially in the context of COVID-19, remote testing has gained in relevance in the present time.	<gnd:4005541-3> <gnd:4125909-9>
Chapter 20 Price Signaling and “Cheap Talk” in Laboratory Posted Offer Markets ¤ This chapter focuses on identifying the marginal impact of price signaling, holding all other environmental and institutional factors constant. Although price signaling often increases transaction prices, this increase is very often temporary. Equilibrium behavior may be unaffected by non-binding price signaling in many environments. Price increases due to price signaling are more likely when sellers compete in multiple markets. Conspiracies are more successful when a subset of sellers forego short term gains by repeatedly offering supercompetitive prices. The market impact of price signaling depends on the signaling language available to sellers. Very restrictive language (e.g., one price proposal by one seller per period) does not have a lasting impact on prices. By contrast, multiple-round structured signaling in which many sellers per period can propose price changes with specific responses required of other sellers can generate persistently higher prices compared to free form price signaling.	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4124477-1>
Market Openness, Trade Liberalisation and Innovation Capacity in the Finnish Telecom Equipment Industry ¤ This case study examines how recent trade and investment patterns (including “trade in tasks” resulting from supply chain fragmentation) and Finnish and global policies that promote market openness and free trade have affected the innovation process in the Finnish mobile telecom equipment industry. It illustrates, first, how regulatory, trade and investment policy choices have helped, alongside other key policies, provide the adequate framework conditions for innovation in this country of 5.2 million people. Secondly, it examines how the private sector, and more particularly Nokia, has taken advantage of those conditions to enhance its innovation capacity. This case study does not constitute an in-depth evaluation of the effectiveness of Finnish public policies nor of Nokia’s business strategy, but provides an illustration of how certain public policy choices and business strategies can contribute to a country’s innovation performance.

Ageing and Financial Markets ¤ Over the next decades, OECD countries will experience a significant ageing of their populations. Changes in the age structure of populations affect the economy’s saving behaviour, including the level of saving and the choices of saving vehicles. During the 1990s, financial markets in general and equity markets in particular may have benefited from large inflows into pension funds and other institutionalised forms of saving. These inflows reflected to a considerable extent saving for retirement by baby boom generations. These baby boom generations are expected to start to move into retirement after 2010. Almost as a natural corollary to the developments during the 1990s, some observers have argued that when baby boomers start entering retirement they will become net sellers of financial assets to finance retirement consumption...	<gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4073788-3>
An Overview of Hedge Funds and Structured Products : Issues in Leverage and Risk ¤ The size of the hedge fund sector, using IOSCO sources and results from responses to an OECD Questionnaire on Hedge Funds, is around USD 1.4 trillion in assets under management (AUM).

Chapter 28 Automated Markets and Trading Agents ¤ Computer automation has the potential, just starting to be realized, of transforming the design and operation of markets, and the behaviors of agents trading in them. We discuss the possibilities for automating markets, presenting a broad conceptual framework covering resource allocation as well as enabling marketplace services such as search and transaction execution. One of the most intriguing opportunities is provided by markets implementing computationally sophisticated negotiation mechanisms, for example combinatorial auctions. An important theme that emerges from the literature is the centrality of design decisions about matching the domain of goods over which a mechanism operates to the domain over which agents have preferences. When the match is imperfect (as is almost inevitable), the market game induced by the mechanism is analytically intractable, and the literature provides an incomplete characterization of rational bidding policies. A review of the literature suggests that much of our existing knowledge comes from computational simulations, including controlled studies of abstract market designs (e.g., simultaneous ascending auctions), and research tournaments comparing agent strategies in a variety of market scenarios. An empirical game-theoretic methodology combines the advantages of simulation, agent-based modeling, and statistical and game-theoretic analysis.	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4011152-0> <gnd:4112736-5>
Chapter 35 Coordination Issues in Long-Run Growth ¤ Economic growth depends not only on how people make decisions but also upon how their decisions are coordinated. Because of this, aggregate outcomes can diverge from individual intentions. I illustrate this with reference to the modern literature on economic growth, and also with reference to an older literature on the stability of full-employment equilibrium. Agent-based computational methods are ideally suited for studying the aspects of growth most affected by coordination issues.	<gnd:4011152-0> <gnd:4112736-5> <gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4066528-8>
Chapter 92 Endogenous Properties of Equilibrium and Disequilibrium in Spatial Committee Games ¤ This chapter discusses that experiments demonstrate the extent to which outcomes are responsive to the structure of preferences. Where a preference-induced equilibrium exists, outcomes converge toward that equilibrium. Where a natural majority coalition exists, outcomes cluster around it. Where preferences are widely distributed, so too are outcomes. By and large, the fact that outcomes are sensitive to endogenous preferences comes as some relief. These results indicate that there is a clear patterning to outcomes and they are dependent on the preferences of actors. Rather than throwing up our hands in frustration over the impossibility of understanding basic collective choice processes, these results point to the possibility of predicting outcomes. Those theoretical constructs aim at capturing the complex relationships between preference and choices.	<gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4066528-8>
Introduction to the Series ¤ This chapter presents an introduction to the series Handbooks in Economics. The series produced handbooks for various branches of economics, each of which is a definitive source, reference, and teaching supplement for the use by professional researchers and advanced graduate students. Each handbook provides self-contained surveys of the current state of a branch of economics in the form of chapters prepared by leading specialists on various aspects of this branch of economics. These surveys summarize not only received results but also newer developments, from recent journal articles and discussion papers.	<gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4011152-0> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4112736-5> <gnd:4066528-8>
Chapter 18. Panel Data Forecasting ¤ This chapter reviews the panel data forecasting literature. Starting with simple forecasts based on fixed and random effects panel data models. Next, these forecasts are extended to allow for various ARMA type structure on the disturbances, as well as spatial autoregressive and moving average type disturbances. These forecasting methods are then studied in the context of seemingly unrelated regressions. We highlight several forecasting empirical applications using panel data, as well as several Monte Carlo studies that compare various forecasting methods using panel data. The chapter concludes with suggestions for further work in this area.	<gnd:4047390-9> <gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4059787-8>
Chapter 15 Monte carlo simulation and numerical integration ¤ This chapter discusses simulation methods that are both important and useful in the solution of integration problems, and discusses the principles for the practical application of simulation in economics with a focus on integration problems. The simulation methods are generally straightforward for the investigator to implement, relying on an understanding of a few principles of simulation and the structure of the problem at hand. By contrast, deterministic methods require much larger problem-specific investments in numerical methods. Simulation methods can provide solutions for two related integration problems. One integration problem arises in model solution for agents whose expected utilities cannot be expressed as a closed function of state and decision variables. The other occurs, when the investigator combines sources of uncertainty about models to draw conclusions about policy.

Market Economics of Uncertainty and Information ¤ The principles based on purposeful behavior, which have always been at the foundations of economics, began to expand to explain the acquisition of information and its use, including both the information that might be carried in the actions of others and in the behavior of markets. This evolution was accompanied by the development of more precise principles of behavior as well as modifications of those of classical origin. This chapter reports on the expectations development of individuals and in particular the capacity of individuals to condition their expectations of some events on the observation of multiple other events. That is, they measure the implicit conditional subjective probabilities of events that have a stochastic dependence on other observable events.	<gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4252654-1>
Chapter 19 Experimental Methods and Valuation ¤ This chapter explores how economists use experimental methods to understand better the behavioral underpinnings of environmental valuation. Economic experiments, in the lab or field, are an attractive tool to address intricate incentive and contextual questions that arise in assessing values through direct statements of preferences. By combining empirical observation with theoretical insight, researchers use the experimental method and mindset to help explain how economic and social contexts matter to valuation. Herein we consider three themes in applying the experimental method to valuation rational choice theory and stated values, direct value elicitation in the field and lab, and testbedding survey designs prior to field application. First, experimental tests of rational valuation are discussed. This lab work examines whether respondents make choices and state values in a manner consistent with standard rational choice theory. The circumstances of rational valuation are illustrated by the malleability of two classic anomalies the WTPWTA divergence and the preference reversal phenomenon. Second, direct experimental methods to measure actual values for public and private goods are examined. These experiments ask people to buy and sell actual goods to elicit real values, in which researchers test how alternative exchange institutions affect these values. Third, we survey testbed experiments designed to identify potential incentive problems caused by hypothetical valuation questions. Four topics are discussed: testing for hypothetical bias, calibrating real and hypothetical values, examining surrogate values (or scoping) for specific environmental preferences, and evaluating the incentive (in)compatibility of alternative elicitation mechanisms.	<gnd:4006340-9> <gnd:4061638-1> <gnd:4061616-2>
Chapter 7 Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium Predictions as a Means of Organizing Behavior in Posted-Offer Market Experiments ¤ Market power arises in many posted-offer markets and drives a distinction between the competitive prediction and the Nash equilibrium for the market viewed as a stage game. Pricing patterns in such markets tend to be characterized by Edgeworth cycles that deteriorate as the sessions progress. The amplitude and frequency of the cycles are sensitive to design and procedural details, and vary considerably from experiment to experiment. Although persistent serial correlation in pricing proscribe any direct test of static Nash mixing predictions, rough correspondence between the central moments of predicted and observed densities has been observed in a variety of different instances. However, the persistent and very prominent deviations observed in an asymmetric design suggests that Nash mixing predictions do not uniformly organize behavior well. The circumstances under which mixing predictions may organize outcomes well merits further investigation.	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1>
Optimization of compliant path-generating mechanisms based on non-linear analytical modeling ¤ Monolithic compliant mechanisms are often used in precision engineering applications for path-generating tasks due to their many advantages. They are mostly realized with concentrated compliance in form of notch flexure hinges and achieve their motion due to bending of the hinges. This contribution presents the non-linear analytical modeling of compliant mechanisms with power function-based notch flexure hinges and their efficient optimization of the elasto-kinematic path-generating properties using MATLAB. Different planar mechanisms are analytically characterized with the theory for large deflections of curved rod-like structures. A verification of the analytical model is exemplified by FEM simulations for a four-hinge Watt mechanism as a point guidance mechanism and for a 12-hinge pantograph mechanism as a plane guidance mechanism. Further, the exponents of the power function contours for each hinge are individually optimized on the example of an Evans and a Roberts mechanism. This is achieved with the goal of minimizing the straight-line deviation of their coupler points realizing a stroke of 10 mm.	<gnd:4774350-5> <gnd:4205811-9> <gnd:4017233-8> <gnd:4198914-4>
Challenges related to financial guarantee insurance ¤ Traditionally, bond insurers have provided guarantees of payments on municipal bonds, where defaults have been very limited. But since the late 1990s they have become increasingly involved as guarantors of elements of various structured financial products: in particular, the credit enhancements provided by these entities have played an important role in making securities based on sub-prime loans attractive to a wide range of investors. It is this trend change in their activity that has become the focal point in concerns about the health of these entities that have grown during the financial turbulence. The note identifies three policy issues that arise in the context of the current challenges facing these entities and it draws some preliminary findings. First, while concerns regarding the potential financial stability implications of further downgrades and/or failures of some of these companies have ebbed somewhat from their peaks in early 2008, the situation still bears monitoring. Second, current developments raise questions regarding the role of financial guarantors in specific financial market segments. In this context, there appears to be a public interest in the continued availability of guarantees on payments on municipal bonds. Private solutions seem to be forthcoming. Third, transparency of the financial guarantee insurance sector is limited. In this context, the performance of credit rating agencies in providing guidance for investors regarding the quality of the guarantees provided by financial guarantors appears to have been uneven.	<gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4073788-3>
Chapter 17 Contingent Valuation ¤ Value estimates for environmental goods can be obtained by either estimating preference parameters as revealed through behavior related to some aspect of the amenity or using stated information concerning preferences for the good. In the environmental economics literature the stated preference approach has come to be known as contingent valuation as the valuation estimated obtained from preference information given the respondent is said to be contingent on the details of the constructed market for the environmental good put forth in the survey. Work on contingent valuation now typically comprises the largest single group of papers at major environmental economics conferences and in several of the leading journals in the field. As such, it is impossible to review the literature per se or even cover all of the major papers in the area in some detail. Instead, in this chapter we seek to provide a coherent overview of the main issues and how they fit together. The organization of the chapter is as follows. First, we provide an overview of the history of contingent valuation starting with its antecedents and foundational papers and then trace its subsequent development using several broad themes. Second, we put forth the theoretical foundations of contingent valuation with particular emphasis on ties to standard measures of economic welfare. Third, we look at the issue of existence/passive use considerations. Fourth, we consider the relationship of contingent valuation to information on preferences that can be obtained by observing revealed behavior and how the two sources of information might be combined. Fifth, we look at different ways in which preference information can be elicited in a CV survey, paying particular attention to the incentive structure posed by different elicitation formats. Sixth, we turn to econometric issues associated with these different elicitation formats. Seventh, we briefly consider survey design issues. Eighth, we look at issues related to survey administration and extrapolating the results obtained to the population of interest. Ninth, we describe the major controversies related to the use of contingent valuation and summarize the evidence. Finally, we provide some thoughts on where we think contingent valuation is headed in the future.	<gnd:4006340-9> <gnd:4061616-2> <gnd:4061638-1>
Pension Fund Demand for High-quality Long-term Bonds : Quantifying Potential "Scarcity" of Suitable Investments ¤ The article describes the results of a modeling exercise to gauge the size of potential pension fund demand for bonds under some simplifying assumptions, so as to illustrate the potential role of this specific group of investors. It provides a measure of the potential excess demand for high-quality fixed-income instruments from pension funds, using the admittedly restrictive assumptions that pension funds invest only in high-quality bonds in an attempt to achieve cash-flow matching of their liabilities.	<gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4067488-5>
Financial Stability, Fiscal Consolidation and Long-Term Investment after the Crisis ¤ In the future there will be a global growing demand for long-term investment, both in mature and in emerging countries, to finance infrastructure, innovation, education, growth, environmental programs. Mature economies will also need to increase their share of long-term investment to exit from the recent crisis, to reinforce their growth rates and global competitiveness and to ensure public debt sustainability. Given the need to enlarge the amount of long-term financing worldwide, policy makers should create a prudential and accounting framework that encourages long-term investment with positive effects for growth and financial market stability. The paper then discusses regulatory issues related to the introduction of a new international and/or European regulatory framework that is more favourable or less penalising for long-term investment, and issues related to the creation of new euro denominated financial instruments for financing infrastructure (long-term equity funds, project bonds and guarantee schemes) and for strengthening stability in EU sovereign bond markets (Eurobonds).	<gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4067488-5>
Challenges for financial intermediaries offering asset decumulation products ¤ The present article focuses on issues related to asset decumulation. In discussing these issues, a key proposition is that financial institutions are most willing and able to offer decumulation products with fixed payment promises to the extent they are able to invest in financial assets that allow them to hedge a considerable part of the risks associated with the payment promises they extend.Indeed, what is sometimes overlooked in discussions bout shifts from asset accumulation to decumulation is that the decumulation phase also involves investment challenges, especially if specific patterns of payouts such as regular payouts of fixed amounts are aimed at. Many writers have argued for some time now that pension fund managers will have difficulty implementing asset-liability matching because there are insufficient quantities of suitable assets. As it turns out, the shortfall in hedging instruments extends to more than just the “toxic” tail of longevity risk, as is commonly being argued. The analysis in this article shows that hedging interest rate risk is also not as straightforward as one may think.	<gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4067488-5>
Chapter 52 The Problem of Common Choice in Symmetric N -person Coordination Games ¤ Coordination problems are easily solved when there are clear and unambiguous signals. Institutional mechanisms that enhance the clarity of signals enables even cheap talk to work as a coordinating mechanism. On the other hand, learning about signals, especially if there is path-dependent noise in the environment, complicates the ability of subjects to settle on a common coordinating device. Coordination problems, such as the one facing our Cornhusker motorists, can be simply and easily solved provided an appropriate institutional remedy is at hand. Markets, for example, with frictionless transaction costs and complete information, constitute one way of quickly coordinating supply and demand. The evolution of social norms constitutes another way of coordinating human action. Central to both of these solutions is the presence of a clear, unambiguous signal about what actions individuals should take. Where such a signal is present, the problem of coordination is easily solved; where absent, the problem of coordination can be extraordinarily difficult.	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4015999-1>
Chapter 8. Empirical Validation of Agent-Based Models ¤ The literature on agent-based models has been highly successful in replicating many stylized facts of financial and macroeconomic time series. Over the past decade, however, also advances in the estimation of such models have been made. Due to the inherent heterogeneity of agents and nonlinearity of agent-based models, fundamental choices have to be made to take the models to the data. In this chapter we provide an overview of the current literature on the empirical validation of agent-based models. We discuss potential lessons from other fields of applications of agent-based models, avenues for estimation of reduced form and ‘full-fledged’ agent-based models, estimation methods, as well as applications and results.	<gnd:4112736-5> <gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4132280-0>
Chapter 45 Experimental Beauty Contest Games: Levels of Reasoning and Convergence to Equilibrium ¤ This chapter presents data from a series of experiments with human subjects to test how individuals form expectations of others' expectations. The experiment has much in common with Keynes' insight regarding the behavior of investors in financial markets, and therefore the game is called beauty contest game in honor of Keynes. This chapter introduces new asymmetric guessing games in which subjects of the same group may have different parameters p or intervals to choose from in order to separate leading decision rules. The main difference was the high number of frequencies at or near the equilibrium. The choices closest to the winning number were typically those which came from subjects who did their own pre-experiments with students, friends or even with a newsgroup experiment.	<gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4124477-1>
Adapted Process Model for Manufacturing Within Production Networks ¤ The paper concentrates on the external elimination of bottlenecks by using congruent shared capacities within a non-hierarchical organized network. The study assumes that the capacity of assembly can be adapted by increasing the resources of the company. Conversely, the capacity of production is restricted by technological requirements and regulated by machine resources.To relieve capacity by external measures within a non-hierarchical organized network, an adapted process model is required. For this purpose, critical issues for the process flow within a network are identified and necessary regulations suggested.The paper presents the possibility of integrating the adapted approach into the operations management process as well as into systems of production planning and control and deduces the necessary information that is required to ensure the economic viability of bottleneck removal.	<gnd:4329079-6>
Chapter 10 Modeling languages in computational economics: Gams ¤ A GAMS model is a collection of statements in the GAMS language that define the variables of the model, specify the symbolic relationships among them in the form of equations, specify data structures and assign values to them, and instructs the computer to generate and solve the model. This chapter provides an introduction to algebraic modeling language, general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) of Brooke, Kendrick and Meeraus (1992). The chapter also gives an overview of the language and illustrates its use in modeling problems in transportation, asset allocation, and the estimation of social accounting matrices. This system provides a high-level (algebraic) language for the representation of large and complex models. It allows for unambiguous statements of algebraic relations that define an abstract system of variables and equations. It also provides mechanisms for data management. The system performs appropriate data transformations to create a specific instance of the model, starting from the abstract representation. Because, the model description is algebraic the GAMS statement of the model provides a readable documentation. The data management mechanisms also facilitate the preparation of reports.	<gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4112736-5> <gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4011152-0>
Chapter 11. Computing All Solutions to Polynomial Equations in Economics ¤ Multiplicity of equilibria is a common problem in many economic models. In general, it is impossible to devise methods that always find all equilibria for any type of model. A notable exception are models in which all equilibria are solutions to a system of polynomial equations since there are powerful solution methods for finding all solutions to such polynomial systems. In many economic applications, equilibria can indeed be characterized as solutions to a system of polynomial equations. This handbook article provides a hands-on introduction to two solution methods for finding all solutions to polynomial systems; the first approach relies on Gröbner bases, the second approach employs all-solution homotopy methods. Several economic examples show how to compute all equilibria using modern software implementations of these two methods.	<gnd:4112736-5> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4148259-1>
Chapter 6 Forecasting with VARMA Models ¤ Vector autoregressive moving-average (VARMA) processes are suitable models for producing linear forecasts of sets of time series variables. They provide parsimonious representations of linear data generation processes. The setup for these processes in the presence of stationary and cointegrated variables is considered. Moreover, unique or identified parameterizations based on the echelon form are presented. Model specification, estimation, model checking and forecasting are discussed. Special attention is paid to forecasting issues related to contemporaneously and temporally aggregated VARMA processes. Predictors for aggregated variables based alternatively on past information in the aggregated variables or on disaggregated information are compared.	<gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4047390-9> <gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4059787-8>
Chapter 44 Multiple Market Systems and the Classical Principles of Price Dynamics in General Equilibrium ¤ Theoretically, it is not the case that markets will necessarily equilibrate even when the equilibrium is a unique, interior equilibrium. In his example prices always orbit around the equilibrium and thus never converge. That platform thus provides the starting point of the research. For the parameters of his example, either the markets will not equilibrate, as predicted by theory, or the basic principle of dynamics he employed is substantially wrong. The Scarf example is ideal for a study of classical dynamics because in that situation the theory makes striking and unexpected predictions. The conditions under which markets will equilibrate, and therefore the frequency with which equilibration might be expected, depend on the nature of the process of equilibration and the underlying principles of dynamics.	<gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4015999-1>
Highlights of Recent Trends in Financial Markets ¤ After some significant corrections in the second half of May and in early June, major equity markets have resumed their growth, in some cases regaining levels reached before the May-June contraction. Against a backdrop of healthy corporate balance sheets, robust earnings growth and low default rates, investor sentiment has remained positive, as reflected in these equity market developments and compressed credit spreads. However, there are signs of increasing nevousness, which include the May/June market turbulence and somewhat increased levels of historical and implied volatility. The increased nervousness may reflect in part downward revisions to economic forecasts.	<gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4068097-6>
Chapter 50 Fairness in Ultimatum Bargaining ¤ Although fairness concerns may be relevant, they appear to be too simple an explanation for why game theory's strong predictions for ultimatum games are so rarely supported. Self interested offerers want to avoid rejections; unpredicted, non-equilibrium behavior is more valuable and effective than equilibrium behavior. Previous ultimatum bargaining researchers tended to conclude that unpredicted outcomes resulted from fairness concerns. In a series of studies, we operationally defined fairness and tested its effects. The accumulated data from our projects document quite clearly that concerns for fairness provide little explanatory value for offerers and only a small part of the explanation for respondents' rejections: the simple cognitive reactions associated with fairness concerns may explain some idiosyncratic rejections; additional, emotional reactions make wounded pride and spite a more compelling explanation for unexpected rejections.	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4124477-1>
The Role of Private Pools of Capital in Corporate Governance : Summary and Main Findings about the Role of Private Equity Firms and "Activist" Hedge Funds ¤ In November 2006, the OECD Steering Group on Corporate Governance initiated a study of the role of privately organised pools of capital (“alternative investment vehicles”) in corporate governance. With a rapid increase in the size of transactions and investments, and partly due to differences in corporate governance frameworks and company structures, there has been a growing public interest in private equity firms and “activist” hedge funds. The Steering Group agreed that the distinct corporate governance aspects that emerge in these discussions required special attention based on the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance (OECD Principles). This Report summarises the main conclusions reached by the Steering Group in April 2007, including the findings of a factual review that were taken into consideration. On the basis of available evidence, the Steering Group concluded that “activist” hedge funds and private equity firms could help strengthen corporate governance practices by increasing the number of investors that have the incentive to make active and informed use of their shareholder rights. It was agreed that, from a corporate governance perspective, there was no need to promote a special set of principles for private equity firms and “activist” hedge funds, but that the opportunities and challenges that follow from their ownership strategies should instead be analysed within the general framework of the OECD Principles, also taking into account existing voluntary standards established and promoted by the industry.	<gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4068097-6>

Chapter 7. Numerical Methods for Large-Scale Dynamic Economic Models ¤ We survey numerical methods that are tractable in dynamic economic models with a finite, large number of continuous state variables. (Examples of such models are new Keynesian models, life-cycle models, heterogeneous-agents models, asset-pricing models, multisector models, multicountry models, and climate change models.) First, we describe the ingredients that help us to reduce the cost of global solution methods. These are efficient nonproduct techniques for interpolating and approximating functions (Smolyak, stochastic simulation, and ε -distinguishable set grids), accurate low-cost monomial integration formulas, derivative-free solvers, and numerically stable regression methods. Second, we discuss endogenous grid and envelope condition methods that reduce the cost and increase accuracy of value function iteration. Third, we show precomputation techniques that construct solution manifolds for some models’ variables outside the main iterative cycle. Fourth, we review techniques that increase the accuracy of perturbation methods: a change of variables and a hybrid of local and global solutions. Finally, we show examples of parallel computation using multiple CPUs and GPUs including applications on a supercomputer. We illustrate the performance of the surveyed methods using a multiagent model. Many codes are publicly available.	<gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4112736-5>
Secondary market liquidity in domestic debt markets : Key policy conclusions ¤ The Tenth OECD/World Bank/IMF Annual Global Bond Market Forum highlighted that liquidity is a complex concept with different dimensions – micro liquidity vs. macro liquidity, market liquidity vs. funding liquidity, endogenous vs. exogenous liquidity, and so on. Relative liquidity (including ‘liquidity freezes or squeezes’) can best be explained by focusing on the market’s institutional structure, in particular the architecture of electronic trading platforms, the importance of OTC trading, the nature and width of the investor base, disclosure requirements, valuation methods, the role of primary dealers including market-making requirements or conventions, tax factors, and the role of issuers of government bonds and other fixed-income instruments in primary and secondary markets.	<gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4068097-6>
Chapter 4 Zero-Intelligence Robots and the Double Auction Market: A Graphical Tour ¤ This chapter illustrates the behavior of Zero-Intelligence (ZI) Robots in double auction markets and offer some comparison with humans . The behavior of these robots is very simple: they simply choose a random bid or ask over a range of prices constrained by their budget and the market improvement rules. The goal of this chapter is to compare the behavior of markets populated with simple robots to markets populated by humans. As there is clearly a lot more that could be done, sufficient detail about the market, environment, and robots are provided so that an advanced undergraduate or graduate student could easily develop their own ZI robot and market software. A series of graphs summarizes some important features of various humans and robots in a variety of double auction environments. After breaking the ZI robots in the new environment, the UNIT robots are introduced to show how making robot behavior dependent on the previous market transaction price can yield stability in situations with continuously order flow.	<gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8>

Credit: Some Macroeconomic, Market and Consumer Implications ¤ Financial consumers are facing paradoxical situations. On the one hand, they are overly solicited to use credits on various forms. On the other hand, segments of the population do not have access to credit. In this paper, we examine some emerging issues regarding consumer protection and information in four OECD countries: Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. These four countries have much in common but nevertheless develop their own specific experience. By comparing their recent experience we identify some questions of emerging importance.	<gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4113450-3>
Evaluating the Effectiveness of Financial Education Programmes ¤ Policy makers in many countries are giving more attention to ‘financial literacy’ or ‘financial capability’, and there are many financial education programmes. The need to evaluate the effectiveness of these programmes is likely to increase. But little evaluation is currently taking place, and the evaluations made so far show mixed and inconclusive results. It is not clear whether this is a consequence of poor evaluation methods or poor programme design, or, that financial education works patchily. But it does mean that a positive impact from financial education has not been unambiguously proven; nor has a clear picture emerged of what works best and why. Evaluation of financial education is inherently difficult, and the impact of any one programme can probably never be fully isolated. Nevertheless, this paper suggests that evaluating the effectiveness of financial education can and should be improved. It begins to develop an approach to do so, including a Financial Education Evaluation (FEE) Framework which can be tailored for any programme in any country. This paper also suggests guidelines for governments and other public authorities to lead the way towards better evaluation of the benefits, costs and value for money of financial education.	<gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4113450-3>
Sovereign Debt Challenges for Banking Systems and Bond Markets ¤ Discussions at the October 2010 OECD Financial Roundtable conveyed a rather sombre view regarding the current outlook and risks, heightened by financial sector weaknesses, ongoing deleveraging and sovereign debt. Policy makers should be prepared for downside risks to materialise along the way to recovery. Low interest rates and low returns pose specific challenges for institutional investors. While sovereign risk is currently a major concern, its measurement is rather complex and markets do not always provide proper guidance. Sovereign ratings can serve as a useful point of reference but should be made more forward-looking and less procyclical. Should default or debt restructuring become necessary, strong political backing can minimise its costs. The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) was seen as helpful in providing a backstop. Some optimism was expressed as to the current fiscal adjustments underway to bring public finances back onto a sustainable path. Banking sectors remain fragile, especially in Europe, where, however, the transparency provided by recent stress tests has calmed some fears. Reactivating the wholesale markets for bank funding will be essential going forward. Capitalisation of the US banking sector has improved, but pockets of risk remain in exposures to commercial property by regional and small banks. Contingent convertible (bail-in) bonds could become a useful instrument for sharing the costs of crises, but they need to be made attractive for investors.

Chapter 17 The Exercise of Market Power in Laboratory Experiments ¤ Many aspects of antitrust policy are influenced by the possibility that sellers in concentrated markets may have the power to raise prices above competitive levels. Of course, anyone can raise prices, so the issue is whether a change in structure, e.g., a merger, will allow one or more sellers to raise price profitably. A price increase by one seller diverts sales to others, so a firm is more likely to have market power when its competitors have limited capacity to expand their sales. Thus a merger that reduces competitors' capacity may create market power. Market power can also be sensitive to the trading institution, and this is the context that power issues first arose in experimental economics. Relatively high prices in posted-offer auctions are not surprising, since experimental economists have long noticed that prices in such markets tend to be above competitive levels, and will converge from above if they converge at all.	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4139716-2>

The Impact of Pension Funds on Financial Markets ¤ This paper empirically explores the impact of pension funds on market volatility, equity prices, government and corporate bond yields for a panel of 24 countries. The results show a positive and statistically significant relationship between market volatility and pension assets. It complements micro evidence (Dennis and Strickland, 2002) as well as macro findings (Davis, 2004). In addition, equity prices are found to be positively correlated with pension funds, a finding observable for both OECD countries and emerging market economies (EMEs) and present in both the short and long terms. Furthermore, there is evidence indicating a negative link between pension fund assets and both corporate and government bond yields. This might be due to the sizeable buying effects of pension funds, particularly when governments have the tendency to use pension funds to finance implicit pension debts when the traditional pay-as-you-go systems shift to funded systems.	<gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4067488-5>
Debt Markets : Policy Challenges in the Post-Crisis Landscape ¤ Discussions at the 11th OECD-WBG-IMF Global Bond Market Forum focused on four key areas: i) the impact of crisis-related measures and the potential implications of exit; ii) the measurement of sovereign risk; iii) the determinants of investor demand; and iv) debt managers’ response to the crisis. Overall, participants felt that the steps taken to stabilise financial conditions had generally been effective and that conditions in financial markets were normalising. However, discussions highlighted a number of ongoing risks including: i) while credible consolidation plans were needed, fiscal and monetary policy would be tightened too soon; ii) managing investor uncertainty would prove critical in managing risk in the near-term; and (iii) regulatory changes might lead to a deterioration in conditions in primary and secondary markets and otherwise aggravate the challenges facing debt managers.

Chapter 4 Forecast Combinations ¤ Forecast combinations have frequently been found in empirical studies to produce better forecasts on average than methods based on the ex ante best individual forecasting model. Moreover, simple combinations that ignore correlations between forecast errors often dominate more refined combination schemes aimed at estimating the theoretically optimal combination weights. In this chapter we analyze theoretically the factors that determine the advantages from combining forecasts (for example, the degree of correlation between forecast errors and the relative size of the individual models' forecast error variances). Although the reasons for the success of simple combination schemes are poorly understood, we discuss several possibilities related to model misspecification, instability (non-stationarities) and estimation error in situations where the number of models is large relative to the available sample size. We discuss the role of combinations under asymmetric loss and consider combinations of point, interval and probability forecasts.	<gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4047390-9> <gnd:4059787-8> <gnd:4132280-0>
Chapter 55 Testing Theories of Other-regarding Behavior: A Sequence of Four Laboratory Studies ¤ This chapter describes a sequence of four experiments. The hypotheses tested are all informed by one or more of the aforementioned types of models. Each experiment builds on the findings of the previous experiment in the sequence. At the same time, each experiment involves a different game, thereby allowing us to study the phenomenon from a variety of perspectives. While some of the models that this chapter examines get important features of the data correct, none is completely satisfactory. What emerges from this sequence of experiments is a set of empirical regularities that should provide some useful guidance to the construction of more accurate models. This chapter found that preferences for distribution, independent of considerations of intentions, are sufficient to explain contributions in a simple dilemma game. The solidarity game and a linear public goods game proved sensitive to East German/West German cultural differences, but not so much so that it changes the qualitative features of giving.	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4124477-1>
Human capital formation and foreign direct : Investment in developing countries ¤ This article synthesises a selected literature on human capital formation and foreign direct investment (FDI) in developing countries. The aim is to take a bird’s eye view of the complex linkages between the activities of multinational enterprises (MNEs) and policies of host developing countries. In doing so, general trends, best practices and policy experiences are extracted to evaluate the current state of knowledge. The literature indicates that a high level of human capital is no doubt one of the key ingredients for attracting FDI, as well as for host countries to gain maximum benefits from their activities. Most developing countries, however, underinvest in human capital, and the investment that is actually taking place is unevenly distributed across countries and regions that have adopted different human resource development (HRD) policies. To improve human capital formation and thus to attract more FDI would therefore require a more coherent approach that takes host country constraints such as limited budgetary resources into account. One such approach is to provide strong incentives for MNEs and Investment Promotion Agencies (IPAs) to participate in formal education and vocational training even for workers employed by domestic firms. This allows HRD to be flexible and demanddriven. Another policy option is to facilitate human resource development (HRD) for small and medium-sized domestic enterprises which usually do not invest sufficiently in training of employees although these enterprises stand to gain most from education and training. In addition, FDI promotion policies can target high value-added MNEs that are more likely to bring new skills and knowledge to the economy that can be tapped by domestic enterprises. Lastly, it is important that key components of HRD policies, i.e. formal schooling and vocational education and training policies (post-formal schooling), are well coordinated so as to equip students with knowledge and skills that will later be complementary to training opportunities provided in the labour market.	<gnd:4113450-3> <gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4066493-4>
Chapter 31 Computational Laboratories for Spatial Agent-Based Models ¤ An agent-based model is a virtual world comprising distributed heterogeneous agents who interact over time. In a spatial agent-based model the agents are situated in a spatial environment and are typically assumed to be able to move in various ways across this environment. Some kinds of social or organizational systems may also be modeled as spatial environments, where agents move from one group or department to another and where communications or mobility among groups may be structured according to implicit or explicit channels or transactions costs. This chapter focuses on the potential usefulness of computational laboratories for spatial agent-based modeling. Speaking broadly, a computational laboratory is any computational framework permitting the exploration of the behaviors of complex systems through systematic and replicable simulation experiments. By that definition, most of the research discussed in this handbook would be considered to be work with computational laboratories. A narrower definition of computational laboratory (or comp lab for short) refers specifically to specialized software tools to support the full range of agent-based modeling and complementary tasks. These tasks include model development, model evaluation through controlled experimentation, and both the descriptive and normative analysis of model outcomes. The objective of this chapter is to explore how comp lab tools and activities facilitate the systematic exploration of spatial agent-based models embodying complex social processes critical for social welfare. Examples include the spatial and temporal coordination of human activities, the diffusion of new ideas or of infectious diseases, and the emergence and ecological dynamics of innovative ideas or of deadly new diseases.	<gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4011152-0> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4112736-5>
Chapter 46 Reciprocity in Ultimatum and Dictator Games: An Introduction ¤ This chapter presents data based on treatment manipulations intended to affect subjects' expectations about others' behavior, and degree of social isolation (anonymity) from the experimenter and others who might see the results, holding constant subject anonymity with respect to each other .The standard economic/game theoretic model predicts that the (conscious) reasoning process that applies to social exchange optimization in the self interest against other presumed self-interested protagonists applies also to coalitional relations, games against nature and other content-specific decision problems. Of course, this paradigm makes provision for cooperative behavior in repeat play interaction, but such outcomes emerge out of reward and threat possibilities, that channel the self-interest into longer term betterment over time. According to game theory, such behavior is strictly ruled out in any one-shot game, unless one postulates a taste (utility) for fairness, a topic to which we shall return after introducing our experimental design and results.	<gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8>
Guidelines for Insurers' Governance ¤ On 28 April 2005, the OECD Council approved the Recommendation on Guidelines for Insurers’ Governance. Guidelines were first endorsed by the OECD Insurance and Private Pensions Committee in collaboration and wide consultation with the 30 member countries’ governmental experts in the insurance sector as well as the insurance and reinsurance industry. These guidelines were also deemed fully compatible and consistent with the OECD Revised Principles on Corporate Governance by its Steering Group in October 2004.	<gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4067488-5>
Chapter 9. Forecasting Real Estate Prices ¤ This chapter reviews the evidence of predictability in U.S. residential and commercial real estate markets. First, we highlight the main methodologies used in the construction of real estate indices, their underlying assumptions and their impact on the stochastic properties of the resultant series. We then survey the key empirical findings in the academic literature, including short-run persistence and long-run reversals in the log changes of real estate prices. Next, we summarize the ability of local as well as aggregate variables to forecast real estate returns. We illustrate a number of these results by relying on six aggregate indexes of the prices of unsecuritized (residential and commercial) real estate and REITs. The effect of leverage and monetary policy is also discussed.	<gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4066399-1>
Chapter 9. Computable General Equilibrium Modeling of Environmental Issues in Australia : Economic Impacts of an Emissions Trading Scheme ¤ A key distinguishing characteristic of computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling in Australia is its orientation to providing inputs to the policy-formation process. Policy makers require detail. They want to be able to identify convincingly which industries, which occupations, which regions and which households would benefit or lose from policy changes, and when the benefits or losses might be expected to flow. In this chapter, we explain how the necessary level of detail can be provided, using as an example analysis that was undertaken by Centre of Policy Studies (CoPS) and Frontier Economics of the potential economic impacts of a carbon price on the Australian economy. The Australian carbon price framework is assumed to be part of a global emissions trading scheme (ETS). Over time, the global ETS becomes the dominant greenhouse abatement policy for all countries including Australia. It sets the price for carbon permits and allocates the number of permits available to each country. A number of key findings emerge from the CGE simulations of the effects of the ETS policy. (i) Domestic abatement falls well short of targeted abatement, requiring significant amounts of permits to be imported. (ii) Despite the requirement for deep cuts in emissions, the ETS reduces Australias GDP by only about 1.1% relative to the base case in 2030. The negative impact on real household consumption (the preferred measure of national welfare) is somewhat greater, reflecting the need to import permits. (iii) The national macroeconomic impacts of the ETS might be described as modest in the context of the policy task. However, this does not carry through to the industry and state/territory levels where some industries and regions prove particularly vulnerable in terms of potential lost employment. The need for detail is highlighted throughout the analysis. For example, a suitably detailed treatment of electricity supply is provided by linking CoPS CGE model with Frontiers detailed bottom-up model of the stationary energy sector. Similarly, necessary detail on the effects of the global ETS on Australias international trading conditions is provided by linking with a multicountry model.	<gnd:4065341-9> <gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4079351-5> <gnd:4224214-9> <gnd:4210294-7> <gnd:4066493-4>
Chapter 26 Agent-Based Models of Organizations ¤ The agent-based approach views an organization as a collection of agents, interacting with one another in their pursuit of assigned tasks. The performance of an organization in this framework is determined by the formal and informal structures of interactions among agents, which define the lines of communication, allocation of information processing tasks, distribution of decision-making authorities, and the provision of incentives. This chapter provides a synthesis of various agent-based models of organizations and surveys some of the new insights that are being delivered. The ultimate goal is to introduce the agent-based approach to economists in a methodological manner and provide a broader and less idiosyncratic perspective to those who are already engaging in this line of work. The chapter is organized around the set of research questions that are common to this literature: (1) What are the determinants of organizational behavior and performance? (2) How does organizational structure influence performance? (3) How do the skills and traits of agents matter and how do they interact with structure? (4) How do the characteristics of the environment—including its stability, complexity, and competitiveness—influence the appropriate allocation of authority and information? (5) How is the behavior and performance influenced when an organization is coevolving with other organizations from which it can learn? (6) Can an organization evolve its way to a better structure?	<gnd:4112736-5> <gnd:4011152-0> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4066528-8>
A Market Perspective on the European Sovereign Debt and Banking Crisis ¤ Europe has been beset by an interrelated banking crisis and sovereign debt crisis. Bond spreads faced by Greece and Ireland, and to a lesser extent Portugal followed by Spain, have increased. This paper explores these issues from the perspective of financial markets, focusing mainly on the four countries in the frontline of these pressures: Greece and Portugal, on the one hand, where the problems are primarily fiscal in nature; and Ireland and Spain, on the other, where banking problems related to the property boom and bust have been the key moving part. The paper first examines the probabilities of default implicit in observable market spreads and considers these calculations against sovereign debt dynamics. It then explores the implications of the interaction between bank losses and fiscal deficits on the one hand, and the feedback that any debt haircuts anticipated by markets could have on bank solvency. The study finds that market-implied sovereign default probabilities do in fact discriminate quite clearly between countries based on five criteria that affect the probability of debt restructuring. The discussion highlights some implications for banking system balance sheets of expected losses and shows the potential impact on them of sovereign restructuring implicit in market analysis. While the paper does not make any recommendations for policy action, it does explore a range of policy options and the implications each might have for the financial markets.

Chapter 62 Asymmetric Two-person Bargaining Under Incomplete Information: Strategic Play and Adaptive Learning ¤ This chapter focuses on a series of experiments investigating decision behavior in single-stage, two-person bargaining over the exchange of a single commodity, where neither trader knows with precision the reservation value that the other places on the good or service being bought or sold. Uncertainty about the other trader's reservation value is represented by a commonly known probability distribution. This chapter also summarizes the major behavioral regularities that have been observed in two computer-controlled bargaining experiments using the sealed-bid double auction mechanism. Under this mechanism, the buyer submits a bid anonymously over a computer network, and the seller submits an offer for the good she possesses. Bids and offers are submitted simultaneously. Considerable theoretical progress has been made in analyzing these bilateral bargaining situations with two-sided incomplete information within the general framework of the BayesianNash equilibrium.	<gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4252654-1>
Chapter 68 The Combinatorial Auction ¤ This chapter summarizes a market mechanism for a combinatorial sealed-bid auction that was motivated by the airport slot problem under which bidders would submit bids for packages of slots that support their schedules. Under this scheme, the elemental resources would be allocated only in the form of those combinations desired by the bidders. Under this scenario, the purpose of an aftermarket would be to adjust for allocation errors in the primary market (the objective in the experiments reported below), or to adjust for post-primary market changes in demand. Although this form of combinatorial auction was never applied to airport runway rights, the issue of pricing runway slots has arisen in the new century as a means of managing airport congestion. The combinatorial procedure below is not generally incentive compatible; i.e., if any bidder desires multiple units of either packages or elements, or multiple units of any element, then it may be to a bidder's advantage to strategically underbid the true value of a package.	<gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8>
Chapter 21. Advances in Forecasting under Instability ¤ The forecasting literature has identified two important issues: (i) several predictors have substantial and statistically significant predictive content, although only sporadically, and it is unclear whether this predictive content can be exploited reliably; (ii) in-sample predictive content does not necessarily translate into out-of-sample predictive ability, nor ensures the stability of the predictive relationship over time. The objective of this chapter is to understand what we have learned about forecasting in the presence of instabilities. The empirical evidence raises a multitude of questions. If in-sample tests provide poor guidance to out-of-sample forecasting ability, what should researchers do? If there are statistically significant instabilities in Granger-causality relationships, how do researchers establish whether there is any Granger-causality at all? If there is substantial instability in predictive relationships, how do researchers establish which model is the “best” forecasting model? And finally, if a model forecasts poorly, why is that and how should researchers proceed to improve the forecasting models? In this chapter, we answer these questions by discussing various methodologies for inference as well as estimation that have been recently proposed in the literature.	<gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4047390-9> <gnd:4059787-8> <gnd:4066399-1>

Chapter 14. Choice Under Uncertainty: Empirical Methods and Experimental Results ¤ This chapter is concerned with the empirical exploration and experimental investigation of the numerous theories of decision making under uncertainty proposed in the earlier chapters of this handbook. This chapter begins with static theories of behavior under risk ; then we look at dynamic theories under risk; and finally look at decision making under ambiguity (the theory of which is largely static at this point in time). As we proceed through the chapter we will come across a number of methodological issues concerning the conduct of experiments, and relating to the econometric analysis of the data. These issues will be elaborated further in the concluding subsections of the appropriate sections and in a concluding section at the end of the chapter.	<gnd:4186957-6> <gnd:4120934-5> <gnd:4070864-0> <gnd:4135592-1> <gnd:4050133-4>

Chapter 8. Advances in Numerical Dynamic Programming and New Applications ¤ Dynamic programming is the essential tool in dynamic economic analysis. Problems such as portfolio allocation for individuals and optimal economic growth are typical examples. Numerical methods typically approximate the value function. Recent work has focused on making numerical methods more stable, and more efficient in its use of information. This chapter presents two examples where numerical dynamic programming is applied to high-dimensional problems from finance and the integration of climate and economic systems.	<gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4112736-5>
Chapter 5. Insurance and Insurance Markets ¤ Kenneth Arrow and Karl Borch published several important articles in the early 1960s that can be viewed as the beginning of modern economic analysis of insurance activity. This chapter reviews the main theoretical and empirical contributions in insurance economics since that time. The review begins with the role of utility, risk, and risk aversion in the insurance literature and summarizes work on the demand for insurance, insurance and resource allocation, moral hazard, and adverse selection. It then turns to financial pricing models of insurance and to analyses of price volatility and underwriting cycles; insurance price regulation; insurance company capital adequacy and capital regulation; the development of insurance securitization and insurance-linked securities; and the efficiency, distribution, organizational form, and governance of insurance organizations.	<gnd:4186957-6> <gnd:4070864-0> <gnd:4050133-4> <gnd:4135592-1> <gnd:4120934-5>
Climate Change and Africa ¤ Climate change is a major threat to sustainable growth and development in Africa, and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Africa is particularly vulnerable to climate change because of its overdependence on rain-fed agriculture, compounded by factors such as widespread poverty and weak capacity. The main longer-term impacts include: changing rainfall patterns affecting agriculture and reducing food security; worsening water security; decreasing fish resources in large lakes due to rising temperature; shifting vectorborne diseases; rising sea level affecting low-lying coastal areas with large populations; and rising water stress.	<gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4113450-3> <gnd:4066399-1>
Chapter 70 Trading Institutions and Emission Allowances ¤ In the frictionless world of theory without transaction costs, allowance trading offers the potential of billions of dollars in savings when compared to traditional command and control regulation. It is therefore not surprising that regulators have embraced this approach in recent years to reduce the pain of achieving specific environmental objectives. This short review highlights the fact that policy-makers must recognize that the devil is in the details, and that several intermediate steps are necessary when translating these plans and schemes from the theorist's blackboard to the field. For example, regulators need to carefully consider the design of any new trading institutions and allowance characteristics. Failure to consider these details can lead to poorly designed trading institutions such as the EPA auction which can slow the development of the market and require redesign after only several years of operation. By contrast, sufficient consideration of incentives and sponsoring laboratory experiments when appropriate can lead to a better design of allowance characteristics such as in the RECLAIM program.	<gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4124477-1>
Chapter 39 Information Cascade Experiments ¤ This chapter focuses on the information cascade experiments. The concept of an information cascade can be explained in the context of a specific numerical example that was used in initial laboratory experiments. The predictions are publicly announced as they are made, but individuals are not able to observe others' private signals. The first person in the sequence must predict only on the basis of private information. All of the analysis is based on the assumption that others do not make mistakes, and we conjecture that the anomalous behavior patterns may be explained by incorporating the possibility of decision error. When others may make errors, the option of following one's own information becomes more attractive. Even though these applications are motivated by naturally occurring institutions, the usefulness of field data is limited by the fact that the private information of traders and/or betters typically cannot be observed. Laboratory experiments are particularly useful in examining herding behavior because private information is observed by the experimenter and the flow is information can be precisely controlled.	<gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4066528-8>
The elephant in the room: The need to deal with what banks do ¤ Contagion risk and counterparty failure have been the main hallmarks of the current crisis. While some large diversified banks that focused mainly on commercial banking survived very well, others suffered crippling losses. Sound corporate governance and strong riskmanagement culture should enable banks to avoid excessive leverage and risk taking. The question is whether there is a better way, via leverage rules or rules on the structures of large conglomerates, to ensure volatile investment banking functions do not dominate the future stability of the commercial banking and financial intermediation environment that is so critical for economic activity. While there is a main consensus on the need for reform of capital rules, dynamic provisioning, better co-operation for future crises, centralised trading of derivatives etc., the question is whether such reforms will be sufficient if they do not address contagion and counterparty risk directly. The world outside of policy making is waiting for a fundamental reassessment of banks’ business models: what banks are supposed to do and how they compete with each other. It is the “elephant in the room” on which some policy makers have not yet had the time or inclination to focus. This article emphasises not only the need for transparent and comparable accounting rules and for improvements in corporate governance, but also supports the imposition of a group leverage ratio to provide a binding capital constraint (that Basel riskweighted rules have been unable to achieve) and proposes a Non- Operating Holding Company Structure (NOHC) – reforms that are essential to deal with contagion and counterparty risk that are so integral to the ‘too big to fail’ issue.	<gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4068097-6>
Chapter 31 Experiments with Arbitrage Across Assets ¤ Theoretical finance is essentially the study of inter-temporal arbitrage, but it is often interesting also to analyze relationships between asset prices. Cross-sectional analysis makes it possible to purge both field and laboratory data of unobservable changes in time-varying fundamentals. Also, although backward induction is at the heart of asset- pricing theory, subjects may find its logic dauntingly complex. They may be able to perceive cross-asset arbitrage opportunities much more readily. Foreign exchange markets are also environments where arbitrage across assets is salient. Indeed, purchasing power parity, uncovered interest parity, and covered interest parity are all descriptions of arbitrage across currencies, goods, and interest-bearing assets. Thus a simple theory of cross-asset arbitrage predicts the bluered exchange rate well, while the dollar price of each asset is quite different from its fundamental. Triangular arbitrage, a fundamental aspect of exchange rate theory, holds in these data, while a simple notion of inter-temporal arbitrage is soundly refuted.	<gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4139716-2>
Governance and investment of sovereign and public pension reserve funds in selected OECD countries ¤ Many countries around the world are partly prefunding their otherwise pay-as-you-go (PAYG) financed social security systems by establishing or further developing existing public pension reserve funds (PPRFs). Most OECD countries have put in place internal and external governance mechanisms and investment controls to ensure the sound management of these funds and better isolate them from undue political influence. These structures and mechanisms are in line with OECD standards of good pension fund governance and investment management. In particular, the requirements of accountability, suitability and transparency are broadly met by these reserve funds. However, some specific details of the funds’ governance and investment management could be improved in a few countries, such as enhancing the expertise in the funds’ governing boards and constraining discretionary interventions by government. Such reforms will ultimately raise the long-term investment performance of the funds and the solvency of social security systems.	<gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4073788-3>
Extension of the Ahiezer-Kac Determinant Formula to the Case of Real-Valued Symbols with Two Real Zeros ¤ The Fredholm determinant asymptotics for self-adjoint convolution operators on finite intervals with real symbols vanishing on the real axis is studied. Explicit formulae are obtained in the case where the symbol satisfies the generalized zero index condition and has only two simple zeros of analytic type. These formulae are direct extensions of the AhiezerKacSzegö limit theorem which, in particular, take into account the oscillating character of the asymptotics.	<gnd:4037944-9>
Chapter 13 The Matching Market Institution ¤ The matching market (MM) institution is a two-sided auction procedure that collects bids from buyers and asks from sellers, and iteratively matches the highest remaining bid with the highest remaining ask less than or equal to it. This chapter summarizes a first laboratory experiment comparing the MM institution to the natural alternative, the uniform price (UP) or single call market.the chapter found that, compared with UP, MM has lower efficiency, has about the same average volume but greater variability, and gives sellers a smaller fraction of the surplus. Compared either to the competitive equilibrium (CE) theoretical benchmark or to the actual performance of the uniform price (UP) market institution, the MM institution fails to deliver on its main selling point: that it will generate higher trading volume. It does generate considerably more variable volume but average trading volume is quite close to the CE benchmark and to the UP average. A secondary selling point is that the MM will offer sellers a larger share of the surplus.	<gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4124477-1>
Chapter 8. Economic Analysis of Risk and Uncertainty Induced by Health Shocks: A Review and Extension ¤ We review and extend the economic analysis of mitigating risks in the presence of health shocks. The existing literature is mainly focused on how shocks affect consumption, for example through their impact on medical spending. We argue that this focus is limited in that shocks to health itself, rather than consumption, may be more damaging. Since human capital is not transferrable, health risk—unlike medical spending risk—cannot be pooled through traditional insurance. Instead, medical innovation is the main method of achieving smoothing in health across disease states. We explore the welfare implications of this “health insurance” view of medical R&amp;D . We also review the evidence on how FDA regulations affect overall health risk, as regulations lower health risks of products ex post but raise risk ex ante by discouraging medical innovation. More analysis seems warranted on the relative value of programs aimed at mitigating shocks to health itself by stimulating innovation versus health insurance reforms aimed mainly at consumption smoothing.	<gnd:4120934-5> <gnd:4050133-4> <gnd:4070864-0> <gnd:4186957-6> <gnd:4135592-1>
Chapter 19 Experiments in Decentralized Monopoly Restraint ¤ This chapter focuses on laboratory experimental examinations of a particular class of institutions, policies or mechanisms of monopoly control. These are mechanisms which take the existence of a monopoly as a given and ask how might the abuses of monopoly be controlled in a decentralized manner. The most prevalent form of monopoly control in the United States for many decades was cost-based rate of return regulation. The academic and practitioner critics of rate of return regulation were numerous. In general, the arguments were that the incentives in the rate of return regulatory process itself led to distortions relative to standard measures of efficiency. This chapter focuses exclusively on experiments that do more than simply reform centralized price regulation, that is, we examine decentralized forms of monopoly control.	<gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4015999-1>
Expanded guarantees for banks : Benefits, costs and exit issues ¤ This article argues that the expansion of existing and the introduction of new guarantees for financial institutions has been a key element of the policy response to the recent financial crisis. Essentially, the government expanded its role as the provider of the safety net for banks by adopting the function of a guarantor of last resort. Among the various policy response measures, the expansion of guarantees has the benefit of entailing lower upfront fiscal costs relative to other options. Guarantees are not without cost however. Even if they do not generate significant upfront fiscal costs, they create contingent fiscal liabilities. Other potential costs include those arising from distortions to competition and incentives (moral hazard). For example, there may be a perception that similar guarantees will always be made available at low costs. The fact that the expansion of guarantees has not been as closely co-ordinated across borders as might have been desired has resulted in additional costs. To avoid additional costs arising from inconsistencies in exit strategies, close communication and coordination regarding pricing and timing issues is required, especially as a more formal framework for the public provision of insurance would still need to be developed.	<gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4068097-6>

Overview of Advances in Risk Management of Government Debt ¤ Modern risk management has become an important tool for achieving strategic debt targets in the OECD area. In essence, risk management policies, based on the use of formal methods, are now an integral part of debt management in most OECD jurisdictions. In general, risk management tolerances and policies are approved (and often set) by the Ministry of Finance (or other appropriate Ministry). This strategy about risks entails an explicit political decision about the trade-off between costs and risks. The actual risk management operation is often run at a separate agency responsible for management of the sovereign debt or at the central bank if it manages the debt, and is typically segregated from other treasury...	<gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4067488-5>
Chapter 1. Forecasting Inflation ¤ This chapter discusses recent developments in inflation forecasting. We perform a horse-race among a large set of traditional and recently developed forecasting methods, and discuss a number of principles that emerge from this exercise. We find that judgmental survey forecasts outperform model-based ones, often by a wide margin. A very simple forecast that is just a glide path between the survey assessment of inflation in the current-quarter and the long-run survey forecast value turns out to be competitive with the actual survey forecast and thereby does about as well or better than model-based forecasts. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of some specific prediction methods, including forecasts based on the Phillips curve and based on dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models, in greater detail. We also consider measures of inflation expectations taken from financial markets and the tradeoff between forecasting aggregates and disaggregates.	<gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4066399-1>
Chapter 21 ACE Models of Endogenous Interactions ¤ Various approaches used in Agent-based Computational Economics (ACE) to model endogenously determined interactions between agents are discussed. This concerns models in which agents not only (learn how to) play some (market or other) game, but also (learn to) decide with whom to do that (or not).	<gnd:4112736-5> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4011152-0>
Chapter 25 Agent-based Models of Innovation and Technological Change ¤ This chapter discusses the potential of the agent-based computational economics approach for the analysis of processes of innovation and technological change. It is argued that, on the one hand, several genuine properties of innovation processes make the possibilities offered by agent-based modelling particularly appealing in this field, and that, on the other hand, agent-based models have been quite successful in explaining sets of empirical stylized facts, which are not well accounted for by existing representative-agent equilibrium models. An extensive survey of agent-based computational research dealing with issues of innovation and technological change is given and the contribution of these studies is discussed. Furthermore a few pointers towards potential directions of future research are given.	<gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4011152-0> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4112736-5>
Chapter 9. Analysis of Numerical Errors ¤ This paper provides a general framework for the quantitative analysis of stochastic dynamic models. We review the convergence properties of some numerical algorithms and available methods to bound approximation errors. We then address the convergence and accuracy properties of the simulated moments. We study both optimal and non-optimal economies. Optimal economies generate smooth laws of motion defining Markov equilibria, and can be approximated by recursive methods with contractive properties. Non-optimal economies, however, lack existence of continuous Markov equilibria, and need to be simulated by numerical methods with weaker approximation properties.	<gnd:4112736-5> <gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4132280-0>
Financial Education and Annuities ¤ Life annuities – financial products that help individuals convert a lump-sum of wealth into a guaranteed life-long income stream – have an important role to play in providing a secure source of retirement income. Because annuities provide valuable insurance against longevity risk, much of the theoretical work in economics suggests that life annuities ought to comprise a large share of the retirement portfolios of most households. Yet around the world, voluntary annuity markets remain small.	<gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4113450-3>
Chapter 115 On the Performance of the Lottery Procedure for Controlling Risk Preferences ¤ This chapter describes the lottery procedure for inducing preferences over units of experimental exchange and show how it is supported by several experiments on behavior in simple contexts. This chapter reviews various evidence from a set of paired choice and pricing tasks designed to determine whether subjects' revealed preferences over gambles are consistent with attempted risk preference induction. There is strong support for the performance of inducing when subjects choose between paired gambles. Subjects induced to be risk seeking nearly always choose the riskier gamble, while those induced to be risk averse choose the less risky one. There is similar support for pricing gambles, but the strength of the effect is a function of the variance of the gambles. This is consistent with other experimental evidence about the importance of saliency. Risk preferences matter little when there is little risk As risk increases, risk preferences should become more important in the experiments. Subjects appear to price gambles more consistently with their induced risk preferences as variance increases.	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4015999-1>
Chapter 22. The New Keynesian Approach to Dynamic General Equilibrium Modeling: Models, Methods and Macroeconomic Policy Evaluation ¤ This chapter aims to provide a hands-on approach to New Keynesian models and their uses for macroeconomic policy analysis. It starts by reviewing the origins of the New Keynesian approach, the key model ingredients and representative models. Building blocks of current-generation dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models are discussed in detail. These models address the famous Lucas critique by deriving behavioral equations systematically from the optimizing and forward-looking decision making of households and firms subject to well-defined constraints. State-of-the-art methods for solving and estimating such models are reviewed and presented in examples. The chapter goes beyond the mere presentation of the most popular benchmark model by providing a framework for model comparison along with a database that includes a wide variety of macroeconomic models. Thus, it offers a convenient approach for comparing new models to available benchmarks and for investigating whether particular policy recommendations are robust to model uncertainty. Such robustness analysis is illustrated by evaluating the performance of simple monetary policy rules across a range of recently estimated models, including some with financial market imperfections, and by reviewing recent comparative findings regarding the magnitude of government spending multipliers. The chapter concludes with a discussion of important objectives for ongoing and future research using the New Keynesian framework.	<gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4210294-7> <gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4065341-9> <gnd:4079351-5> <gnd:4224214-9>
Chapter 32 Out-of-Equilibrium Economics and Agent-Based Modeling ¤ Standard neoclassical economics asks what agents' actions, strategies, or expectations are in equilibrium with (consistent with) the outcome or pattern these behaviors aggregatively create. Agent-based computational economics enables us to ask a wider question: how agents' actions, strategies, or expectations might react to—might endogenously change with—the patterns they create. In other words, it enables us to examine how the economy behaves out of equilibrium, when it is not at a steady state. This out-of-equilibrium approach is not a minor adjunct to standard economic theory; it is economics done in a more general way. When examined out of equilibrium, economic patterns sometimes simplify into a simple, homogeneous equilibrium of standard economics; but just as often they show perpetually novel and complex behavior. The static equilibrium approach suffers two characteristic indeterminacies: it cannot easily resolve among multiple equilibria; nor can it easily model individuals' choices of expectations. Both problems are ones of formation (of an equilibrium and of an “ecology” of expectations, respectively), and when analyzed in formation—that is, out of equilibrium—these anomalies disappear.	<gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4112736-5> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4011152-0>
Chapter 16 Agent-Based Computational Economics: A Constructive Approach to Economic Theory ¤ Economies are complicated systems encompassing micro behaviors, interaction patterns, and global regularities. Whether partial or general in scope, studies of economic systems must consider how to handle difficult real-world aspects such as asymmetric information, imperfect competition, strategic interaction, collective learning, and the possibility of multiple equilibria. Recent advances in analytical and computational tools are permitting new approaches to the quantitative study of these aspects. One such approach is Agent-based Computational Economics (ACE) , the computational study of economic processes modeled as dynamic systems of interacting agents. This chapter explores the potential advantages and disadvantages of ACE for the study of economic systems. General points are concretely illustrated using an ACE model of a two-sector decentralized market economy. Six issues are highlighted: Constructive understanding of production, pricing, and trade processes; the essential primacy of survival; strategic rivalry and market power; behavioral uncertainty and learning; the role of conventions and organizations; and the complex interactions among structural attributes, institutional arrangements, and behavioral dispositions.	<gnd:4011152-0> <gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4112736-5> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4066528-8>
Chapter 2 From Market Jaws to the Newton Method: The Geometry of How a Market Can Solve Systems of Equations ¤ This chapter focuses on the geometry of how a market can solve systems of equations from market jaws to the newton method. Since market equilibrium can be interpreted as a solution to a system of equations, price discovery, as it called in the language of market makers, can be viewed as having found the solution. Of course the information needed to even formulate the equations does not exist in one place so the idea that markets are searching for the solution to a system of equations as a numerical process would search, cannot be taken literally. The empirical foundation for jaws can be found in many forms. When markets are on the way up the number of bids typically exceeds the number of asks. When markets are on the way down, the number of asks typically exceeds the number of bids. This is exactly the concept of pushing referred to Plott.	<gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4015999-1>
New challenges in the use of governement debt issuance procedures, techniques and policies in OECD markets ¤ Government debt issuance procedures and policies differ across OECD jurisdictions, in particular in terms of technical standards for selling techniques, primary dealer systems and other primary market arrangements. However, the increased integration of global financial markets (including the jump in the integration of European government debt markets since the introduction of the Euro) has been an important catalyst in the standardisation of the structure and types of instruments as well as the convergence of general procedures and policies for the issuance government debt. In many countries, the ongoing credit and economic crises have prompted a review of existing issuance procedures and policies. This article provide (a) a survey of the general characteristics of government debt issuance procedures and related primary dealer (PD) arrangements in the OECD area; and (b) an evaluation of the challenges and changes generated by the impact of the turmoil in global financial markets on issuance procedures and policies.	<gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4068097-6>
Increasing side-channel resistance by netlist randomization and FPGA-based reconfiguration ¤ Modern FPGAs are equipped with the possibility of Partial Reconfiguration (PR) which along with other benefits can be used to enhance the security of cryptographic implementations. This feature requires development of alternative designs to be exchanged during run-time. In this work, we propose dynamically alterable circuits by exploring netlist randomization which can be utilized with PR as a countermeasure against physical attacks, in particular side-channel attacks. The proposed approach involves modification of an AES implementation at the netlist level in order to create circuit variants which are functionally identical but structurally different. In preliminary experiments, power traces of these variants have been shuffled to replicate the effect of partial reconfiguration. With these dynamic circuits, our experimental results show an increase in the resistance against power side-channel attacks by a factor of [Tilde] 12.6 on a Xilinx ZYNQ UltraScale+ device.	<gnd:4347749-5> <gnd:1135808198> <gnd:4075860-6> <gnd:4238872-7> <gnd:4396978-1>
Chapter 103 Utility Maximization ¤ A testable form of the utility hypothesis results from identifying necessary condition(s) for the existence of a utility function that rationalizes the price and quantity data, meaning a utility function that correctly predicts choices that do not violate an agent's budget constraint. Possible inconsistencies with utility-maximizing choices are of no clear economic interest unless the objects of choice are scarce. In order for the chosen commodities to be scarce, the agent's budget constraint must be binding. Hence, a specific testable form of the utility hypothesis must incorporate scarcity. There are various ways to incorporate scarcity in the model of the utility-maximizing agent. The model of the utility-maximizing agent is central to theoretical and applied economics and to economics education. But how can one test for the presence of utility maximization? More specifically, how can one test the utility hypothesis, defined as the hypothesis that real economic agents behave as if they maximize utility functions subject to binding budget constraints?	<gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4252654-1>
Tax and good governance ¤ Taxation is fundamental to sustainable development. The ability to raise revenue and manage public expenditure is of core importance to every state. However, taxation plays another crucial role which has been often overlooked or underestimated in the past: as a catalyst for more responsive and accountable governments. This article explains why international taxation is a “missing link” in the development-statebuilding process and offers an important route for building effective and self-supporting states. It explores the challenges for developing countries with regard to international taxation and how future work proposed by the OECD will address these challenges. The article concludes with an assessment of what more the international community can do to better target aid towards building the capacity of developing countries’ tax administrations.	<gnd:4113450-3> <gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4066493-4>
Chapter 23 Some Results on Anti-Competitive Behavior in Multi-Unit Ascending Price Auctions ¤ This chapter focuses on the some results on anti-competitive behavior in multi-unit ascending price auctions. Depending on the environment and institutional details, demand reduction and bidder collusion may occur under both ascending-price and sealed bid type markets. The chapter focuses on ascending price auctions; results on the sealed bids are mentioned only for comparison. Unless stated otherwise, it considers independent, private value auctions. Two frequently discussed kinds of anti-competitive behavior in multi-object auction markets are demand reduction and bidder collusion. Although the two are closely interrelated, distinction is often made along the following lines. Demand reduction occurs due to monopsony power of a buyer demanding multiple units of a homogeneous good in a uniform price auction. The buyer is essentially able to affect auction prices by reducing his or her demand. Coordination among buyers may not be necessary.	<gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4124477-1>
Financial Markets Highlights - May 2007 ¤ There was a sizeable correction in financial markets in February.

Chapter 21. Income Distribution in Computable General Equilibrium Modeling ¤ Studying the poverty and income distribution effects of macroeconomic policies or shocks requires a methodology that accounts on the one hand for the nature of the policy or shock being studied and their aggregate impact on the economy and, on the other hand, the heterogeneity of their overall effects among individuals or households at the micro level. Standard evaluation methods are of little use here. Methods based on the comparison between individuals exposed and not exposed to the policy or shock are clearly not applicable since, by definition, all individuals are affected by any policy with some macroeconomic dimension. The evaluation methodology thus needs to rely not only on a micro but also on a macro counterfactual within some kind of general equilibrium setting. This chapter reviews the growing literature that addresses this challenge by combining macro and micro modeling in various ways. It describes existing methodologies and their underpinning links with economic theory and presents some applications. The chapter is structured according to the nature of the computable general equilibrium (CGE) macro model being used and how the macro and micro components of the methodology are connected together and/or integrated. It thus starts from a simple framework where the two components are handled separately: the CGE model is static and Walrasian and the unidirectional link from the macro to the micro component essentially consists of changes in prices. It then moves to more integrated variants, where results from both the CGE and micro models are looped back and forth, and also to non-Walrasian specifications where both price and aggregate quantity changes link the macro and the micro components. Finally the chapter considers dynamic settings where the static CGE model on the macro side is replaced by a recursive-dynamic model, whereas the micro data base is allowed to change over time through both exogenous demographic and policy-induced endogenous economic transitions. Illustrations of that approach are drawn from the Global Income Distribution Dynamics (GIDD) model recently developed at the World Bank.	<gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4224214-9> <gnd:4210294-7> <gnd:4079351-5> <gnd:4065341-9> <gnd:4358095-6>
Chapter 59 Self-centered Fairness in Games with More Than Two Players ¤ The concept of self-centered fairness, as embodied in ERC preferences, organizes the data from the two-person ultimatum and dictator game, as well as the Gthvan Damme game, the market game, the dictator game with multiple recipients, and the fixed total sacrifice effect as observed in this chapter. An interesting theme for future empirical and theoretical research, particularly in games with more than two players, is the identification of the appropriate reference group. While this task is rather obvious in the simple games considered here, this need not to be true in more complex social environments. A nice example of an environment with competing reference groups can be found in European parliaments. The income distribution of the Europe-parliamentarians in Brussels is highly unequal. Due to the conﬂicting reference groups and given the differing incomes of the parliamentarians across nations, it is far from obvious what constitutes a fair income distribution within the European parliament.	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4124477-1>
Trade and Innovation in the Korean Information and Communication Technology Sector ¤ This case study analyses the effect of trade and investment liberalisation on Korea’s information and communication technology (ICT) sector and finds that trade and investment have played a crucial role in innovation in this sector. In the initial stages of development, imported capital goods and components, joint ventures, licensing and Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) contracts were important sources of technology and exports were key to obtain the necessary economies of scale for innovation. Free trade and investment policies in the 1990s and stronger protection of intellectual property rights have led to an increase in R&D and innovation, which in turn has led to the transformation of Korea into a knowledge-based economy.

Chapter 91 Institutional Modifications of Majority Rule ¤ This chapter states that institutions and preferences are hopelessly confounded with the world of politics. Starting with data about institutional variation and variation in policy outcomes, it is impossible to make any hard and fast inferences about the impact of institutional features on policy outcomes. Do the states with a line-item veto spend less on certain budget categories because of the line-item veto, or because those states have electorates that prefer both the line-item veto and those expenditure patterns? Disentangling cause, effect, and spurious correlation can be virtually impossible with natural data. Experiments are uniquely suited for examining institutional effects. The experimenter can hold preferences constant and randomly assign subjects to treatments distinguished only by variations in institutional rules; resulting differences in behavior may be ascribed to the institutional differences with a degree of confidence that would be impossible in natural political settings.	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1>
Outlook for the Securitisation Market ¤ Securitisation issuance has slumped in recent years, with the market having become increasingly dependent on central bank and government support in both Europe and the United States. Despite facing a number of threats that could inhibit a recovery in the shorter term, the securitisation market is expected to recover over a longer term horizon. Funding costs have improved, but investor confidence in the asset class remains weak, and the impact of regulatory reform is as yet difficult to fully assess. A long-term sustainable recovery for the securitisation market remains in the hands of regulators and policy makers. They must be awake to the possibility that a recovery in securitisation markets could be a prerequisite to unlocking credit markets in general and supporting a wider global economic recovery.	<gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4073788-3>
Chapter 12.

Chapter 3 Computational methods for macroeconometric models ¤ This chapter discusses computational methods for the estimation and analysis of macroeconometric models. The chapter focuses on methods that, while possibly computationally routine, are not trivial. Most of the methods discussed are methods for complete models. The results reported in Fair and Taylor (1990) using the methods discussed in this chapter are encouraging regarding the use of models with rational expectations. FIML estimation seems computationally feasible using the procedure of computing derivatives, for the expectations and stochastic simulation , when done in the manner described in the chapter. FIML estimation is particularly important, because it takes into account all the nonlinear restrictions implied by the rational expectations hypothesis. It is hoped that the methods discussed in this chapter will open the way for many more tests of models with rational expectations.	<gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4112736-5> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4011152-0>

Chapter 11. Economics of Natural Catastrophe Risk Insurance ¤ Economic and insured losses from natural catastrophes have increased significantly in recent years and are challenging the way catastrophe risk insurance markets operate today. This chapter focuses on how insurance in combination with other policy tools can reduce losses from natural disasters and provide funds to aid the recovery process following catastrophic events. To address this issue we discuss conditions of insurability and how insurers have behaved with respect to extreme events in the United States. We then examine the demand for homeowners insurance and why there is limited interest by many individuals in voluntarily purchasing and maintaining coverage against catastrophe losses. We introduce two guiding principles for insurance: Premiums should reflect risk and Dealing with equity and affordability issues , and discuss several options for providing coverage against large-scale risks that embrace these principles including offering fixed-price multi-year insurance contracts as a complement to annual policies.	<gnd:4050133-4> <gnd:4120934-5> <gnd:4186957-6> <gnd:4135592-1> <gnd:4070864-0>
The subtrace order and counting first-order logic ¤ We study the subtrace relation among Mazurkiewicz traces which generalizes the much-studied subword order. Here, we consider the 2-variable fragment of a counting extension of first-order logic with regular predicates. It is shown that all definable trace languages are effectively recognizable implying that validity of a sentence of this logic is decidable (this problem is known to be undecidable for virtually all stronger logics already for the subword relation).	<gnd:4002498-2> <gnd:4120591-1>
Consumer Protection and Financial Innovation : A Few Basic Propositions ¤ The issue of financial innovation and consumer protection is mostly about access and suitability. Access refers to a situation in which affordable, mainstream financial products are available to all segments of the population across the range of income levels and demographic characteristics. Suitability addresses the appropriateness of the products for particular consumer groups. Innovative products will tend generally to be either positive for access to finance or neutral. But products that actually result in increased access to finance may nonetheless still raise suitability issues. Innovative products can be particularly difficult for retail consumers to understand and better financial education is needed to help address financial illiteracy. In addition, service providers should have appropriate internal controls to minimise the chances that consumers take on inappropriate exposures. Even the best disclosures, alone, may not be adequate, so to avoid situations in which retail investors become involved with unsuitable products, institutions should be “encouraged” to develop sufficient measures for client protection as part of their product development activities. Stricter penalties should be used when needed to address mis-selling, fraud or firm misconduct. JEL Classification: G01, G28, G38.

Chapter 51 Coordination Failure in Market Statistic Games ¤ A central question in economics is how do markets coordinate the behavior of anonymous decision makers in a many person decentralized economy. Economic theory has traditionally addressed the question using the equilibrium method, which abstracts away from an important aspect of the general coordination problem, because it assumes an equilibrium. For abstract games, an equilibrium is defined as an assignment to each player of a strategy that is best for him when the others use the strategies assigned to them. The relevance of this abstract mutual consistency requirement for economic modeling is an open question. The requirement has two related problems: disequilibrium and coordination failure. First, the mutual consistency requirement of an equilibrium assignment is not an implication of individual rationality, but an additional strong assumption. Second, there is often more than one equilibrium assignment. For example, multiple Pareto ranked equilibria arise in both macroeconomic models with production, search, or trading externalities and microeconomic models of monopolistic competition, technology adoption and diffusion, and manufacturing with non-convexities.	<gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4124477-1>
Chapter 65 Payoff Uncertainty and Cooperation in Finitely-repeated Prisoner's Dilemma Games ¤ Several of the results reported here broadly support theories of sequential equilibria. In particular, at least four pieces of data indicate that game theory's structurally-oriented models predict some of the reasons for individuals' play in the prisoner's dilemma game: (1) more cooperation resulted when a cooperative equilibrium existed; (2) players cooperated more overall and more in the first round in SW than in SS; (3) Column was more cooperative than Row on the first trial; and (4) the SW Column Uncertain condition produced the most end game cooperation. Unfortunately, these effects only explain part of the picture. In essence, even after considering the effects of uncertainty, the original issue still remains: considerable cooperation resulted when no cooperative equilibria exist.	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1>
Private pensions and the financial crisis : How to ensure adequate retirement income from DC pension plans ¤ The current economic and financial crisis has shaken confidence in funded pension systems in general and in defined contribution (DC) pension plans in particular. The crisis has highlighted the impact of market conditions on retirement savings accumulated in DC pension plans and the uncertainty as to whether those retirement savings may prove adequate to finance retirement – particularly for those close to retirement. The purpose of this paper is to provide recommendations on how to ensure adequate retirement income from DC pension plans. In this context, this paper addresses three main questions: 1) How much do people need to save? 2) How can the effects of market risk on DC pension plans be alleviated? 3) How can retirement income be protected during the payout phase? The analysis concludes that in order to deliver adequate retirement income from DC pension plans with a certain degree of certainty, there is a need for comprehensive measures which include: higher contributions; increasing the contribution period by postponing retirement; setting as default options relatively conservative investment policies including life-cycle strategies; and managing risk in the payout phase with inflationindexed life annuities.	<gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4067488-5>
Chapter 6. Forecasting Stock Returns ¤ We survey the literature on stock return forecasting, highlighting the challenges faced by forecasters as well as strategies for improving return forecasts. We focus on U.S. equity premium forecastability and illustrate key issues via an empirical application based on updated data. Some studies argue that, despite extensive in-sample evidence of equity premium predictability, popular predictors from the literature fail to outperform the simple historical average benchmark forecast in out-of-sample tests. Recent studies, however, provide improved forecasting strategies that deliver statistically and economically significant out-of-sample gains relative to the historical average benchmark. These strategies – including economically motivated model restrictions, forecast combination, diffusion indices, and regime shifts – improve forecasting performance by addressing the substantial model uncertainty and parameter instability surrounding the data-generating process for stock returns. In addition to the U.S. equity premium, we succinctly survey out-of-sample evidence supporting U.S. cross-sectional and international stock return forecastability. The significant evidence of stock return forecastability worldwide has important implications for the development of both asset pricing models and investment management strategies.	<gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4066399-1>
Migration to and from Russia and South-East Europe : what does the future hold? ¤ Whereas Germany and Austria were the main destinations of Russians in the 1990s, recently Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Britain and Ireland became major destinations. Recent East European immigration was mainly directed to the Mediterranean countries to fill gaps in caretaking jobs. South-Eastern Europe and Moldova can be characterized as emigration-remittance-economies with large parts of the active population having migrated to the EU, Russia, Israel, Turkey, and the Gulf states. A distinct Russia-centered immigration system came into being during and after the dissolution of the Soviet empire. Although Russia’s population figures remained stable on balance, the country went through a far-reaching exchange of populations. In the future, the demographic downturn and the loss of manpower are the main challenges facing Russia and also neighbouring Ukraine and Belarus. Russia, with its new wealth due to soaring energy prices, will become a competitor for engineers, technicians, researchers, doctors, and also non-qualified workers.	<gnd:4113450-3> <gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4066493-4>
Chapter 24. Market Structure in Multisector General Equilibrium Models of Open Economies ¤ We provide an overview of several approaches to modeling market structure in multisector general equilibrium (MSGE) models, including both oligopoly and monopolistic competition. We emphasize open economy models and applications to international economic policy. We map out practical strategies for implementing variations on market structure, including functional forms and calibration strategies. We also identify areas that, in our view, are promising for further research. This includes both exploring the implications of moving away from average cost pricing models (including monopolistic competition) for labor market outcomes and inequality, and better methods for econometric estimation of parameters and confronting alternative forms of market structure against measures of model performance (specification testing).	<gnd:4210294-7> <gnd:4224214-9> <gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4065341-9> <gnd:4079351-5>
Chapter 94 Three-way Experimental Election Results: Strategic Voting, Coordinated Outcomes and Duverger's Law ¤ This chapter discusses here all used plurality voting. Thus, subjects could cast the vote vectors (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1) and (0, 0, 0) for the candidates O, G and B, respectively. After each election, the candidate with the most votes was declared the winner and subjects were paid accordingly. If a tie occurred between two or more candidates, the winner was selected randomly with the tied candidates having equal probabilities of being selected. After each election, subjects were informed of the number of votes received by each candidate, the election winner and their payoffs. The equilibria are based on expectations about (1) which candidates will be in contention in a close race (conditional tie probabilities) and (2) the values voters place on breaking ties in their favor. For these payoffs, only the relative strengths of candidates O and G matter in selecting the equilibrium. When O is perceived strong while G is weak, all majority voters vote for O.	<gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4066528-8>
Assessing Default Investment Strategies in Defined Contribution Pension Plans ¤ This paper assesses the relative performance of different investment strategies for different structures of the payout phase. In particular, it looks at whether the specific glide-path of life-cycle investment strategies and the introduction of dynamic features in the design of default investment strategies affect significantly retirement income outcomes. The analysis concludes that there is no “one-size-fits-all” default investment option. Life-cycle and dynamic investment strategies deliver comparable replacement rates adjusted by risk. However, life-cycle strategies that maintain a constant exposure to equities during most of the accumulation period, switching swiftly to bonds in the last decade before retirement, seem to produce better results and are easier to explain. Dynamic management strategies can provide somewhat higher replacement rates for a given level of risk than the more deterministic strategies, at least in the case of pay-outs in the form of variable withdrawals. The length of the contribution period also affects the ranking of the different investment strategies with life-cycle strategies having a stronger positive impact the shorter is the contribution period.	<gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4067488-5>
Chapter 18. Trade Elasticity Parameters for a Computable General Equilibrium Model ¤ Computable general equilibrium (CGE) models of international trade typically rely on econometrically estimated trade elasticities as model inputs. These elasticities vary by as much as an order of magnitude and there is no consensus on which elasticities to use. We review the literature estimating trade elasticities, focusing on several key considerations. What are the identifying assumptions used to separate supply and demand parameters? What is the nature of the shock to prices employed in the econometrics? And what is the time horizon over which trade responds to this shock? This discussion ranges from older reduced form approaches that use time-series variation in prices, to more recent work that identifies demand elasticities from trade costs or by using instruments in cross-section or panel data, and finally to prominent applications that separately identify supply and demand parameters in the absence of instruments. We also discuss recent theoretical developments from the literature on heterogeneous firms that complicate the interpretation of all these parameter estimates. Finally, we briefly survey a literature on structural estimation and link this to recent attempts to incorporate such theories in CGE applications. By elucidating the differences and similarities in these approaches we hope to guide the CGE practitioner in choosing elasticity estimates. We favor elasticities taken from econometric exercises that employ identifying assumptions and exploit shocks that are similar in nature to those imposed in the model experiment.	<gnd:4079351-5> <gnd:4065341-9> <gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4224214-9> <gnd:4210294-7>
Chapter 7. Agent-Based Models for Market Impact and Volatility ¤ Financial markets display a host of universal “stylized facts” begging for a scientific explanation: Excess volatility, fat tails, and clustered activity are well known and have been studied for many years. More microstructural stylized facts have recently emerged, for example the long memory of the order flow or the square-root dependence of impact on the volume of metaorders. Agent-based models are attempts to account for these stylized facts in a unified manner. Devising faithful microstructural ABMs would allow one to answer crucial questions, such as those related to market stability. Can large orders destabilize markets? Is HFT activity detrimental? Can destabilizing feedback loops be mitigated by adequate regulation? The present review paper summarizes recent work in that direction. We discuss in particular the Santa-Fe zero-intelligence model, which provides a very interesting benchmark, but suffers from important drawbacks as well, such as strong mean-reversion effects. One can enrich the Santa-Fe model as to reproduce both diffusive prices, and the square-root impact law. The underlying mechanism can be well understood in terms of a generic “reaction–diffusion” model for the dynamics of the liquidity, which can be solved analytically. Finally, we argue that the role of “information” is probably overstated in classical theories, while a picture based on a self-reflexive price-impacting order flow has many merits. The recent accumulation of microstructural stylized facts, allowing one to focus on the price formation mechanism, all but confirm that fundamental information plays a relatively minor role in the dynamics of financial markets, at least on short to medium time scales.	<gnd:4112736-5> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4148259-1>
Chapter 12 Forecasting with Breaks ¤ A structural break is viewed as a permanent change in the parameter vector of a model. Using taxonomies of all sources of forecast errors for both conditional mean and conditional variance processes, we consider the impacts of breaks and their relevance in forecasting models: (a) where the breaks occur after forecasts are announced; and (b) where they occur in-sample and hence pre-forecasting. The impact on forecasts depends on which features of the models are non-constant. Different models and methods are shown to fare differently in the face of breaks. While structural breaks induce an instability in some parameters of a particular model, the consequences for forecasting are specific to the type of break and form of model. We present a detailed analysis for cointegrated VARs, given the popularity of such models in econometrics. We also consider the detection of breaks, and how to handle breaks in a forecasting context, including ad hoc forecasting devices and the choice of the estimation period. Finally, we contrast the impact of structural break non-constancies with non-constancies due to non-linearity. The main focus is on macro-economic, rather than finance, data, and on forecast biases, rather than higher moments. Nevertheless, we show the relevance of some of the key results for variance processes. An empirical exercise ‘forecasts’ UK unemployment after three major historical crises.	<gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4047390-9> <gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4059787-8>
Chapter 57 Differences in the Economic Decisions of Men and Women: Experimental Evidence ¤ This chapter reviews the results from public goods, ultimatum, and dictator experiments for evidence of systematic differences in the behavior of men and women. While the results do not offer consistent evidence of behavioral differences between men and women, there are some intriguing patterns in the data. No significant evidence of systematic differences in the play of men and women is evident in those settings where subjects are exposed to risk. In those settings where risk is absent, systematic differences are revealed. This finding is conditioned by the level of risk.	<gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4139716-2>
Chapter 11 Forecasting with Trending Data ¤ This chapter examines the problems of dealing with trending type data when there is uncertainty over whether or not we really have unit roots in the data. This uncertainty is practical – for many macroeconomic and financial variables theory does not imply a unit root in the data however unit root tests fail to reject. This means that there may be a unit root or roots close to the unit circle. We first examine the differences between results using stationary predictors and nonstationary or near nonstationary predictors. Unconditionally, the contribution of parameter estimation error to expected loss is of the same order for stationary and nonstationary variables despite the faster convergence of the parameter estimates. However expected losses depend on true parameter values. We then review univariate and multivariate forecasting in a framework where there is uncertainty over the trend. In univariate models we examine trade-offs between estimators in the short and long run. Estimation of parameters for most models dominates imposing a unit root. It is for these models that the effects of nuisance parameters in the models is clearest. For multivariate models we examine forecasting from cointegrating models as well as examine the effects of erroneously assuming cointegration. It is shown that inconclusive theoretical implications arise from the dependence of forecast performance on nuisance parameters. Depending on these nuisance parameters imposing cointegration can be more or less useful for different horizons. The problem of forecasting variables with trending regressors – for example, forecasting stock returns with the dividend–price ratio – is evaluated analytically. The literature on distortion in inference in such models is reviewed. Finally, forecast evaluation for these problems is discussed.	<gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4047390-9> <gnd:4059787-8> <gnd:4132280-0>
Zambia: Sustaining Agricultural Diversification ¤ Zambia has a huge agricultural potential, which is still largely untapped, and could play a key role in growth and poverty eradication. Since the early 2000s, the government has implemented important reforms to promote privatisation and trade reforms, leading to higher investment and a strong growth in export crops such as cotton and horticulture. Despite this success, agricultural productivity, especially for food crops, remains low. The study shows that public resources to the agricultural sector have drastically decreased since the early 1990s, while private sector providers have not stepped in to fill the void left by the government disengagement from input supply and marketing. Despite a strong government commitment to reverse this trend, budget figures show that the share in total allocations dropped again in the 2008 budget. The study also argues that evaluations of past donor interventions in agriculture are not very positive, especially in terms of their sustainability. Projects often paid little attention to local absorptive and implementing capacity, had too narrow a focus on production and food security, and lacked an adequate understanding of the socio-economic conditions and behaviour of the target groups. Lack of co-ordination resulted in duplications and insufficient scale. A new generation of donor projects emerged in the early 2000s, with a strong focus on commercialisation and the development of market linkages, especially via contract farming. These projects have borne good results in terms of production volumes, quality standards and access to international commodity chains, as well as farmers’ income. The key challenge for donors is to scale up these success cases and ensure sustainability. The implementation of the Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia 2007-2010 is an opportunity to achieve a better division of labour, strengthen synergies on the ground and reduce transaction costs for government.

Chapter 66 Learning and Equilibrium in Games ¤ This chapter describes a very general approach to learning in games: experience-weighted attraction (EWA) learning. This approach strives to explain, for every choice in an experiment, how that choice arose from players' previous behavior and experience, using a general model which can be applied to most games with minimal customization and which predicts well out of sample. Sophisticated EWA includes important equilibrium concepts and many other learning models as special cases. The model therefore allows one- stop shopping for learning about the latest statistical comparisons of many different learning and equilibrium models . The model can also be adapted to field applications in which strategies and payoffs are often poorly-specified. The EWA model presented is a simplification (as are all the other adaptive models) because it does not permit players to anticipate learning by others. Omitting anticipation logically implies that players do not use information about the payoffs of other players, and that whether players are matched together repeatedly or randomly re-matched should not matter.	<gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4124477-1>
Chapter 47 Preferences and Property Rights in Ultimatum and Dictator Games ¤ The results demonstrated in this chapter quite clearly the impact of property rights on the shared expectations about appropriate proposer behavior in both ultimatum and dictator games. If the game is presented as division (which by one definition means literally to separate into equal parts by a divisor) and players are randomly assigned to positions, there is no legitimate reason why the proposer should be allowed to exploit his or her strategic advantage. The norm of equality applies and both players assume that is the operating norm.	<gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4124477-1>
Chapter 49 Social Distance and Reciprocity in Dictator Games ¤ This chapter defines various social distances as the degree of reciprocity that people believe is inherent within a social interaction. The greater the social distance, or isolation, between a person and others, the weaker is the scope for reciprocal relations. This chapter conjecture that the FHSS-V treatment defines a minimal increase in the social distance between proposer and recipient, as compared with the FHSS-R treatment. At the other pole, which we use to define the maximal social distance, the experiment is operated double blind, meaning that the procedures make it evident to all subjects that the experimenter, who makes and retains no record of the data by subject name, and any person who subsequently sees the data, can never know who made what decision. The objective of this procedure is to remove all social context in a manner that is transparent to the subjects.	<gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4066528-8>

Chapter 37 Reciprocity and Contract Enforcement ¤ This chapter reports the results of experiments that were designed to test the effectiveness of reciprocity as a contract enforcement device. It turns out that reciprocity generates a significant increase in effort levels relative to the prediction based on selfish preferences. Moreover, it gives rise to a considerable mitigation of the contract enforcement problem. The impact of reciprocity is particularly strong if both parties have possibilities to reciprocate. Hence, reciprocity can lead to considerable efficiency gains for the contracting parties. These results indicate that models that neglect reciprocity are likely to make wrong predictions and are, thus, seriously incomplete as a basis for normative advice.	<gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4015999-1>
Chapter 1 Bayesian Forecasting ¤ Bayesian forecasting is a natural product of a Bayesian approach to inference. The Bayesian approach in general requires explicit formulation of a model, and conditioning on known quantities, in order to draw inferences about unknown ones. In Bayesian forecasting, one simply takes a subset of the unknown quantities to be future values of some variables of interest. This chapter presents the principles of Bayesian forecasting, and describes recent advances in computational capabilities for applying them that have dramatically expanded the scope of applicability of the Bayesian approach. It describes historical developments and the analytic compromises that were necessary prior to recent developments, the application of the new procedures in a variety of examples, and reports on two long-term Bayesian forecasting exercises.	<gnd:4047390-9> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4059787-8>
The financial industry and challenges related to post-crises exit strategies ¤ Financial markets have recovered substantially but vulnerabilities remain significant. Ample liquidity may lead to new bubbles, particularly in some emerging markets, and uncertainties about government exit strategies and regulatory changes threaten a fledgling upswing. Co-ordination and communication of exit policies will be important, and exit from policy stimulus should not be precipitated at the current juncture. While financial institutions have increasingly obtained market financing and paid back state aid, the sector remains fragile; thus, such voluntary pay-backs should meet preconditions aimed at ensuring the soundness and sustainability of the concerned institutions’ balance sheets. At the same time, expectations of future writedowns and more stringent capital rules put pressure on bank lending more generally. Restarting securitisation to support lending would be important and could be fostered by government initiatives focussing on standardisation, transparency and due diligence to restore investor confidence. Regulatory reforms currently being proposed concern accounting rules, capital requirements and compensation issues. However, further reforms are required to address such systemic issues as moral hazard created by public support. Measures would include resolution mechanisms for large and systemically important banks as well as appropriately fire-walled business structures for the financial sector. Peer pressure via co-operation in international standard-setting and relevant bodies should help to keep the reform momentum, overcome political impediments to reform and maintain a level playing field.	<gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4073788-3>
What is the future for Latin American migration? ¤ International migration in Latin America today presents several features that will remain constant up to 2030, and new issues will emerge such as the growing feminisation of migration, the special case of indigenous people or human rights aspects. A concentrated migration pattern to the United States and Spain dominate the region. Although this will continue during the next decades, there will also be an incipient pattern of diversification of destinations (other European countries, Canada and Japan). Little progress has been made regarding the productive use of remittances, and the agreements and programmes targeted for temporary labour migration have not become widespread and also continue to include meagre migrant worker quotas. Today, the main destinations for intraregional migrants are Argentina, Costa Rica and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, but there are some modest signs of change in the future.	<gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4113450-3>
Residential Water Use ¤ Although 72% of the earth surface is covered by water, less than 1% of the world’s fresh water is directly accessible for human uses. Given humans’ water consumption patterns and the world population growth rate, these fresh water reserves have been shrinking all over the world at an alarming rate. There are currently more than 800 million people facing water scarcity and the United Nations project that approximately 2 to 7 billion people will be left without water by 2050; moreover, in the next 20 years, the average global supply of water per person will drop by one-third (see United Nations, 2003 and 2006).	<gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4113450-3> <gnd:4066493-4>
OECD Sovereign Borrowing Outlook No.3 ¤ OECD governments are facing ongoing challenges in the markets for government securities as a result of continued strong borrowing amid concerns about the pace of recovery and sovereign risk. The third OECD Sovereign Borrowing Outlook† Raising large volumes of funds at lowest cost, with acceptable roll-over risk, remains a great challenge for several countries, with most OECD debt managers continuing to rebalance the profile of debt portfolios by issuing more long-term instruments and moderating bill issuance. provides revised estimates for 2010 and projections for 2011. Gross borrowing needs of OECD governments are expected to reach almost USD 17.5 trillion in 2010, up from an earlier estimate of almost USD 16 trillion. In 2011, the borrowing needs of OECD sovereigns are projected to reach almost USD 19 trillion, nearly twice that of 2007. Against this backdro,p government debt ratios are expected to further deteriorate. An additional challenge for government issuers is how to deal with the complications generated by the pressures of a rapid increase in sovereign risk, whereby “the market” suddenly perceives the debt of some sovereigns as “risky”.

Chapter 88 Voluntary Provision of Public Goods ¤ This chapter discusses that redistributing resource endowments from people who contribute to public goods to other people who contribute to public goods will have no effect on the aggregate contributions to public goods. However, redistribution from non-contributors to contributors will result in an increase in the provision of public goods. A model which incorporates equity theory is used to generate alternative hypotheses for the behavior of individual contributors. Aggregate contribution data from three-person public goods environments support the neutrality theorem originally when endowments were redistributed among contributors. The individual contribution data, however, did not support the predictions of the conventional model. Individuals with relatively high endowments tended to under-contribute, relative to the conventional predictions, while individuals with relatively low endowments over-contributed.	<gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4124477-1>
Chapter 86 Explaining the Comparative Statics in Step-Level Public Good Games ¤ The step-level public good game differs strategically from the linear public good game. In the one-shot linear public good game the dominant strategy is not to contribute. In the one-shot step-level public good game multiple Nash equilibria exist. An inefficient Nash equilibrium involves nobody contributing. There are efficient Nash equilibria in pure strategies where 3 of the n players contribute (i.e., there are exactly enough contributions to reach the threshold). A rational player maximizing expected value will contribute if and only if she estimates the probability that her contribution will be critical for the provision of the public good to be sufficiently high. This chapter distinguishes individual preferences (allowing them to be non-selfish) and individual beliefs about the behavior of others. Both beliefs and preferences are important building blocks for most theories explaining behavior in games.	<gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4015999-1>
Funding regulations and risk sharing ¤ This paper provides a description of the risk sharing features of pension plan design in selected OECD and non-OECD countries and how they correspond with the funding rules applied to pension funds. In addition to leading to a better understanding of differences in funding rules across countries with developed pension fund systems, the study considers the trend towards risk-based regulation. While the document does not enter the debate over the application of riskbased quantitative funding requirements to pension funds (as under Basel II or Solvency II), it identifies the risk factors that should be evaluated and considered in a comprehensive risk-based regulatory approach, whether prescriptive or principles-based. The three main risk factors identified are the nature of risks and the guarantees offered under different plans designs, the extent to which benefits are conditional and can be adjusted, and the extent to which contributions may be raised to cover any funding gap. In addition, the strength of the guarantee or covenant from the sponsoring employer(s) and of insolvency guarantee arrangements should be carefully assessed when designing funding requirements.	<gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4073788-3>
Chapter 67 Incentive-compatible Mechanisms for Pure Public Goods: A Survey of Experimental Research ¤ The presence of public goods seriously challenges traditional or natural solutions for the allocation of private goods. Important policy questions, of whether this chapter can rely on the market to provide optimal amounts of public goods such as air pollution, and how much we can rely on natural processes such as voluntary contribution to solve environmental problems, boil down to fundamental issues about human nature, i.e., about whether people are selfish or cooperative. Existing experiments on incentive-compatible mechanisms have focused on a few mechanisms. The data, combined with theoretical investigation, give us a fresh perspective on implementation among real people. For these mechanisms that have been studied in the laboratory, need more replications and robustness tests. Meanwhile, many mechanisms have never been tested in the laboratory. Equilibrium selection problem is almost untouched in this context. Therefore, more experiments should be conducted in this exciting field.	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4015999-1>

Dealing with the crisis and thinking about the exit strategy ¤ This article looks at the stages of crisis management and some of the different degrees of transparency on losses and risks in the US and Europe. It also compares alternative approaches to dealing with impaired assets used in the USA and Europe. Exposure to off-balance losses remains a key issue. Europe, surprisingly, has been and remains the major issuer of collateralised synthetic obligations that have been so prominent in the crisis. The capital needs of banks over the next few years is examined, and great uncertainties remain due to the unknown extent to which off-balance sheet vehicles will need to be consolidated. Finally, the requirements of longer-run reform are outlined.	<gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4068097-6>
The Design of Government Guarantees for Bank Bonds : Lessons from the Recent Financial Crisis ¤ In 2010 authorities have taken the first steps to end some of the public support measures put in place in response to the financial crisis, starting with government guarantees for bond issues. Financial institutions have made extensive use of this tool, which has been effective in avoiding a further tightening of funding conditions, but this type of public support has, nonetheless, raised some concerns. First, the cost of issuing guaranteed bonds has mainly reflected the characteristics of the sovereign guarantor rather than those of the issuer, thus favouring “weak” borrowers with a “strong” sovereign backing. This situation has the potential to distort competition and create incentives for excessive risk taking. Such effects could have been reduced by the choice of a different fee determination mechanism. Second, the continued availability in 2010 of guarantee schemes, despite a declining overall usage, may be alleviating the pressure on some weak financial institutions to address their weaknesses: the average creditworthiness of banks issuing after mid-2009, when market conditions became more favourable, has sharply declined.

Chapter 43 Price Discovery and Allocation in Chains and Networks of Markets ¤ The experiments reported in this chapter explore the interaction of networks of markets. The issue is whether, and how long, chains of markets separated in time, space and participants might behave. The setting can be interpreted in two different ways. One is a system of vertical markets in which tiers of intermediate goods are produced as inputs for the next, higher level on the way to a final consumption good. Another, and perhaps more graphic, interpretation is geographic, in which suppliers are located at one location and consumers are at a different location. They are connected by a series of short transportation hauls that must be undertaken by different transporters. No transporter can undertake a long haul from seller to consumer. Markets exist at the beginning and end of each short haul. That is, the first transporters/middlemen buy from sellers and transport to the first drop-off for sale there.	<gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4252654-1>
Chapter 7. Mechanism Design for the Environment ¤ We argue that when externalities such as pollution are nonexcludable, agents must be compelled to participate in a “mechanism” to ensure a Pareto-efficient outcome. We survey some of the main findings of the mechanism-design (implementation-theory) literature – such as the Nash implementation theorem, the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem, the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanism, and the Arrow/d’Aspremont–Gerard–Varet mechanism – and consider their implications for the environment, in particular the reduction of aggregate emissions of pollution. We consider the cases of both complete and incomplete information.	<gnd:4075236-7> <gnd:4061619-8> <gnd:4164199-1> <gnd:4078523-3> <gnd:4061638-1>
Gender- and diversity-oriented design of social media for participation in public transport ¤ The aim of the paper is to define design recommendations for gender- and diversity-sensitive social media appearances to strengthen participation in the context of local public transport and mobility planning. Social media are an effective instrument for actively and sustainably involving citizens and other interest groups in planning and evaluation processes [1]. A major advantage is its reach across gender, cultural, language and national boundaries, which means that a high diversity of users can be covered. For this very reason, social media have become one of the most important tools when it comes to implementing and promoting participation culture effectively and efficiently. Social media can not only be used to inform interested parties, but also to actively and above all interactively involve them. In order for this to happen, the needs and requirements of users must be taken into account when designing social media appearances. In addition to flexible user interface design and content design, this includes enabling and providing elements for an interactive exchange of information, opinions and experiences between providers and users as well as among users. Although this type of participation is already widespread (e.g. as marketing for companies and products, but also for political opinion-forming), it has not yet fully entered all areas. Especially in the transport sector, the social media appearances provide information, but often these are not designed to be gender- and diversity-transcending and therefore not understandable and usable for all target groups. Every day, countless and diverse people are moved and connected with each other over long distances via public transport, but this user diversity is not addressed and reflected on the social media appearances of public transport companies.	<gnd:4639271-3> <gnd:4812463-1> <gnd:4125909-9>
Chapter 8 Simulated and Real Buyers in Posted Offer Markets ¤ This chapter uses the data from three previously published studies to examine the effect of real versus simulated buyers on laboratory outcomes. Real buyers can and occasionally do trategically deviate from full demand revelation. Further, the threat of strategic behavior appears to temper the pricing decisions by sellers. The chapter presents the experimental design and a discussion of demand withholding as a buyer strategy. The chapter concludes by providing results and discussion.	<gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4124477-1>
Investment: Unlocking Africa's Potential ¤ It is now time to invest in Africa. The prospects are good. Africa is already attracting growing flows of private resources, as a result of its greater political stability and economic reforms. Significant new investors are now engaging in Africa, from within and outside the continent. Development assistance and debt relief alone will not be sufficient to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Africa now needs more and sustainable investment, both domestic and foreign, in order to accelerate economic growth and progress in poverty reduction, and become better integrated into the global economy. We call for the fulfilment of commitments made at African and G8 Summits and other global fora, including support from development partners to help Africa mobilise more investment, and better focus on mobilisible domestic revenue sources and indigenous resources. Areas such as infrastructure, extractive industry, tourism, agribusiness and ICT are particularly important drivers of development, and require support from development partners.	<gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4113450-3>
VANET-based traffic light management for an emergency vehicle ¤ Wireless communications have affected our lifestyle in the last decades. It is helpful to improve quality of life for communities. Communications among vehicles usually take place in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications are aspects of communications in the transportation which are growing rapidly. They can play a pivotal role in the transportation field. Management of traffic lights (TLs) is crucial to control traffic flow especially at an intersection. The goal of this paper is to manage the TLs at an intersection when an emergency vehicle (EV) is approaching. First, we simulate an intersection which includes TLs via simulation of urban mobility (SUMO). Later, we simulate VANETs communication to manage the TLs at the intersection when the EV is coming with the help of objective modular network testbed in C++ (OMNeT++) and vehicles in network simulation (Veins). Finally, the impact of V2I communication on delivery efficiency of the emergency service is investigated. Simulation results show an improvement in delivery efficiency of the emergency service.	<gnd:4274324-2> <gnd:4033447-8> <gnd:7713781-4>
Chapter 85 Spiteful Behavior in Voluntary Contribution Mechanism Experiments ¤ One of the basic findings in public good provision experiments via the voluntary contribution mechanism is that subjects contribute a considerable amount of their initial holdings to the provision of a public good even when no contribution is the dominant strategy. On the other hand, there are three fundamental criticisms of voluntary contribution mechanism experiments. First, most experiments to date have used a linear utility function where the marginal return of a public good out of one unit of contribution of a private good is less than one. The second criticism is on the linearity of a utility function. In usual theoretical analyses, economists use a non-linear utility function. The third criticism comes from mechanism design theory. Mechanism designers implicitly assumed that agents in their mechanisms must participate in the mechanisms.	<gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4139716-2>
Chapter 18 Agent Learning Representation: Advice on Modelling Economic Learning ¤ This chapter presents an overview of the existing learning models in the economic literature.

Chapter 4 Mechanics of forming and estimating dynamic linear economies ¤ This paper describes the recent advances for rapidly and accurately solving matrix Riccati and Sylvester equations and applies them to devise efficient computational methods for solving and estimating dynamic linear economies. The chapter explores the most promising solution methods available and compares their speed and accuracy for some particular economic examples. Except for the simplest dynamic linear models, it is necessary to compute solutions numerically. In estimation contexts, computation speed is important because climbing a likelihood function can require that a model be solved many times. Methods that are faster than direct iterations on the Riccati equation and are more reliable than solutions based on eigenvalueeigenvector decompositions of the statecostate evolution equation are discussed in the chapter. Two generalizations are presented in the chapter: The first generalization introduces forcing sequences or uncontrollable states into the deterministic regulator problem, while the second generalization introduces, among other things, discounting and uncertainty into the augmented regulator problem.	<gnd:4011152-0> <gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4112736-5> <gnd:4132280-0>
Chapter 96 Growing Organizational Culture in the Laboratory ¤ The states of the world are possible sequences of pictures that both the manager and employee have in front of them. The pictures are of complex office environments, in which there are several people, objects, and activities. The pictures all overlap substantially in content, but also all have several unique elements. More interestingly, perhaps, subjects underestimated the difficulty of integrating these very simple forms of culture. Prior to the merger, they elicited estimates from all subjects about the average performance of the merged firm in the 10 post-merger rounds. One subject would receive a monetary reward for making a more accurate prediction. This produces a situation where it is incentive compatible for subjects to state their true belief of the post-merger firm's performance. The results clearly indicate that subjects overestimate the value of a merged firm.	<gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4015999-1>
Ageing and the payout phase of pensions, annuities and financial markets ¤ This paper reviews the impact of ageing on private pensions, in particular on the payout phase, assesses the part that annuities can play in financing retirement, and examines the role of financial markets in facilitating the allocation of assets accumulated in defined contribution pension plans.A comprehensive set of recommendations for consideration is provided at the end of the paper.	<gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4068097-6>
1. Markets ¤ More than anything else in the history of the development of economic thought, experimental economics is about the extended order of markets whose outcomes are not part of the intentions of the participants. It is accurate to say that markets emerged out of the dim past of social and economic exchange as an inscrutable human social propensity to truck, barter and exchange, rather than to describe them as having been invented. Even today, as in the experimental subfield of economic system design and testing, although invention appears to be prominent initially, all designs are subject to continuous change and adaptation in the light of experience and feedback; first in lab testing, then ongoing in the field. For example, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has a book of rules, consisting of a three ring loose-leaf notebook, symbolizing the persistence of change based on experience that characterizes institutions.	<gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4015999-1>
Chapter 2. Ecosystem Dynamics ¤ From ecosystems we derive food and fiber, fuel and pharmaceuticals. Ecosystems mediate local and regional climates, stabilize soils, purify water, and in general provide a nearly endless list of services essential to life as we know it. To understand how to manage these services it is essential to understand how ecological communities are organized and how to measure the biological diversity they contain. Ecological communities are comprised of many species, which are in turn made up of large numbers of individuals, each with their own separate ecological and evolutionary agendas. Not all species are equal as regards their role in maintaining the functioning of ecosystems or their resiliency in the face of stress. This chapter explains how ecosystems evolve and function as complex adaptive systems. It examines ecological systems at scales from the small to the large, from the individual to the collective to the community, from the leaf to the plant to the biosphere (including the global carbon cycle). It reviews theoretical and empirical models of ecosystem dynamics, which are highly nonlinear and contain the potential for qualitative and irreversible shifts. It considers applications to forests, fisheries, grasslands, and freshwater lakes.	<gnd:4061619-8> <gnd:4061638-1> <gnd:4078523-3> <gnd:4164199-1> <gnd:4075236-7>
Recent trends in institutional investors statistics ¤ Data to measure and analyse the increasing role of institutional investors in capital markets has been collected and published by the OECD for a number of years.

Private pensions and policy responses to the financial economic crisis ¤ This article discusses responses to current financial and economic crisis by regulators, supervisorss and policy makers in the area of private pensions. These responses are examined in the light of international guidelines, best practices and recommendations to improve the design of private pensions. Policy makers are reminded that private pensions continue to play an important role in a balanced pension system, with security coming from diversity of provision.	<gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4067488-5>
Chapter 64 Learning in Entry Limit Pricing Games ¤ This chapter examines whether refinements based on forward induction or simple adaptive learning models are better able to capture behavior in signaling game experiments. This chapter also finds that observed behavior is inconsistent with either the equilibrium refinements literature or pure belief-based adaptive learning models. An augmented adaptive learning model in which some players recognize the existence of dominated strategies and their consequences successfully captures the major qualitative features of the data.Equilibrium refinements do quite poorly in capturing our results. The refinements say nothing about the observed dynamics of play and cannot predict observed differences between Treatments I and IB and between Treatments II, III, and IV. The results of Treatment V are completely inconsistent with any refinement to sequential equilibrium. All of these results can be characterized by a simple belief-based learning model augmented to allow for some limited reasoning ability by players.	<gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4124477-1>
Housing Markets and Household Debt : Short-term and Long-term Risks ¤ High levels of household indebtedness have been considered one source of risk for households’ balance sheets and financial stability for some time now. Household debt has risen in many OECD countries, although there is great variation among them in terms of the levels and compositions of debt, the distribution of associated risks within the financial system and between the latter and the household sector.	<gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4068097-6>
Chapter 14 Numerical dynamic programming in economics ¤ This chapter explores the numerical methods for solving dynamic programming (DP) problems. The DP framework has been extensively used in economics because it is sufficiently rich to model almost any problem involving sequential decision making over time and under uncertainty. The chapter focuses on continuous Markov decision processes (MDPs) because these problems arise frequently in economic applications. Although, complexity theory suggests a number of useful algorithms, the theory has relatively little to say about important practical issues, such as determining the point at which various exponential-time algorithms such as Chebyshev approximation methods start to blow up, making it optimal to switch to polynomial-time algorithms. In future work, it will be essential to provide numerical comparisons of a broader range of methods over a broader range of test problems, including problems of moderate to high dimensionality.	<gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4112736-5> <gnd:4011152-0>

Use of derivatives for debt management and domestic debt market development : Key conclusions ¤ The Ninth OECD/World Bank/IMF Annual Global Bond Market Forum held on 22-23 May 2007 in Paris, France, highlighted that there has been very sharp growth in the use of derivative instruments in both mature and emerging market countries. The use of derivative instruments is helping public debt managers in their portfolio management operations and in supporting market development. Several institutional and structural impediments, however, remain toward the more active use of derivative products. Most developed market debt managers use derivative instruments for debt management purposes, while this is the case for only a handful of emerging markets. Several emerging markets, though, are taking steps towards developing the legal environment necessary to support derivative markets, and are addressing the challenges posed by illiquidity of the underlying cash market, deficiencies in prudential regulation, and restrictions on market participation.	<gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4067488-5>
Risk Capital in OECD Countries : Past Experience, Current Situation and Policies for Promoting Entrepreneurial Finance ¤ This article follows up on monitoring and analysing developments and structural issues related to risk capital undertaken by the OECD since the mid-1990s. Risk capital, i.e. finance for fast-growth SMEs, should help to foster entrepreneurship and a high rate of company formation which is seen as essential to achieving full employment.	<gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4068097-6>
Regulatory issues related to financial innovation ¤ This note explores various regulatory issues related to financial innovation. It starts from a premise that financial innovations are neither always helpful (or benign) nor always threatening. Innovations have the potential to provide for a more efficient allocation of resources and thereby a higher level of capital productivity and economic growth. Many financial innovations have had this effect. But others have not. Examples of the latter include products that may have been misrepresented to end-users and resulted in delinquencies, bankruptcies or other problems among them, or products that have been inadequately managed with respect to the various credit or market risks they entail. Considerations of problems aside, innovation should be seen as a natural aspect of the workings of a competitive system. Thus, the ideal policy approach is to find an appropriate balance between preserving safety and soundness of the system and allowing financial institutions and markets to perform their intended functions. That approach entails first ensuring that the necessary market-framing and market-perfecting rules are in place and then establishing a proper structure for reviewing financial innovations. Seven steps needed to accomplish this task are outlined in the report.	<gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4073788-3>
Chapter 20 Quantifying and Valuing Environmental Health Risks ¤ This chapter provides an overview of the current methodology for assessing environmental health risks. Our primary focus is on the practices that U.S. regulatory agencies use for assessing cancer risk, although we also provide a brief comparison to the methodology used in Western Europe. We then discuss the potential biases that may be inherent in the various components of the assessment methodology, and we discuss the implications of these biases towards regulatory policy. This chapter also provides an overview of the current methodology for valuing risks of both mortality and morbidity, placing particular emphasis on ex ante measurements of individuals' willingness to pay for risk reductions. We present the underlying theory, the estimation concerns, and the policy implications of labor market, housing market, and survey studies of estimating the value of risk reductions. Once we have established the economic framework of efficient regulatory policies, we then provide an overview of the extent to which U.S. regulatory performance meets these efficiency goals and offer suggestions for better achieving these goals.	<gnd:4061616-2> <gnd:4061638-1> <gnd:4006340-9>
Development of user-centred interaction design patterns for the International Data Space ¤ This paper describes a set of methods for the development of user-centred interaction design patterns (IDP) based on the International Data Space (IDS). The IDS is to be understood as a virtual market place where data and products can be bought and sold as well as related contracts concluded. Based on the existing reference model of the IDS, new types of user interfaces (UI) will be created for this purpose. It is important for the developers of the UI’s that the users and the associated core tasks are known, so that the interactions can be designed in a user-friendly interface. IDP’s are intended to support developers in developing applications. The patterns are design patterns and represent proven solutions for frequently occurring problems for the developers when designing the UI. They also provide design alternatives and can effectively support communication between potential end users and developers.	<gnd:1232346071> <gnd:4125909-9>
Chapter 11 First Price Independent Private Values Auctions ¤ The first price sealed bid auction is the market institution in which the high bidder acquires ownership of the auctioned item and pays a price equal to the amount of the highest bid. This market institution is distinguished from the second price sealed bid auction in which the high bidder obtains the auctioned item and pays an amount equal to the second highest bid. Bids in sealed bid auctions are often literally sealed in envelopes but need not be; the essential distinction is from a real time auction in which the time at which bids are submitted during the auction is an essential feature of the market institution. This chapter presents experimental tests, using independent private values, of the consistency of bidding behavior in the first price auction with three nested Nash equilibrium bidding models. The reported tests have various implications for the three nested models. Depending on which test is used, data for only 010 of the subjects are consistent with the risk neutral model. This conclusion is the same regardless of whether one conducts the tests with market prices, individual subjects' bids and values, or subjects' expected foregone earnings. Tests with individual subjects' bids and values indicate that data for about 48 of the subjects are consistent with the constant relative risk averse model and data for almost all subjects are consistent with the log-concave model.	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4015999-1>
Chapter 111 Payoff Scale Effects and Risk Preference Under Real and Hypothetical Conditions ¤ The use of monetary incentives may not affect behavior much in some contexts, or it may simply reduce the dispersion of data around some theoretical prediction. But the experiments indicate that incentive effects may be large and systematic in other contexts. In the absence of a widely accepted theory of when incentives matter, it is probably not advisable to derive scientific conclusions from laboratory studies that do not provide clear, salient motivation. The evidence surveyed here shows that relying on hypothetical payments can yield misleading results in some circumstances. Moreover, social scientists do not have a good feel for when to believe hypothetical choice patterns. Given this, they believe that performance-based incentives should be used in economics experiments, and results motivated by hypothetical incentives should be interpreted with caution.	<gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4139716-2>
Deregulation, Trade Reform and Innovation in the South African Agriculture Sector ¤ This case study examines the effect of deregulation and trade reform on South Africa’s agriculture sector, which is highly dualistic consisting of a developed commercial sector and a subsistence farming sector. Deregulation and trade reform has led to substantial changes in innovation in the commercial agriculture sector, such as wine and fruit, leading to a large change in composition while innovation seems to have been more limited in subsistence agriculture, which lacks absorption capacity. Legal uncertainties related to land reform may also be a factor which can negatively affect innovation in the commercial farming sector. Keywords: innovation, deregulation, trade reform, South Africa, agriculture, wine, fruit, field crops, foreign investment, absorption capacity.	<gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4113450-3>
Chapter 13. Forecasting Exchange Rates: an Investor Perspective ¤ The popular scholarly exercise of evaluating exchange rate forecasting models relative to a random walk was stimulated by the well-cited Meese and Rogoff (1983) paper. Practitioners who construct quantitative models for trading exchange rates approach forecasting from a different perspective. Rather than focus on forecast errors for bilateral exchange rates, as in the Meese–Rogoff case, we present what is required for constructing a successful trading model. To provide more perspective, a particular approach to quantitative modeling is presented that incorporates return forecasts, a risk model, and a transaction cost constraint in an optimization framework. Since beating a random walk is not a useful evaluation metric for currency investing, we discuss the use of benchmarks and conclude that performance evaluation in currencies is much more problematic than in equity markets due to the lack of a passive investment strategy and the multitude of alternative formulations of well-known currency style factors. We then provide analytical tools that can be useful in evaluating currency manager skill in terms of portfolio tilts and timing. Finally, we examine how conditioning information can be employed to enhance timing skill in trading generic styles like the carry trade. Such information can be valuable in reducing the duration and magnitude of portfolio drawdowns.	<gnd:4047390-9> <gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4059787-8>
Human Health Biotechnologies to 2015 ¤ This article provides an overview of the current use of biotechnology to produce human health products and short-term estimates of the number and types of these products that are likely to reach the market by 2015. Relevant health products include biopharmaceuticals, experimental therapies (e.g. cell/tissue engineering and gene therapy), small molecule therapeutics, diagnostics, bioinformatics (including DNA sequencing and pharmacogenetics), functional food and nutraceuticals, and medical devices. The analysis of current use is based on regulatory approval data and the current literature and includes a comparison of the additional therapeutic value of biopharmaceuticals compared to small molecule pharmaceuticals. The short-term estimates of the number and types of products that are likely to reach the market by 2015 are based, where possible, on an analysis of quantitative data on clinical trials. For several other products, including functional foods and nutraceuticals, it is not possible to make short-term estimates due to a lack of reliable data. While the biopharmaceutical share of all pharmaceuticals reaching the market is expected to remain very close to historical levels, biotechnology is expected to be used in the discovery, development, manufacturing, and/or prescribing of nearly all new drugs by 2015. In addition, the use of biotech based diagnostics (especially genetic testing), bioinformatics, and pharmacogenetics is likely to increase. In some cases, these technologies will be used to improve the safety and efficacy of clinical trials, to personalise prescribing practises, and to reduce adverse drug reactions.	<gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4113450-3> <gnd:4066399-1>
Lessons from the Last Financial Crisis and the Future Role of Institutional Investors ¤ The dynamics of the financial crisis were driven by underpricing of risk and lack of transparency, which led to a loss of confidence when the bubble finally burst. Crisis resolution involved massive government interventions that caused a permanent transfer of losses to the public sector as well as sovereign-debt crises that may involve painful solutions. Letting banks fail is a necessary disciplinary factor, but this requires a well-defined “game plan” which did not exist in the crisis. Regulatory reforms underway aim at restoring confidence, but they may hamper the long-term potential of institutional investors. Nevertheless, institutional investors should still be able to provide risk capital – except for perhaps pension funds, which have been weakened by demographic developments. Finally, improving governance and reducing excessive risk-taking are important but challenging tasks. More active and involved shareholders could further these goals, but such participation will be hard to achieve. Therefore, transparent bonus and remuneration plans are perhaps the most important initiatives for preventing future systemic financial crises.	<gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4067488-5>
The Contribution of the Asset Management Industry to Long-term Growth ¤ The global asset management industry was severely hit by the worldwide financial crisis, but has recovered well from the crisis. The resiliency of the asset management industry can be explained by a more diversified industry and investors turning to greater diversification in asset classes. The asset management industry is a vital source of economic growth as intermediary in the savings-investment channel. The industry is also one of the most important providers of liquidity needed to ensure smooth functioning of capital markets and provides the means for its clients to diversify their portfolios and achieve their investment goals. Asset managers should act as the ‘stewards’ of their clients’ interest. But less ‘sticky’ liabilities tend to create short-termism of asset managers. A sound governance framework, more transparency, better communication with clients and better management of their expectations may be needed to overcome this problem. But clients themselves, at the institutional as well as retail level, will also have to adopt a more long-term view to appropriately evaluate the risk and returns of their portfolios. Vehicles for longterm retail investment need to be developed and support by fiscal and other incentives may be considered.	<gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4068097-6>
Chapter 112 Rewards and Behavior in First Price Auctions ¤ The trading rules for the first price auction can be summarized as follows. A single object is offered in perfectly inelastic supply to N &gt; 2 bidders. Each bidder submits a single bid for the commodity with the understanding that the commodity will be awarded to the highest bidder at a price equal to the highest bid. This chapter examines the impact on subjects' behavior of substantial increases in the size of expected laboratory payoffs and experience in the context of a first price auction. Bidding behavior in this institution has been investigated by experimental economists for over 20 years. Virtually all studies reveal behavior in which: (1) bidding behavior across subjects is heterogeneous; and (2) subjects consistently bid above the level predicted for risk-neutral agents, behavior which is consistent with as if risk averse.	<gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8>
Chapter 6. Uncertainty and Imperfect Information in Markets ¤ This chapter deals with uncertainty and incomplete information in markets. It first considers situations in which the contract proposer is the ignorant party with the problem of designing a mechanism that induces the counter party, who is exogenously endowed with his information, to reveal that information in such a way that maximizes the contract proposer’s expected payoff. In contrast to settings of symmetric information, inefficiencies will tend to arise in equilibrium. Also considered is the situation when each side of the transaction is endowed with his or her own payoff-relevant information. Here the focus is on whether and how a social planner could design a contract to achieve efficiency. The following section assumes it is the contract proposer who is endowed with the payoff-relevant information. The quintessential example of this is a seller who knows the quality of the good she seeks to sell. Because she cannot commit fully to not deceive her counter party, inefficiencies arise. The last section examines the problems that arise if the asymmetry of information arises endogenously, because one party’s prior-to-trade actions provide him or her payoff-relevant information.	<gnd:4070864-0> <gnd:4135592-1> <gnd:4186957-6> <gnd:4050133-4> <gnd:4120934-5>
Indian Financial System Reform : Selected Issues ¤ India’s financial sector has become much more diversified, with capital markets playing an increasingly important role. These markets have been substantially deregulated and, recent changes notwithstanding, many restrictions on capital flows have been eased, especially with respect to equity inflows. As well, the health of the public banks, which initially had very weak balance sheets, has been restored. While India’s regulatory, supervisory and financial policy authorities have made progress, they are likely to face challenges related to several aspects characterising the country’s financial system, including its banking sector and its capital markets. Banks remain subject to government imposed constraints on their lending portfolios and the banking sector is still dominated by public institutions. Although the Indian government has intensified its efforts to develop corporate bond markets, the latter remain relatively underdeveloped. Equity markets, which have evolved considerably, have recently been characterised by substantial price increases, in part reflecting large foreign inflows. This development raises the question of sustainability of valuations under changing global monetary liquidity conditions and risk aversion. Different policy responses have been considered by Indian authorities. Representatives from these authorities expressed a reluctance to interfere with the market process. However, the recent decisions by policy authorities suggest that during the course of the ongoing deliberations by policy authorities, these considerations have been outweighed by concerns about the consequences of failing to constrain inflows. The decision by authorities to disallow issuance of “participatory notes” by foreign institutional investors has to be seen in this context.	<gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4073788-3>
Chapter 21 The Effects of Collusion in Laboratory Experiments ¤ Even when markets seem to alternate between collusive and non-collusive phases, the price differences are difficult to interpret since a breakdown in collusion may be caused by a demand decrease that would have reduced prices in any case. This makes the laboratory an ideal setting to study factors that facilitate or hinder illegal price fixing. The main result from the experimental economics literature is that the market trading institutions are crucial in determining whether or not collusion will be successful in raising prices above competitive levels. This chapter examined the effects of seller discussions between rounds of a continuous double auction. In particular, the sellers were allowed to come together to a corner of one of the rooms and confer after the close of one trading period and before the start of another. Attempts to collude were as ineffective as they were inevitable. The problem is that each seller has a strong private incentive to defect and lower the asking price during the course of the double auction trading .	<gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4139716-2>
Infrastructure Needs and Pension Investments : Creating the Perfect Match ¤ The life insurance and pensions sector manages large funds with a truly long time horizon. These investors therefore naturally seek long-dated assets to match their liabilities. Real assets or real cash flows are preferred in order to hedge against inflation, which is particularly relevant for pension funds in order to assure a decent purchasing power for their clients’ retirement income. Many countries have the daunting tasks of refurbishing and expanding infrastructure, maintaining and expanding public real estate – and doing this in an environmentally friendly manner. Well-conceived infrastructure investments promote productivity and efficiency in both the public and private sector and foster economic – potentially also “green” – growth. Large amounts of capital are needed. Many nations cannot tap the private capital markets as easily as before. Infrastructure investments could be the “perfect match” for a portion of pension savings. Therefore, the link between the capital at hand and its accessibility for infrastructure investments needs to be improved, via regulation, co-operation and communication that foster public-private partnerships, as well as government leadership.	<gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4068097-6> <gnd:4067488-5>
Chapter 24 Agent-based Computational Finance ¤ This chapter surveys research on agent-based models used in finance. It will concentrate on models where the use of computational tools is critical for the process of crafting models which give insights into the importance and dynamics of investor heterogeneity in many financial settings.	<gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4112736-5> <gnd:4011152-0> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4132280-0>
Chapter 108 One-Reason Decision Making ¤ One-reason decision making is a label for a class of fast and frugal heuristics that base decisions on only one reason. These heuristics do not attempt to optimally fit parameters to a given environment; rather, they have simple structural features and bet that the environment will fit them. By not attempting to optimize, these heuristics can save time and computations, and demand only little knowledge concerning a situation. Models of one-reason decision making have been designed for various tasks, including choice, numerical estimation, and classification. This chapter focuses on two of these heuristics, Take The Best and Minimalist, and compare their performance with that of standard statistical strategies that weigh and combine many reasons, such as multiple regression. Contrary to common intuition, more reasons are not always better.	<gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4015999-1>
Chapter 16 Leading Indicators ¤ In this chapter we provide a guide for the construction, use and evaluation of leading indicators, and an assessment of the most relevant recent developments in this field of economic forecasting. To begin with, we analyze the problem of indicator selection, choice of filtering methods, business cycle dating procedures to transform a continuous variable into a binary expansion/recession indicator, and methods for the construction of composite indexes. Next, we examine models and methods to transform the leading indicators into forecasts of the target variable. Finally, we consider the evaluation of the resulting leading indicator based forecasts, and review the recent literature on the forecasting performance of leading indicators.	<gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4059787-8> <gnd:4047390-9> <gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4358095-6>
Chapter 17. Quantile Prediction ¤ This chapter is concerned with the problem of quantile prediction (or forecasting). There are numerous applications in economics and finance where quantiles are of interest. We primarily focus on methods that are relevant for dynamic time series data. The chapter is organized around two key questions: first, how to measure and forecast the conditional quantiles of some series of interest given the information currently available and second, how to assess the accuracy of alternative conditional quantile predictors.	<gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4059787-8> <gnd:4047390-9> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4358095-6>
Chapter 78 Quasi-experimental Evaluation of Regional Employment Subsidies ¤ Although certain government policies might be tested in controlled experiments during a pilot phase, such tests are rarely undertaken. Ideally, a policy could be tried, when feasible and meaningful, on a random subset of areas, firms or consumers exposed to the policy and be compared with the remaining subset over a significant period of time. The results reported here are from a test where the Swedish government introduced a regional employment policy in a limited part of a fairly homogeneous area with high chronic unemployment, hence creating a non-random division into an experiment region and a control region. Once the decision was made to introduce the policy, a quasi- experimental evaluation of the policy was proposed to the government; and, as a result, the government agreed to leave the two regions intact for a period of three years to allow this evaluation to take place and cover a non-trivial period of time a quite unusual, perhaps unprecedented, step for a government to take.	<gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4124477-1>
Modeling, design and prototyping of a pantograph-based compliant mechanism ¤ The main task of the compliant mechanism synthesis is to generate a pre-defined motion path as accurately as possible. A general approach to the compliant mechanism synthesis is to develop a compliant mechanism based on the rigid-body model by replacing conventional joints with compliant joints, i.e. flexure hinges. Using the example of a mechanism producing a scissors-like motion, in this paper a more specific and iterative synthesis process is implemented for the design of a compliant path-generating mechanism. Based on two symmetric pantograph mechanisms, a kinematic analysis of the multi-link rigid-body model is performed. The final dimensions and link lengths of the rigid-body model are used to implement a compliant mechanism with different flexure hinges. Therefore, several designs are iteratively investigated by means of FEM simulations in order to improve the path accuracy and the opening angle of the scissors-like motion.	<gnd:4774350-5> <gnd:4198914-4> <gnd:4205811-9> <gnd:4017233-8>
Chapter 97 Motivation Theory and Experimental Behavior under the Decision Cost Hypothesis ¤ This chapter compare hypothetical with actual bids of a Treasury bill dealer, and find that the dealer's measure of constant relative risk aversion using actual bid data is four times larger than under hypothetical assessment. This chapter also reports individual decision making experiments in which the incidence of confused behavior is reduced with monetary rewards, but subjects who appear not to be confused behave about the same with or without monetary rewards. This chapter finds that results in the dictator game are affected significantly by monetary incentives and that under no-pay conditions the results in ultimatum games are inconclusive because they fail to be replicable.	<gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4015999-1>
Chapter 56 Focal Points and Bargaining ¤ This chapter focuses on the focal points and bargaining. The idea of a focal point is of great practical importance. However, no consensus exists concerning the manner in which focal points become established or survive after their establishment. At one extreme, some authors emphasize rationality considerations above all else. At the other extreme are authors who argue that social norms are so important that strategic issues can be neglected entirely. Even those who emphasize the importance of social norms are left with unresolved questions. Subjects can be conditioned to begin bargaining against real opponents close to any of the four focal points discussed in the chapter. The equal increments and utilitarian focal points are not stable. The explanation that groups of subjects converge on an exact Nash equilibrium of the discrete game that they actually played fits the data very well. One potential criticism of the above experiments is that the graphical display might have made the process of myopic optimization focal.	<gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4139716-2>
Financial Education Programmes in Schools ¤ Research in a number of countries has shown that many people lack the ability to manage their money well.

Chapter 105 Rationality the Fast and Frugal Way: Introduction ¤ This chapter focuses on bounded rationality as the study of heuristics that can exploit structures of their environments, we use the term ecological rationality. If one focuses only on cognitive limitations, one can hardly understand why cognition works as well as it does just as looking at one blade alone does not explain how scissors cut. Simon's use of the term cognitive limitations (as opposed to neutral terms such as cognitive heuristics) is unfortunate because it has been taken to imply poor performance. However, equating limits with failure, and lack of limits with success, may underlie a deep misunderstanding about the consequences of omniscience. An unlimited memory, for instance, could be disastrous: The sheer mass of details stored could critically slow down and inhibit the retrieval of the few important experiences when they are needed. And too much information would impair the mind's ability to abstract, infer, and learn.	<gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4066528-8>
Trade and investment in regional trade agreements : The case of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) 2006 ¤ Over the past twenty years, the economies of Central and South East Europe have undergone fundamental changes – the opening of new markets, major policy reforms, deeper intra- and inter-regional economic integration and institutional improvements – which have significantly altered the landscape of economic activity in the region. This paper explores the experience in South East Europe and investigates how this growth has impacted the geographical location of economic activity in the region as well as foreign direct investment flows.	<gnd:4113450-3> <gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4066399-1>
Kluwer-EZUL-Testdatensatz (1) : Monte Carlo Simulations of Adsorbed Solutions in Heterogeneous Porous Materials ¤ We present results of a Monte Carlo simulation study of binary mixtures of ethane and methane in silica gel. The molecular model treats the adsorbent as a matrix of silica microspheres. The adsorption isotherms, adsorption selectivities and isosteric heats of adsorption have been determined for these systems. The results are compared with predictions from the ideal adsorbed solution (IAS) theory and with experiment. The heats of adsorption are accurately described by the IAS theory. The adsorption isotherms are accurately described by the IAS theory at low bulk pressure but the IAS theory overpredicts the density at high bulk pressure. This latter effect is opposite to that observed in bulk mixtures of this type where nonidealities generally lead to a density increase on mixing. The pressure dependence of the selectivity does not exhibit a maximum at low pressure. We discuss this effect in terms of the adsorbent microstructure.	<gnd:4000536-7>
Chapter 109 Cognitive Illusions Reconsidered ¤ Behavioral economists have done a great service in connecting psychology and economics. Up to now, however, most have focused on cognitive illusions and anomalies, in order to prove the descriptive failure of neoclassical economic models. The key problems in the cognitive illusions literature can be summarized in two terms: narrow norms and vague heuristics. The fact that the cognitive illusions they have dealt with can be reduced by efficient representations, or turn out to be no illusions at all, should not lead to the conclusion that people make no errors. By definition, any intelligent system that can operate in an uncertain world will make errors. When one defines precise models of heuristics, one can predict in which tasks people who use them will fail and where they will succeed.	<gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4139716-2> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4124477-1>
The turmoil and the financial industry : Developments and policy responses ¤ The situation in financial markets deteriorated over the past year, but government actions have helped to avert an even bigger crisis. While some signs of recovery are on the horizon, the banking sectors in many countries are not yet on solid footing. Recent government programmes that deal with banks’ ‘toxic assets’ are welcome in this regard. But further reaching financial sector reforms such as those recently endorsed by the G20 leaders and proposed in Europe and the United States are necessary in order to establish a sound financial system.	<gnd:4067488-5> <gnd:4073788-3> <gnd:4068097-6>
Chapter 14. Modeling the Global EconomyForward-Looking ScenariosforAgriculture ¤ The development of global computable general equilibrium (CGE) models lagged behind development of national models as globally consistent datasets were not readily available and software and hardware were generally not up to the task. As the latter improved and data became more readily available particularly through the efforts of the GTAP consortium the use of global CGE models to examine critical economic policies of an international or a global nature exploded in the 1990s. The catalysts of the use of global CGE models were international trade negotiations in the form of the Uruguay Round and the rising concern over global warming. Over the last two decades global CGE models have expanded in size, complexity and the range of policy issues including bilateral and regional trade agreements, the role of trade preferences, trade in services, international migration, foreign direct investment, cross-border environmental issues, structural transformation, demographics and more. This chapter is focused on work largely undertaken at the World Bank over the last decade using the ENVISAGE model with a focus on long-run dynamics, impacts on agriculture and interactions with climate change.	<gnd:4065341-9> <gnd:4210294-7> <gnd:4079351-5> <gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4224214-9> <gnd:4358095-6>
Chapter 33 Agent-based Modeling as a Bridge Between Disciplines ¤ Using the author's own experiences, this chapter shows how agent-based modeling (ABM) can address research questions common to many disciplines, facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration, provide a useful multidisciplinary tool when the math is intractable, and reveal unity across disciplines. While ABM can be a hard sell, convergence within the agent-based community can enhance the interdisciplinary value of the methodology.	<gnd:4011152-0> <gnd:4112736-5> <gnd:4148259-1> <gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4066528-8>
Chapter 12 Welfare Theory and Valuation ¤ Public policies that lead to a reduction in the emissions of air and water pollutants or the protection of sensitive ecosystems presumably increase the well-being of many members of society. Applied welfare economists are accustomed to measuring the welfare effects of policies that invoke price changes. If it is granted that the public good attributes of most dimensions of environmental quality preclude the development of well functioning markets for these service flows, how are the monetary values of changes in environmental quality to be measured? The past twenty to thirty years have seen the rapid development of the economic theory and techniques for measuring the demands for nonmarketed goods, and in this chapter we attempt to sketch out the major results. We review the basic concept of economic welfare and derive measures of welfare change for both changes in prices of market goods and changes in quantities and qualities of nonmarket goods. We then describe the principal economic techniques for estimating the benefits of environmental quality improvements when these improvements either directly affect individuals' well-being or indirectly affect individuals through constraints they face. Perhaps the major class of measurement methods is based on the observation that changes in environmental quality may cause individuals to alter purchases of goods and services that are complements or substitutes for environmental quality in their preference orderings. These revealed preference methods are the primary focus of this chapter. A second major approach to obtaining estimates of the benefits and costs of environmental changes, stated preference methods, are addressed in detail in later chapters. Our treatment of welfare effects places special emphasis on the connection between the underlying economic theory and practical empirical models.	<gnd:4061638-1> <gnd:4006340-9> <gnd:4061616-2>
Chapter 8. The Political Economy of Environmental Policy ¤ This chapter provides a review and assessment of the extensive literature on the political determination of environmental regulation. A promising theoretical literature has emerged relatively recently that provides models of the political interaction of government with various interest groups in the setting of environmental standards and the choice of regulatory instruments. A large empirical literature supports such models, finding evidence of the influence of interest groups but also evidence that net social benefits are often an important determinant of environmental policy choices. A later section of the paper takes up the issue of environmental federalism and the large and growing theoretical literature that addresses the so-called competitive “race to the bottom” as various jurisdictions attempt to use environmental policy as an instrument of economic competition. The evidence on all this is sparse, although some recent work in the U.S. is unable to find any support for the race-to-the-bottom hypothesis. The paper concludes with a brief look at the evolution of environmental policy and finds that economics has come to play a growing role both in the setting of standards for environmental quality and in the design of regulatory measures. There seems to be a discernible trend toward more efficient decision-making for environmental protection.	<gnd:4061638-1> <gnd:4164199-1> <gnd:4078523-3> <gnd:4075236-7> <gnd:4061619-8>
Chapter 12. Global Applied General Equilibrium Analysis Using the Global Trade Analysis Project Framework ¤ This chapter provides an overview of the first two decades of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) an effort to support a standardized database and computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling platform for international economic analysis. It characterizes GTAP in four different dimensions: institutional innovation, a network, a database and a standardized modeling platform. Guiding principles for the GTAP modeling framework include flexibility, ease of use, transparency, and symmetric treatment of production and utility fundamentals across regions. The chapter reviews core modeling assumptions relating to the regional household, private consumption behavior, welfare decomposition, the Global Bank, treatment of the international trade and transport sector, and imports. Model validation and sensitivity analysis, as well as software issues receive attention as well. The chapter also offers brief overviews of the two major areas of application: international economic integration and global environmental issues. It closes a discussion of future directions for the Project.	<gnd:4065341-9> <gnd:4210294-7> <gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4224214-9> <gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4079351-5>
Chapter 3. Forecasting Output ¤ This chapter surveys the recent literature on output forecasting, and examines the real-time forecasting ability of several models for U.S. output growth. In particular, it evaluates the accuracy of short-term forecasts of linear and nonlinear structural and reduced-form models, and judgmental forecasts of output growth. Our emphasis is on using solely the information that was available at the time the forecast was being made, in order to reproduce the forecasting problem facing forecasters in real-time. We find that there is a large difference in forecast performance across business cycle phases. In particular, it is much harder to forecast output growth during recessions than during expansions. Simple linear and nonlinear autoregressive models have the best accuracy in forecasting output growth during expansions, although the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model and the vector autoregressive model with financial variables do relatively well. On the other hand, we find that most models do poorly in forecasting output growth during recessions. The autoregressive model based on the nonlinear dynamic factor model that takes into account asymmetries between expansions and recessions displays the best real time forecast accuracy during recessions. Even though the Blue Chip forecasts are comparable, the dynamic factor Markov switching model has better accuracy, particularly with respect to the timing and depth of output fall during recessions in real time. The results suggest that there are large gains in considering separate forecasting models for normal times and models especially designed for periods of abrupt changes, such as during recessions and financial crises.	<gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4066399-1>
Waste Generation and Recycling ¤ There are two serious failures that arise in the management of solid waste. The first relates to the existence of negative externalities in the individual decision-making over waste generation and disposal. When individuals decide on how much to consume and what to consume, they do not take into account how much waste they produce. Because the external costs of waste generation (such as air and water pollution) are ignored by individuals, more waste is produced and disposed of than is socially optimal. The second serious failure relates to the ways in which waste collection services are typically financed. More often than not, individuals pay for waste disposal in lump sums through general taxes or flat payments to local governments or private collectors. Hence, waste disposal costs are not fully reflected in the prices households face at the margin. Even if these flat charges included both the private and external costs of waste production and disposal, individuals would still face zero prices for additional waste produced, and would thus tend to produce (and dispose of) more waste than if they were to pay for the additional garbage according to its social marginal cost.	<gnd:4066493-4> <gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4113450-3>
Chapter 4. Economics of Common Property Management Regimes ¤ The purpose of this chapter is to identify the reasons for collective action failures and successes in natural resource management, and to understand, in the light of economic theory, the mode of operation of the factors involved whenever possible. In the first section, we clarify the notion of a common property management regime and provide cautionary remarks about estimation methodologies commonly used. In Section 2, we focus on the general case where common property regulation is feasible yet only if governance costs are kept to a reasonable level. Emphasis is placed on such factors as the size of the user group, income or wealth inequality, and availability of exit opportunities. Special attention is paid to the aspect of inequality since this has remained a rather confused issue in much of the empirical literature. Economic theory can contribute significantly to improving our understanding of the manner in which it bears upon collective action. In Section 3, we discuss cognitive problems as an important impediment to the design and implementation of efficient common property management systems. We also present evidence of the deleterious effects resulting from the absence or inappropriateness of state interventions, particularly where they are motivated by private interests. In Section 4, the importance, under a co-management approach, of appropriate incentive systems at both the village and state levels is underlined and illustrated.	<gnd:4164199-1> <gnd:4078523-3> <gnd:4075236-7> <gnd:4061638-1> <gnd:4061619-8>
Hochaufgelöste Energieprofile durch hybride Simulation ¤ The price of a commodity, as electricity, is determined on a commodity market. A market is efficient when the supply and demand in the market are at an equilibrium. Efficient markets run on information. Information can cause a spontaneous and instantaneous change within the supply and demand in a market. The market communicates this new equilibrium through the change of the price of a commodity. In the electricity market the supplier and consumer communicate through electrical load profiles. A load profile signals when and how much energy should be consumed within a certain time frame without causing a change in the price of electricity. Creating such load profiles is commonly done by the supplier of energy by means of standard load profiles. Here we propose a data-driven simulation-based method that allows for the consumer to create its own specific load profile, which potentially will bring down the cost of energy consumed.	<gnd:4055072-2> <gnd:4059205-4> <gnd:4148259-1>

Chapter 22 Predatory Pricing: Rare Like a Unicorn? ¤ Despite the discovery of predatory intent in several widely cited antitrust cases, many industrial organization economists have argued that predatory pricing is irrational and rarely observed. The argument is that pricing below cost in order to drive competitors out of the market will be irrational for two reasons: (1) there are more profitable ways (e.g., acquisitions) to eliminate competitors, and (2) future price increases will result in new entry. Decisions in antitrust cases have often resulted from documented predatory intent, which is sometimes attributed to an irrational motive for management to eliminate rivals. In the absence of a smoking gun, arguments turn on AreedaTurner cost-based tests, which are difficult to apply given the multi-product nature of most business operations. For these reasons, the issue of predatory pricing is a natural topic for laboratory studies where costs are induced directly.	<gnd:4015999-1> <gnd:4124477-1> <gnd:4066528-8> <gnd:4252654-1> <gnd:4139716-2>

Chapter 4. Now-Casting and the Real-Time Data Flow ¤ The term now-casting is a contraction for now and forecasting and has been used for a long time in meteorology and recently also in economics. In this chapter we survey recent developments in economic now-casting with special focus on those models that formalize key features of how market participants and policymakers read macroeconomic data releases in real-time, which involves monitoring many data, forming expectations about them and revising the assessment on the state of the economy whenever realizations diverge sizeably from those expectations.	<gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4066399-1>

Chapter 17 Forecasting with Real-Time Macroeconomic Data ¤ Forecasts are only as good as the data behind them. But macroeconomic data are revised, often significantly, as time passes and new source data become available and conceptual changes are made. How is forecasting influenced by the fact that data are revised? To answer this question, we begin with the example of the index of leading economic indicators to illustrate the real-time data issues. Then we look at the data that have been developed for U.S. data revisions, called the “Real-Time Data Set for Macroeconomists” and show their basic features, illustrating the magnitude of the revisions and thus motivating their potential influence on forecasts and on forecasting models. The data set consists of a set of data vintages, where a data vintage refers to a date at which someone observes a time series of data; so the data vintage September 1974 refers to all the macroeconomic time series available to someone in September 1974. Next, we examine experiments using that data set by Stark and Croushore (2002), Journal of Macroeconomics 24, 507–531, to illustrate how the data revisions could have affected reasonable univariate forecasts. In doing so, we tackle the issues of what variables are used as “actuals” in evaluating forecasts and we examine the techniques of repeated observation forecasting, illustrate the differences in U.S. data of forecasting with real-time data as opposed to latest-available data, and examine the sensitivity to data revisions of model selection governed by various information criteria. Third, we look at the economic literature on the extent to which data revisions affect forecasts, including discussions of how forecasts differ when using first-available compared with latest-available data, whether these effects are bigger or smaller depending on whether a variable is being forecast in levels or growth rates, how much influence data revisions have on model selection and specification, and evidence on the predictive content of variables when subject to revision. Given that data are subject to revision and that data revisions influence forecasts, what should forecasters do? Optimally, forecasters should account for data revisions in developing their forecasting models. We examine various techniques for doing so, including state-space methods. The focus throughout this chapter is on papers mainly concerned with model development – trying to build a better forecasting model, especially by comparing forecasts from a new model to other models or to forecasts made in real time by private-sector or government forecasters.	<gnd:4132280-0> <gnd:4358095-6> <gnd:4066399-1> <gnd:4059787-8> <gnd:4047390-9>
