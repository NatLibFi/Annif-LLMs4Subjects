Advanced technologies and wireless networks beyond 4G
"This book has been arranged to account for several current and modern wireless networks and the corresponding novel technologies and techniques based on the main aspects of "physical layer". The book is composed of four parts, consisting of nine chapters. Part I deals with well-known networks -- from 2-G to 3-G, in a historical perspective. Part II illuminates the so-called "physical layer" of networks while presenting polarization diversity analysis and positioning of any subscriber located in areas of service both for land-to-land and land-to-atmosphere communication links. Part III describes planning techniques for different integrated femto/pico/micro/macrocell deployments. Part IV explores new technologies of time and frequency dispersy and multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) modern network design in space and time domains, and ends with a discussion of a MIMO network based on multibeam adaptive antennas"--
