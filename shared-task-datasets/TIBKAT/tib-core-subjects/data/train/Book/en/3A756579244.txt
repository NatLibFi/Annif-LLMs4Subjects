Composite materials and processing
"An exploration of the processing of composite materials, this book covers fiber reinforcements, production of various fibers and properties, and the processing of polymer matrix, metal matrix, and ceramic matrix composites. It then discusses topics illustrating advanced composites, carbon-carbon composites and nanocomposites, processing of polymer-clay nanocomposites, carbon nanotube-reinforced composites, and nanoparticle-reinforced composites. The book also includes a chapter on practical instructions for processing composites"--
"Composite Materials and Processing provides the science and technology of processing several composites using different processing methods, and includes collective information on the processing of common and advanced composite materials. It also weighs the advantages and disadvantages of various processing methods. This book is suitable for materials scientists, and graduate students, as well as for practicing engineers in composite industries."--
