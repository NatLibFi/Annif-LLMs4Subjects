Dense phase carbon dioxide : food and pharmaceutical applications
"Dense phase carbon dioxide (DPCD) is a non-thermal processing technology, mainly used for pasteurization of liquid foods. It has advantages compared to thermal pasteurization in its potential to preserve the sensory quality and nutrient content of the foods. It also has potential advantages over other non-thermal processes since it is a continuous process, and both the capital costs and operating costs are lower than some other non-thermal processes. The theory, microbial, enzymatic, quality, and process related issues have been researched. However, there is no compilation of all of this accumulated knowledge and know-how in a single volume.  Dense Phase Carbon Dioxide: Applications for Food brings into one volume the diverse aspects and the accumulated knowledge regarding DPCD. International experts in the Dense Phase Carbon Dioxide applications to foods have contributed in their areas of expertise to create synergy that clarifies concepts and reveals potential application areas and future direction of research. Positioned as an industry reference book, Dense Phase Carbon Dioxide: Applications for Food will appeal to food scientists, food technologists, food engineers, food safety, quality and production managers; government officials, researchers and regulators; extension specialists; equipment and packaging suppliers; and particularly professionals in the juice, dairy and beverage industries"--
