Stylistic deceptions in online news : journalistic style and the translation of culture
"Demonstrating the central role played by the stylistic features of online news in shaping cultural representations of people and places, this book highlights how these features share in constructing meaning. Taking the 2016 terror attack in Nice, France as a case study, Ashley Riggs analyses online news coverage of the attack from the UK, Spain and Switzerland, three distinct linguistic and cultural spaces. An innovative mixed-methods approach, including content analysis and elements of translation criticism and comparative stylistics, is used to analyse this corpus to reveal the frequency and influence of stylistic devices found in online news and explore how they help to shape reader interpretations. Drawing conclusions about linguistic and journalistic practices by place and interrogating the notions of 'European identity' and 'European journalism', Stylistic Deceptions in Online News reveals how stylistic features vary according to both political leanings and national and regional contexts, and the influence these have upon readers"--
