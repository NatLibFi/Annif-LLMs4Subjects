Analytical methods in the determination of bioactive compounds and elements in food
Most bioactive compounds have antioxidant activity, particularly tocochromanols, phenolics (flavonoids and phenolic acids), methylxantines and capsaicinoids. Some of these compounds have also other properties important for human health. For example, vitamin E protects against oxidative stress, but it is also known for its “non-antioxidant” functions, including cell signalling and antiproliferation. Selenium compounds and indoleamins are the components of the antioxidant enzymes. Selenium makes vitamin E acquisition easier and controls its physiological functions. In taking part in enzymatic reactions and protecting the cell against free radicals, selenium shows immunomodulative, antiphlogistic, and antiviral activity. Capsaicinoids possess not only antioxidant, but also antibacterial, analgesic, weight-reducing and thermoregulation properties. Studies have also demonstrated their gastroprotective and anticancer properties. Analytical Methods in the Determination of Bioactive Compounds and Elements in Food explores both the influence of particular compounds on human health and the methods used for their determination. Chapters describe various aspects of food and plant analysis, including chromatographic and non‐chromatographic approaches as well as hyphenated techniques. Readers of this book will gain a comprehensive understanding of the important groups of bioactive compounds relevant to human health.
