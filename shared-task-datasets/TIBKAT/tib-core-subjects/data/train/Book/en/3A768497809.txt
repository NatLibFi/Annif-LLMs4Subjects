Structural analysis : principles, methods and modelling
"Combining a user-friendly, practical approach with detailed derivations and mathematical background, this text shows students how to use structural analysis accurately and efficiently to solve engineering problems. Many worked examples walk students through the methods and give them insight into creating analytical models. The book also challenges students to consider specific aspects of the material in more detail and to extend the methods to other problems. MATLABÂ® is used to perform complex analyses, with the code and other ancillaries accessible online"--
