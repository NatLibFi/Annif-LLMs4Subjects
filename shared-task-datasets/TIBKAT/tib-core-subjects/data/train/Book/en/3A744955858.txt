Hâˆž Control and Filtering of Two-dimensional Systems
Over the past decades a considerable interest has been concentrated on problems involving signals and systems that depend on more than one variable. 2-D signals and systems have been studied in relation to several modern engineering fields such as process control, multidimensional digital filtering, image enhancement, image deblurring, signal processing etc. Among the major results developed so far, 2-D digital filters are investigated as a description in frequency domain or as a convolution of the input and the unit response, which has a great potential for practical applications in 2-D image and signal processing. This monograph aims to address several problems of control and filtering of 2-D discrete systems. Specifically the problems of Hinfinity filtering, Hinfinity control, stabilization, Hinfinity model reduction as well as Hinfinity deconvolution filtering of 2-D linear discrete systems are treated
