Melt-quenched nanocrystals
Melt-Quenched Nanocrystals presents a detailed and systematic analysis of the nanostructured state formed in the process of melt quenching and subsequent thermal and deformation effects. It covers the metallurgical and mechanical properties of nanomaterials, focusing particularly on properties derived from nanocrystals and their agglomeration. The text introduces four different types of nanocrystals that can be produced by melt quenching, each having different structures and properties
