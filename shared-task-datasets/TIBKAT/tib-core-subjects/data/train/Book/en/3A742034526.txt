Colloidal quantum dot optoelectronics and photovoltaics
"Capturing the most up-to-date research in colloidal quantum dot (CQD) devices, this book is written in an accessible style by the world's leading experts. The application of CQDs in solar cells, photodetectors and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) has developed rapidly over recent years, promising to transform the future of clean energy, communications, and displays. This complete guide to the field provides researchers, students and practitioners alike with everything they need to understand these developments, and begin contributing to future applications. Introductory chapters summarise the fundamental physics and chemistry, whilst later chapters review the developments that have propelled the field forwards, systematically working through key device advances. The science of CQD films is explained through the latest physical models of semiconductor transport, trapping, and recombination, whilst the engineering of organic and inorganic multilayered materials is shown to have enabled major advances in the brightness and efficiency of CQD LEDs"--
