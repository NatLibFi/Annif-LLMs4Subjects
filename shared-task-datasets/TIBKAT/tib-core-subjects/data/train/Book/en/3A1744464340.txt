Nanostructured multifunctional materials : synthesis, characterization, applications and computational simulation
Introduction to nanostructured multifunctional materials / Esteban A. Franceschini -- Mesoporous particles by combination of aerosol route and sol-gel process / María Verónica Lombardo, Andrea Verónica Bordoni and Alejandro Wolosiuk.
"This book provides an overview of the effect of nanostructuring in the multifunctionality of different widely studied nanomaterials from a broad approach that allows access to a public of chemists, (bio)engineers, physicists, nanotechnologists, undergraduates and professors. This book is divided into three parts that group materials sharing certain types of nanostructuring, including nanoporous, nanoparticled, 2D laminar materials, and a fourth section including computational studies of the nanostructures addressed. This structured approach in nanomaterials research will work as a valuable reference material for those who want to learn and explore nanoscience and nanotechnology from a rational point of view"--
