UMTS Radio Network Planning, Optimization and QOS Management : For Practical Engineering Tasks
In cellular networks, a new generation of CDMA or WCDMA-based networks will start operations in most countries in the near future. The standardized WCDMA technology generates new challenges in radio network planning, optimization and QoS management because of the dynamic nature of its radio interface and various new services and different network operating modes. Moreover, new and modified radio planning phases as well as new field measurements and emphasized QoS management are needed when UMTS networks are designed and optimized. Hence, a practical UMTS planning process must be defined in detail, from dimensioning to optimization tasks. This book follows the UMTS planning process. It is organized in three parts: Part I - UMTS configuration planning; Part II - UMTS topology planning; and Part III - UMTS network functionality. The first chapter in Part I introduces the UMTS and UTRAN systems and radio network planning strategy, and defines a planning process for UMTS. In Chapter 2, the UMTS planning process is covered, and a detailed description of the UMTS power budget is given, with planning threshold examples provided.
