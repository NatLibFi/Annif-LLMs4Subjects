Fluid mechanics : fundamentals and applications
"Fluid mechanics is an exciting and fascinating subject with unlimited practical applications ranging from microscopic biological systems to automobiles, airplanes, and spacecraft propulsion. Fluid mechanics has also historically been one of the most challenging subjects for undergraduate students because proper analysis of fluid mechanics problems requires not only knowledge of the concepts but also physical intuition and experience. Our hope is that this book, through its careful explanations of concepts and its use of numerous practical examples, sketches, figures, and photographs, bridges the gap between knowledge and the proper application of that knowledge"--
