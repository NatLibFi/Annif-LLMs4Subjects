Northern exposure : works of Carol A. Wilson Architect
"Northern Exposure celebrates the work of Carol A. Wilson Architect. Deeply tied to the landscape of Maine, Wilson's studio specializes in buildings that respond to their residents as well as their cultural and ecological landscapes. This monograph features eight New England houses illustrated with site plans, detail drawings, and photographs."--
