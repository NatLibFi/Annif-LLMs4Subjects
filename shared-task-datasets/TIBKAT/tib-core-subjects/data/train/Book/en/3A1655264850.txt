The Boundary-Domain Integral Method for Elliptic Systems
This monograph gives a description of all algorithmic steps and a mathematical foundation for a special numerical method, namely the boundary-domain integral method (BDIM). This method is a generalization of the well-known boundary element method, but it is also applicable to linear elliptic systems with variable coefficients, especially to shell equations. The text should be understandable at the beginning graduate-level. It is addressed to researchers in the fields of numerical analysis and computational mechanics, and will be of interest to everyone looking at serious alternatives to the well-established finite element methods
