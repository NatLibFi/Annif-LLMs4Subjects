A City of comings and goings
Architecture and urbanism can contribute to making our cities more resilient to migration. In ?City of Comings and Goings? Crimson brings together a cast of European cities that are marked by migration represented through authoratitive essays by local scholars. These cities are also the source of a catalogue of one hundred projects that tackle the issue of migration in many different ways and on different scales. The essays, the catalogue of projects and Crimson?s manifesto-like introductory essay, make for a book that demonstrates how planning and architectural design can play a crucial role in making the Western European City into a resilient and exciting 'City of Comings and Goings'.0Crimson Historians and Urbanists (Rotterdam) designs for the city, researches and writes about it, shows it in exhibitions and works of art, teaches about it, gives advice on it and makes policies for it
