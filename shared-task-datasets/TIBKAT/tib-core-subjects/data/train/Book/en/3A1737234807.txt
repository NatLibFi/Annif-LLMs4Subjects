Boundary value problems for fractional differential equations and systems
"This book is devoted to the study of existence of solutions or positive solutions for various classes of Riemann-Liouville and Caputo fractional differential equations, and systems of fractional differential equations subject to nonlocal boundary conditions. The monograph draws together many of the authors' results, that have been obtained and highly cited in the literature in the last four years. In each chapter, various examples are presented which support the main results. The methods used in the proof of these theorems include results from the fixed point theory and fixed point index theory. This volume can serve as a good resource for mathematical and scientific researchers, and for graduate students in mathematics and science interested in the existence of solutions for fractional differential equations and systems"--
