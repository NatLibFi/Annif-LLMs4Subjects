Electromagnetic compatibility of electric vehicle
This book introduces the electromagnetic compatibility(EMC) of electric vehicle(EV), including EMC of the whole vehicle, electromagnetic interference(EMI) prediction and suppression of motor drive system, EMI prediction and suppression of DC-DC converter, electromagnetic field safety and EMC of wireless charging system, signal integrity and EMC of the vehicle controller unit(VCU), EMC of battery management system(BMS), electromagnetic radiated emission diagnosis and suppression of the whole vehicle, etc. The analysis method, modeling and simulation method, test method and rectification method of EMC are demonstrated. The simulation and experimental results are presented as tables and figures. This book is useful as reference for graduate students, senior undergraduates and engineering technicians of vehicle engineering related majors. For EMI prediction, suppression and EMC optimization design for EVs, this book provides reference for engineers to solve EMC problems. This book is intended for senior undergraduates, postgraduates, lecturers and laboratory researchers engaged in electric vehicle and electromagnetic compatibility research
