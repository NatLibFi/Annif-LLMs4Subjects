Conservation science : balancing the needs of people and nature
"Conservation Science was primarily written for undergraduates and beginning graduate students who are interested either in academic careers or in doing science-based conservation at government agencies, non-governmental organizations, or international institutions. It will also be of interest to those already involved in conservation who want to bolster their understanding of the field. It is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the science that drives conservation policy and action."--Publisher's description
