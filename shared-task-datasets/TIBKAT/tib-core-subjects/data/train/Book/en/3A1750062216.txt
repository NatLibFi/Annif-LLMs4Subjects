Subsonic combustion ramjet design
This book presents a step-by-step methodology for the design of ramjet engines. It explores ramjet combustion, provides guidelines on how to size the engines, and discusses performance analysis. The book begins with an introduction to ramjet design, including fundamental definitions in the field. It then discusses ramjet engine performance, and fuels which can be used. Several types of ramjet engines are then explored, and guidelines for their design are presented, including flame holders, injectors, and combustors. Finally, the book concludes with a discussion of the types of materials which should be used for ramjet engines. This book is of interest to engine designers and engineers, researchers, and graduate students, as it collates research in a succinct, clear guide to the issue of designing ramjet engines. .
