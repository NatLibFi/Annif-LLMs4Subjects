A first course in optimization
"Designed for graduate and advanced undergraduate students, this text provides a much-needed contemporary introduction to optimization. Emphasizing general problems and the underlying theory, it covers the fundamental problems of constrained and unconstrained optimization, linear and convex programming, fundamental iterative solution algorithms, gradient methods, the Newton-Raphson algorithm and its variants, and sequential unconstrained optimization methods. The book presents the necessary mathematical tools and results as well as applications, such as game theory"--
