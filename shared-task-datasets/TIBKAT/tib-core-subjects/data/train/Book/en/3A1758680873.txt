"The differential quadrature hierarchical finite element method (DQHFEM) was proposed by Bo Liu. This method incorporated the advantages and the latest research achievements of the hierarchical finite element method (HFEM), the differential quadrature method (DQM) and the isogeometric analysis (IGA). The DQHFEM also overcame many limitations or difficulties of the three methods. This unique compendium systemically introduces the construction of various DQHFEM elements of commonly used geometric shapes like triangle, tetrahedrons, pyramids, etc. Abundant examples are also included such as statics and dynamics, isotropic materials and composites, linear and nonlinear problems, plates as well as shells and solid structures. This useful reference text focuses largely on numerical algorithms, but also introduces some latest advances on high order mesh generation, which often has been regarded as the major bottle neck for the wide application of high order FEM"--
