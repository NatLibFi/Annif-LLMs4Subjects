Magnetic hysteresis
Electrical Engineering Magnetic Hysteresis Understanding magnetic hysteresis is vitally important to the development of the science of magnetism as a whole and to the advancement of practical magnetic device applications. Magnetic Hysteresis, by acclaimed expert Edward Della Torre, presents a clear explanation of the connection between physical principles and phenomenological hysteresis. This comprehensive book offers a lucid analysis that enables the reader to save valuable time by reducing trial-and-error design. Dr. Della Torre uses physical principles to modify Preisach modeling and to describe the complex behavior of magnetic media. While Pretsach modeling is a useful mathematical tool, its congruency and deletion properties present limitations to accurate descriptions of magnetic materials. Step-by-step, this book describes the modifications that can overcome these limitations. Special attention is given to the use of feedback around a Preisach transducer to remove the congruency restriction, and to the use of accommodation and aftereffect models to remove the deletion restriction. Magnetic state selection rules are introduced to couple scalar Preisach models to form a vector model. Magnetic Hysteresis is indispensable reading for engineers, physicists, and materials scientists who want to gain a better understanding of hysteresis losses and create more energy-efficient motor designs
