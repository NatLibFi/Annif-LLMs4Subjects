Exam topics covered include tasks and scheduling, remoting, the Spring Web Services framework, RESTful services with Spring MVC, the Spring JMS module, JMS and JTA transactions with Spring, batch processing with Spring Batch and the Spring Integration framework. Prepare with confidence for the Pivotal Enterprise Integration with Spring Exam. One of the important aspects of this book is a focus on new and modern abstractions provided by Spring. Therefore most of the features are shown with Java annotations alongside established XML configurations. Most of the examples in the book are also based on the Spring Boot framework. Spring Boot adoption is exponential because of its capability to significantly simplify Spring configuration using sensible opinionated defaults. But Spring Boot is not the target of the exam, therefore all the features are also covered with plain Spring configuration examples.
