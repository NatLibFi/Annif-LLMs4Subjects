Mechanics of materials
This revised and updated second edition is designed for the first course in mechanics of materials in mechanical, civil and aerospace engineering, engineering mechanics, and general engineering curricula. It provides a review of statics, covering the topics needed to begin the study of mechanics of materials including free-body diagrams, equilibrium, trusses, frames, centroids, and distributed loads. It presents the foundations and applications of mechanics of materials with emphasis on visual analysis, using sequences of figures to explain concepts and giving detailed explanations of the proper use of free-body diagrams. The Cauchy tetrahedron argument is included, which allows determination of the normal and shear stresses on an arbitrary plane for a general state of stress. An optional chapter discusses failure and modern fracture theory, including stress intensity factors and crack growth. Thoroughly classroom tested and enhanced by student and instructor feedback, the book adopts a uniform and systematic approach to problem solving through its strategy, solution, and discussion format in examples. Motivating applications from the various engineering fields, as well as end of chapter problems, are presented throughout the book.
