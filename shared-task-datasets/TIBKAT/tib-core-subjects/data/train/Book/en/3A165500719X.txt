C-XSC : A C++ Class Library for Extended Scientific Computing
C-XSC is a tool for the development of numerical algorithms delivering highly accurate and automatically verified results. It provides a large number of predefined numerical data types and operators. These types are implemented as C++ classes. Thus, C-XSC allows high-level programming of numerical applications in C and C++. The most important features of C-XSC are: real, complex, interval, and complex interval arithmetic; dynamic vectors and matrices; subarrays of vectors and matrices; dotprecision data types, predefined arithmetic operators with maximum accuracy; standard functions of high accuracy; multiple precision arithmetic and standard functions; rounding control for I/O data; error handling, and library of problem solving routines with automatic result verification. Thus, C-XSC makes the computer more powerful concerning the arithmetic. C-XSC is immediately usable by C programmers, easy to learn, user-extendable, and may also be combined with other tools. The book can be used as a textbook and as a reference manual. It consists of an introduction to advanced computer arithmetic, a chapter describing the programming languages C and C++, the major chapter "C-XSC Reference", sample programs, and indices
