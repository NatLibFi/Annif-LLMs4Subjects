Smart sensors for environmental and medical applications
"This book presents a comprehensive overview of chemical sensors, ranging from the choice of material to the sensor validation and through their modeling and simulation and manufacturing technology processes, which have been developed so far. It addresses the process of data collection by intelligent techniques such as deep learning, multivariate analysis, etc. The book incorporates different types of smart chemical sensors and discusses each under a common set of sub-sections. In this way readers are educated on the advantages and disadvantages of the relevant transducers depending on the design, transduction mode and final applications. The book covers all major aspects of the primary constituents of the field of smart chemical sensors including working principle and related theory, sensor materials, classification of respective transducer type, relevant fabrication processes, methods for data analysis and suitable application"--
