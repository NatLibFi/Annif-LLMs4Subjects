Power transformer design practices
"The book presents basic theories of transformer operation, design principles and methods used in power transformer designing work, and also includes limitation criteria, effective utilization of material and calculation examples to enhance reader's techniques of transformer design and testing. The ways to optimize design is also discussed throughout the book as a goal to achieve best performances on economic design. The book is a great reference material for engineers, students, teachers, researchers and anyone involved in the field associated with power transformer design, manufacture, testing, application and service maintenance"--
