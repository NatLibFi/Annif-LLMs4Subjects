Neural Networks Models : An analysis
Providing an in-depth treatment of the main topics in neural networks this volume concentrates on multilayer networks and completely connected networks, as well as discussing both analog and digital networks. The central themes are dynamical behaviour, attractors and capacity. Boltzmann machines are also discussed. The subject is developed from scratch and does not use statistical physics. Because the volume adopts a pedagogical approach, explaining all steps in full, the style which the book takes it will appeal to engineers, computer scientists and applied mathematicians. The reader will learn the parameters and results that are most important for the design of neural networks and will be able to critically assess the existing commercial products or design a hardware or software implementation for him- or herself
