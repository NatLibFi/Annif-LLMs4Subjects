Nanoscale Materials
Organized nanoassemblies of inorganic nanoparticles and organic molecules are building blocks of nanodevices, whether they are designed to perform molecular level computing, sense the environment or improve the catalytic properties of a material. The key to creation of these hybrid nanostructures lies in understanding the chemistry at a fundamental level. This book serves as a reference book for researchers by providing fundamental understanding of many nanoscopic materials.
