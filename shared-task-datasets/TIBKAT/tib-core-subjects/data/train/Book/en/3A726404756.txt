Computational methods for electromagnetic phenomena : electrostatics in solvation, scattering, and electron transport
"A unique and comprehensive graduate text and reference on numerical methods for electromagnetic phenomena, from atomistic to continuum scales, in biology, micro-to-optical waves, photonics, nanoelectronics and plasmas. The state-of-the-art numerical methods described include: Statistical fluctuation formula for the dielectric constant; Particle-Mesh-Ewald, Fast-Multipole-Method and image-based reaction field method for long-range interactions; High order singular/hypersingular (Nyström collocation/Galerkin) boundary and volume integral methods in layered media for Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatics, electromagnetic wave scattering and electron density waves in quantum dots; Absorbing and UPML boundary conditions; High order hierarchical Nédélec edge elements; High order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and Yee finite difference time-domain methods; Finite element and plane wave frequency-domain methods for periodic structures; Generalized DG beam propagation method for optical waveguides; NEGF(Non-equilibrium Green's function) and Wigner kinetic methods for quantum transport; High order WENO and Godunov and central schemes for hydrodynamics transport; Vlasov-Fokker-Planck and PIC and constrained MHD transport in plasmas"--
