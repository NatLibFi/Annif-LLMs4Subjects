Endothelin in renal physiology and disease
Endothelin is a 21-amino acid peptide that exerts uniquely potent and long-lasting effects on the kidney, including regulation of water and electrolyte excretion, blood pressure, cell growth, inflammation and fibrosis. During the past 10 years, the field has evolved rapidly; we are now uncovering the potential importance of endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) in the treatment of kidney disease.This book reviews experimental concepts, preclinical studies and clinical data which form the basis of our current understanding of the association between endothelin and kidney disease. Acclaimed experts in pharmacology, molecular biology, physiology, cardiovascular medicine, and nephrology have contributed timely reviews dealing with renal pharmacology and physiology of endothelin, the role of endothelin in renal disease development and ERAs in preclinical studies, and the current state of clinical development of ERA therapy in renal medicine.The publication at hand will be a valuable reference source for nephrologists, internists and other healthcare professionals, renal physiologists and molecular biologists, post-doctoral researchers and students in the life sciences, as well as for scientists and decision makers in drug research and development
