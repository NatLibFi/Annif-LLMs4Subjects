Innovation in small family businesses
Innovation in Small Family Businesses explores how innovation is developed and carried out in small family-owned businesses, the factors underpinning it, and the innovation drivers and barriers in these firms’ context. Sylvie Laforet also offers suggestions on how innovation can be fostered and perhaps, sustained in small family-owned businesses and discusses the government’s role in this. The book makes an important contribution to the theoretical development of family firms’ and small businesses’ innovation. -- The detailed and critical literature review will provide useful reference points for both academics and students and identifies avenues for future research for the area. Policymakers and practitioners will also find this compact compendium insightful.
