Soil bioremediation : an approach towards sustainable technology
"This book will discuss the effective and sustainable technological approaches for remediation of contaminates via eco-friendly usage of microbes. The primary focus will be on the role of microbes, particularly bacteria and fungi, for the degradation and removal of various xenobiotic substances in the environment. The book will also emphasize molecular approaches and biosynthetic pathways of microbes, and present gene and protein expression studies for bio-deterioration techniques. New innovative and sophisticated green technologies for waste minimization and waste control will be presented, as well as the potential of microbes for various techniques of bioremediation, including bio-sorption, bio-augmentation, bio-stimulation, to clean contaminated environments"--
