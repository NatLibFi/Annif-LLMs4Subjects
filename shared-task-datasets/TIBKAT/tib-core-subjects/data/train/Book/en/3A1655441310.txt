Combinatorial Theory
Reihentext + Combinatorial Theory From the reviews: "This book presents a very good introduction to combinatorics. It covers most aspects of enumeration and order theory,.. It is divided into three parts. The first part presents the basic material on mappings and posets.. The second part deals with enumeration .. Finally the third part treats of the order-theoretic aspects .. In the text examples are given and at the end of each chapter valuable notes, also very good selected exercises. They constitute an organic part of the book. This book can warmly be recommended first of all to students interested in combinatorics. A two semester course can also be based on it."
