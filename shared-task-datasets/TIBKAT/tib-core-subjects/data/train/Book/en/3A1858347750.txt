Reliability and probabilistic safety assessment in multi-unit nuclear power plants
"Presents a comprehensive framework to integrate the risk contributions from single- and multi-unit nuclear power plants and aggregate the risks that may arise due to applicable hazards and operating states. Combines the key feeatures of multi-unit risk assessment in one resource, reviwing the practices adopted in various countries around the globe. These dependencies include multi-unit interactions, environmental stresses, the sharing of systems, and the sharing of human resources in a control room, factors that can all introduce an increased potential for heightened accident conditions. Designed to help the reader systematically identify events and evaluate techniques of possible accident outcomes and serves as a ready reference for probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) analysts in identifying a suitable site."--From the publisher
