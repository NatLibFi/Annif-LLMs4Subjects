A numerical primer for the chemical engineer
"This book emphasizes the deriviation and use of a variety of numerical methods for solving chemical engineering problems. The algorithms are used to solve linear equations, nonlinear equations, ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations. It also includes chapters on linear- and nonlinear regression and ond optimizaiton. MATLAB is adopted as the programming environment throughout the book. MATLAB is a high performance computing program. An introductory chapter on MATLAB basics has been added and Excel users can find a chapter on the implementation of numerical methods in Excel. Another chapter with worked out exaples are given in the Case study chapter to demonstrate the numerical techniques. Most of the examples were written in MATLAB and are compatible with the latest versions of MATLAB. It is important to mention that the main purpose of this book is to give the students a flavor of numerical methods and problem solving, rather than to be an in depth guide to numerical analysis. The chapters end with small exercises that students can use to familiarize them selves with the numerical methods. The material in this book has been used in undergraduate and graduate courses in the chemical engineering department of Eindhoven University of Technology. To aid lecturers and students course materials have also been made available on the web at http://webpage.com. The author would finally thank everybody who has been helpful and supportive in the creation of this book, especially some of the Ph.D. students at Eindhoven University that have assisted during lectures and directly influenced the content of this book: Juan Pablo Gutierrez, Esayas Barega and Arend Dubbelboer"--
