Quantum Physics : An Introduction Based on Photons
The quantum postulates -- Entanglement -- One-dimensional motion -- Angular momentum -- Quantum physics of complex systems -- A: Linear algebra basics -- B: Probabilities and distributions -- C: Optical polarization tutorial -- D: Dirac delta function and the Fourier transformation. Solutions.
This textbook is intended to accompany a two-semester course on quantum mechanics for physics students. Along with the traditional material covered in such a course (states, operators, Schrödinger equation, hydrogen atom), it offers in-depth discussion of the Hilbert space, the nature of measurement, entanglement, and decoherence – concepts that are crucial for the understanding of quantum physics and its relation to the macroscopic world, but rarely covered in entry-level textbooks. The book uses a mathematically simple physical system – photon polarization – as the visualization tool, permitting the student to see the entangled beauty of the quantum world from the very first pages. The formal concepts of quantum physics are illustrated by examples from the forefront of modern quantum research, such as quantum communication, teleportation and nonlocality. The author adopts a Socratic pedagogy: The student is guided to develop the machinery of quantum physics independently by solving sets of carefully chosen problems. Detailed solutions are provided.
