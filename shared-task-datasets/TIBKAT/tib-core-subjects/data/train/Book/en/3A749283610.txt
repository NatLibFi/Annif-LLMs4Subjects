Molecular Self-Assembly Organic Versus Inorganic Approaches
Self-assembly is undoubtedly a topic of special interest in current chemistry and is related to very wide scientific areas. Recent progress in this field seems to be featured by the construction of well-defined discrete systems exploiting complementary hydrogen bonding as well as coordination bonding. Seven leading international experts introduce the current topics in this very interesting field, focusing on two major subjects: organic assemblies and inorganic assemblies. All researchers who are interested in molecular recognition, material science, nanotechnology, and supramolecular chemistry will welcome this book as an inspiring source for creative research ideas
