Discover how all levels Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be present in the most unimaginable scenarios of ordinary lives. This book explores neural networks, agents, multi agent systems, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. These and other topics will be addressed with real world examples, so you can learn fundamental concepts with AI solutions and apply them to your own projects. People tend to talk about AI as something mystical and unrelated to their ordinary life. Practical Artificial Intelligence provides simple explanations and hands on instructions. Rather than focusing on theory and overly scientific language, this book will enable practitioners of all levels to not only learn about AI but implement its practical uses.
