Landau Fermi liquids and beyond
Quasiparticle concept -- Pomeranchuk stability conditions -- Collective excitations and zero sound -- Scattering theory -- Fermi liquid regime of the Kondo problem -- Response of an ideal Fermi gas -- Collective excitations -- Effect of disorder on electron interactions -- Bridging phenomenological and microscopic aspects -- Effect of ampere forces in Fermi liquids -- Overscreened Kondo model and Nozi√®res-Blandin theory -- Electron lifetime in a mesoscopic conductor -- Marginal Fermi liquids
"This book consolidates the older and more recent concepts on weakly-interacting fermions where traditional many-body techniques are adequate. Targeting primarily the advanced undergraduates and graduates, the author has included plenty of examples and problems from contemporary topics of research"--
