Nanotechnology in agriculture and environmental science
"This book highlights the applications of nanotechnology in agriculture as well as environmental sciences and gives an overview of nanopesticides, nanofertilizers; nano based delivery system for plant system and biosensors that could be useful for soil health and detection of pesticides. It consists of topics based on Bionanomaterials for sustainable agriculture; Synthesis of mesoporous nanoparticles from waste; nanofungicides; biosensors for Monitoring Soil Health and Pesticides; toxicity of nanoparticles; safe designing of nanomaterial to manage the fate and associated environmental risks. This book will be highly useful for researchers and scientists in the agricultural sector, academia and industry, and all scientists working in for sustainability in agriculture"--
