Syngas : production methods, post treatment, and economics
"Syngas is the name given to a gas mixture that contains varying amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Examples of production methods include steam reforming of natural gas or liquid hydrocarbons to produce hydrogen, the gasification of coal and in some types of waste-to-energy gasification facilities. Syngas is also used as an intermediate in producing synthetic petroleum for use as a fuel or lubricant via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and previously the Mobil methanol to gasoline process. Syngas consists primarily of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and very often some carbon dioxide, and has less than half the energy density of natural gas. It is combustible and often used as a fuel source or as an intermediate for the production of other chemicals. This new book gathers the latest research from around the globe in this dynamic field covering topics such as syngas production from biomass generated gases, recent developments of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis catalysts, syngas cleaning technologies, and new syngas utilizations at different stages of deployment."--Publisher's description
