Research handbook on urban design
"With the UN-Habitat estimating that by 2035 the majority of the world's population will be living in metropolitan areas, this cutting-edge Research Handbook explores the emerging field of urban design and its place in contemporary scholarship. Gathering together a broad spectrum of eminent and up-and-coming scholars across the globe, Marion Roberts and Suzy Nelson demonstrate the depth and rigour of 21st century urban design research. Contributors explore a wide range of topics such as effectively aligning urban design and landscape; reshaping the sustainable city; crisis and temporary public spaces; indigenous urbanism; and designing a healthy neighbourhood. Combining theoretical knowledge with practical application, this erudite Research Handbook analyses key literature in the field supported by an in-depth examination of international case studies. Offering an extensive cross-disciplinary overview of urban design scholarship, this Research Handbook will prove an enlightening read for academics and researchers in urban design, planning, urban studies, landscape architecture, human geography and cultural studies. Its wealth of specialist knowledge will also benefit urban design, city and planning practitioners alike."--Back cover
