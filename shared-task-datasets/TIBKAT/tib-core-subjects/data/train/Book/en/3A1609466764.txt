Image analysis, classification and change detection in remote sensing : with algorithms for ENVI/IDL and Python
"The book introduces advanced undergraduates and graduates to techniques used in the processing of remote sensing digital imagery. It is intended for people who are working with remote sensing data in image analysis and GIS environments. The material is self-contained and illustrated with many programming examples in IDL, a computer language which supports the professional graphical user interface ENVI, one of the leading environments for remote sensing imagery analysis. The new edition includes Python-coded versions of the main image analysis algorithms discussed in the text, making it accessible to students and teachers without expensive ENVI/IDL licenses. "--
"The focus of this book is on pixel-oriented analysis of visual/infrared Earth observation satellite imagery. Among the topics that get the most attention are the discrete wavelet transform, image fusion, supervised classification with neural networks, clustering algorithms and statistical change detection methods. Each of the chapters concludes with exercises, some of which are small programming projects, intended to illustrate or justify the foregoing development"--
