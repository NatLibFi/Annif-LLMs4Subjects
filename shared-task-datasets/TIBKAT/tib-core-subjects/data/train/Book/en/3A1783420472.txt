Mobile microservices : building flexible pervasive applications
"In the 5G era, edge computing and new ecosystems of mobile microservices enable new business models, strategies, and competitive advantage. Focusing on microservices, this book introduces the essential concepts, technologies, and trade-offs in the edge computing architectural stack, providing for widespread adoption and dissemination. The book elucidates the concepts, architectures, well-defined building blocks, and prototypes for mobile microservice platforms and pervasive application development, as well as the implementation and configuration of service middleware and AI-based microservices. A goal-oriented service composition model is then proposed by the author, allowing for an economic assessment of connected, smart mobile services. Based on this model, costs can be minimized through statistical workload aggregation effects or backhaul data transport reduction, and customer experience and safety can be enhanced through reduced response times. This title will be a useful guide for students and IT professionals to get started with microservices and when studying the use of microservices in pervasive applications. It will also appeal to researchers and students studying software architecture and service-oriented computing, and especially those interested in edge computing, pervasive computing, the Internet of Things, and mobile microservices"--
