Continuum Mechanics
This concise textbook develops step by step the fundamental principles of continuum mechanics. Emphasis is on mathematical clarity, and an extended appendix provides the required background knowledge in linear algebra and tensor calculus. After introducing the basic notions about general kinematics, balance equations, material objectivity and constitutive functions, the book turns to the presentation of rational thermodynamics by stressing the role of Lagrange multipliers in deriving constitutive funcitions from the underlying entropy principle. A brief lecture on extended thermodynamics closes the book. Many examples and exercises round off the material presented in the chapters. The book addresses primarily advanced undergraduate students in theoretical physics, applied mathematics and materials sciences
