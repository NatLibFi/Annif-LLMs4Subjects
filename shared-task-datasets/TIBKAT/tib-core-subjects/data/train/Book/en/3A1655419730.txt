Shape Optimization by the Homogenization Method
This book provides an introduction to the theory and numerical developments of the homogenization method. Its main features are: a comprehensive presentation of homogenization theory; an introduction to the theory of two-phase composite materials;a detailed treatment of structural optimization by using homogenization; a complete discussion of the resulting numerical algorithms with many documented test problems. It will be of interest to researchers, engineers, and advanced graduate students in applied mathematics, mechanical engineering, and structural optimization
