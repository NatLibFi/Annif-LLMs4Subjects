Interactive LISREL in Practice : Getting Started with a SIMPLIS Approach
“Getting Started with a SIMPLIS Approach” is particularly appropriate for those users who are not experts in statistics, but have a basic understanding of multivariate analysis that would allow them to use this handbook as a good first foray into LISREL. Part I introduces the topic, presents the study that serves as the background for the explanation of matters, and provides the basis for Parts II and III, which, in turn, explain the process of estimation of the measurement model and the structural model, respectively. In each section, we also suggest essential literature to support the utilization of the handbook. After having read the book, readers will have acquired a basic knowledge of structural equation modeling, namely using the LISREL program, and will be prepared to continue with the learning process.
Part I – Introduction and Preparation of the Analysis -- PART II – Assessment of Measurement Model -- Part III – Assessment of Structural Model.
