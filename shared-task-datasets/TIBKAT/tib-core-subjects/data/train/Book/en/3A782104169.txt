Concise encyclopedia of high performance silicones
"A unique and indispensable one-stop encyclopedia for academicians and industrial sector scientists and engineers working on applied silicone technologies."--
"This concise encyclopedia contains critical information on silicones (i.e., polysiloxanes) that are commercially available for high performance applications. Although, voluminous literature is available to readers, however; vital information is hard to find as it remains scattered. This book has been compiled for a broad readership and contains carefully screened chapters on cutting edge technologies available in the field of silicones. The book contains three sections: developments, characterization and applications of silicones.In the first section, chapters are included that explain various innovative techniques adopted by chemists for the synthesis of novel silicone materials. In the second section, chapters describe the modern analytical techniques that are convenient for the characterization of silicones and allied materials. This section presents one-stop solution for scientists, who are looking for the comprehensive information and data extracted from NMR, FTIR, Raman, XPS and thermal analysis on a wide range of silicones. The final section explores current application areas of silicones. Various uses of silicones such as in soft electronics, contact lens, membranes, maxillofacial prosthetics, fiber optics, tissue engineering, microfluidic and biopharmaceuticals are described in depth and detail.
