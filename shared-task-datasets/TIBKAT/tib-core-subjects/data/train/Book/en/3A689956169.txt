LCP for microwave packages and modules
"A comprehensive overview of electrical design using Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP), giving you everything you need to know to get up-to-speed on the subject. This text describes successful design and development techniques for high-performance microwave and millimeter-wave packages and modules in an organic platform. These were specifically developed to make the most of LCP's inert, hermetic, low-cost, high-frequency (DC to 110+ GHz) properties. First-hand accounts show you how to avoid various pitfalls during design and development. You'll get extensive electrical design details in areas of broadband circuit design for low-loss interconnects, couplers, splitters/combiners, baluns, phase shifters, time-delay units (TDU), power amplifier (PA) modules, receiver modules, phased-array antennas, flexible electronics, surface mounted packages, Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) and reliability. Ideal for engineers in the fields of RF, microwave, signal integrity, advanced packaging, material science, optical and biomedical engineering"--
