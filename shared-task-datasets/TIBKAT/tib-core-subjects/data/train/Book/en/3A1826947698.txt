Food packaging : safety, management and quality
"The objective of this book is to present a snapshot of the latest advances in the development, characterization and quality management of films for food packaging purposes. This book consists of three sections. The first section aims at presenting an introduction to materials selection and design for food packaging. Different types of materials, ranging from polysaccharides to graphene oxide nanocomposites, for film development will be discussed. The second section reviews the current status of engineering and optimization of food packaging films. Applications of the films for packaging foods such as green vegetables and mushrooms will also be presented. The last section is devoted to delineating practices useful for quality control and assurance in food packaging. Concepts and implementation of HACCP and other quality control measures will be discussed. Strategies to reduce human error in quality control of fresh produce labels will also be covered for food production purposes"--
