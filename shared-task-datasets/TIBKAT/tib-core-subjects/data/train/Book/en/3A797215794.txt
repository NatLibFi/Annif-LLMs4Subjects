Quantum chemistry : a concise introduction for students of physics, chemistry, biochemistry and materials science
This book is designed to help the non-specialist user of spectroscopic measurements and electronic structure computations to achieve a basic understanding of the underlying concepts of quantum chemistry. The book can be used to teach introductory quantum chemistry to second-or third-year undergraduates either as a stand-alone one-semester course or as part of a physical chemistry or materials science course. Researchers in related fields can use the book as a quick introduction or refresher.
