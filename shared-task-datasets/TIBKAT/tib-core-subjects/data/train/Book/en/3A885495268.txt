Lectures on selected topics in mathematical physics : introduction to lie theory with applications
This book provides an introduction to Lie theory for first-year graduate students and professional physicists who may not have come across the theory in their studies. It is an overview of the theory of finite groups, a brief description of a manifold, and an informal development of the theory of one-parameter Lie groups. Interested readers should acquire a tool that is complete and that actually works to simplify or solve differential equations as well as moving them on to other topics.
