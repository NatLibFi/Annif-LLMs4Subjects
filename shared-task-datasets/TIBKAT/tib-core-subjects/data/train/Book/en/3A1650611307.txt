High-Performance Thin-Layer Chromatography (HPTLC)
The present edited book is the presentation of 18 in-depth national and international contributions from eminent professors, scientists and instrumental chemists from educational institutes, research organizations and industries providing their views on their experience, handling, observation and research outputs on HPTLC, a multi-dimensional instrumentation. The book describes the recent advancements made on TLC which have revolutionized and transformed it into a modern instrumental technique HPTLC. The book addresses different chapters on HPTLC fundamentals: principle, theory, understanding, instrumentation: implementation, optimization, validation, automation and qualitative and quantitative analysis, applications: phytochemical analysis, biomedical analysis, herbal drug quantification, analytical analysis, finger print analysis and potential for hyphenation: HPTLC future to combinatorial approach, HPTLC-MS, HPTLC-FTIR and HPTLC-Scanning Diode Laser. The chapters in the book have been designed in such away that the reader follows each step of the HPTLC in logical order.
