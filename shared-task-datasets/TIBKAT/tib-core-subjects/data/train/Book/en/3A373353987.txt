Theory and practice of finite elements
This bookpresentsthe mathematical theory of finite elements,starting from basic results on approximation theory and finite element interpolation and building up to more recent research topics, such as subgrid viscosity methods and Discontinuous Galerkin methods.The main body of the textis organized into three main sections. The firstpart develops the theoreticalbasisfor the finite element method, emphasizing inf-sup conditionsover themore conventional Lax-Milgrim paradigm, while the second and third parts address various applications andpractical implementaions of the method, respectively. Written at the graduate level,thetext contains numerous examples and exercises and will be beneficial to students and researchers alike. Depending on one's interests, several reading paths can be followed, emphasizing either convergence results, numerical algorithms, code efficiency, or applications in the engineering sciences.
