Practical multiscaling
"Practical Multiscaling covers fundamental modelling techniques aimed at bridging diverse temporal and spatial scales ranging from the atomic level to a full-scale product level. It focuses on practical multiscale methods that account for fine-scale (material) details but do not require their precise resolution. The text material evolved from over 20 years of teaching experience at Rensselaer and Columbia University, as well as from practical experience gained in the application of multiscale software. This book comprehensively covers theory and implementation, providing a detailed exposition of the state-of-the-art multiscale theories and their insertion into conventional (single-scale) finite element code architecture. The robustness and design aspects of multiscale methods are also emphasised, which is accomplished via four building blocks: upscaling of information, systematic reduction of information, characterization of information utilizing experimental data, and material optimization. To ensure the reader gains hands-on experience, a companion website hosting a lite version of the multiscale design software (MDS-Lite) is available. Key features: Combines fundamental theory and practical methods of multiscale modelling  Covers the state-of-the-art multiscale theories and examines their practical usability in design; covers applications of multiscale methods; accompanied by a continuously updated website hosting the multiscale design software; illustrated with colour images. Practical Multiscaling is an ideal textbook for graduate students studying multiscale science and engineering. It is also a must-have reference for government laboratories, researchers and practitioners in civil, aerospace, pharmaceutical, electronics, and automotive industries, and commercial software vendors"--
