Introductory solid state physics with MATLABÂ® applications
"Solid state physics, the study and prediction of the fundamental physical properties of materials, forms the backbone of modern materials science and has many technological applications.  The concepts learned in solid state physics also play an important role in treating systems that deviate away from the solid state, namely, glasses and perhaps even liquids for those who pursue such condensed matter topics.  The unique feature of this text is the MATLAB-based computational approach with several numerical techniques and simulation methods included"--Back cover
