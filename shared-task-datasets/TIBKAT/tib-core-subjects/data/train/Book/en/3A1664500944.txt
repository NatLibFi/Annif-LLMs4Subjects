Preface -- Introduction -- Fundamental principle and enabling technologies of single-frequency fiber lasers -- Single-frequency active fiber lasers -- Fiber nonlinear single-frequency lasers -- Single-frequency pulsed fiber lasers -- Single-frequency fiber amplifiers -- Representative applications of single-frequency fiber lasers -- Outlook
This book gives a contemporary overview of the technologies of single-frequency fiber lasers. The development of single-frequency fiber lasers is one of the most significant achievements in the field of laser photonics over the past two decades. Owing to the crucial demands of a laser sources with highly stable single-frequency operation, narrow linewidth, low noise, scalable to high output power, compact and robustness structure, fiber lasers have been intensively studied since its introduction to the single-frequency laser community and they still continuously proceed to trigger the emergence of new technologies and applications. This book systematically demonstrates the single-frequency fiber laser technologies from fundamental principles to state-of-the-art progress. Details of selected typical applications of single-frequency fiber lasers are also given and discussed. The reader will acquire a good knowledge of the current situation within this important field
