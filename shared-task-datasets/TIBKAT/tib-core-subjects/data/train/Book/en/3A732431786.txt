Brand spaces : branded architecture and the future of retail design
Brands are always hungry for new communication ideas. With unique spatial experiences quirky events, experimental showrooms, radical pop-up shops, and stunning flagship stores they are reaching out to their most sophisticated audiences. Brand Spaces showcases cutting-edge interior concepts and locations with character that effectively communicate brands in several dimensions at the same time. Decision-makers from leading brands such as Audi, Camper, Aesop, Freitag, Gaggenau, Nike, Nokia, and Starbucks share concepts and strategies that communicate overall brand identity while respecting local specifications. On top of that, a wide range of exceptional examples of contemporary interior design proves that the work of smaller brands and local retailers is as groundbreaking as that of larger global players. In short, Brand Spaces shows how trailblazers are creating branded worlds that are more than worth a visit. They are places that become urban landmarks or community hubs; they provide us with experiences that stick with us on an emotional level and we buy products there as souvenirs to preserve their memory
