Refining used lubricating oils
"Used lubricating oil is a valuable resource. This book examines recycling processes for a wide range of products with different properties and different criteria. It also compares the various recycling methods and resulting products to conventional products obtained from original refining processes. The reviews, data, and comparisons provided by the authors allow readers to identify which processes are likely to produce a product with specific properties, and enables them to combine this with an analysis of the economic data to identify attractive oil recycling propositions"--
