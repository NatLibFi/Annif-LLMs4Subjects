Advanced materials and techniques for radiation dosimetry
The threat of nuclear "dirty" bombs, a growing shift to nuclear energy, and new medical therapies using radiation are just some of the current developments bringing new importance to dosimetry? the detection and measurement of radiation. This comprehensive volume is indispensable to engineers and scientists working in dosimetry to protect the health and safety of radiation workers and the general public. Ranging from basic theory to advance concepts, this complete reference covers the physics of radiation, the biological effects of radiation, and the technology of radiation sensing and measurement. It provides a useful guide to commercially available dosimetry equipment and explains their applications. Surveying current and cutting-edge methods and materials used to detect radiation and record dosages, the book also explores novel approaches for designing new low-cost radiation sensors and furthering dosimetry research
