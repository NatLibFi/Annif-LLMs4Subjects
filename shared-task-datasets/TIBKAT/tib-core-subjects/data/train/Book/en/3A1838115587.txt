Elements of chemical reaction engineering
The Definitive Guide to Chemical Reaction Engineering Problem-Solving â€“ With Updated Content and More Active Learning For decades, H. Scott Fogler's Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering has been the world's dominant chemical reaction engineering text. This Sixth Edition and integrated Web site deliver a more compelling active learningexperience than ever before. Using sliders and interactive examples in Wolfram, Python, POLYMATH, and MATLAB, students can explore reactions and reactors byrunning realistic simulation experiments. Writingfor today's students, Fogler provides instant access to information, avoidsextraneous details, and presents novel problems linking theory to practice.Faculty can flexibly define their courses, drawing on updated chapters, problems, and extensive Professional Reference Shelf web content at diverselevels of difficulty. Thebook thoroughly prepares undergraduates to apply chemical reaction kinetics and physics to the design of chemical reactors. And four advanced chapters address graduate-level topics, including effectiveness factors. To support the field'sgrowing emphasis on chemical reactor safety, each chapter now ends with apractical safety lesson. Updates throughout the book reflect current theory and practice and emphasize safety New discussions of molecular simulations and stochastic modeling Increased emphasis on alternative energy sources such as solar and biofuels Thorough reworking of three chapters on heat effects Full chapters on non ideal reactors, diffusion limitations, and residence time distribution About the Companion Web Site
