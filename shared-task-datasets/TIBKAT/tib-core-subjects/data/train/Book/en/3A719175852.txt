Topics in structural graph theory
"The rapidly expanding area of structural graph theory uses ideas of connectivity to explore various aspects of graph theory and vice versa. It has links with other areas of mathematics, such as design theory and is increasingly used in such areas as computer networks where connectivity algorithms are an important feature. Although other books cover parts of this material, none has a similarly wide scope. Ortrud R. Oellermann (Winnipeg), internationally recognised for her substantial contributions to structural graph theory, acted as academic consultant for this volume, helping shape its coverage of key topics. The result is a collection of thirteen expository chapters, each written by acknowledged experts. These contributions have been carefully edited to enhance readability and to standardise the chapter structure, terminology and notation throughout. An introductory chapter details the background material in graph theory and network flows and each chapter concludes with an extensive list of references"--
