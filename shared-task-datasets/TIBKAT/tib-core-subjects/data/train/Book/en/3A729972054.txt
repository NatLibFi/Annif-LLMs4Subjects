Open Innovation in Global Networks
To match the global demand and supply of innovation, businesses increasingly internationalise their innovation activities while opening their innovation process by collaborating with external partners (e.g., suppliers, customers, universities). This book examines what drives these global innovation networks across different industries, how they are related to companies' overall strategies, whether they are accessible for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and what the consequences are.
