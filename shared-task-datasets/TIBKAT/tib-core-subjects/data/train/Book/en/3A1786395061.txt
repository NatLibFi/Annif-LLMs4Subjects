Bioremediation : green approaches for a clean and sustainable environment
"Environmental sustainability with rapid industrialization is one of the major challenges of the current scenario worldwide. Industries are the key drivers in the world economy, but these are also the major polluters of environment due to discharge of partially treated/untreated toxic and hazardous wastes containing organic and inorganic pollutants, which cause severe environmental (soil and water) pollution and toxic effects in living beings. Thus, the adequate treatment of industrial wastes to degrade/detoxify pollutants is utmost important for environmental safety and to promote the sustainable development of our society with low environmental impacts. Thus, this book entitled "Bioremediation: Green Approaches for a Clean and Sustainable Environment" showcases the latest information on the different bioremediation approaches used for the different types of industrial pollutants and dedicated for the environmental safety. This book provides a detailed knowledge on the various natural as well as anthropogenic sources of different types of toxic pollutants such as toxic metals, dyes, pesticides, petroleum hydrocarbons, plastics etc., their fate and transport into the environment, their ecotoxicological effects and health hazards as well as different approaches used for their bioremediation for the environmental cleanup. Key features cover the different aspects of environmental problems and their remedies with up to date developments in the field of bioremediation of industrial/environmental pollutants. This book serves as an invaluable source of knowledge for a wide range of students, scientists and researchers in Microbiology, Biotechnology, Environmental Sciences with the fundamental and advance knowledge about the environmental pollution, challenges and bioremediation of toxic pollutants"
