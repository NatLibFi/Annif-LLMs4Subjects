An introduction to the formalism of quantum information with continuous variables
Quantum information is an emerging field which has attracted a lot of attention in the last couple of decades. It is a broad subject which extends from the most applied questions (e.g. how to build quantum computers or secure cryptographic systems) to the most theoretical problems concerning the formalism and interpretation of quantum mechanics, its complexity, and its potential to go beyond classical physics. This book is an introduction to quantum information with special emphasis on continuous-variable systems (such as light) which can be described as collections of harmonic oscillators. It covers a selection of basic concepts, focusing on their physical meaning and mathematical treatment. It starts from the very first principles of quantum mechanics, and builds up the concepts and techniques following a logical progression. This is an excellent reference for students with a full semester of standard quantum mechanics and researchers in closely related fields.
