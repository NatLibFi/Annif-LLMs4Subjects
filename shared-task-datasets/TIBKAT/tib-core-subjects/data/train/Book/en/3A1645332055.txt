Condensed Matter and Materials Science are two of the most active fields of applied physics, with a stream of discoveries in areas from superconductivity and magnetism to the optical, electronic and mechanical properties of materials. While a huge amount of data has been compiled and spread over numerous reference works, no single volume compiles the most used information. Springer Handbook of Condensed Matter and Materials Data provides a concise compilation of data and functional relationships from the fields of solid-state physics and materials in this 1200-page volume. The data, encapsulated in over 750 tables and 1025 illustrations, have been selected and extracted primarily from the extensive high-quality data collection Landolt-Börnstein and also from other systematic data sources and recent publications of physical and technical property data. Many chapters are authored by Landolt-Börnstein editors, including the editors of this Springer Handbook. Key Topics Fundamental Constants The International System of Units (SI) Rudiments of Crystallography The Elements Metals, Ceramics, Polymers, Glasses Semiconductors, Superconductors, Magnetic Materials, Dielectrics and Electrooptics Ferroelectrics and Antiferroelectrics Liquid Crystals Physics of Solid Surfaces, Mesoscopic and Nanostructered Materials Features Covers basic data, materials, properties and fabrication.
