Isotope Effects : in the Chemical, Geological, and Bio Sciences
"Isotope Effects: Applications in the Chemical Geological and Bio Sciences is an educational monograph that provides the tools for teaching and understanding the principles of isotope effects. The book also describes applications of isotope effects, within the framework of these principles, and touches on most of the general types of applications in a variety of disciplines. The term ""isotope effects"" is used rather than ""applications of isotopes"" to indicate clearly that this book deals with the differences in the properties of isotopically substituted molecules (e.g. H2O and HDO where HDO is an isotopically substituted water molecule with one of the two hydrogen atoms in water replaced by a deuterium atom which is an isotope of hydrogen). The interest of the book is in the origin of the difference of the properties of isotopes and also in the applications and the consequences of these differences. This book does not deal with the use of isotopes as tracers, although isotopes are indeed widely used as tracers and such applications are very important. The principles covered in this book will probably be more familiar to the physical chemistry graduate students, but the book is constructed in such a way as to ensure that it is an asset for biochemistry students and isotope geology students. The various fields in which isotope effects are applied do not only share fundamental principles but they also share experimental techniques. Thus, the book includes discussion of experimental techniques and experimental apparatus. The book does not present a review of isotope effect studies, but provides students with a good ""taste"" of what has been done what is being done at present, and how it is being done."
