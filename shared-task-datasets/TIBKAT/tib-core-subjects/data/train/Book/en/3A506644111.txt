Control of redundant robot manipulators : theory and experiments
This monograph provides a comprehensive and thorough treatment of the problem of controlling a redundant robot manipulator. It presents the latest research from the field with a good balance between theory and practice. All theoretical developments are verified both via simulation and experimental work on an actual prototype redundant robot manipulator. This book is the first text aimed at graduate students and researchers working in the area of redundant manipulators giving a comprehensive coverage of control of redundant robot manipulators from the viewpoint of theory and experimentation
