Applications of energy harvesting technologies in buildings
This timely new resource explores the available energy sources within commercial and residential buildings and the available technologies for energy harvesting. Energy harvesting within built environments is presented using strong research and commercial examples. This book includes clear and concise case studies on solar cell powered sensor nodes for emotion monitoring systems in ambient assistive living environments and inductive/RF power transfers. Thermoelectric energy harvesting and power management circuit design, airflow and vibration energy harvesting is also explored. The book concludes with a look at the future of energy harvesting in buildings
