Electronic transport theories from weakly to strongly correlated materials
"The issue of transport in strongly correlated materials is of current interest. This book presents a concise and pedagogical introduction to a wide range of topics in electronic transport. There are plenty of books that cover the traditional theories (Boltzamnn transport equation and Kubo formula) however, there is no such book that covers the traditional theories along with the recent theories of transport in strongly correlated materials. Being useful to both graduates and researchers, this book deals with the challenging problems in this area"--
