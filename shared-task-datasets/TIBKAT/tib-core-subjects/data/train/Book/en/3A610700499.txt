Chemotaxis : methods and protocols
"Fundamental to the development and vital functions of organisms, the migration of motile cells due to the detection of shallow gradients of specific chemical signals in their environments, or chemotaxis, can be clearly seen as a major force in cell biology. In Chemotaxis: Methods and Protocols, expert researchers in the field provide state-of-the-art methods for investigating cell migration behaviors, studying molecular components involved in detecting extracellular signals and directing cell movement, visualizing spatiotemporal dynamics of the components in signaling networks of chemotaxis in real time, and constructing quantitative models that simulate chemoattractant-induced cell responses. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and notes on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls." "Comprehensive and cutting-edge, Chemotaxis: Methods and Protocols serves scientists with practical guidance on the diverse methodologies that are currently propelling chemotaxis research forward in order to further our understanding of this vital biological system."--BOOK JACKET
