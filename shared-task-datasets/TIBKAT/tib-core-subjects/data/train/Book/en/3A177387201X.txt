Corrosion is generally described as "an attack on a metallic material by reaction with itâ€™s environment". The corrosion of metallic materials causes large economic losses and is a high risk for accidents. The cost of corrosion is great but it is possible to reduce this cost by a better employment of existing knowledge. Providing a thorough contribution to knowledge distribution, Bardal combines a description of practical corrosion processes and problems with a theoretical explanation of the various types and forms of corrosion, with particular attention to the interaction between description and theory. A well thought-out introduction to corrosion science, with excellent examples and useful tables of data. Exremley well illustrated with 167 diagrams and photographs. Contains extensive reference material utilising the latest international standards. Vital emphasis is placed on the connections between practical problems and basic scientific principles. Corrosion and Protection is an essential guide for engineering students, particularly those with a limited background in chemistry, such as mechanical, marine and civil engineering students and also provides a valuable reference source for practicing engineers.
