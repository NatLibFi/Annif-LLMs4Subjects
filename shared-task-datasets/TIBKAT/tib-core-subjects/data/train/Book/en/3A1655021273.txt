The MatlabÂ® 5 Handbook
The Matlab 5 Handbook is an easily accessible reference tool and first resource for the numerical computation system MATLAB. Each MATLAB command, in both the standard library and the applications toolboxes, is described in a precise, concise, and consistent manner. Topics, including calculus, linear algebra, graphics, and more, are explained in context. The Matlab 5 Handbook begins with MATLABQuickstart, an introductory session which will help get the reader off to a flying start. Each section then begins with a practical introduction to the subject area. There is also an introduction to MATLAB programming as a whole. Each entry includes the command name, common types of parameter sequences, description, type of output to expect, additional hints and information, and extensive cross references. Everyone who uses MATLAB in more than the most cursory fashion will find this book a helpful tool, not only because of its structure, but because it combines elements previously not available in any other book or in on-line help files for MATLAB. It is fully up to date for MATLAB 5
