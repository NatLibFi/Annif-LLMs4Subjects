City Made : resumptions of urban production
This book documents the most recent realizations of urban factory facilities in Flanders designed by the upcoming architecture studio TRANS. In Flanders three recently built factory facilities showcase the potential of bringing manufacturing back to the city. Nina Rappaport (Yale University) and Job Floris (Monadnock architects) put these projects designed by Ghent-based architects TRANS into context. Interviews with CEOs and policymakers give a 'behind the scenes' insight on the co-production of these pioneering projects and high-quality drawings and pictures show precise information on their construction. Exhibition: Traveling exhibition in Brussels, Rotterdam, London and Ghent (2018-2019)
