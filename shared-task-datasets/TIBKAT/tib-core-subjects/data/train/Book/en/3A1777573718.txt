Extraction techniques for environmental analysis
"This text will focus on the extraction techniques used for organic compounds of relevance for environmental analysis. In addition, information will be provided that covers all relevant extraction techniques for aqueous, air and solid environmental matrices. Case study material will be used to help visualise and focus on the technologies used. In addition, the book will have a chapter that sets the scene in terms of the requirements, including health and safety, for the analytical laboratory and will be sectioned to allow ease of reading and will cover aqueous samples, solid samples and gaseous samples. By using case studies for specific extraction techniques and their methods will provide the reader with in-depth knowledge for adoption in the laboratory; whilst providing extensive coverage of the practical aspects of all extraction techniques described. Finally, the relevant analytical techniques used for the analysis of the organic compound extracts will be discussed, with a focus on chromatographic separation and detection"--
