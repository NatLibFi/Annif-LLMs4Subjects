An Introduction to large-scale tropical meteorology
This upper-undergraduate/graduate-level textbook introduces students to large-scale tropical climate circulation and its variations, covering their fundamental aspects and our current understanding of how they are impacted in a warming world. From this volume, readers will gain an understanding of tropical climate variability from the meso- to planetary scale. Uniquely, equal emphasis is placed on atmospheric and oceanic processes of tropical phenomena. The book will appeal to senior undergraduate and graduate students across geoscience disciplines, including in meteorology, oceanography, geography, hydrology, and environmental science.
