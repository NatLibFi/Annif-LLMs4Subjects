Code in the cloud : programming Google app engine
Provides information on building scalable Web applications using Google App Engine. Cloud computing refers to the use and access of multiple server-based computational resources via a digital network (WAN, Internet connection using the World Wide Web, etc.). Cloud users may access the server resources using a computer, netbook, pad computer, smart phone, or other device. In cloud computing, applications are provided and managed by the cloud server and data is also stored remotely in the cloud configuration. This volume will show readers what a cloud service is, and how it differs from traditional applications. It will demonstrate how to build a cloud service, taking advantage of the services that AppEngine makes available, using iterative development of a simple application to guide you through the different aspects of AppEngine development, using either Python or Java. Through the process of working on a simple application, readers will learn about how to build an application as a service; how to manage persistent data using AppEngine; how to build dynamic, interactive user interfaces that run in a user's web-browser; how to manage security in a web application; and how to interact with other services running in the AppEngine cloud.--
