Material characterization techniques and applications
Characterization techniques for morphology analysis -- Characterization techniques for mass spectrometry analysis -- Characterization techniques for topography analysis -- Characterization techniques for chemical and structural analyses -- Characterization techniques for thermal analysis -- Characterization techniques for wettability analysis -- Characterization techniques for electrochemical analysis -- Characterization techniques for chromatography analysis -- Coupled characterization techniques.
This book presents commonly applied characterization techniques in material science, their brief history and origins, mechanism of operation, advantages and disadvantages, their biosensing applications, and troubleshooting for each technique, while addressing the challenges researchers face when working with these techniques. The book dedicates its focus to identifying physicochemical and electrochemical nature of materials including analyses of morphology, mass spectrometry, and topography, as well as the characterization of elemental, structural, thermal, wettability, electrochemical, and chromatography properties. Additionally, the main features and benefits of using coupled characterization techniques are discussed in this book.
