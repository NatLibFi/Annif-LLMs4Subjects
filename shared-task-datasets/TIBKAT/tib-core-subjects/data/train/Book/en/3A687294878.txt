The Ashgate research companion to border studies
This comprehensive volume brings together a multidisciplinary team of leading scholars to provide an authoritative, state-of-the-art review of all aspects of borders and border research. It is global in scope and embraces the more traditional strands of the field including geopolitics, migration and territorial identities, and also recently emerging topics such as the role of borders in a seemingly borderless world; creating neighbourhoods, and border enforcement in the post-9/11 era
