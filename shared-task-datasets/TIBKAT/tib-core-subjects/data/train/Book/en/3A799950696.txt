Organic synthesis and molecular engineering
With a focus on methods and practices for how to engineer functionality into organic molecules, Organic Synthesis and Molecular Engineering takes a synthesis-oriented approach to organic materials chemistry. Examining how smart, functional organic molecules are rationally designed and prepared, chapters cover: the concepts, molecular building blocks, synthetic tools, molecular electronic, supramolecular chemistry and self-assembly, grapheme, the engineering of photoresponsive materials, applications across both materials and bioorganic chemistry, molecular electronics, energy storage, s
