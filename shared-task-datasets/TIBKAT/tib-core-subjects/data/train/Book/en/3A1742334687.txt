Heritage planning : principles and process
"This new and substantially revised edition of 'Heritage Planning: Principles and Process' offers an extensive overview of the burgeoning fields of heritage planning and conservation. Positioning professional practice within its broader applied and theoretical contexts, the authors provide a firm foundation for understanding the principles, history, evolution, debates, and tools that inform heritage planning, while also demonstrating how to effectively enact these processes. Few published works focus on the practice of heritage planning. The first edition of this book was developed to fill this gap, and this second edition builds upon it. The book has been expanded in scope to incorporate new research and approaches, as well as a wide range of international case studies. New themes reflect the emerging recognition that sustainability, climate resilience, human rights, social justice, and reconciliation are fundamental to the future of planning. Heritage Planning is indispensable reading, not only for professionals who transform the built environment, but for anyone who wants to understand the ideas and practices of heritage planning and conservation. For the benefit of student readers, twelve chapters-designed to accommodate the academic semester-are augmented with concise summaries, key terms and definitions, questions, and learning objectives"--
