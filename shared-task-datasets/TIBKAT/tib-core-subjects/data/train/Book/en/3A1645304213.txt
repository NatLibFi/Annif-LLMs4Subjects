Heat and Mass Transfer
This comprehensive presentation of the whole field of heat and mass transfer makes the reader familar with the fundamentals and enables him to solve practical problems. The basic theory is developed systematically, and the solution methods to all important problems are covered in detail. Therefore, this book will be useful not only to students, but likewise to scientists and practising engineers. All areas of heat and mass transfer are dealt with. Many calculated examples in the text and numerous exercises and elaborate solutions will facilitate learning and understanding.  For the second edition, changes apply to heat and mass transfer correlations based on theoretical results or experimental findings. They were adapted to the state-of -the-art. Some of the worked examples as well as the compilation were revised or updated.
