Principles of biofuels and hydrogen gas : production and engine performance
"Principles of Biofuels explores the chemistry of biofuels, the latest refining processes, and major performance characteristics-discussing the theory and experimental procedures used to prepare biofuels economically. Unlike most books on biofuels that broadly cover non-conventional energy sources, this book goes into detail about engine performance, making it a highly valuable resource for students, researchers, and practitioners. Principles of Biofuels is grounded in professional relevance and expertise. It covers the derivation of hydrogen gas from biomass and water media, as well as biofuels derived from algae and biomass. End-of-chapter questions reinforce student comprehension"--
