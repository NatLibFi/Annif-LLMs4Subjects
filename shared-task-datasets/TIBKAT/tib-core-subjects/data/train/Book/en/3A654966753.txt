Optimization for communications and networks
"The book provides an introduction to optimization theory and its applications. It is written for senior under-graduate students and first-year graduate students of telecommunication and related fields. Most applications pertain to communication and network problems. Optimization theory involves a great deal of mathematics. The book has practical examples to accompany rigorous discussion so that the reader may develop intuitive understanding on relevant concepts. The materials have been developed from course notes. By attempting to cover convex, linear, and integer optimization for a one-semester course, the author focuses on fundamental concepts and techniques rather than trying to be comprehensive. Infact, the book is written with the main intention to serve as a bridge for students with no prior background in optimization to be able to access more advanced books on the subject later on."--Provided by publisher
