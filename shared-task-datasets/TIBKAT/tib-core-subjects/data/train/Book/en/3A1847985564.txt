On-board processing for satellite remote sensing images
"Onboard image processing systems are used to maximize image data transmission efficiency for large volumes of data gathered by Earth observation satellites. This book explains the methods, mathematical models, and key technologies used for these systems. It introduces the background, basic concepts, and the architecture of on-board image processing, along with on-board detection of the image feature and matching, ground control point identification, on-board geometric correction, calibration, geographic registration, etc. A great reference for students, researchers, and professionals in government and industry interested in remote sensing of cities and disaster monitoring"--
