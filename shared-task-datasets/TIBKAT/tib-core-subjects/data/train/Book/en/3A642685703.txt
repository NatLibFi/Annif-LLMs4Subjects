Bureau B+B - stedebouw en landschapsarchitectuur ; een collectief talent 1977 - 2010
Summary: Since it was established by Riek Bakker and Ank Bleeker in 1977, the Bakker & Bleeker bureau (operating as Bureau B+B since 1990) has functioned as a laboratory for the professional community. Designers such as Winy Maas, Adriaan Geuze and Michael van Gessel have worked there and the office was an incubator for design practices such as West 8, Karres en Brands and Rietveld Landscape. The development of Bureau B+B coincides to a large extent with the emancipation of Dutch post-war landscape architecture and urbanism. Self-assured and autonomous, the bureau reintroduced design to the city, from an unexpected angle. It soon ranked among the world|s best, thanks among other things to its design for the Parc de la Villette in Paris (1982), a commission won ex aequo with designers such as Rem Koolhaas and Bernard Tschumi. The bureau has always been interdisciplinary, employing landscape architects, urban planners, architects, land development experts and industrial designers
