Computational Aspects of Model Choice
This volume contains complete texts of the lectures held during the Summer School on "Computational Aspects of Model Choice", organized jointly by International Association for Statistical Computing and Charles University, Prague, on July 1 - 14, 1991, in Prague. Main aims of the Summer School were to review and analyse some of the recent developments concerning computational aspects of the model choice as well as their theoretical background. The topics cover the problems of change point detection, robust estimating and its computational aspecets, classification using binary trees, stochastic approximation and optimizationincluding the discussion about available software, computational aspectsof graphical model selection and multiple hypotheses testing. The bridge between these different approaches is formed by the survey paper about statistical applications of artificial intelligence
