Recent developments in structural health monitoring and assessment : opportunities and challenges : bridges, buildings and other infrastructures
"This is a follow up to Health Assessment of Engineered Structures (World Scientific, 2013). It incorporates the most recent developments in health assessment and monitoring of infrastructures covering several advanced conceptual frameworks, different types of sensors, and application potentials. Opportunities and challenges in theoretical, numerical, and experimental investigations generally overlooked in the profession are discussed. Also included are various types of Bayesian filtering concepts improving the commonly used techniques. Showcasing a multi-faceted, technology-based development in health assessment of infrastructures, several new approaches for health assessment are presented to assess the health of masonry structures, riveted steel railway bridges, and more, such as the use of: Modified Social Group Optimization (MSGO) - a human-based meta-heuristic optimization technique, autonomous crack detection approach using Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality (AR) - a digital interface that combines interactive holographic components with the real-world, vision-based noncontact and targetless vibration sensors, as well as intelligent use of smartphone-based health assessment"--
