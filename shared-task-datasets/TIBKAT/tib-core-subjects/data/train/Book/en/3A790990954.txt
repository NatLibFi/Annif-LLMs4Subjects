Above ground storage tanks : practical guide to construction, inspection, and testing
"Although the majority of above ground storage tanks are constructed according the standards of the American Petroleum Institute (API), these standards only provide requirements. There has long been a need for a book that deals with all aspects subsequent to design. Filling this need, this book deals with every aspect that needs to be known upon receipt of an order to construct a storage tank at site. It describes all activities that are to be carried out in a sequential manner, principally aimed at achieving required quality for the constructed storage tank. "--
