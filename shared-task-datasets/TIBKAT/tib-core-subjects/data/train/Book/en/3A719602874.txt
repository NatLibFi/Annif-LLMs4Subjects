Stochastic dynamics of marine structures
"Stochastic Dynamics of Marine Structures is a text for students and reference for professionals on the basic theory and methods used for stochastic modelling and analysis of marine structures subjected to environmental loads. The first part of the book provides a detailed introduction to the basic dynamic analysis of structures, serving as a foundation for later chapters on stochastic response analysis. This includes an extensive chapter on the finite element method. A careful introduction to stochastic modelling is provided, which includes the concepts: stochastic process, variance spectrum, random environmental processes, response spectrum, response statistics and short- and long-term extreme value models. The second part of the book offers detailed discussion of limit state design approaches, fatigue design methods, the equations of motion for dynamic structures and numerical solution techniques. The final chapter highlights methods for prediction of extreme values from measured data or data obtained by Monte Carlo simulation"--
