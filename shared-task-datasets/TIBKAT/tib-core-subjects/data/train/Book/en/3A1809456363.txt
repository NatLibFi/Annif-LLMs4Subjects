Uncertain graph and network optimization
This first book focuses on uncertain graph and network optimization. It covers three different main contents: uncertain graph, uncertain programming and uncertain network optimization. It also presents applications of uncertain network optimization in a lot of real problems such as transportation problems, dispatching medical supplies problems and location problems. The book is suitable for researchers, engineers, teachers and students in the field of mathematics, information science, computer science, decision science, management science and engineering, artificial intelligence, industrial engineering, economics and operations research.
