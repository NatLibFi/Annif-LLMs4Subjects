"If big data is an untapped natural resource, how do you find the gold hidden within? Leaders realize that big data means all data, and are moving quickly to extract more value from both structured and unstructured application data. However, analyzing this data can prove costly and complex, especially while protecting the availability, performance and reliability of essential business applications. In the new era of big data, businesses require data systems that can blend always-available transactions with speed-of-thought analytics. DB2 10.5 with BLU Acceleration provides this speed, simplicity, and affordability while making it easier to build next-generation applications with NoSQL features, such as a mongo-styled JSON document store, a graph store, and more. Dynamic in-memory columnar processing and other innovations deliver faster insights from more data, and enhanced pureScale clustering technology delivers high-availability transactions with application-transparent scalability for business continuity. With this book, you'll learn about the power and flexibility of multiworkload, multi-platform database software."--
