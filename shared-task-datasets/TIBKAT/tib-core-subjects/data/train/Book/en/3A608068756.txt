Carbon nanotubes and related structures : synthesis, characterization, functionalization, and applications
"Carbon's special structures, such as diamond, graphite, and in particular fullerenes and nanotubes, have unique mechanical and electronic properties that have triggered a research boom over the past fifteen years. The resulting applications range from ultrahard films and super-tensile materials to the exceptionally minute functionalities found in transistors, sensors, nanocontainers, and biomedical applications." "Written by the most prominent experts and pioneers in the field, this ready reference combines fundamental research, recent breakthroughs and real-life applications in one well-organized treatise. As such, both newcomers and established researchers will find here a wide range of current methods for producing and characterizing carbon nanotubes using imaging as well as spectroscopic techniques."--BOOK JACKET
