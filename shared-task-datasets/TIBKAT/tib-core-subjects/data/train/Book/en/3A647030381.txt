Microbial fuel cells
The theory, design, construction, and operation of microbial fuel cellsMicrobial fuel cells (MFCs), devices in which bacteria create electrical power by oxidizing simple compounds such as glucose or complex organic matter in wastewater, represent a new and promising approach for generating power. Not only do MFCs clean wastewater, but they also convert organics in these wastewaters into usable energy. Given the world's limited supply of fossil fuels and fossil fuels' impact on climate change, MFC technology's ability to create renewable, carbon-neutral energy has generated tremendous interest
Dedicated entirely to microbial fuel cells - a method of efficient energy production. This title serves as an introduction to MFC theory in a variety of industries, as well as a manual for research and maintenance
