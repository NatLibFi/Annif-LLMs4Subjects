Environmental pollution and medicinal plants
"Environmental pollution mainly caused by anthropogenic activities can damage medicinal plants and alter their growth, gas exchange parameters, biochemical attributes, bioactive substances, antioxidant activity, and gene expression. This book presents information on impacts of environmental pollution on the performance of medicinal plants at various levels including damage detection, adaptation, tolerance, physiological and molecular responses. Discusses trends and responses of medicinal plant tolerance and adaptation to environmental pollution. Focuses on secondary metabolites, phytochemicals, and bioactive compounds associated with medicinal plants growing in contamination conditions"--
