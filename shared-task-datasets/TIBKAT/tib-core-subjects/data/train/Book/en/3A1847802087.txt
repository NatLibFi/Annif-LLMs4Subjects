Laboratory manual for groundwater, wells, and pumps
"The over-exploitation of groundwater and marked changes in climate over recent decades has led to unacceptable declines in groundwater resources. Laboratory Manual for Groundwater, Wells, and Pumps serves as a valuable resource and provides a multi-disciplinary overview for academics, administrators, scientists, policymakers, and professionals involved in the managing sustainable groundwater development programs. It includes practical guidance on the measurement of groundwater flow, soil properties, aquifer properties, wells and their design, as well as the latest state-of-the-art information on pumps and their testing, and groundwater modeling"--
