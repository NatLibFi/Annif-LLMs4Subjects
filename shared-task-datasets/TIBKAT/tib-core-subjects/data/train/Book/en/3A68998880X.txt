Membrane processes in biotechnologies and pharmaceutics
Membrane processes are increasingly used in pharmaceutical and biochemical engineering, and biotechnology for concentration and purification, synthesis of molecules and drug delivery systems, and support for biochemical reactions. This book provides a state-of-the art overview of the classical membrane processes used in pharmaceutical and biochemical engineering, and biotechnology, such as ultrafiltration, microfiltration, virus filtration, membrane chromatography, membrane emulsification, liquid membranes and membrane bioreactors. It describes the general rules (principles, choice of configurations, membranes, parameters, etc.), recent developments (fouling control, increase permeate flux and selectivity, etc.), applications, and theoretical descriptions. Further it presents emerging processes such as solvent resistant nanofiltration and membrane crystallization
