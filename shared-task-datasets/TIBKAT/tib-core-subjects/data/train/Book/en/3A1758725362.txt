Active packaging for various food applications
"Microbial attacks occur on food surfaces even when the food is packaged. This can be attributed to moisture permeability in the packaging materials and other environmental conditions. Therefore, active agents like antimicrobial components and antioxidants must be incorporated into the packaging system; these active agents function by enhancing the stability of the product to a greater extent. Implementing active packaging system ensures the safety and quality aspects of packaged foods so that consumers may use the products without worry. Active Packaging for Various Food Applications addresses the significance of active packaging for enhancing quality and safety of various packaged foods. This book discusses extending the shelf life of various food products by incorporating various active packaging systems. It also addresses bioactive materials used for packing food products, and application of nano materials in an active packaging system. This book is a great source for academicians, scientists, research scholars, and food industry personnel, shedding light on the recent techniques used in active packaging systems for enhancing quality aspects"--
