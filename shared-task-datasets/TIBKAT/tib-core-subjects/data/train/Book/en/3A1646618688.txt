High Field Brain MRI : Use in Clinical Practice
This book describes the development of systems of magnetic resonance imaging using the higher magnetic field strength of 3 tesla, in comparison to the current gold standard of 1.5 tesla. These new systems of MRI make it possible to perform with high spatial, temporal and contrast resolution not only morphological examinations but also functional studies on spectroscopy, diffusion, perfusion, and cortical activation, thus helping research and providing an important tool for routine diagnostic activity. At the same time the new systems offer unparalleled sensitivity and specificity in the numerous conditions of neuroradiological interest.
