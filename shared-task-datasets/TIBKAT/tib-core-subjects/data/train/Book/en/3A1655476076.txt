Computational Aspects of Linear Control
The main objective of this volume is to create a bridge between control theory and its numerical analysis aspects. It is unique because it presents both subjects in a single volume. The book combines an exposition of linear control theory and the corresponding modern relevant computational techniques such as orthogonal polynomials, Pad√© approximation, numerical linear algebra, and some topics on nonlinear differential equations. It can be considered as an introduction to control theory for numerical analysts looking for a wide area of applications and as an introduction to recent numerical methods for control specialists. Audience: Aimed at advanced students at a doctoral or post-doctoral level, engineers, and researchers in control theory and numerical analysis
