Classical theory of free-electron lasers : a text for students and researchers
This textbook focuses on the fully classical theory of FELs with application to FEL oscillators and develops the fundamentals of FEL theory in sufficient depth to provide both a solid understanding of FEL physics and a solid background for research in the field. All numerical approximations were developed by the author and numerous examples are included throughout to illustrate the application of analytical results. The text is written at a level suitable for advanced undergraduate or graduate students.
