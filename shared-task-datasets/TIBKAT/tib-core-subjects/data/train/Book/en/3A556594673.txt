Shaped crystals : growth by micro-pulling-down technique
This volume presents an overview of the growth of shaped crystals (oxides, fluorides, etc.) by the micro-pulling-down technique. Both melt and solution (flux) growth are considered. The advantages and disadvantages of the method are discussed in detail and compared with related crystal-growth processes. The authors attempt to give a practical introduction to this technique, thereby also explaining how its application can help to solve problems commonly encountered in other melt-growth methods. Currently the micro-pulling-down technique is applicable to the growth of crystals up to 1 m long with cross-section ranging from 0.05 to 10 mm. This book represents a valuable resource for researchers, industrial engineers, teachers, and students involved in materials science, crystal growth, physics, chemistry, optics and electronics.
