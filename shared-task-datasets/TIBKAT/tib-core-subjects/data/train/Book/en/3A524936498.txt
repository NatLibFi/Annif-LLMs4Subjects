Plasma-Material Interaction in Controlled Fusion
Plasma-Material Interaction in Controlled Fusion deals with the specific contact between the fourth state of matter, i.e. plasma, and the first state of matter, i.e. a solid wall, in controlled fusion experiments. A comprehensive analysis of the main processes of plasma-surface interaction is given together with an assessment of the most critical questions within the context of general criteria and operation limits. It is shown that the choice of plasma-facing materials can be reduced to a very limited list of possible candidates. Plasma-Material Interaction in Controlled Fusion emphasizes that a reliable solution of the material problem can only be found by adjusting the materials to suitable plasma scenarios andvice versa.
