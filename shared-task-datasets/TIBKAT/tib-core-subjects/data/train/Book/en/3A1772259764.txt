Electricity and magnetism : new formulation by introduction of superconductivity
This book is a very comprehensive textbook covering in great depth all the electricity and magnetism. The 2nd edition includes new and revised figures and exercises in many of the chapters, and the number of problems and exercises for the student is increased. In the 1st edition, emphasis much was made of superconductivity, and this methodology will be continued in the new edition by strengthening of the E-B analogy. Many of the new exercises and problems are associated with the E-B analogy, which enables those teaching from the book to select suitable teaching methods depending on the studentâ€™s ability and courses taken, whether physics, astrophysics, or engineering. Changes in the chapters include a detailed discussion of the equivector-potential surface and its correspondence between electricity and magnetism. The shortcomings of using the magnetic scalar potential are also explained. The zero resistivity in a magnetic material showing perfect diamagnetism can be easily proved. This textbook is an ideal text for students, who are competent in calculus and are taking physics, astrophysics, or engineering at degree level. It is also useful as a reference book for the professional scientist.
