Providing an invaluable resource, this volume contains analysed, evaluated and distilled information on the latest in organometallic and coordination chemistry research and emerging fields. With the increase in volume, velocity and variety of information, researchers can find it difficult to keep up to date with the literature in their field. The reviews range in scope and include recent advances in chromium coordination chemistry, borohydride and borane ligand architectures supported by heterocyclic units and discussion on behaviours of novel ruthenium(II) complexes. This volume is a key reference for researchers in academic and industrial settings
