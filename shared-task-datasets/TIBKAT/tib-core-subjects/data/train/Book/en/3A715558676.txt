Incomplete urbanism : a critical urban strategy for emerging economies
"Incomplete Urbanism is a dynamic, hybrid interactive concept, which destabilizes the current architectural and urban theories and practices. Its main characteristics are indeterminacy, inconsistency and changeability, which are particularly challenging in the context of the New World Order and the fast emerging global digital network. It is a concept that can be effectively applied to any sizeable section of existing cities without the need for major readjustments and can be implemented at different rates in response to specific local conditions. As for the word 'critical', I use it deliberately in order to convey the essential need to think creatively and positively in a controversial contesting and social-orientated manner about what we do, as it will constructively influence the way we do things that impact our values and social environment."--Publisher's website
