Deep learning for the earth sciences : a comprehensive approach to remote sensing, climate science and geosciences
"The research in deep learning for the geosciences and Earth observation is growing fast and goes beyond the mere application of algorithms to new data. This is a huge interdisciplinary field. Applying new algorithms to the data deluge is a hot topic in all these cross-sectorial fields. Academic research on this area is strongly involved, and many specialized conferences and special issues in journals are arising each year. The book will provide the reader with the landscape, skills, and principles to quickly become familiar with both fields? needs and applications and will give a principled status of where are we now. The practitioner will be ready to use the technology and principles in his/her own research field in a short period of time. The highlights on future research at the end of each chapter will provide new ideas, particularly for those people involved in advanced research education, who will find these highlights of special interest for PhD Thesis orientations"--
