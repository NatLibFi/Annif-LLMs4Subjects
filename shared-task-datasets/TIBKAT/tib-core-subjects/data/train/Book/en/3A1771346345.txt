Heating with wolves, cooling with cacti : thermo-bio-architectural framework (ThBA)
Building Energy Use and Climate Change -- Thermal Issues and Building Design -- Biomimicry and Its Approaches to Energy-Efficient Building Design -- Linking Biology and Buildings -- Developing a Structure for the ThBA -- Thermoregulation in Nature -- Parallels in Building Design -- Testing the ThBA -- Developing a Framework for Bio-Inspired 226  Energy-Efficient Building Design.
"The book highlights the absence of a systematic process for problem-based biomimetic architectural design. While existing biomimetic design approaches are metaphorical and non-methodological, this book presents a cross-disciplinary bio-inspired design tool that for the first time connects architecture to biology with the aim of designing biomimetic energy-efficient buildings. The proposed tool is a framework consisting of a comprehensive list of generalised thermal adaptation strategies used by plants and animals. The systematic design process introduced in this book enables those seeking innovative solutions to overcome thermal challenges in buildings to find relevant thermoregulatory strategies in nature"--
