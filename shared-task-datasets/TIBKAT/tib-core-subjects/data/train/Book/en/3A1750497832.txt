Time-domain scattering
"The wave equation, a classical partial differential equation, has been studied and applied since the eighteenth century. Solving it in the presence of an obstacle, the scatterer, can be achieved using a variety of techniques and has a multitude of applications. This book explains clearly the fundamental ideas of time-domain scattering, including in-depth discussions of separation of variables and integral equations. The author covers both theoretical and computational aspects, and describes applications coming from acoustics (sound waves), elastodynamics (waves in solids), electromagnetics (Maxwell's equations) and hydrodynamics (water waves). The detailed bibliography of papers and books from the last 100 years will be an essential reference on the topic for applied mathematicians, physicists and engineers. Encyclopedia of Mathematics and Its Applications This series is devoted to significant topics or themes that have wide application in mathematics or mathematical science and for which a detailed development of the abstract theory is less important than a thorough and concrete exploration of the implications and applications. Books in the Encyclopedia of Mathematics and Its Applications cover their subjects comprehensively. Less important results may be summarised as exercises at the ends of chapters. For technicalities, readers can be referred to the bibliography, which is expected to be comprehensive. As a result, volumes are encyclopedic references or manageable guides to major subjects"--
