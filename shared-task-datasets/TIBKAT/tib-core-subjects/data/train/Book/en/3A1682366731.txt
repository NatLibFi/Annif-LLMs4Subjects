Field guide to laser cooling methods
"The primary objective of this Field Guide is to present an overview of the various concepts and methods of laser cooling including Doppler cooling, polarization gradient cooling, different sub-recoil schemes of laser cooling, laser cooing with anti-Stokes fluorescence and so on. This Field Guide will serve to introduce students, scientists, and engineers to this exciting field"--
