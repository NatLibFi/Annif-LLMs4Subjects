Research handbook of comparative employment relations
The Research Handbook of Comparative Employment Relations is an essential resource for those seeking to understand contemporary developments in the world of work, and the way in which employment relations systems are evolving around the world. -- Special consideration is given to the impact of globalisation and the role of multinational corporations, including their consequences for the fate of workersâ€™ rights under existing national systems of employment relations (ER) regulation. This Handbook is unique in taking an explicitly comparative approach by discussing ER developments through a series of paired country comparisons. These chapters include a wide selection of countries from all regions, looking beyond those that are frequently discussed. The expert contributors also examine comparative issues from a range of perspectives, including industrial and employment relations, political economy, comparative politics, and cross-cultural studies. These impressive features make this important reference tool the most comprehensive of its kind. -- This research hand-book is a highly readable and thought-provoking account of comparative employment relations in current published texts. The breadth and depth of this book are remarkable and it will serve as a very valuable introductory text to students and researchers inter-ested in comparative employment relations and global governance of employment relations.
