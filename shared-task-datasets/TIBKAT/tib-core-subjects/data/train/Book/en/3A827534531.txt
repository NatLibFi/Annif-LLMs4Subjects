Business statistics : communicating with numbers
"Statistics can be a fun and enlightening course for both students and teachers. From our years of experience in the classroom, we have found that an effective way to make statistics interesting is to use timely business applications to which students can relate. If interest can be sparked at the outset, students may end up learning statistics without realizing they are doing so. By carefully matching timely applications with statistical methods,students learn to appreciate the relevance of business statistics in our world today. We wrote Business Statistics: Communicating with Numbers because we saw a need for a contemporary, core statistics textbook that sparked student interest and bridged the gap between how statistics is taught and how practitioners think about and apply statistical methods. Throughout the text, the emphasis is on communicating with numbers rather than on number crunching. In every chapter, students are exposed to statistical information conveyed in written form"--
