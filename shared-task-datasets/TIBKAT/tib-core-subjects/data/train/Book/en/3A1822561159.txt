Green chemistry and water remediation : research and applications
"Reviews how the principles of Green Chemistry can reduce water contamination and guide sustainable approaches to water remediation. Water remediation is an essential tool in reducing the environmental impact of pollutants in the environment. Green Chemistry and Water Remediation explores how integrating the principles of green chemistry into remediation research and practice can have a great impact from multiple directions. This volume reviews common sources of chemical pollution alongside the use of green chemistry as the basis for new or improved remediation techniques to ensure that remediation itself is conducted sustainably. By outlining the main types of chemical pollutants in water and sustainable ways to address them, the authors help chemists identify key areas to be addressed and encourage them to integrate green chemistry principles into the design of new processes and products to minimize waste. At the same time, they highlight and encourage the use of the growing range of green remediation approaches available to experts, thus helping researchers, planners, and managers make informed decisions in their selection of remediation techniques"--Page 4 of cover
