Lp-Theory for Incompressible Newtonian Flows : Energy Preserving Boundary Conditions, Weakly Singular Domains
This thesis is devoted to the study of the basic equations of fluid dynamics. First Matthias Köhne focuses on the derivation of a class of boundary conditions, which is based on energy estimates, and, thus, leads to physically relevant conditions. The derived class thereby contains many prominent artificial boundary conditions, which have proved to be suitable for direct numerical simulations involving artificial boundaries. The second part is devoted to the development of a complete Lp-theory for the resulting initial boundary value problems in bounded smooth domains, i.e. the Navier-Stokes equations complemented by one of the derived energy preserving boundary conditions. Finally, the third part of this thesis focuses on the corresponding theory for bounded, non-smooth domains, where the boundary of the domain is allowed to contain a finite number of edges, provided the smooth components of the boundary that meet at such an edge are locally orthogonal.
