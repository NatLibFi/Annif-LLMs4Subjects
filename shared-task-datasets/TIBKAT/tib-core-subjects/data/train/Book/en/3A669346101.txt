Functional Equations in Mathematical Analysis
The stability problem for approximate homomorphisms, or the Ulam stability problem, was posed by S. M. Ulam in the year 1941. The solution of this problem for various classes of equations is an expanding area of research. In particular, the pursuit of solutions to the Hyers-Ulam and Hyers-Ulam-Rassias stability problems for sets of functional equations and ineqalities has led to an outpouring of recent research. This volume, dedicated to S. M. Ulam, presents the most recent results on the solution to Ulam stability problems for various classes of functional equations and inequalities. Comprise
