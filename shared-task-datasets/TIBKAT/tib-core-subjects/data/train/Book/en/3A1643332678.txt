Lectures in geochemistry
"This short course of lectures is designed for chemical, biological and environmental audiences who, though lacking in geology basics, are quite experienced in chemistry and biology. The structure and contents of these lectures are aimed at giving the reader a general idea of the Earth's chemical life and its related global geological events as fully as allowed by the present-day concepts of natural history, including new directions such as geochemistry of cryogenesis, geochemistry of disperse systems, geochemistry of microorganisms, and geochemistry of cryptobiosphere"--
Geochemistry tools, statistical geochemistry, equilibrium thermodynamics : phase diagrams, nonequilibrium thermodynamics, thermodynamic principles of evolution, laws of self-development -- Cosmochemistry: the formation, composition, and structure of earth -- Geochemistry of elements -- The evolution of earth as a planet -- Geochemistry of processes -- Geochemistry of processes (continuation) -- The biosphere -- Environmental chemistry -- Geochemistry of systems -- A generalized model of earth as a self-developing system
