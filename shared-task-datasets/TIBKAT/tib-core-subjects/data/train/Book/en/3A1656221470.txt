Nearly Pseudo-Kähler Manifolds and Related Special Holonomies
Developing and providing an overview of recent results on nearly Kähler geometry on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, this monograph emphasizes the differences with the classical Riemannian geometry setting. The focal objects of the text are related to special holonomy and Killing spinors and have applications in high energy physics, such as supergravity and string theory. Before starting into the field, a self-contained introduction to the subject is given, aimed at students with a solid background in differential geometry. The book will therefore be accessible to masters and Ph.D. students who are beginning work on nearly Kähler geometry in pseudo-Riemannian signature, and also to non-experts interested in gaining an overview of the subject. Moreover, a number of results and techniques are provided which will be helpful for differential geometers as well as for high energy physicists interested in the mathematical background of the geometric objects they need
