Mechatronic servo system control : problems in industries and their theoretical solutions ; with 21 tables
This monograph presents the fundamentals as well as the application techniques of servo control systems, which are a key element of Mechatronics. The industrial applications and problems of Mechatronic Servo System Control are demonstrated as well as its theoretical and applicable solutions. The book is unique in its kind in converting a know-how only suitable for special situations until now into a more universal technology. This introductory monograph is aiming at students and engineers who are involved in the field of Mechatronics and Robotics. TOC:Outline of mechatronic servo system.- Mathematical model construction of a mechatronic servo system.- Discretized time interval of a mechatronic servo system.- Quantization error of mechatronic servo system.- Torque saturation of mechatronic servo system.- The modified taught data method.- The contour control with the master- slave synchronous positioning control method
