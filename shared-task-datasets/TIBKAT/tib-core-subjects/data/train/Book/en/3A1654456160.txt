Treks into Intuitive Geometry : The World of Polygons and Polyhedra
This book is written in a style that uncovers the mathematical theories buried in our everyday lives such as examples from patterns that appear in nature, art, and traditional crafts, and in mathematical mechanisms in techniques used by architects. The authors believe that through dialogues between students and mathematicians, readers may discover the processes by which the founders of the theories came to their various conclusions-their trials, errors, tribulations, and triumphs. The goal is for readers to refine their mathematical sense of how to find good questions and how to grapple with these problems. Another aim is to provide enjoyment in the process of applying mathematical rules to beautiful art and design by examples that highlight the wonders and mysteries from our daily lives. To fulfill these aims, this book deals with the latest unique and beautiful results in polygons and polyhedra and the dynamism of geometrical research history that can be found around us. The term "intuitive geometry" was coined by Lászlo Fejes Tóth to refer to the kind of geometry which, in Hilbert's words, can be explained to and appeal to the "man on the street." This book allows people to enjoy intuitive geometry informally and instinctively. It does not require more than a high school level of knowledge but calls for a sense of wonder, intuition, and mathematical maturity
