Cooling energy solutions for buildings and cities
"In the first book of its kind, this volume addresses the problem of the future cooling energy demand, the global frame defining the actual and future cooling energy consumption in the building sector. Based on the explored inputs and forecasts, a model was developed to predict the future cooling energy consumption of both the residential and commercial sector. Low energy, high-performance technological solutions for cooling energy problem in the building and city level will be presented"--
Cooling of buildings: the new energy challenge -- The impact of local and global climate change on the future energy -- Cooling consumption -- Economic and demographic parameters affecting the future cooling -- Energy consumption.
