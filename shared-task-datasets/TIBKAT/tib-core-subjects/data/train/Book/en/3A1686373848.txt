Animal cell biotechnology : methods and protocols
Animal Cell Biotechnology: Methods and Protocols, Fourth Edition constitutes a comprehensive manual of state-of-the-art techniques for setting up mammalian cell lines and media for development of biopharmaceuticals, and optimizing critical parameters for cell culture considering the whole cascade from the lab to the final production. Special emphasis was put on model-assisted concepts. Scientists with long-refined expertise describe cutting-edge techniques for the production of therapeutic proteins and vaccines. Capturing the major advances that have occurred in both science and the technology of these biopharmaceuticals, this important book covers the powerful new techniques used in cell line and media development, optimizing process techniques and process strategies, use of model-assisted tools for process design and optimization, and in analysis. Topics include cell line and media development, techniques for process development, model-based techniques for process development, process analysis, and downstream techniques. The volume is divided into five parts that reflect the processes required for different stages of production. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Animal Cell Biotechnology: Methods and Protocols, Fourth Edition provides a compendium of techniques for scientists in industrial and research laboratories that use mammalian cells for biotechnology purposes.
