Derived Functors in Functional Analysis
The text contains for the first time in book form the state of the art of homological methods in functional analysis like characterizations of the vanishing of the derived projective limit functor or the functors Ext1 (E, F) for Fr√©chet and more general spaces. The researcher in real and complex analysis finds powerful tools to solve surjectivity problems e.g. on spaces of distributions or to characterize the existence of solution operators. The requirements from homological algebra are minimized: all one needs is summarized on a few pages. The answers to several questions of V.P. Palamodov who invented homological methods in analysis also show the limits of the program
