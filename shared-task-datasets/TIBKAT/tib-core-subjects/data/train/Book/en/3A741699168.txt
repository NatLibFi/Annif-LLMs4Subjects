Multi-criteria decision analysis for supporting the selection of engineering materials in product design
It is a constant challenge for designers, even when educated in the fundamentals of materials and mechanical engineering, to make optimal selections of materials to satisfy complex design problems, when faced with the vast range of materials available. Current approaches to materials selection range from the use of intuition and experience to more formalized methods. The latter is available in computer-based form, and includes electronic databases with search engines to facilitate the materials selection process
This book describes the growing field of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) as applied to materials selection in product design. Useful in academic and research contexts, as well as to practitioners in materials engineering and design, it aids readers in producing successful designs by improving the decision-making process in materials selection.   It is a constant challenge for designers, even when educated in the fundamentals of materials and mechanical engineering, to select the best materials to satisfy complex design problems. Current approaches to materials selection range ...
