Advanced standard SQL dynamic structured data modeling and hierarchical processing
"Based on the Artech House classic, ANSI SQL Data Modeling and Structure Processing, this expanded and updated book offers you an essential tool for utilizing the ANSI SQL outer join operation to perform simple or complex hierarchical data modeling and structure processing. The book provides you with a comprehensive review of the outer join operation, its powerful syntax and semantics, and new features and capabilities. This revised resource introduces several important new concepts such as relationship and hierarchical integration at the hierarchical processing level, multipath hierarchical automatic XML query processing, dynamic structured data processing using automatic metadata maintenance, and advanced data transformations. Featuring more than 230 illustrations, the book shows you how to tap the full power of data structure extraction technology that gathers data structure meta information naturally embedded in ANSI SQL specifications. You discover existing, but previously unknown, SQL capabilities for improving performance. The book explains how to perform multitable outer joins and combine relational structures with hierarchical structures. Moreover you learn how to establish a default database standard for hierarchical data modeling and structure processing."
