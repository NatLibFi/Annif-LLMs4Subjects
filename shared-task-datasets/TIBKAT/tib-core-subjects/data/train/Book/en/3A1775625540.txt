Mobility-as-a-Service : the convergence of automotive and mobility industries
The advent of mobility-as-a-service and the disruption of the automotive industry are both overlapping and fuelled by the same developments and thus raise a very fundamental question: are we at peak car? Based on the authorâ€™s extensive field research, academic study, and professional experience, this book explores this very question as well as the underlying social, economic, generational, and regulatory changes that lead to a new mobility regime. Through rich descriptions of established OEMs and mobility start-ups, it discusses the current forms of mobility and the promise of autonomous technology. It further explores the strategic dimension of these developments so as to navigate and succeed within the disruptive and ever-changing environment of mobility services.
