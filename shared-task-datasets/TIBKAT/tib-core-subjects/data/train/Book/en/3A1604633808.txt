Differential geometry of singular spaces and reduction of symmetry
"In this book the author illustrates the power of the theory of subcartesian differential spaces for investigating spaces with singularities. Part I gives a detailed and comprehensive presentation of the theory of differential spaces, including integration of distributions on subcartesian spaces and the structure of stratified spaces"--
