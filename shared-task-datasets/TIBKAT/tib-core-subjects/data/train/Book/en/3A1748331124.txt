EMI protection for communication systems
In recent years the protection of communication services operating in the same of adjacent channels has become more and more challenging. Communication systems need to be protected from natural and man-made interference. This practical reference provides a thorough understanding of how to protect communication systems from intentional and unintentional electromagnetic interference. Engineers learn how to overcome critical problems in both digital and analog communications. This unique resource shows how to shield equipment from electrical and magnetic fields, design TEM and GTEM-Cell, build capacitive coupling clamps for susceptibility tests, protect electronic equipment with filters, and calculate the measurement uncertainty. Professionals find numerous, well-illustrated examples that make challenging electromagnetics issues far easier to comprehend. CD-ROM Included! Contains time-saving software that helps engineers perform important calculations, including characteristic impedance of TEM-Cell, cut-off frequencies for higher order modes, and cut-off and resonant frequencies for GTEM-cell
