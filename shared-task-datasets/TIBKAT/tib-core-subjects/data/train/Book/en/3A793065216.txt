Modern NMR techniques for synthetic chemistry
"There are many NMR textbooks available (a number of them are referred to in this volume), and a good number of these are in their third or higher editions. A number of these books deal with the application of NMR alongside other spectroscopic techniques (and mass spectrometry) and include guides for spectral analysis. Some texts deal with the physical principles of NMR spectroscopy with a light mathematical touch, while others include a full mathematical (quantum mechanical) description. A smaller number of books deal with the "nuts and bolts," that is, the practicalities so that the reader may discover how to perform a particular NMR experiment. The current text has an element of each of these features, the emphasis being dictated by my experience of the aspects of NMR that different communities feel inadequately informed on. For example, early-year researchers who employ NMR to analyse small molecules (organic and inorganic) and/or their interactions with larger molecules often feel that they are not clear on what "questions" they can ask with NMR, or NMR researchers who may be developing new techniques but feel that they have limited knowledge of the range of applications to which they may be put. Since the days, over 30 years ago now, I suppose, when there was excitement about the developments that enabled NMR to be used to investigate biomolecular structure and function, the use of NMR has developed in parallel to, and in support of, much novel science. Areas such as, for example, supramolecular chemistries (including organometallic nanocages and vessels, and organic materials in general); rational drug design and high throughput screening; interrogation of complex mixtures for biomarker discovery or process monitoring,"--
"This book illustrates how the key analytical technique, NMR spectroscopy, may be used to determine the abundance, size, shape, and function of organic molecules. It provides the reader with a physical picture for the NMR technique used (pictorial rather than mathematical), indicating the most common pulse sequences, some practical information as appropriate, followed by illustrative examples. This format is followed for each chapter so that the reader may go straight to practical and theoretical details as appropriate"--
