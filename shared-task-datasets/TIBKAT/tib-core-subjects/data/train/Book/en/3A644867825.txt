The post-modern reader
"Post-Modernism has been debated, attacked and defended for over three decades. It is, however, not just a fashion or style but part of a greater movement in all areas of culture, and one which stubbornly persists like its parent, Modernism. The Post-Modern Reader is a seminal anthology that presents this trend in all its diversity, as a convergence in architecture and literature, sociology and cultural theory, feminism and theology, science and economics. For this new edition, editor Charles Jencks has provided an entirely new definitive introductory essay 'What Then Is Post-Modernism?' that reflects on the movement's coming of age. The book also encompasses essential classic texts on the subject by John Barth, Umberto Eco, David Harvey, Jane Jacobs, Jean-François Lyotard and Robert Venturi, while incorporating new articles by Felipe Fernández-Armesto, John Gray, Ihab Hassan and Anatole Kaletsky. Each text is introduced and contextualised for the reader with a new short introductory passage."--P. [4] of cover
