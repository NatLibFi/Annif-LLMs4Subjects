Multi-Carrier Digital Communications : Theory and Applications of OFDM
Multi-carrier modulation, in particular orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), has been successfully applied to a wide variety of digital communications applications for several years. Although OFDM has been chosen as the physical layer standard for a diversity of important systems, the theory, algorithms, and implementation techniques remain subjects of current interest. This book is intended to be a concise summary of the present state of the art of the theory and practice of OFDM technology. This book offers a unified presentation of OFDM theory and high speed and wireless applications. In particular, ADSL, wireless LAN, and digital broadcasting technologies are explained. It is hoped that this book will prove valuable both to developers of such systems, and to researchers and graduate students involved in analysis of digital communications, and will remain a valuable summary of the technology, providing an understanding of new advances as well as the present core technology.
