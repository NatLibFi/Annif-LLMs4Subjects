Particle Physics Reference Library : Volume 1: Theory and Experiments
This first open access volume of the handbook series contains articles on the standard model of particle physics, both from the theoretical and experimental perspective. It also covers related topics, such as heavy-ion physics, neutrino physics and searches for new physics beyond the standard model. A joint CERN-Springer initiative, the “Particle Physics Reference Library” provides revised and updated contributions based on previously published material in the well-known Landolt-Boernstein series on particle physics, accelerators and detectors (volumes 21A,B1,B2,C), which took stock of the field approximately one decade ago. Central to this new initiative is publication under full open access.
Introduction -- Gauge Theories and the Standard Model -- The Standard Model of Electroweak Interactions -- QCD: The Theory of Strong Interactions -- QCD on the lattice -- The Discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC -- Relativistic Nucleus-Nucleus Collisions and the QCD Matter Phase Diagram -- Beyond the Standard Model -- Symmetry Violations and Quark Flavour -- The Future of Particle Physics – the LHC and Beyond.
