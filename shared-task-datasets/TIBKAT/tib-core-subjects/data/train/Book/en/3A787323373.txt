Revit architecture 2014 for designers
"Building information modeling (BIM) is the new AutoCAD for architects and interior designers--and Revit Architecture is the leading software package in the BIM marketplace. Revit Architecture 2014 for Designers is written specifically for architects and interior designers as they transition from CAD to BIM. Beginning with the building blocks of BIM modeling (walls, windows, and doors), the text progresses through dynamically generated 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional views to advanced features--such as photorealistic rendering, custom title blocks, and exporting drawings to AutoCAD and SketchUp. Instructions are fully illustrated, creating a smooth transition to the BIM environment for all designers. Clear, concise, and above all visual, this is the essential Revit guide written specifically for interior designers and architects."--Publisher's website
