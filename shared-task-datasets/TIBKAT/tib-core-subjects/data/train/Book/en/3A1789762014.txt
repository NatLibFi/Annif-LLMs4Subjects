"Bioremediation and Phytoremediation Technologies in Sustainable Soil Management, Volume 2: Microbial Approaches and Recent Trends focuses on new and emerging techniques and approaches to address soil pollution. These include the use of rhizobacteria, archae, cyanobacteria, and microalgae as biofertilizers and for soil bioremediation efforts. New technologies for assessment of soil bioremediation are explored also. The chapters provides in-depth coverage of the mechanisms, advantages, and disadvantages of the technologies used and highlights the use of different microbial enzymes that are used in the process of bioremediation and phytoremediation to clean up different pollutants without causing damage to the natural environment"--
