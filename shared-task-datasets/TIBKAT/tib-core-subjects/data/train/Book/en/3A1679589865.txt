Hyperspectral data processing : algorithm design and analysis
"Hyperspectral Data Processing: Algorithm Design and Analysis is a culmination of the research conducted in the Remote Sensing Signal and Image Processing Laboratory (RSSIPL) at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Specifically, it treats hyperspectral image processing and hyperspectral signal processing as separate subjects in two different categories. Most materials covered in this book can be used in conjunction with the author's first book, Hyperspectral Imaging: Techniques for Spectral Detection and Classification, without much overlap ... Hyperspectral Data Processing compiles an algorithm compendium with MATLAB codes in an appendix to help readers implement many important algorithms developed in this book and write their own program codes without relying on software packages. Hyperspectral Data Processing is a valuable reference for those who have been involved with hyperspectral imaging and its techniques, as well those who are new to the subject."--
