Tunable external cavity diode lasers
Annotation - Presents a thorough account of the state-of-the-art of tunable external cavity diode lasers Provides an up-to-date survey on physics, technology, and performance of widely applicable coherent radiation sources of tunable external cavity diode lasers May be used as a textbook for related undergraduate and graduate courses
This is the first book on tunable external cavity semiconductor diode lasers, providing an up-to-date survey on the physics, technology, and performance of widely applicable coherent radiation sources of tunable external cavity diode lasers. The purpose is to provide a thorough account of the state-of-the-art of tunable external cavity diode lasers which is achieved by combining this account with basic concepts of semiconductor diode lasers and its tunability with monolithic structures
