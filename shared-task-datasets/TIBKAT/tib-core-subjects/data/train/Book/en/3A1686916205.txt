Biofuels from algae : methods and protocols
This volume provides a comprehensive overview of different ways to grow algae and the techniques used to start algal cultivation, monitor algal growth, environmental impact of growing algae, and various methods for characterizing the biomass. The chapters in this book discuss a range of topics such as step-by-step protocols on how to isolate and grow algae; descriptions on how to use fluorescence to estimate algal biomass and lipid content; and instructions on using advanced techniques to determine the carbohydrates and lipids in algal biomass. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Authoritative and cutting-edge, Biofuels from Algae: Methods and Protocols is a valuable resource for novice and experienced researchers who want to learn more about this impactful and developing field.
