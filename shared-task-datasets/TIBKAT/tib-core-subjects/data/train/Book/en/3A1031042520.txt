Designing optics using CODE V
"This book explains how to design an optical system using the high-end optical design program CODE V. The design process, from lens definition to the description and evaluation of lens errors and onto the improvement of lens performance, will be developed and illustrated using the program. The text is organized so that readers can (1) reproduce each step of the process including the plots for evaluating lens performance and (2) understand the significance of each step in producing a final design"--
