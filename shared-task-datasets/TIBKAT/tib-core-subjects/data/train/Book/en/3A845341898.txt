Inverse modeling : an introduction to the theory and methods of inverse problems and data assimilation
This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the techniques, tools and methods for inverse problems and data assimilation, and is written at the interface between mathematics and applications for students, researchers and developers in mathematics, physics, engineering, acoustics, electromagnetics, meteorology, biology, environmental and other applied sciences. Basic analytic questions and tools are introduced, as well as a wide variety of concepts, methods and approaches to formulate and solve inverse problems. OCTAVE /MATLAB codes are included, which serve as a first step towards simulations and more sophisticated inversion or data assimilation algorithms.
