Nanocellulose : synthesis, properties and applications
Progressing knowledge about the reactivity and structural features of cellulose has led to the gradual development of novel cellulose- based materials. Specifically, the development of nanocellulose in the form of nanocrystals, nano-fibrils, nano-whiskers and nanofibers has gained significant research attention. These materials display unique properties owing to their nanostructure such as hydrophilicity, ease of chemical modification and the generation of adaptable semi-crystalline fiber structures, along with extensive surface area. These properties enable the use of such nanomaterials for a large number of advanced applications. In this context, the book provides deep insights into the current state of the art as well as future trends with respect to the synthetic procedures, property development and applications of nanocellulose. The book is a valuable reference for polymer, chemical, biochemical and materials engineers, as well as practicing scientists and researchers in both academia and industry. It is also a useful resource for postgraduate university students in chemical, polymer and materials disciplines, along with interdisciplinary streams.
