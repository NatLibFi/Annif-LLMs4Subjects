Embedded software system testing : automatic testing solution based on formal method
"This book introduces embedded software engineering and management methods, proposing the relevant testing theory and techniques that promise the final realization of automated testing of embedded systems. The quality and reliability of embedded systems have become a great concern, faced with the rising demands for the complexity and scale of system hardware and software. The authors propose and expound on the testing theory and techniques of embedded software systems and relevant environment construction technologies, providing effective solutions for the automated testing of embedded systems. Through analyzing typical testing examples of the complex embedded software systems, the authors verify the effectiveness of the theories, technologies and methods proposed in the book. In combining the fundamental theory and technology and practical solutions, this title will appeal to researchers and students studying computer science, software engineering, and embedded systems, as well as professionals and practitioners engaged in the development, verification, and maintenance of embedded systems in the military and civilian fields"--
