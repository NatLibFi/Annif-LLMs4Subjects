New frontiers in evolutionary algorithms : theory and applications
This book delivers theoretical and practical knowledge of Genetic Algorithms (GA) for the purpose of practical applications. It provides a methodology for a GA-based search strategy with the integration of several Artificial Life and Artificial Intelligence techniques, such as memetic concepts, swarm intelligence, and foraging strategies. The development of such tools contributes to better optimizing methodologies when addressing tasks from areas such as robotics, financial forecasting, and data mining in bioinformatics. The emphasis of this book is on applicability to the real world. Tasks from application areas--optimization of the trading rule in foreign exchange (FX) and stock prices, economic load dispatch in power system, exit/door placement for evacuation planning, and gene regulatory network inference in bioinformatics--are studied, and the resultant empirical investigations demonstrate how successful the proposed approaches are when solving real-world tasks of great importance.--Publisher description
