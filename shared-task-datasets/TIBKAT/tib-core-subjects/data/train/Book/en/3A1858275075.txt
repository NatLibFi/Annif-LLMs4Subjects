Metal-Organic Frameworks in Analytical Chemistry
One of the current research lines in analytical chemistry is the design and utilization of novel materials with higher selectivity and improved analytical performance in various steps of chemical analysis. In this sense, Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have attracted attention as a potential alternative to current commercially available materials. MOFs present an interesting set of properties, such as diverse structural topologies, modifiable pore size, high porosity, tuneable surface area, diverse composition, and versatile functionality. This book covers multipurpose usage MOFs in sample preparation, integration, and detection stages of analytical chemistry. Along with the application of MOFs in green analytical methodologies. It will serve as a reference book for researchers, scientists and engineers who are interested in developing new materials as well as researchers who are interested in new application development
