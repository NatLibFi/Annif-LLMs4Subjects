Biosurfactants and sustainability : from biorefineries production to versatile applications
"Surfactants are compounds used in different industry segments (oil, detergent soap, food, and beverages) (Akbari et al., 2018; Drakontis and Amin, 2020). They are amphipathic molecules that reduce the surface tension at the oil-water interface, increasing the solubility of immiscible substances in water. The global demand for surfactants is overgrowing, and according to market surveys, the outlook is for more than 520 billion tonnes of surfactants to be on the global market by 2022 (Singh et al., 2019). The production of synthetic surfactants began in the first half of the 20th century. However, with a more expressive development of the petrochemical industry after World War II, the production of these compounds became more significant since the petrochemical industry provides raw materials to produce synthetic surfactants (Karsa et al. 2006). In the last decades, surfactants have attracted attention for their wide range of applications in modern society and their harmful effects on the environment. They have low biodegradability because they are derived from petroleum ecotoxicity and bioaccumulation"--
