Computational fluid dynamics and energy modelling in buildings : fundamentals and applications
"This book will explain how heat and mass transport in buildings can be modelled using commercial and educational tools, with a focus on helping those who want to use those tools to understand and predict the performance of buildings, but who may not be experts in CFD. The fundamentals of modelling will be fully covered and then extended to show how those models can be used to simulate the behaviour of buildings. The aim is to ensure the reader understands the essentials of modelling and can use the existing tools effectively and knowledgably. Modelling and simulation involve many assumptions and simplifications, so the book covers these topics fully, ensuring the reader understands and can justify those assumptions and simplifications. In addition, it addresses uncertainties in the selection of possible options to ensure the reader can get the most from existing heat and mass transport modelling tools."--
