Nanoelectronics
Nanomaterials are changing the world we live in, and one of the most exciting applications they can have is the creation of new electronic devices. But what are they, how can we build devices from them, and how can nanoelectronics give us new ways to interact with light, our environments and even our brains? This ebook will explore the unique physics of different types of nanomaterials, and lay out different devices that harness this unique physics to create optoelectronic components, chemical sensors, and novel paradigms for memory and computing. After outlining the current state of the art, the final section looks to grand challenges and opportunities in nanoelectronics.
