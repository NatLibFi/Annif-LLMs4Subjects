Semiconductor-On-Insulator Materials for Nanoelectronics Applications
Semiconductor-On-Insulator Materials for NanoElectronics Applications is devoted to the fast evolving field of modern nanoelectronics, and more particularly to the physics and technology of nanoelectronic devices built on semiconductor-on-insulator (SemOI) systems. The book contains the achievements in this field from leading companies and universities in Europe, USA, Brazil and Russia. It is articulated around four main topics: 1. New semiconductor-on-insulator materials, 2. Physics of modern SemOI devices, 3. Advanced characterization of SemOI devices, 4. Sensors and MEMS on SOI. Semiconductor-On-Insulator Materials for NanoElectonics Applications is useful not only to specialists in nano- and microelectronics but also to students and to the wider audience of readers who are interested in new directions in modern electronics and optoelectronics.
