Calculating x-ray tube spectra : analytical and Monte Carlo approaches
"Calculating x-ray tube spectra provides a comprehensive review of the modelling of x-ray tube emissions, with a focus on medical imaging and radiotherapy applications. It begins by covering the relevant background, before discussing modelling approaches, including both analytical formulations and Monte Carlo simulation. Historical context is provided, based on the past century of literature, as well as a summary of recent developments and insights. The book finishes with example applications for spectrum models, including beam quality prediction and the calculation of dosimetric and image-quality metrics. This book will be a valuable resource for postgraduate and advanced undergraduate students studying medical radiation physics, in addition to those in teaching, research, industry and healthcare settings whose work involves x-ray tubes. Key Features: Covers simple modelling approaches as well as full Monte Carlo simulation of x-ray tubes Bremsstrahlung and characteristic contributions to the spectrum are discussed in detail Learning is supported by free open-source software and an online repository of code"--
