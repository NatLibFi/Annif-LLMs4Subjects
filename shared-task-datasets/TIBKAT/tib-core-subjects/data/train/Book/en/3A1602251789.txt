My dream of stars : from daughter of Iran to space pioneer
Anousheh Ansari tells of her childhood in Iran and her family's exodus to America after the Islamic Revolution. After settling down in Texas, Anousheh built a computer technology firm from the ground up, which eventually allowed her to achieve her childhood dream of spaceflight. As the first-ever female commercial spaceflight participant, her story became politicized, culminating in a debate over whether she would be allowed to display both the American and Iranian flags on the sleeve of her spacesuit. Later, Anousheh started The Ansari Foundation, a nonprofit which supports social entrepreneurship, and is especially committed to ensuring the freedom of women around the world and supporting female entrepreneurs. Ultimately, this is the story of a woman who has become a role model to people around the globe struggling to overcome economic and cultural barriers, as well as those dreamers who look upon the stars.--From publisher description
