Sustainable solid waste management : a systems engineering approach
"Systems engineering techniques such as optimization tools, simulation model, integrated modeling systems, management information systems, decision support tools, material flow analysis, and life cycle assessment have been developed, yet have not been applied to the waste management industry as practical tools. This book introduces how to apply  systems engineering techniques not only by theory, but also through practical case studies. The target applications include urban, industrial, hazardous and non-hazardous waste, waste streams such as waste packaging, end-of-life vehicles, waste batteries, waste of electric and electronic equipment, waste lubricant oils, end of life tires and all waste streams demanding sustainable management via appropriate systems analysis to meet both managerial and technical goals"--
