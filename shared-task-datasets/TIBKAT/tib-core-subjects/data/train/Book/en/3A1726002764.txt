This is home : the art of simple living
This Is Home is about simple living - how to focus on our values to create authentic homes full of meaning and joy. Natalie Walton steps inside fifteen homes across the world to meet the people who made them, and discover whether there is some universality to what makes us happy in the spaces we inhabit. Filled with beautiful photography, transporting stories and practical advice, This Is Home reminds and inspires us to nurture the space that helps make our lives possible
