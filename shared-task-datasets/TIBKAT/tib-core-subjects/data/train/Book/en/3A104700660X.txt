The possibility of earthquake forecasting : learning from nature
This book uses a holistic approach to address the problems of earthquake forecasting, demonstrating the earthquake preparation process as a complex system because of the interaction of different geospheres. The purpose of the book is to widen the understanding of the earthquake preparation process and to inform the audience that not only seismometers are necessary for earthquake forecasting. It demonstrates that applications of space technologies like remote sensing, in-situ measurements, and GPS TEC provide rich information on the process and help to conclude that the earthquake is coming. The authors explain the physical nature of the observed pre-earthquake anomalies from one side and demonstrate how their approach is working by utilizing rich illustrations of precursory phenomena in different geospheres.
