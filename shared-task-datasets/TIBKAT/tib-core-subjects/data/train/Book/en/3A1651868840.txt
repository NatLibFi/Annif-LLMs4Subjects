Multivariate Statistical Quality Control Using R
The intensive use of automatic data acquisition system and the use of cloud computing for process monitoring have led to an increased occurrence of industrial processes that utilize statistical process control and capability analysis. These analyses are performed almost exclusively with multivariate methodologies. The aim of this Brief is to present the most important MSQC techniques developed in R language. The book is divided into two parts. The first part contains the basic R elements, an introduction to statistical procedures, and the main aspects related to Statistical Quality Control (SQC). The second part covers the construction of multivariate control charts, the calculation of Multivariate Capability Indices. .
An introduction to R -- Basic Statistical and SQC Procedures -- Multivariate Control Charts -- Multivariate Process Capability -- Multivariate tools of support for MSQC -- Appendix -- Index -- Problem -- Solutions.
