Statics and mechanics of materials
Statics of Particles -- Rigid Bodies : Equivalent Systems of Forces -- Equilibrium of Rigid Bodies -- Distributed Forces : Centroids and Centers of Gravity -- Analysis of Structures -- Distributed Forces : Moments of Inertia -- Concept of Stress -- Stress and Strain : Axial Loading -- Torsion -- Pure Bending -- Analysis and Design of Beams for Bending -- Shearing Stresses in Beams and Thin-Walled Members -- Transformations of Stress -- Deflection of Beams -- Columns.
"Study of statics and mechanics of materials is based on the understanding of a few basic concepts and on the use of simplified models. This approach makes it possible to develop all the necessary formulas in a rational and logical manner, and to clearly indicate the conditions under which they can be safely applied to the analysis and design of actual engineering structures and machine components"--
