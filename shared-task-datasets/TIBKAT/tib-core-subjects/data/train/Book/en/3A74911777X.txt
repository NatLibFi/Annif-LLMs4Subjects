Systems Representation of Global Climate Change Models : Foundation for a Systems Science Approach
This book bridges the gap between system theory and global climate change research, and benefits both. A representative set of systems problems is listed indicating how such cross-fertilization would enhance present understanding of global problems while assisting the extension of systems theory. The goal is a comprehensive conceptual model of global change which encompasses atmosphere, lithosphere, ocean, biosphere and cryosphere. The systems model is developed in two steps using a "block diagram" approach. First, causality flows among principal components are identified and a block diagram representation is constructed. Second, mathematical description of the mappings represented by the blocks is derived from the physical principles and known disciplinary models. The generation of the complete block diagram is believed to be the first of its kind. A number of helpful features characterize the book. Chapter 1 provides the basic framework and organization of the book. Chapter 2 is a primer to global climate systems for the reader unfamiliar with the subject of the scientific aspects of global warning. A list of notation in Appendix B, a glossary of global climate change research search terminology, and a detailed index for cross referencing are included. Additionally, a representative set of relevant systems problems in global change is listed at the end of the book
