Rhythmic oscillations in proteins to human cognition
This book explores various aspects of biophysics, from neurobiology to quantum biology and the consciousness of human beings and in the universe. It examines eight different areas of natural intelligence, ranging from time crystals found in chemical biology, to the vibrations and the resonance of proteins, and also discusses hierarchical communication in various biological systems. Written by senior and experts in the field in language that is lucid and easy to understand, it is a valuable reference resource for researchers and practitioners in academia and industry.
