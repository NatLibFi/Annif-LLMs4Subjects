Fundamentals of software architecture : an engineering approach
Although salary surveys worldwide regularly identify software architect as one of the top ten best jobs, no decent guides exist to help developers become architects. Until now. This practical guide provides the first comprehensive overview of software architecture’s many aspects. You’ll examine architectural characteristics, architectural patterns, component determination, diagramming and presenting architecture, evolutionary architecture, and many other topics. Authors Neal Ford and Mark Richards help you learn through examples in a variety of popular programming languages, such as Java, C#, JavaScript, and others. You’ll focus on architecture principles with examples that apply across all technology stacks.
