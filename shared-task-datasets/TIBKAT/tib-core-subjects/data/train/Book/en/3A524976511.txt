Space-Time Processing for CDMA Mobile Communications
Basic Space-Time Aspects -- Aspects Influencing Space-Time Performance -- Space-Time Channel Models -- Smart Antenna Techniques -- Smart Antenna Performance -- Multiuser Detection -- Space-Time Coded Transmit Diversity for CDMA.
Space-Time Processing for CDMA Mobile Communications is one of the first books to: bring together spatial/temporal channel models and analytic performance evaluation techniques; establish a link between smart antenna systems and advanced receiver design techniques; treat smart antennas specifically for UMTS-like communication systems, with applicable simulations and calculations; supply code with Matlab® GUI so readers can run or modify existing simulations or create new ones. The field of smart antenna technology or, more generally, space-time processing is rapidly becoming one of the most promising areas of mobile communications, especially regarding the development of the first practical third-generation mobile communication systems. The authors have addressed many of the most basic questions relating to the use of space-time processing in CDMA-based third-generation systems and have presented models for the integration of space-time processing, error correction coding, and multi-user detection techniques. Included is extensive background information on cellular systems, antenna array theory, smart antenna techniques, performance of basic space-time processors and advanced space-time processors. The book also includes an extensive simulation program written in Matlab®. The simulation code implements both the uplink and the downlink of a UMTS-like communication system. This provides multiple options for simulating system performance using a variety of channel models as well as receiver structures. Space-Time Processing for CDMA Mobile Communications will be an invaluable reference work for engineers and researchers, and a useful source for design engineers enabling them to understand the implications of adding space-time processing systems to CDMA-based communication systems.
