Robotic intelligence
"This volume aims to provide a reference to the development of robotic intelligence, built upon Semantic Computing, in terms of "action" to realize the "context" and "intention" formulated by Semantics Computing during the "thinking" or reasoning process. It addresses three core areas: Ability to interface and interact with human in the form of natural languages and map them onto Semantic Services; Understanding the (possibly naturally-expressed) intentions (semantics) of users and develop into plans to deliver the outcomes by means of robots; Improve on the sophistication in a big data environment to develop the capability to process and analyze massive data on-the-fly."--
