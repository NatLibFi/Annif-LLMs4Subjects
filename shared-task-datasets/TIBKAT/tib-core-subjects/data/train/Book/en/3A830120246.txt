Anthropic awareness : the human aspects of scientific thinking in nmr spectroscopy and mass spectrometry
"Anthropic awareness (AA)" (mind your mind!). The philosophy of "anthropic awareness" in scientific thinking -- AA in why-science: examples from NMR theory (if you think you know NMR, think again{u2026}). An "anthropically" flavored look at some basic aspects of NMR spin physics using a classical description ; The ups and downs of classical and quantum formulations of magnetic resonance ; The RF pulse and the uncertainty principle ; On the nature of the RF driving field in NMR (with a lookout on optical rotation) -- AA in what-science: small-molecule structure elucidation by NMR and MS (are you sure you have found the correct structure and not an apparently correct structure?). An "anthropic" modus operandi of structure elucidation by NMR and MS ; NMR methodological overview ; MS methodological overview ; Computer-assisted structure elucidation in NMR ; Structure elucidation of a mysterious trace component of ulipristal acetate ; The adventurous discovery of the structure of a novel vincristine impurity ; An elusive degradation product of ziprasidone ; The case of an emotion- and emotycs-laden structure determination of a small synthetic molecule with an unexpected structure ; Self-induced recognition of enantiomers (SIRE) in NMR spectroscopy ; Believe it or not: carbon protonation of the pyrimidine ring
