Nanoscience for the conversation of works of art
Understanding the chemistry behind works of art and heritage materials presents an opportunity to apply scientific techniques to their conservation and restoration. Manipulation of materials at the nanoscale affords greater accuracy and minimal disturbance to the original work, while efficiently combating the affects of time and environment. This book meets the growing demand for an all-encompassing handbook to instruct on the use of today's science on mankind's cultural heritage. The editors have pioneered modern techniques in art conservation over the last four decades, and have brought toge
