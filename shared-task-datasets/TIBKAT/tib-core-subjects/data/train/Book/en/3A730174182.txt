Linear system theory and design
"Linear System Theory and Design is for use in advanced undergraduate/first-year graduate courses in linear systems and multivariable system design in electrical, mechanical, chemical, and aeronautical engineering departments"--
"Striking a balance between theory and applications, Linear System Theory and Design, Fourth Edition, uses simple and efficient methods to develop results and design procedures that students can readily employ.  Ideal for advanced undergraduate courses and first-year graduate courses in linear systems and multivariable system design, it is also a helpful resource for practicing engineers.  NEW TO THIS EDITION  All examples using MATLAB have been updated using the R2011a version  Chapter 1 provides a brief history and overview of the subject  Chapter 2 has been restructured in order to discuss four types of equations and to give reasons for focusing on rational transfer functions and state-space equations  Chapter 4 includes a new section on SISO realizations and expanded discussions of computer computation and real-time processing of state-space equations  Chapter 7 includes a new section on complete characterization  SUPPLEMENTS  Companion website at www.oup.com/us/chen contains PowerPoint-based versions of the figures from the text (available to adopters of the text)  An Instructor's Solutions Manual is available to adopters"--
