Solid-State Lasers : A Graduate Text
Overview of the History, Performance Characteristics, and Applications of Solid-State Lasers -- Energy Transfer Between Radiation and Atomic Transitions -- Properties of Solid-State Laser Materials -- Laser Oscillator -- Laser Amplifier -- Optical Resonator -- Optical Pump Systems -- Thermo-Optic Effects -- Q-Switching -- Mode-Locking -- Nonlinear Devices.
Solid-state lasers have seen a fast and steady development and are the ubiquitous tool both for research and industrial applications. The author's monograph Solid-State Lasers has become the most-used reference book in this area. The present graduate text on solid-state lasers takes advantage of this rich source by focusing on the needs at the graduate level and those who need an introduction. Numerous exercises with hints for solution, new text and updated material where needed make this text very accessible.
