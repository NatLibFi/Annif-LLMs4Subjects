Nuclear emergencies : a holistic approach to preparedness and response
This book discusses nuclear events that may become imminent threats to the fabric of our society, and elucidates strategies for preventing these threats or mitigating their adverse effects. It addresses multidisciplinary aspects of various nuclear emergencies, including nuclear accidents, terror attacks involving nuclear materials, illicit trafficking of nuclear materials, and problems related to nuclear forensics and strikes with nuclear weapons/warheads. Very often, nuclear emergencies are only discussed within certain, specific communities. However, this volume brings together experts from various fields to provide a more holistic approach to the problem. Physical, chemical, environmental, social, and medical scientists, together with representatives from the media and authorities, present their views on and strategies for events that cause fear and anxiety among the public – an aspect that can be even more threatening than the direct health effects. The book offers a valuable guide for nuclear scientists, such as radioecologists, health physicists, radioanalytical scientists and nuclear engineers, as well as decision-makers and national/international authorities
