Handbook of Molecular Force Spectroscopy
Modern materials science and biophysics has increasingly focused on studying and controlling intermolecular interactions on the single-molecule level. The peer-reviewed literature contains an increasing number of studies that either measure the interaction forces directly or use mechanical forces to deform the molecules or trigger structural transitions.Molecular force spectroscopy is the result of unprecedented advances in the capabilities of modern force measurement instruments in the past decade and describes a number of techniques that use mechanical force measurements to study interaction
