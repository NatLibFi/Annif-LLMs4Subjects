Transgenic herbicide resistance in plants
This book provides a comprehensive and in-depth discussion on the development of herbicide resistance during the past 50 years, emphasizing the biochemical pathways of herbicide resistance in weeds. It discusses the principles of plant genetics, different methods of genetic engineering, makingof transgenic plants, various transgenic crops conferred with herbicide resistance, evolution of weed, problems subsequent to growing of transgenic crops, benefits and risks of growing transgenic crops, and management of transgenic crops.
"This book elucidates the basic principles of herbicide resistance and transgenic engineering besides a detailed discussion on the current status of transgenes used to engineer herbicide resistance in crops, and development of herbicide-resistant events and stacked lines/hybrids."--
