Plasmon-enhanced light-matter interactions
This book highlights cutting-edge research in surface plasmons, discussing the different types and providing a comprehensive overview of their applications. Surface plasmons (SPs) receive special attention in nanoscience and nanotechnology due to their unique optical, electrical, magnetic, and catalytic properties when operating at the nanoscale. The excitation of SPs in metal nanostructures enables the manipulation of light beyond the diffraction limit, which can be utilized for enhancing and tailoring light-matter interactions and developing ultra-compact high-performance nanophotonic devices for various applications. With clear and understandable illustrations, tables, and descriptions, this book provides physicists, materials scientists, chemists, engineers, and their students with a fundamental understanding of surface plasmons and device applications as a basis for future developments. .
