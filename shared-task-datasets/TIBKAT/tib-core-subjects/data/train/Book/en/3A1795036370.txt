Atomistic simulations of glasses : fundamentals and applications
"Written by the leading experts and active practitioners from across the world, this book provides a comprehensive review of the fundamentals and practical applications of atomistic simulations of inorganic glasses. After providing a concise overview of both classical, first principles, Reverse Monte Carlo and other simulation methods and analysis techniques, the second part of the book focuses on practical examples of the application of atomistic simulations in the research of different glass systems: silica, silicate, aluminosilicate, borosilicate, chalcogenide and halide glasses. Up-to-date information is provided on simulations (both classical and ab initio methods) of these glass systems, and current challenges facing these systems are discussed"--
