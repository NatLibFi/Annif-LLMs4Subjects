This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, This book provides an historical overview of the recent developments in the history of diverse fields within chemistry. It follows on from Recent Developments in the History of Chemistry, a volume published in 1985. Covering chiefly the last 20 years, the primary aim of Chemical History: Reviews of the Recent Literature is to familiarise newcomers to the history of chemistry with some of the more important developments in the field. Starting with a general introduction and look at the early history of chemistry, subsequent chapters go on to investigate the traditional areas of chemistry (physical, organic, inorganic) alongside analytical chemistry, physical organic chemistry, medical chemistry and biochemistry, and instruments and apparatus. Topics such as industrial chemistry and chemistry in national contexts, whilst not featuring as separate chapters, are woven throughout the content. Each chapter is written by experts and is extensively referenced to the international chemical literature. Chemical History: Reviews of the Recent Literature is also ideal for chemists who wish to become familiar with historical aspects of their work.  In addition, it will appeal to a wider audience interested in the history of chemistry, as it draws together historical materials that are widely scattered throughout the chemical literature
