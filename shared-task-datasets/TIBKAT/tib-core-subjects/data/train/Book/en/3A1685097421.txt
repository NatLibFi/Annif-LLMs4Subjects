"This is the second volume in a series of books about using the GAMLSS R package developed by the authors. This volume presents a broad overview of statistical distributions and how they can be used in practical applications. It describes over 100 distributions - all available in the supporting R package - including their properties, limitations, and applications. Given the increasing size and complexity of available datasets, it is important to choose the underlying statistical distribution for your model very carefully, and this book gives both users and non-users of GAMLSS the tools to do that effectively"--
