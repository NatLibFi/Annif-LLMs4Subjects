The urban condition: space, community, and self in the contemporary metropolis
Written by the Ghent Urban Studies Team (GUST) this multidisciplinary study, consisting mainly of texts, asks a host of questions about the state of the Western city at the end of the 20th century. The first part contains a synthesising theoretical description of the contemporary urban condition whilst the second part complements abstract speculations by concrete examples.
