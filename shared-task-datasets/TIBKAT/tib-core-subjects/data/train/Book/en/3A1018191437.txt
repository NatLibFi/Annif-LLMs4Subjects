Computing the flow of light : nonstandard FDTD methodologies for photonics design
The finite difference time domain (FDTD) method computes the time evolution of a system at discrete time steps, and periodically visualizing the results lets us view the time evolution, yielding valuable physical insights. FDTD and FDTD-like methods can be used to solve a wide variety of problems, including--but not limited to--the wave equation, Maxwell's equations, and the Schr√∂dinger equation. In addition to introducing useful new methodologies, this book provides readers with analytical background and simulation examples that will help them develop their own methodologies to solve yet-to-be-posed problems. The book is written for students, engineers, and researchers grappling with problems that cannot be solved analytically. It could also be used as a textbook for a mathematical physics or engineering class. An accompanying CD provides supplemental Mathcad and pseudocode programs
