Auditory effects of microwave radiation
This book examines the human auditory effects of exposure to beams of high-power microwave pulses, which research results have shown can cause a cascade of health events when aimed at a human subject or the subjectâ€™s head. The book details multidisciplinary investigations using physical theories and models, physiological events and phenomena, and computer analysis and simulation. Coverage includes brain anatomy and physiology, dosimetry of microwave power deposition, microwave auditory effect, interaction mechanisms, and shock/pressure wave induction. The book will be welcomed by scientists, academics, health professionals, and practicing engineers as an important contribution to the continuing study of the effects of microwave pulse absorption on humans.
