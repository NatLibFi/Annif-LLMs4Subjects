Galois Theory
J***VERKAUFSKATEGORIE*** 0 e This text offers a clear, efficient exposition of Galois Theory with exercises and complete proofs. Topics include: Cardano's formulas; the Fundamental Theorem; Galois' Great Theorem (solvability for radicals of a polynomial is equivalent to solvability of its Galois Group); and computation of Galois group of cubics and quartics. There are appendices on group theory and on ruler-compass constructions. Developed on the basis of a second-semester graduate algebra course, following a course on group theory, this book will provide a concise introduction to Galois Theory suitable for graduate students, either as a text for a course or for study outside the classroom
