Simple theories and hyperimaginaries
"In the 1990s Byunghan Kim and Anand Pillay generalized stability, a major model-theoretic idea developed by Saharon Shelah twenty-five years earlier, to the study of simple theories. This book is an up-to-date introduction to simple theories and hyperimaginaries, with special attention to Lascar strong types and elimination of hyperimaginary problems. Assuming only knowledge of general model theory, the foundations of forking, stability, and simplicity are presented in full detail. The treatment of the topics is as general as possible, working with stable formulas and types and assuming stability of the theory only when necessary. The author offers an introduction to independence relations as well as a full account of canonical bases of types in stable and simple theories. In the last chapters, the notions of internality and analyzability are discussed and used to provide a self-contained proof of elimination of hyperimaginaries in supersimple theories"--Provided by publisher
