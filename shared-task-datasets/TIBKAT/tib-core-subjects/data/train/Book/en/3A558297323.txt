Continuing the "Architecture in Context" series, this second volume narrates the development of architecture across a huge swathe of the world, from the Indian subcontinent to the Japanese archipelago, over a period extending from prehistory to the arrival of Islam and its distinct traditions from the eleventh century onwards. Fantastically illustrated, with over 1,000 photographs and drawings, Christopher Tadgell covers the major architectural traditions of India, China, Thailand and Japan as well as the spectacular architecture of Sri Lanka, Nepal, Korea, Myenmar, Bhutan and Tibet. As with the first volume - "Antiquity" - "The East" presents not only the buildings themselves, but the cultures and peoples that they are a part of. Unprecedented in its scope, this volume is a beautiful guide to the fascinating history of Eastern architecture.
