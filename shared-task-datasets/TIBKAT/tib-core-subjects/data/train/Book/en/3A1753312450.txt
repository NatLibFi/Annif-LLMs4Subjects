Manual of laboratory testing methods for dental restorative materials
"Dental postgraduate trainees often face the difficulty of formulating a study design due to lack of knowledge of instrument and experiment availability as well as the type of equipment that will be appropriate for conducting experiments and tests related to dental materials. This manual will be an accessible reference, providing an insight into the materials used in restorative dentistry, the properties studied, the methods used to study the properties and their respective advantages and disadvantages. Since there are many products available, it becomes difficult for dentists to select appropriate materials which are used in the oral cavity for various purposes -- restorations, endodontic treatments, orthodontic applications, surgical and prosthodontic treatments. Even though material testing has not reached the level of clinical simulation, they represent an important parameter of analyses. The knowledge of the principle laboratory tests is of high importance for proper screening of different dental restorative materials available. The book will be a helpful addition to any institute library or personal collection and will cater to the needs of postgraduate dental students, researchers and academics in the fields of dentistry and material sciences"--
