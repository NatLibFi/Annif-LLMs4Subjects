The constructed other : Japanese architecture in the Western mind
A built chimera : the image of Japanese architecture -- Three types of otherness : early Western responses -- The self in the other : Western theories in Japanese buildings -- The other in the self : adoptions of Japanese ideas -- The other in the other : the othering of Japanese architecture -- The lens of myth : the myth of Japanese architecture.
"The Constructed Other argues that a widespread assumption of the inherent otherness of Japanese architecture made it not only a test of the universality of Western architectural theories but also a seemingly endless source of inspiration. The book traces three interwoven themes in Western accounts of Japanese architecture from the reopening of Japan in the mid-19th century to the present day: a wish to see Western architectural theories validated in Japanese buildings; efforts to integrate elements of Japanese architecture into Western buildings; and a desire to connect contemporary Japanese architecture with Japanese traditions. It is suggested that these narratives had the effect of creating what amounted to a mythical version of Japanese architecture in the West, often at odds with historical fact, but which nonetheless exercised a powerful influence on 20th century architecture internationally. As such, this book should be of value to anyone interested in architectural history, Japanese architecture or cultural theory"--
