Aggregation of luminophores in supramolecular systems : from mechanisms to applications
"Aggregation of Luminophores in Supramolecular System: From Mechanisms to Applications provides recent advancement in Supramolecular Chemistry, in which the luminophores are almost non-luminescent in the molecular state, but become highly emissive in the aggregate state, brings new opportunities and challenges for the development of Supramolecular Chemistry. The intermolecular non-covalent interactions have been considered to be the main driving forces for fabricating supramolecular systems with aggregating luminophores, and have an important influence on the luminescence properties of the probes. Based on these unique properties, luminescent supramolecular aggregates have greatly promoted the development of novel materials for applications as sensors, bio-imaging agents, organic electronic devices, and in the drug delivery field"--
