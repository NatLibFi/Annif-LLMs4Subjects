Linear Differential Equations in the Complex Domain : From Classical Theory to Forefront
This book provides a detailed introduction to recent developments in the theory of linear differential systems and integrable total differential systems. Starting from the basic theory of linear ordinary differential equations and integrable systems, it proceeds to describe Katz theory and its applications, extending it to the case of several variables. In addition, connection problems, deformation theory, and the theory of integral representations are comprehensively covered. Complete proofs are given, offering the reader a precise account of the classical and modern theory of linear differential equations in the complex domain, including an exposition of Pfaffian systems and their monodromy problems. The prerequisites are a course in complex analysis and the basics of differential equations, topology and differential geometry. This book will be useful for graduate students, specialists in differential equations, and for non-specialists who want to use differential equations. .
