Advanced antenna array engineering for 6G and beyond wireless communications
"Whilst 5G standards are in solid shape, the telecommunications industry faces tremendous engineering challenges in designing and deploying antennas which will not only deliver the expected 5G performance, but also can be installed in collocation with 4G antennas. It is expected that analogue antenna arrays will play a major part in enabling the cost-effective roll-out of 5G networks. Moreover, it is expected many 6G antennas will be mounted on airborne and spaceborne platforms. The nature of such space, air, and terrestrial integrated communications networks poses new challenges and demands for antennas with characteristics such as high gain, individually scannable multi-beams, immunity to interference, reconfigurability, and conformability to all platforms."--
