Perkins&Will : Miami : twenty-five years
This publication contains a compilation of the work of Perkins&Will Miami since its inception in 1996. Drawing from a legacy of nearly a century of the fabled Chicago Architectural Firm, the story of the Miami Studio is one of a search for a regional and critical modernist language unique to its time and place. Starting as a five-person office, the studio has grown to a team of 70 architects, interior designers, and landscape professionals who have come together with a single vision of meaning and purpose. The work ranges from one of the most visionary Corporate Headquarters in the country to a Hospital in Ghana; from the most important new Public Park in Florida to the largest Women's University in the Middle East; from an Innovation Center in Rio de Janeiro to an Office Building in Wynwood. The book contains a series of interviews with the founding members and partners carrying the Studio into the future. --
