Interchanging : future designs for responsive transport environments
Interchanging brings together a collection of design projects and interdisciplinary perspectives on policy, planning, design, and management issues, that currently, and are set to, shape and influence our expectations and experiences of urban public transport environments. This comprises a unique range of contributions from academics, industry and practice, including the Australian Research Council Linkage Grant project and research team Encircle: Dr. M. Hank Haeusler (University of New South Wales/ UNSW), Briedy Mahar (UNSW), Tim Tompson (UNSW), Dr. Martin Tomitsch (University of Sydney), Dr. Nathan Kirchner (University of Technology Sydney/UTS) and Dr. Michelle Zeibots (UTS), together with Nicole Gardner (UTS), Tom Hordern (Volvo Group), Transport for New South Wales, Bonnie Parfitt (City of Sydney), Jimmy Ti (Queensland University of Technology/QUT), Professor Alec Tzannes (Tzannes Associates/UNSW), and Mark Gilder (Grimshaw Architects), and with a foreword by Associate Professor Marcus Foth, Director of the Urban Informatics Research Lab at QUT
With consideration of a range of social trends, but also emerging responsive and sustainable technologies, the essays and design projects presented here reimagine, in various ways, a public transport Interchange of the Future better suited to address the complexities and conditions of 21st century urban digital life
