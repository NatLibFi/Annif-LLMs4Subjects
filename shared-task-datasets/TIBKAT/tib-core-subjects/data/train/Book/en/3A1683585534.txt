Green polymeric nanocomposites
"The book covers green polymeric nanocomposites that show greater properties in terms of degradability, biocompatibility, synthesis process, cost effectiveness, mechanical strength, high surface area, nontoxicity, and environmemntal friendliness. These are beneficial to agricultural, biomedical, food processing, pharmaceutical, and other fields. It includes applications and studies of various sources for green polymeric nanocomposites"--
