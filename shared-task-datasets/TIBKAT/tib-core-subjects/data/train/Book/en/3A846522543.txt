Probability and randomness : quantum versus classical
Foundations of probability -- Randomness -- Supplementary notes on measure-theoretic and frequency -- Approaches -- Introduction to quantum formalism -- Quantum and contextual probability -- Interpretations of quantum mechanics and probability -- Randomness: quantum versus classical -- Probabilistic structure of Bell's argument -- Quantum probability outside of physics: from molecular  biology to cognition
"Creating a rigorous mathematical theory of randomness is far from being complete, even in the classical case. Interrelation of Classical and Quantum Randomness rectifies this and introduces mathematical formalisms of classical and quantum probability and randomness with brief discussion of their interrelation and interpretational and foundational issues. The book presents the essentials of classical approaches to randomness, enlightens their successes and problems, and then proceeds to essentials of quantum randomness. Its wide-ranging and comprehensive scope makes it suitable for researchers in mathematical physics, probability and statistics at any level"--
