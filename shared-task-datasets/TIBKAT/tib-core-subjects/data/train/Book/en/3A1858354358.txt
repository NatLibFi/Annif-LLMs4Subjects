Bubbles, drops, and particles in non-Newtonian fluids
"The third edition of Bubbles, Drops, and Particles in Non-Newtonian Fluids provides comprehensive coverage of the scientific foundations and latest advances in particle motion in non-Newtonian media. Thoroughly updating and expanding its best-selling predecessor, this edition addresses numerical and experimental developments in non-Newtonian particulate systems. It includes a new chapter on heat transfer in non-Newtonian fluids in the free and mixed convection regimes and covers forced convection regimes"--
