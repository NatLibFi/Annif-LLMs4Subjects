Design of CMOS operational amplifiers
This cutting-edge volume provides an analytical method for designing CMOS Op Amp circuits, placing emphasis on the practical aspects of the design process. It takes an in-depth look at CMOS differential amplifiers, explaining how they are the main part of all Op Amps. It presents important details and a design method for the different architectures of single ended Op Amps. There are complete chapters dedicated to the critical issues of CMOS output stages, fully differential Op Amps, and CMOS reference generators. This resource also includes an introduction to CMOS technology and the basics of the physical aspects of MOS transistors, providing the foundation needed to fully master the material. --
