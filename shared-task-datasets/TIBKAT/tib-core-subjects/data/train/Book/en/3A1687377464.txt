Electroanalytical chemistry : principles, best practices, and case studies
"This book is one of a series of modules to be used in teaching an undergraduate course in instrumental chemical analysis. The first two books in this series, written by Mark Vitha, covers chromatography and spectroscopy, respectively. These books provide an alternative to the encyclopedic texts currently available for such courses which inevitably include much more material and dozens of methods that are not covered in a single course. Providing a collection of shorter texts, each dedicated to a single field, gives the instructor an opportunity to select 3 or 4 areas to focus on in a semester. This text emphasizes electrochemical phenomena and conceptual models to help the undergraduate majors in chemistry and chemical engineering understand the influence of experimental conditions and the interpretation of results for common potentiometric and voltammetric methods. It illustrates best practices with the use of case studies of organic reactions. By providing a collection of shorter texts, each dedicated to a single field, this book allows instructors to select focus areas and tailor the book to their course"--
