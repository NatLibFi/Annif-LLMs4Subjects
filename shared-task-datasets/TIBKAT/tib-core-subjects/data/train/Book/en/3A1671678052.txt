Lectures on the physics of extreme states of matter
Containing a summary of the latest experimental and theoretical results on matter at high pressure and temperature, this book provides critical analysis of data and models ranging from matter in extreme states in the laboratory to the influence of laser radiation, relativistic heavy ion collisions, strongly coupled electromagnetic plasma, and extreme matter in astrophysics. The purpose of the book is to give students and young scientists an introduction to the physics of extreme states of matter, to acquaint them with the experimental techniques, new experimental facilities and the main results allowing them to unravel fascinating problems of modern physics of extreme states of matter and acquainting them with the theoretical methods, experimental techniques and results in this exciting new area of research.
