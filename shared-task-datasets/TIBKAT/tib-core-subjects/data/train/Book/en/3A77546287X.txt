Elements of Newtonian Mechanics : Including Nonlinear Dynamics
This textbook provides a thorough introduction to Newtonian Mechanics and is intended for university students in physics, astronomy and engineering. It is based on a course for which Dr Knudsen earned an award as the best introductory course at the university of Copenhagen, Denmark. About 190 problems with solutions and 84 worked examples help the student to grasp the essential aspects of the subject, and to develop proficiency in using the powerful methods of Newtonian mechanics. Moreover, the problem of motion and the concept of inertial frames is faced from the very beginning, and runs through the entire development of classical mechanics. This new and fresh approach is presented in its second edition, which has been revised and enlarged by a new chapter on nonlinear dynamics
