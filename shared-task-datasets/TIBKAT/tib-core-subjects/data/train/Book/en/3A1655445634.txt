Exercises in Functional Analysis
This book of exercises in Functional Analysis contains almost 450 exercises (all with complete solutions), providing supplementary examples, counter-examples and applications for the basic notions usually presented in an introductory course in Functional Analysis. It contains three parts. The first one contains exercises on the general properties for sets in normed spaces, linear bounded operators on normed spaces, reflexivity, compactness in normed spaces, and on the basic principles in Functional Analysis: the Hahn-Banach theorem, the Uniform Boundedness Principle, the Open Mapping and the Closed Graph theorems. The second one contains exercises on the general theory of Hilbert spaces, the Riesz representation theorem, orthogonality in Hilbert spaces, the projection theorem and linear bounded operators on Hilbert spaces. The third one deals with linear topological spaces, and includes a large number of exercises on the weak topologies
