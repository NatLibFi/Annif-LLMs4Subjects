Advanced Wirebond Interconnection Technology
Materials for Wire Bonding -- Bonding Equipment -- Process Technology -- Quality -- Reliability -- New Technologies and New Applications for Wire Bonding.
Advanced Wire Bond Interconnection Technology addresses wire bonding from both manufacturing and reliability perspectives. It analyzes and explores the various factors that one needs to consider: design, materials, processing, equipment, quality testing and reliability engineering, and last but not the least, operator training. This book is intended to be a comprehensive source of information and knowledge that enables both a newcomer to the field and a veteran who needs instant information to make a decision on a process problem. The book explains not only how to do things such as: designing a bond pad or a lead finger, how to select a right bond wire, how to design a capillary and how to optimize a bonding process on the factory floor; but the book also explains why to do it that way.
