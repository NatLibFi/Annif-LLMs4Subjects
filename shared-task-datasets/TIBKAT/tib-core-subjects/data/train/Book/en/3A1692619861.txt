Handbook of analytic operator theory
Handbook of Analytic Operator Theory thoroughly covers the subject of holomorphic function spaces and operators acting on them. The spaces covered include Bergman spaces, Hardy spaces, Fock spaces and the Drury-Averson space. Operators discussed in the book include Toeplitz operators, Hankel operators, composition operators, and Cowen-Douglas class operators. The volume consists of eleven articles in the general area of analytic function spaces and operators on them. Each contributor focuses on one particular topic, for example, operator theory on the Drury-Aversson space, and presents the material in the form of a survey paper which contains all the major results in the area and includes all relevant references. The overalp between this volume and existing books in the area is minimal. The material on two-variable weighted shifts by Curto, the Drury-Averson space by Fang and Xia, the Cowen-Douglas class by Misra, and operator theory on the bi-disk by Yang has never appeared in book form before.
