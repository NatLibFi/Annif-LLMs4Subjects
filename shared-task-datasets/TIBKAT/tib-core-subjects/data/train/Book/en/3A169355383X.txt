Mathematical modeling of concrete mixture proportioning
"The primary aim of this book is to put together an understanding of the appropriate principles of ensuring performance and sustainability of concrete. Broadly subdivided into three parts, first part contains the fundamental aspects introducing the constituent materials, the concepts of concrete mixture designs and the mathematical formulations of the various parameters involved in these designs. The second part is dedicated to discussing approaches and recommendations of American, British and European bodies related to mathematical modelling. Lastly, it discusses perceptions and prescriptions towards both the performance assessment and insurance of the resulting concrete compositions"--
