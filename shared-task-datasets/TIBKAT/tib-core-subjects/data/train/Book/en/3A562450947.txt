Drying technologies in food processing
"This volume provides an up-to-date account of all the major drying technologies employed in the food industry and their underlying scientific principles and effects. Various equipment designs are classified and described. The impact of drying on food properties is covered and the microstructural changes caused by the process are examined, highlighting their usefulness in process analysis and food design. Key methods for assessing food properties of dried products are described, and pre-concentration and drying control strategies are reviewed. Thermal hazards and fire/explosion detection and prevention for dryers are discussed in a dedicated chapter. Where appropriate, sample calculations are included for engineers and technologists to follow. The book is directed at food scientists and technologists in industry and research, food engineers and drying equipment manufacturers."--BOOK JACKET
