Information, opportunism, and economic coordination
This book is an integrated collection of a dozen of Peter Earl's lively and thought-provoking essays, carefully edited and updated. Theoretical topics include the prediction of corporate behaviour, the economic foundations of marketing and shopping mall design, pricing strategy and its relationship with the existence of second-hand markets, and the microfoundations of macroeconomics. Case studies include cooperation in the car industry, managerialist reforms in New Zealand and the university sector, structural change in the advertising industry and the place of G.B. Richardson and G.L.S. Shackle in the literature of economics. Information, Opportunism and Economic Coordination will be of particular interest to historians of economic thought, business economists, behavioural economists and Post Keynesians
