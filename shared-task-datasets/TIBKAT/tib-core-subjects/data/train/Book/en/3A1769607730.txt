Failure analysis of microbiologically influenced corrosion
"The book serves as a complete guide to corrosion failure analysis with emphasis on diagnosis of MIC. It provides background information on the forensic process, types of data or evidence needed to perform the analysis, industrial case studies, details on the MIC failure analysis process, and protocols for field and lab use. By applying the principles of chemistry, microbiology, and metallurgy, readers will be able to reliably determine the mechanistic cause of corrosion damage and failures and select appropriate methods for mitigating future corrosion incidents"--
