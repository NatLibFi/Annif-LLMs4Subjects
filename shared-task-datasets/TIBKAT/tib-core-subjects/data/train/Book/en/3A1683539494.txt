Reclaimed wood : a field guide
Wood reclaimed from old houses, factories, barns, water tanks, and boardwalks has become a valuable commodity, treasured for the patina that gives witness to its history. Our ancestors built well, using locally sourced lumber that expressed the culture and natural history of their region: oak and pine in the Northeast; hickory and cypress in the South; Douglas fir and redwood in the West. Reclaimed Wood: A Field Guide is the first complete visual handbook to this popular resource, covering history, culture, salvage, sources, contemporary uses (in buildings and furniture), and practical advice
