Learning-Based Robot Vision : Principles and Applications
This book provides the background and introduces a practical methodology for developing autonomous camera-equipped robot systems which solve deliberate tasks in open environments based on their competences acquired from training, interaction, and learning in the real task-relevant world; visual demonstration and neural learning for the backbone for acquiring the situated competences. The author verifies the practicability of the proposed methodology by presenting a structured case study including high-level sub-tasks such as localizing, approaching, grasping, and carrying objects
