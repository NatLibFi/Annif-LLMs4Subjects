Photonic instrumentation : sensing and measuring with lasers
"Photonic Instrumentation is designed as the sourcebook for university-level courses covering the essentials of laser-based instrumentation, and is also a useful reference for working engineers. Photonic instruments have very desirable features like non-contact operation and unparalleled sensitivity. They have soon become a big industrial success, passing unaffected through the bubble years and, not less important, well-established methods in measurement science. This book offers coverage of the most proven instruments, with a balanced treatment of the optical and electronic aspects involved. It also attempts to present the basic principles, develop the guidelines of design and evaluate the ultimate limits of performances set by noise. The instruments surveyed include: Alignment instruments -Wire diameter and Particle Size Analyzers - Telemeters - Laser Interferometers -Self- Mixing Interferometers - Speckle Pattern Instruments- Laser Doppler Velocimeters- Gyroscopes - Optical Fiber Sensors -Quantum Sensing A few appendices offer convenient reference material for key principles on lasers, optical interferometers, propagation and scattering, and diffraction."--
