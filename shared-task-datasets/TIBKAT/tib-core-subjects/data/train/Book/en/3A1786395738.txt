Wireless discrete-time receivers
"The first comprehensive guide to discrete-time (DT) receivers (RX), discussing the fundamental concepts and implications of the technology. This book will serve as an essential reference, covering the necessary building blocks of this field, such as low-noise transconductance amplifiers, current-driven mixers, DT band-pass filters, and DT low-pass filters. As well as addressing the basics, the authors present the most recent state-of-the-art techniques applied to the DT RX blocks. A step-by-step style is used to allow readers to develop the required skills to design the DT receivers at the architecture level, while providing in-depth knowledge of the details. Written by leading experts from academia, research, and industry, this book provides an excellent reference to the subject for a wide audience, from postgraduate students to experienced researchers and professionals working with RF circuits"--
