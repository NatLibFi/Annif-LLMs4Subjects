Sensor and data fusion for intelligent transportation systems
"Sensor and Data Fusion for Intelligent Transportation Systems introduces readers to the roles of the data fusion processes defined by the Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) data fusion model, data fusion algorithms, and noteworthy applications of data fusion to ITS. Additionally, the monograph offers detailed descriptions of three of the widely applied data fusion techniques and their relevance to ITS (namely, Bayesian inference, Dempster-Shafer evidential reasoning, and Kalman filtering), and indicates directions for future research in the area of data fusion. The focus is on data fusion algorithms rather than on sensor and data fusion architectures, although the book does summarize factors that influence the selection of a fusion architecture and several architecture frameworks"--
