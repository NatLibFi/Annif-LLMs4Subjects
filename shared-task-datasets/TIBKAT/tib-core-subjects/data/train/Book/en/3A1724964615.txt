Space  & anti-space : the fabric of place, city and architecture
This book challenges the conventional idea of what constitutes the physical form of the contemporary city. Observing the absence of extended urban fabrics?the missing urbanism?in the new global cities developed today, it argues that these cities are merely statistical accumulations of density that lack the positive attributes of a genuine urban condition. Cities as urban places cannot be made by individual buildings alone but rather depend on the intertwined combination of an architecture that is bound to the creation of public spaces and streets, and engaged in the structure of urban blocks to form a complex field pattern of interactive solids and voids. 00In a series of essays, articles and urban projects extensively illustrated by plans, analytic diagrams, and dramatic images, this book makes a visual and verbal argument for the steps that need to be taken to re-urbanize the city in order to achieve an urbanity consisting of multiple discrete places that depend on the essential concept of contained geometrical space. These spatial ideas are illustrated in this book in three proposals: for Rome, in?Roma Interrotta,? 1979; Paris, the?Consultation Internationale pour L?Am√©nagement du Quartier des Halles,? 1980; and New York in the?World Trade Center Site Innovative Design Study,? 2002
