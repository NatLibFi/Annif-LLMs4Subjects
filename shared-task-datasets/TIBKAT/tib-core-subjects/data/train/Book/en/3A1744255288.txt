Introduction to the tools of scientific computing
The book provides an introduction to common programming tools and methods in numerical mathematics and scientific computing. Unlike widely used standard approaches, it does not focus on any particular language but aims to explain the key underlying concepts. In general, new concepts are first introduced in the particularly user-friendly Python language and then transferred and expanded in various scientific programming environments from C / C , Julia and MATLAB to Maple. This includes different approaches to distributed computing. The fact that different languages are studied and compared also makes the book useful for mathematicians and practitioners trying to decide which programming language to use for which purposes.
