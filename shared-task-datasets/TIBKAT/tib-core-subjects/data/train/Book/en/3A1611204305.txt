Introduction to 4G mobile communications
"Juha Korhonen is a project manager within the Mobile Competence Center at ETSI, Sophia Antipolis, France. He earned his Ph.D. in telecommunications engineering from University of Cambridge in Cambridge, UK. Long Term Evolution (LTE) was originally an internal 3GPP name for a program to enhance the capabilities of 3G radio access networks. The nickname has now evolved to become synonymous with 4G. This book concentrates on 4G systems, also known as LTE-Advanced. Telecommunications engineers and students are provided with a history of these systems, along with an overview of a mobile telecommunications system. The overview addresses the components in the system as well as their function. This resource guides telecommunications engineers though many important aspects of 4G including the air interface physical layer, Radio Access Networks, and 3GPP standardization, to name a few" --
