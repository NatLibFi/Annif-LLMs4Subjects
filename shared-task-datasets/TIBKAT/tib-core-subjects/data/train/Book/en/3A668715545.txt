Type-2 fuzzy logic in intelligent control applications
"We describe in this book, hybrid intelligent systems based mainly on type-2 fuzzy logic for intelligent control. Hybrid intelligent systems combine several intelligent computing paradigms, including fuzzy logic, and bio-inspired optimization algorithms, which can be used to produce powerful automatic control systems. The book is organized in three main parts, which contain a group of chapters around a similar subject. The first part consists of chapters with the main theme of theory and design algorithms, which are basically chapters that propose new models and concepts, which can be the basis for achieving intelligent control with interval type-2 fuzzy logic. The second part of the book is comprised of chapters with the main theme of evolutionary optimization of type-2 fuzzy systems in intelligent control with the aim of designing optimal type-2 fuzzy controllers for complex control problems in diverse areas of application, including mobile robotics, aircraft dynamics systems and hardware implementations. The third part of the book is formed with chapters dealing with the theme of bio-inspired optimization of type-2 fuzzy systems in intelligent control, which includes the application of particle swarm intelligence and ant colony optimization algorithms for obtaining optimal type-2 fuzzy controllers"--Publisher
