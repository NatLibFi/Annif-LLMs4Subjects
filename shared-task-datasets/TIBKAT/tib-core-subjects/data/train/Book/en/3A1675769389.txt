Coherent multidimensional spectroscopy
This book will fulfill the needs of time-domain spectroscopists who wish to deepen their understanding of both the theoretical and experimental features of this cutting-edge spectroscopy technique. Coherent Multidimensional Spectroscopy (CMDS) is a state-of-the-art technique with applications in a variety of subjects like chemistry, molecular physics, biochemistry, biophysics, and material science. Due to dramatic advancements of ultrafast laser technologies, diverse multidimensional spectroscopic methods utilizing combinations of THz, IR, visible, UV, and X-ray radiation sources have been developed and used to study real time dynamics of small molecules in solutions, proteins and nucleic acids in condensed phases and membranes, single and multiple excitons in functional materials like semiconductors, quantum dots, and solar cells, photo-excited states in light-harvesting complexes, ions in battery electrolytes, electronic and conformational changes in charge or proton transfer systems, and excess electrons and protons in water and biological systems
