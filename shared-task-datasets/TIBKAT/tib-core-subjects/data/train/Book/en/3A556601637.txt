Physics and properties of Narrow gap semiconductors
Narrow gap semiconductors are the most important materials for the preparation of advanced modern infrared systems. They often operate at the extremes of the rules of semiconductor science. This book offers clear descriptions of crystal growth and the fundamental structure and properties of these unique materials. Topics covered include band structure, optical and transport properties, and lattice vibrations and spectra. A thorough treatment of the properties of low-dimensional systems and their relation to infrared applications is provided.
Narrow gap semiconductors obey the general rules of semiconductor science, but often exhibit extreme features within these rules because of those properties that produce their narrow gaps. Consequently these materials provide sensitive tests of theory, and the opportunity for the design of innovative devices. Narrow gap semiconductors are the most important materials for the preparation of advanced modern infrared systems. Physics and Properties of Narrow Gap Semiconductors offers clear descriptions of crystal growth, material science, and device physics of these unique materials. Topics covered include energy band structures, optical and transport properties, phonons, impurities and defects, recombination, and surface and interface properties. A thorough treatment of the properties of low-dimensional systems and their relation to infrared applications is given. In addition to covering the technology of photoconductive detectors, photovoltaic detectors, metal-insulator-semiconductor devices, quantum well infrared photodetectors, infrared lasers, and single photon detectors, this book will help readers understand semiconductor physics and related areas of materials science and how they relate to advanced opto-electronic devices.
