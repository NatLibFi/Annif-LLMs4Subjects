Smart solar PV inverters with advanced grid support functionalities
"This book covers the full scope of smart inverter technology for PV solar power systems. It begins by introducing the need for smart inverters as well as the challenges faced by utilities in integrating PV solar systems on a large scale in distribution and transmission systems. Configurations of different types of smart inverters for both PV solar and win power systems will be described as well as the broad structure of smart inverters, ranging from small rooftop applications to large utility scale inverters. One of the key subjects covered in this book is the functions and operating characteristics of smart inverters. Functions included are voltage regulation, reactive power control, power factor control, real power control/curtailment, amongst others. The operation of smart inverters in autonomous/commanded mode and operation with local/remote control will be described. The book concludes by discussing emerging technologies and developments for smart inverters, as well as the challenges for implementing smart inverter functions in existing PV inverters."--
