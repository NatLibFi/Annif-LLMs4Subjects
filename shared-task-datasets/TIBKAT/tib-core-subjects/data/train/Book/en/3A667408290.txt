Measurement data modeling and parameter estimation
"This book discusses the theories, methods, and application techniques of the measurement data mathematical modeling and parameter estimation. It seeks to build a bridge between mathematical theory and engineering practice in the measurement data processing field so theoretical researchers and technical engineers can communicate. It is organized with abundant materials, such as illustrations, tables, examples, and exercises. The authors create examples to apply mathematical theory innovatively to measurement and control engineering. Not only does this reference provide theoretical knowledge, it provides information on first hand experiences"--
