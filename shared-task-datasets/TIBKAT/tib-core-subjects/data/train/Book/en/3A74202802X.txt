Introduction to combinatorics
"Praise for the First Edition--"This excellent text should prove a useful accoutrement for any developing mathematics program. it's short, it's sweet, it's beautifully written." --The Mathematical Intelligencer"Erickson has prepared an exemplary work. strongly recommended for inclusion in undergraduate-level library collections." --ChoiceFeaturing a modern approach, Introduction to Combinatorics, Second Edition illustrates the applicability of combinatorial methods and discusses topics that are not typically addressed in literature, such as Alcuin's sequence, Rook paths, and Leech's lattice. The book also presents fundamental results, discusses interconnection and problem-solving techniques, and collects and disseminates open problems that raise questions and observations.Many important combinatorial methods are revisited and repeated several times throughout the book in exercises, examples, theorems, and proofs alike, allowing readers to build confidence and reinforce their understanding of complex material. In addition, the author successfully guides readers step-by-step through three major achievements of combinatorics: Van der Waerden's theorem on arithmetic progressions, Polya's graph enumeration formula, and Leech's 24-dimensional lattice.  Along with updated tables and references that reflect recent advances in various areas, such as error-correcting codes and combinatorial designs, the Second Edition also features:  Many new exercises to help readers understand and apply combinatorial techniques and ideas  A deeper, investigative study of combinatorics through exercises requiring the use of computer programs  Over fifty new examples, ranging in level from routine to advanced, that illustrate important combinatorial concepts  Basic principles and theories in combinatorics as well as new and innovative results in the field  Introduction to Combinatorics, Second Edition is an ideal textbook for a one- or two-semester sequence in combinatorics, graph theory, and discrete mathematics at the upper-undergraduate level. The book is also an excellent reference for anyone interested in the various applications of elementary combinatorics"--
