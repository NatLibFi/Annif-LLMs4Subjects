A laboratory course in nanoscience and nanotechnology
"Written by a well-regarded teacher, this first-ever nanolab manual is aimed at the fast-growing number of practical nanoscience and nanotechnology modules springing up around the world. It is not a direct competitor for theoretical texts, though it does describe laboratory experiments in detail and link them to the theory to place them in context. This highly interdisciplinary book places a strong emphasis on developing skills to prepare undergraduate and graduate students from physics, chemistry, engineering, and biology backgrounds for work in nanoscience- and nanotechnology-related industries"--
