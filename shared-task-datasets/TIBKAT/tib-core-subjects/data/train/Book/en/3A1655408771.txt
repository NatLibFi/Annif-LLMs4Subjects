Riemannian Geometry
This book, based on a graduate course on Riemannian geometry and analysis on manifolds, held in Paris, covers the topics of differential manifolds, Riemannian metrics, connections, geodesics and curvature, with special emphasis on the intrinsic features of the subject. Classical results on the relations between curvature and topology are treated in detail. The book is quite self-contained, assuming of the reader only differential calculus in Euclidean space. It contains numerous exercises with full solutions and a series of detailed examples which are picked up repeatedly to illustrate each new definition or property introduced. For this third edition, some topics about the geodesic flow and Lorentzian geometry have been added and worked out in the same spirit
