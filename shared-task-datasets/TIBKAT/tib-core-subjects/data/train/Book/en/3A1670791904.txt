Natural language understanding and cognitive robotics
"Describes the method for robots to acquire human-like traits of natural language understanding (NLU), the core of which is mental image directed semantic theory (MIDST). It is based on the hypothesis that NLU by humans is essentially processing of mental image associated with natural language expressions. MIDST is intended to model omnisensory mental image in humans and provide a knowledge representation system for integrative management of knowledge subjective to cognitive mechanisms of intelligent entities, e.g. humans and robots, with a systematic scheme for symbol-grounding. The book is aimed at researchers and students interested in artificial intelligence, robotics, or cognitive science. Based on philosophical considerations, this will also have an appeal in linguistics, psychology, ontology, geography, and cartography"--
