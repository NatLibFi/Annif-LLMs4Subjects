Nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics : first book to link these two emerging fields of research
For the first time, international scientists describe the advances in genetics and nutrition by combining methods of molecular biology with those of functional genetics, also known as systems biology. This book provides the latest data on genetic variation and dietary response, nutrients and gene expression, and the contribution molecular biology has given to systems biology. It also includes a comprehensive critique of genetic association studies in defining the risk of chronic diseases and concludes that molecular diagnostic tests will eventually affect every area of health care from individual risk prediction, early diagnosis of disease, and determination of optimal treatment regimens, to monitoring treatment effectiveness. The appendix contains an extensive glossary of the newly emerging terminology, as well as recommendations for genetic screening.This publication is an essential tool for the future work of all physicians, nutritionists, dietitians, geneticists, physiologists, molecular biologists, anthropologists, food technologists, policy makers, ethicists and educators
