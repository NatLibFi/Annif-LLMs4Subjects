Genomics approach to bioremediation : principles, tools, and emerging technologies
"This book presents an up-to-date and comprehensive collection of information on valuable insights into different cutting-edge genomics technologies along with advanced next-generation sequencing technologies as well as bioinformatics tools, which led to a better understanding of microbial communities and their adaptability to a wide range of contaminants and underlying their mechanisms in bioremediation and biodegradation of environmental pollutants that are polluted with various inorganic, metals, organometallic, and organic hydrocarbons. In addition, this edited volume provides critical insight into of potent microbial communities endowed with unique functional attributes through their unique metabolism catalyzed by signature' enzymes and degradation pathways. Step-by-step descriptions are provided of various microbial metabolic pathways of degradation and biotransformation of environmental contaminants by numerous illustrations which make the information easier to understand for the readers. Each chapter is devoted to selected examples of microbial bioremediation supported by tables, and an extensive list of references for readers interested in learning further details about the subject matter. This book is essential to researchers, academics, scientists, engineers, government officers, process managers, and practicing professionals in the areas of microbial degradation, omics, bioremediation, phytoremediation, and related areas"--
