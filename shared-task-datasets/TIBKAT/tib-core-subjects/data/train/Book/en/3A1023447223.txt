Regional development and proximity relations
'Proximity is a concept increasingly used in the international literature on clusters, knowledge transfers and innovation, as well as in the policies that support these processes. In Regional Development and Proximity Relations, André Torre and Frédéric Wallet have collected contributions from some of the world's leading regional scientists to highlight these topics. They have done a good job.' (Hans Westlund, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden). -- 'Over the past decades, proximity has become a leading paradigm in economic geography and beyond. This landmark book marks the latest developments in proximity research, bringing together the leading scholars in the field.' (Koen Frenken, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands). -- The notion of proximity is increasing in popularity in economic and geographic literature, and is now commonly used by scholars in regional science and spatial economics. Few academic works, however, have explored the link between regional development and proximity relations. This comprehensive book redresses the balance with its assessment of the role of, and obstacles caused by, proximity relations in regional development processes. The expert contributors illustrate that the value of integrating proximity into the regional development analysis framework is due its plasticity and ability to draw connections between spatial, economic and social dimensions. Possible changes for regional and territorial policies are also an outcome of this integration. These areas are addressed via four main paradigms: Proximity and regional development, Spatial innovation processes, Networks and proximity relations, Place-based strategies and proximity relations. Students, academics, researchers and regional development practitioners with an interest in regional proximity will find this highly original book to be an illuminating read.
