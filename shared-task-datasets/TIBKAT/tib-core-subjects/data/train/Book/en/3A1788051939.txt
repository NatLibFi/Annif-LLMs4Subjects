How to be creative : a practical guide for the mathematical sciences
Do you know precisely how your creativity happens? Can you coach other people to be more creative? This book is a how-to guide focused on helping you to generate great--or even greater--ideas by showing you "how to do it" and how to teach others how to do it, too. Written specifically for those working in the mathematical sciences, this book provides a proven process for idea generation and a wide range of mathematically oriented examples. Building on the authors' many years of experience running creativity workshops, How to Be Creative: A Practical Guide for the Mathematical Sciences gives a six-step process for generating great ideas that can be used by individuals or groups, provides examples demonstrating how these concepts have been or might be used in practice in the mathematical sciences, presents seven tried and tested briefs that can be used at creativity workshops, and offers guidance on how to evaluate ideas wisely and how to build a team culture in which creativity flourishes.
