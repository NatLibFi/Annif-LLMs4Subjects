The Physics of Semiconductors : An Introduction Including Nanophysics and Applications
The Physics of Semiconductors contains ample material for a comprehensive upper-level undergraduate or beginning graduate course, guiding readers to the point where they can choose a special topic and begin supervised research. The textbook provides a balance between essential aspects of solid-state and semiconductor physics, on the one hand, and the principles of various semiconductor devices and their applications in electronic and photonic devices, on the other. It highlights many practical aspects of semiconductors such as alloys, strain, heterostructures, nanostructures, that are necessary in modern semiconductor research but typically omitted in textbooks. Coverage also includes additional advanced topics, such as Bragg mirrors, resonators, polarized and magnetic semiconductors. The text derives explicit formulas for many results to support better understanding of the topics. The Physics of Semiconductors requires little or no prior knowledge of solid-state physics and evolved from a highly regarded two-semester course. In the second edition many topics are extended and treated in more depth. e.g. dopant diffusion, nanowires, recombination in organic semiconductors, multi-junction solar cells, quantum dot and organic LEDs, thin film transistors, carbon-based nanostructures and transparent conductive oxides.  Professor Dr. Marius Grundman studied physics at the Technical University of Berlin. He worked on the epitaxy and characterization of electronic and optical properties of semiconductor heterostructures and nanostructures as well as devices made from them. He has been Professor of Experimental Physics at the University of Leipzig since 2000.
