Radioactivity Radionuclides Radiation : Including the Universal Nuclide Chart on CD-ROM
RADIOACTIVITY  RADIONUCLIDES  RADIATION is suitable for a general audience interested in topical environmental and human health radiological issues such as radiation exposure in aircraft, food sterilisation, nuclear medicine, radon gas, radiation dispersion devices ('dirty bombs') It leads the interested reader through the three Rs of nuclear science, to the forefront of research and developments in the field. The book is also suitable for students and professionals in the related disciplines of nuclear and radiochemistry, health physics, environmental sciences, nuclear and astrophysics. Recent developments in the areas of exotic decay modes (bound beta decay of bare or fully ionized nuclei), laser transmutation, nuclear forensics, radiation hormesis and the LNT hypothesis are covered.Atomic mass data for over 3000 nuclides from the most recent (2003) evaluation are included.
