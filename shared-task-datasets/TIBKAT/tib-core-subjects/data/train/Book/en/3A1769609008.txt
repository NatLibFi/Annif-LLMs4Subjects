Natural polymers : perspectives and applications for a green approach
"This new volume, Natural Polymers: Perspectives and Applications for a Green Approach, covers the synthesis, characterizations, and properties of natural polymeric systems, including their morphology, structure, and dynamics. It also introduces the most recent innovations and applications of natural polymers and their composites in the food, construction, electronics, biomedical, pharmaceutical, and engineering industries. Natural polymers provide a striking substitute for various applications as compared to synthetic polymers obtained from petrochemicals because they are biocompatible, biodegradable, and easily available and fall within the budget of many industries. The applications of natural polymers in pharmaceutical industries are large in comparison to synthetic polymers and are also wide in scope in the food and cosmetic industries. This new volume provides the information needed to design new applications for natural polymers. This book is a valuable reference for researchers, academicians, chemists, pharmacists, researchers, scientists, industrialists dealing with applications of natural polymers and people working in field of natural polymers"--
