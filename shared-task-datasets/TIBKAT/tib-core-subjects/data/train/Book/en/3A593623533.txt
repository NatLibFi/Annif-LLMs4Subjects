Geopolymers : structure, processing, properties and industrial applications
Annotation, A geopolymer is a solid aluminosilicate material usually formed by alkali hydroxide or alkali silicate activation of a solid precursor such as coal fly ash, calcined clay and/or metallurgical slag. Today the primary application of geopolymer technology is in the development of reduced-CO2 construction materials as an alternative to Portland-based cements. Geopolymers: structure, processing, properties and industrial applications reviews the latest research on and applications of these highly important materials. Part one discusses the synthesis and characterisation of geopolymers with chapters on topics such as fly ash chemistry and inorganic polymer cements, geopolymer precursor design, nanostructure/microstructure of metakaolin and fly ash geopolymers, and geopolymer synthesis kinetics. Part two reviews the manufacture and properties of geopolymers including accelerated ageing of geopolymers, chemical durability, engineering properties of geopolymer concrete, producing fire and heat-resistant geopolymers, utilisation of mining wastes and thermal properties of geopolymers. Part three covers applications of geopolymers with coverage of topics such as commercialisation of geopolymers for construction, as well as applications in waste management. With its distinguished editors and international team of contributors, Geopolymers: structure, processing, properties and industrial applications is a standard reference for scientists and engineers in industry and the academic sector, including practitioners in the cement and concrete industry as well as those involved in waste reduction and disposal
