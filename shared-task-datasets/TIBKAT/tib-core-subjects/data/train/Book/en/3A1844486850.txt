This applications-oriented book describes the construction of an injection mold from the ground up. Included are explanations of the individual types of molds, components, and technical terms; design procedures; techniques, tips, and tricks in the construction of an injection mold; and pros and cons of various solutions. Based on a plastic part ("bowl with lid") specially developed for this book, easily understandable text and many illustrative pictures and drawings provide the necessary knowledge for practical implementation. Step by step, the plastic part is modified and enhanced. The technologies and designs that are additionally needed for an injection mold are described by engineering drawings. Maintenance and repair, and essential manufacturing techniques are also discussed. With full-color illustrations, this third edition builds on the success of the previous ones, with significantly expanded coverage of molding simulation, including many new figures, and updates and small corrections throughout the book.
