Introduction to the physics and techniques of remote sensing
"Introduction to the Physics and Techniques of Remote Sensing was a comprehensive overview of the basics behind remote-sensing physics, techniques, and technology. This third edition builds on that and the previous edition's overview through extensive updates, additions, and expansions in content and the replacement of almost 50% of the color photographs. It discusses in detail the basic physics of wave/matter interactions techniques of remote sensing across the electromagnetic spectrum (UV, visible, infrared, mm, and microwave), and the concepts behind remote sensing techniques currently established and future ones under development. Applications of remote sensing are described for a wide spectrum of earth and planetary atmosphere and surface sciences, including geology, oceanography, resource observation and atmospheric sciences, and ionospheric studies."--
