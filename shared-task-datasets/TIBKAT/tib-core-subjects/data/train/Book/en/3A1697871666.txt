Prakash Trivedi, Ph.D. (Akron, OH), is Head of the Polymer Strategic Business Unit at Gharda Chemicals Ltd. Mumbai, India. He was Chairman of the Indian Plastics Institute from 2010 to 2012 and a Managing Committee member of Plastindia from 2011 to 2014.
Specialty thermoplastics command a US$1.2 billion market worldwide. Their use is proliferating in aerospace and transportation, medical applications including implants, electrical and electronics, textiles and general engineering, and the oil and gas industries. This book provides the key details of all specialty thermoplastics in one volume, uncluttered by information on other commodity and engineering plastics. It covers the spectrum of manufacturing methods, major properties, processing, and applications. The extraordinary resistance of specialty thermoplastics to high temperature, oxidation, hydrolysis, other chemicals, and radiation, as well as outstanding mechanical properties at temperatures from -40 to 300 Â°C make them attractive materials for challenging applications. R&D scientists will appreciate the coverage here of different polymer structures for specialty plastics and why certain structures are technically and commercially preferred. Plastics engineers and product design engineers are empowered to select the right plastic in the right grade for the desired applications. Guidance on processing of specialty plastics using injection and compression molding, extrusion, and coating is provided, together with a wealth of details regarding applications, including aspects that are not readily visible, such as touch and feel. In addition to users in industry and academic research, this work is also applicable as a textbook for special courses on polymer science and engineering for graduate and undergraduate students.
