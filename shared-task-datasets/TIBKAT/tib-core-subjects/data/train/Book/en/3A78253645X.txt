Urban ecology : an introduction
"Urban Ecology: An Introduction seeks to open the reader's mind and eyes to the way in which nature permeates everyday urban living, and how it has to be understood, cared for, and managed to make our towns and cities healthier places in which to live and more resilient to environmental and other changes. The authors examine how contact with nature can improve our health, the air we breathe, the waters we use and our enjoyment of parks and gardens. The texts sets out the science that underlies the changing natural scene and the management tools used to ensure that cities become both capable of adapting to climate change and more beautiful and more resilient places in which to live. The work begins with a discussion of the nature of urban places and the role of nature in towns and cities.

In Part 2 the authors set out the physical and chemical components of urban ecosystems and ecological processes, including urban weather and climate, urban geomorphology and soils"--
