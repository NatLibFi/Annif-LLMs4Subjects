Torre Reforma
LBR & A Arquitectos, founded in 1976 by L. Benjamín Romano, designs and builds architectural projects based on four main axes: sustainable architecture, architectural structuring, high technology and artistic integration. The Reforma Tower was recognized in 2018 as the best skyscraper in the world for the International Highrise Award. With 57 floors and 244 meters high, it was built on the corner of Paseo de la Reforma and Río Elba, it shares the site with a house dating from 1929 that was displaced from the land to build the foundation of the tower and then returned to its original site. There are two large walls of apparent concrete, displaced in square and that open towards the Chapultepec Forest. The construction process of the tower was a fundamental part of the project, which has been expressed plastically. The structural and spatial complexity of the building is the key to understanding it
