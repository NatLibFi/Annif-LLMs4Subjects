Mathematical devices for optical sciences
The Lorentz group which is the underlying scientific language for modern optics has been most notably used for understanding Einstein's special relativity. By using a simplified approach of two-by-two matrices and Wigner functions, this book provides a basic and novel approach to classical and quantum optics, making these often-difficult subjects more transparent to the reader. Written by three experts in the field, Professors Sibel Ba≈ükal, Young S. Kim, and Marilyn E Noz, this book will give the reader a comprehensive overview of how fundamental issues in quantum mechanics can be approached using various optical instruments, Wigner functions, and quantum entanglement.
