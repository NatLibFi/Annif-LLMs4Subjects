Berlin fragments : a heterography of an architectural form
Every building-and every architect-has a tale. Bringing these tales together, determining where they overlap, may give us "telling" urban tales. What can be told is what has the right to remain, to avoid oblivion, allowing words about buildings and cities to renew and increasingly enhance urban matter. This is the job conrad-bercah imposes on himself and, by extension, on the reader. It is a tale, the testimony of experience gained over time-a self-heterography of an architectural form that leads one to discover both an author and the urban scenario within which the tale takes place: Berlin.00Transl. from Italian: Frammenti berlinesi (2018), ISBN 9788862423182
