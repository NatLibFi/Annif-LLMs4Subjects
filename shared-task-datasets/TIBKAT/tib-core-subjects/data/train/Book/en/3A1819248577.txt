Artificial neural network-based optimized design of reinforced concrete structures
"Artificial Neural Network-based Optimized Design of Reinforced Concrete Structures introduces AI-based Lagrange optimization techniques that can enable more rational engineering decisions for concrete structures, while conforming to codes of practice. It shows how objective functions including cost, CO2 emissions, and structural weight of concrete structures are optimized either separately or simultaneously while satisfying constraining design conditions using an ANN-based Hong-Lagrange method. Any design target can be adopted as an objective function. Many optimized design examples are verified by both conventional structural calculations and big datasets. The book suits undergraduate and graduate students who have a good understanding of college-level calculus and will be especially beneficial to engineers and contractors who seek to optimize concrete structures"
