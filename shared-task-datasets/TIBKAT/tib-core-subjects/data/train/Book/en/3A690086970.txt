Crystals and crystallinity in polymers : diffraction analysis of ordered and disordered crystals
"This book provides a comprehensive explanation and overview of the complex topic of polymer crystallography in a way that enables readers to evaluate polymer crystallization data and determine which methods to utilize for particular cases"--
"Polymeric crystals are more complex in nature than other materials' crystal structures due to significant structural disorder present. In fact, they actually exist in a semicrystalline state where the crystals are embedded in an amorphous phase to create a highly interconnected network. Presenting an in-depth and current overview of polymer crystals, Crystals and Crystallinity in Polymers provides researchers, engineers, and graduate students with guidelines to help select the proper crystallization method, evaluate polymer crystallization data, determine which methods to utilize for particular cases, and understand the different analytical techniques utilized"--
