Integrated vehicle health management : the technology
"This is the third book SAE has published on IVHM. The scope of this book was to return to the, now familiar, taxonomy and investigate each of the broad theme areas of IVHM in more detail. The aim was to provide a bridge between the introduction to the subject, covered in the first book, and technical papers describing new work. This book is basically in three parts: the technology chapters (2-9), then the Applications chapter (10), before the Emerging Technologies (11). The contributions made in these sections are now summarized in this order, before drawing the book to its conclusion"-Provided by publisher
