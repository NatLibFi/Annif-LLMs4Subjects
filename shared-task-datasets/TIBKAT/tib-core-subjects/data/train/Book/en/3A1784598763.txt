Extremophiles : general and plant biomass based biorefinery
"Extemophiles are microorganisms which can thrive in extreme conditions such as either high or low temperature, pressure, salt concentration, alkaline/acidic, etc. There extremophiles may be harnessed for their applications in extreme conditions where normal microorganisms fail to survive. Biorefinery is an integration of processes for generating more than one product to make the process economically and environmentally sustainable. Extremophiles may play an important role in biorefining of waste materials such as lignocellulosic wastes, industrial wastes, biomedical wastes, etc. Most of these wastes need extreme conditions for their processing. Moreover, the extremophiles have the capability to act on different wastes efficiently under extreme conditions. This book covers the applications of extremophiles for generating value-added products from waste materials in a biorefinery manner"--
