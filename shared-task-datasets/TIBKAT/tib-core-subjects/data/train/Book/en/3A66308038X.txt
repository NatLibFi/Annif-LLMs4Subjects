Guide to HTML, JavaScript and PHP : for scientists and engineers
"HTML, JavaScript, and PHP are Web-based programming languages that can be used to solve computational problems in an online environment. This easy-to-read, informative guide/reference will enable readers to quickly develop a working knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and PHP - a valuable skill for any scientist or engineer. Updating and expanding upon the author's previous Springer titles, An Introduction to HTML and JavaScript and An Introduction to PHP, the text emphasizes a hands-on approach to learning and makes extensive use of examples throughout the book. A detailed science, engineering, or mathematics background is not required to understand the material, making the book ideally suitable for self-study or an introductory course in programming." -- Publisher's description
