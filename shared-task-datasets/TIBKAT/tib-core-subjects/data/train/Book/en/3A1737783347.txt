Cognitive satellite system
Cognitive satellite system -- Environmental characteristics -- Spectrum sensing of satellite system -- Estimation of the environmental state of satellite system -- Satellite communication system -- Information planning and processing -- Intelligence and decision-making of space system -- Typical application scenarios.
"How can cognition, a concept traditionally associated with the human brain, be applied to satellite systems? For the first time, cognitive system meanings and models are applied to the uncertain environmental processes of satellite systems. The authors of this book go beyond defining "cognitive satellite systems" to design a cognitive satellite communication system architecture with satellite-to-ground coordination, which has uses in emergency response spacecraft and prediction technology. In this book, the optimal utilization of cognitive satellite system resources is discussed in four aspects: (1) Individual utilization rate of cognitive satellite systems (2) Synchronization of spatial information interaction (3) Intelligence of cognitive satellite systems (4) Improving the robustness of the system"--Publisher's website
