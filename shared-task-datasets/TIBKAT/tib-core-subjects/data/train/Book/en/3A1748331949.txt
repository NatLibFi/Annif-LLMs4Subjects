Designing bipolar transistor radio frequency integrated circuits
If you're looking for an in-depth and up-to-date understanding bipolar transistor RFIC design, this practical resource is a smart choice. Unlike most books on the market that focus on GaAs MESFET or silicon CMOS process technology, this unique volume is dedicated exclusively to RFIC designs based on bipolar technology. Until now, critical GaAs HBT and SiGe HBT process technologies have been largely neglected in reference books. This book fills this gap, offering you a detailed treatment of this increasingly important topic. You discover a wide range of circuit topologies that are optimized for maximum performance with bipolar devices. From discussions of key applications (Bluetooth, UWB, GPS, WiMax) and architectures ... to in-depth coverage of fabrication technologies and amplifier design ... to a look at performance tradeoffs and production costs, this book arms you with complete design know-how for your challenging work in the field
