Assessment, evaluation, and repair of concrete, steel, and offshore structures
"Due to age and increased loading on buildings, structural assessment and repair is routinely required with accuracy and professionalism. Our target is to have a building durable along its life time. The typical causes of structural failure and their mechanisms will be presented in this book for all types of structure, and further addressed by numerous case studies and engineering calculations. The up-to-date methods for evaluation and assessment the existing structure will be discussed. It will also examine different codes related to structural assessment and will present project management strategies from the feasibility stage through operations and maintenance"--
