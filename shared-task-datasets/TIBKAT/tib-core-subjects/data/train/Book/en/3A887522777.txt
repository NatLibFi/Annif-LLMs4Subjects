Quantum optics for experimentalists
"This book on quantum optics is from the point of view of an experimentalist. It approaches the theory of quantum optics with the language of optical modes of classical wave theory, with which experimentalists are most familiar. This approach makes the transition easy from classical optics to quantum optics. The emphasis on the multimode description of an optical system is more realistic than in most quantum optics textbooks. After the theoretical part, the book goes directly to the two most basic experimental techniques in quantum optics and establishes the connection between the experiments and the theory. The applications include some key quantum optics experiments, and a few more current interests that deal with quantum correlation and entanglement, quantum noise in phase measurement and amplification, and quantum state measurement"--
