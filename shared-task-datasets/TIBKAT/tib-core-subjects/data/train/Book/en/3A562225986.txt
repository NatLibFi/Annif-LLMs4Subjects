Food engineering : integrated approaches
Food Engineering: Integrated Approachespresents a significant and up-to-date review of various integrated approaches to food engineering. Distinguished food engineers and food scientists from key institutions worldwide have contributed chapters that provide a deep analysis of their particular subjects, at the same time, each topic is framed within the context of this integrated approach. The premise of this work is that a comprehensive approach to food engineering requires a thorough knowledge of the subject and an effective integration of other disciplines in order to appropriately convey the state-of-the-art fundamentals and applications of the involved disciplines.  This book is mainly directed to academics, and to undergraduate and postgraduate students in food engineering and food science and technology, who will find a selection of topics ranging from applications of transport phenomena in food systems to practical implications at industrial levels. Professionals working in food engineering and food science and technology research centers and industries may also find this book useful.
