Cloud dynamics
"This second edition of Cloud Dynamics follows the structure of the first edition by addressing Earth's clouds holistically. Part I reviews basic principles of nomenclature, dynamics and thermodynamics of air motions, the microphysical processes of water drops and ice particles, and the physics of remote sensing of clouds and precipitation. Part II examines in depth the dynamics of each of the major types of clouds in the atmosphere. This two-part structure and the individual chapter topics within each part are the same as in the first edition of the book (although the chapter titles have been slightly altered to modernize them). The material of the first edition of this book is largely unchanged. However, the study of clouds is a vigorous research area. New satellites, more advanced models, and numerous field studies have advanced knowledge of all types of clouds, and I have integrated these new insights into the second edition"--
