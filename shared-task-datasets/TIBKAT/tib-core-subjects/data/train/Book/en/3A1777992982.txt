Remediation of heavy metals
The book presents recent remediation techniques for heavy metal contamination in wastewater, with a focus on recently-developed and sustainable materials such as metal oxides and their composites, two-dimensional materials, organic-inorganic ion exchange materials, nanomaterials, bagasse, and olive-oil waste chelating materials. Chapters also describe the analysis of heavy metals, membranes for water treatment, sources and impact of heavy metals and opportunities and challenges in heavy metal remediation.
