Role-based access control
This newly revised edition of the Artech House bestseller, Role-Based Access Control, offers you the very latest details on this sophisticated security model aimed at reducing the cost and complexity of security administration for large networked applications. The second edition provides more comprehensive and updated coverage of access control models, new RBAC standards, new in-depth case studies and discussions on role engineering and the design of role-based systems. The book shows you how RBAC simplifies security administration by using roles, hierarchies, and constraints to manage the review and control of organizational privileges. Moreover, it explains how RBAC makes it possible to specify many types of enterprise security policies. This unique resource covers all facets of RBAC, from its solid model-theoretic foundations to its implementation within commercial products. You learn how to use RBAC to emulate other access control models and find frameworks and tools for administering RBAC. Research prototypes that have incorporated RBAC into various classes of software like WFMS, Web server, OS (Unix) and Java (JEE) are reviewed. Products implementing RBAC features such as relational DBMS and Enterprise Security Administration (ESA) systems are described to serve as a guide to the state of practice of RBAC
