Topics in Coding Theory : In honour of Lars H. Zetterberg
This book is written in honour of Professor Lars H. Zetterberg, who is the pioneer of information and coding theory in Sweden, and his direct and indirect influence on the evaluation in Sweden of these topics is quite considerable. The various contributions give overviews of different topics within the area of coding theory. Each covers a speciality where - in most cases - good overviews are not easily available. The five papers together provide a good and representative sample of Swedish research activities within the field of coding theory
