Hans von Ohain : elegance in flight
This is the first book ever to chronicle the life and work of Dr. Hans von Ohain, the brilliant physicist who assisted with the invention of the turbojet engine. The book follows him from childhood through his education, the first turbojet development, and his work at the Heinkel Company, where his dream of "elegance of flight" was ultimately realized with the flight of the Heinkel He 178, powered by the turbojet engine he created. It also presents his immigration to the United States and his career with the United States Air Force, whereupon he became one of the top scientists in the field of advanced propulsion.
