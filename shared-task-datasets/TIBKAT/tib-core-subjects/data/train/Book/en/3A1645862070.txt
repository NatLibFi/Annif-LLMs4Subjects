Taking the reader through the history of industrial waste treatment and directing them toward a new path of best practice, this book illustrates how current treatment techniques are affected by regulatory and economic constraints, scientific knowledge and tolerances. This book provides the reader with the basis for a more effective method of waste treatment which is sustainable and supportive of industrial improvements. Overall, it provides valuable information for planners, industrial, civil and environmental engineers and government officials for a better understanding of current practices and regulatory history and how these factors relate to the ability to complete environmental solutions to industrial waste problems. * Provides environmental history from a professional/technical point-of-view as a basis for total solutions engineering * Includes sustainable practice necessary for the 21st Century * Thoroughly explores industry and environmental regulations over the past 150 years
