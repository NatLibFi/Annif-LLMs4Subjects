Towards a robotic architecture
The past decade's surge towards more computationally defined building systems and highly adaptable open-source design software has left the field ripe for the integration of robotics whether through large-scale building fabrication or through more intelligent/adaptive building systems. Through this surge, architecture has not only been greatly influenced by these emerging technologies, but has also begun influencing other disciplines in unexpected ways. The purpose of this book is to provide systems of classification, categorisation, and taxonomies of robotics in architecture so that a more systematic and holistic body of work could take place while addressing the multifarious aspects of possible research and production
