Magnesium alloys as degradable biomaterials
"Magnesium Alloys as Degradable Biomaterials provides a comprehensive review of the biomedical applications of biodegradable magnesium and its alloys. Magnesium has seen increasing use in orthopedic and cardiovascular applications over the last decade, particularly for coronary stents and bone implants. The book discusses the basic concepts of biodegradation mechanisms as well as strategies to control biodegradation mode and rate, microstructure, mechanical properties, corrosion resistance to body fluid, and in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility."--
