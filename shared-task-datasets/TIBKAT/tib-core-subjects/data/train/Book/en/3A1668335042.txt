Persona studies : an introduction
"This book represents a culmination of research into persona as well as launching point for others to take these ideas and explore many other constructions of public identity. Although certainly not a requirement of reading this book, it makes sense to get the background fully in place by working through the concepts, new terminology, and ultimately the methods. This background is the material that will be nuanced as this field advances and we are encouraging all interested readers and researchers to engage and debate with our approaches on this strategic and now pandemic online identity we call persona. To further facilitate this exchange and research collaboration as well as recognise that we are building a field of study, the end of our book is not just the concluding chapter, but also a glossary of the terms we have generated as well as repurposed for our investigation of Persona Studies. You will also notice that words that are in the glossary are highlighted in their first usage in the text to help you navigate effectively through our work on persona and its contemporary transformations"--
