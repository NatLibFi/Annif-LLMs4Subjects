Theoretical Concepts of X-Ray Nanoscale Analysis : Theory and Applications
This book provides a concise survey of modern theoretical concepts of X-ray materials analysis. The principle features of the book are: basics of X-ray scattering, interaction between X-rays and matter and new theoretical concepts of X-ray scattering. The various X-ray techniques are considered in detail: high-resolution X-ray diffraction, X-ray reflectivity, grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering and X-ray residual stress analysis. All the theoretical methods presented use the unified physical approach. This makes the book especially useful for readers learning and performing data analysis with different techniques. The theory is applicable to studies of bulk materials of all kinds, including single crystals and polycrystals as well as to surface studies under grazing incidence. The book appeals to researchers and graduate students alike
