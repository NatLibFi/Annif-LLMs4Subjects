New trends in statistical physics : Festschrift in honor of Leopoldo García-Colín's 80th birthday
"This volume presents a collection of original and peer-reviewed articles related with the applications of statistical physics dedicated to Professor Leopoldo García-Colín, in commemoration of his 80th birthday in 2010. Professor García-Colín has worked in many different fields of statistical physics, and has applied it to biological physics, solid state physics, relativity and cosmology. These are pioneering works of Prof García-Colín involved in all various fields which have their roots in Mexico. His influence is found in each of these works that cover a wide range of topics including thermodynamics, statistical mechanics and kinetic theory applied to biological systems, cosmology and condensed matter, among others. Papers contributed by important experts in the field, such as J Lebowitz, as well as the latest classical applications of statistical physics can be found in this volume."--P. [4] of cover
