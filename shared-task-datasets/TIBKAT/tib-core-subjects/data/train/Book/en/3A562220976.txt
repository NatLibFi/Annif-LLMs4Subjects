Mycotoxins in foodstuffs
Due to the serious spoilage and health issues the presence of mycotoxins can cause, it's imperative that the food industry has a basic understanding fungi and their corresponding mycotoxins. An indispensable resource, &quot;Mycotoxins in Foodstuffs&quot; gives an in-depth overview by listing the degree of contamination, concentration and country of origin/detection for each case of mycotoxin contamination for each commodity. In addition, the book shows whether or not food is predisposed for mycotoxin contamination
