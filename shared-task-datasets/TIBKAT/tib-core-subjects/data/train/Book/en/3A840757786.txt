2D materials for nanoelectronics
"Major developments in the semiconductor industry are on the horizon through the use of 2D materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides for integrated circuits. This book provides the first comprehensive treatment of the field with an emphasis on applications in nanoelectronic devices. Chapters are divided by the three major families of such materials, covering graphene for analog and photonic applications, MoS2 (molybdenum disulfide) for logic applications and novel materials such as silicene, germanene, stanene and phosphorene"--
