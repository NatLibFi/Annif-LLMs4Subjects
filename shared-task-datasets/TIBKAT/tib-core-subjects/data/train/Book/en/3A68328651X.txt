Electrokinetic particle transport in micro-/nanofluidics : direct numerical simulation analysis
"This text, which was developed in part from some of the authors' most recent journal papers, includes a brief introduction of micro/nano-fluidics and a mini review of the basic theories of DC-electrokinetics. It may serve as a useful reference for researchers and graduate students in the micro/nano-fluidics community, who might have limited experience and/or time in developing their own DNS codes to explore the active, growing, and interdisciplinary field of research. Readers could modify and extend the mathematical models, COMSOL files and MATLAB codes in this book for their own research"--
