Aktivhaus - the reference work : from Passivhaus to energy-plus house
"The Aktivhaus is a logical development of existing building standards. As far as possible, it uses renewable energy from the sun and wind to satisfy energy demands. The basic ideas of the Aktivhaus are described in detail in this work and serve as a planning guide for all aspects of Aktivhaus construction."--
