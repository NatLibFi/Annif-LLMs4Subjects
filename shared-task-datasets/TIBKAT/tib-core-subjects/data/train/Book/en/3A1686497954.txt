Sequential change detection and hypothesis testing : general non-i.i.d. stochastic models and asymptotically optimal rules
Sequential hypothesis testing in multiple data streams -- Sequential detection of changes : changepoint models, performance metrics and optimality criteria -- Bayesian quickest change detection in a single population -- Nearly optimal pointwise and minimax change detection in a single population -- Change detection rules optimal for the maximal detection probability criterion -- Quickest change detection in multiple streams -- Joint changepoint detection and identification -- Applications.
"Statistical methods for sequential hypothesis testing and changepoint detection have applications across many fields. This book presents an overview of methodology in these related areas, providing a synthesis of research from the last few decades"--
