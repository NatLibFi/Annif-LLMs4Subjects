Time-domain methods for microwave structures : analysis and design
"This book thoroughly explains the application of Finite-difference Time-domain (FDTD) method to microwave structures. Providing the reader with the most comprehensive collection of material available on this subject, each chapter is composed of an introductory section that addresses the theoretical background of a specific component of the FDTD method and a collection of reprints of the most important papers. Each chapter is contributed by a well-known authority in the field and contains illustrative examples. Topics covered include: * The numerical issues * Geometry description of microwave structures * Methods to reduce the requirements for excessive computational resources * Parallel and vector processing All the topics covered in this book are essential components for successful application of the FDTD method to realistic structures
