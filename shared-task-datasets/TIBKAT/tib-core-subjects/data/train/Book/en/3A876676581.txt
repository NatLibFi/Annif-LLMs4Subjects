Capacitive sensors : design and applications
Capacitive sensors produce spectacular resolution of movement to one part in 10-10 meters and maintain exceptional long-term stability in hostile environments. They are increasingly used for a variety of jobs in consumer and industrial equipment, including wall stud sensors, keypads, lamp dimmers, micrometers, calipers, rotation encoders, and more. The most focused, authoritative book available in the field, Capacitive Sensors brings you complete information on the research, design, and production of capacitive sensors. This all-in-one source provides detailed, comprehensive coverage of key topics, including underlying theory, electrode configuration, and practical circuits. In addition, you'll find reviews of a number of tested systems never before published. Capacitive Sensors is a must-have for product designers and mechanical and electrical engineers interested in using this fast-developing technology to get top price and performance advantages
