Nakamoto Consensus is discussed in both practical and theoretical terms. This volume: Describes attacks and exploits with mathematical justifications, including selfish mining. Identifies common assumptions such as the Market Fragility Hypothesis, establishing a framework for analyzing incentives to attack. Outlines the block reward schedule and economics of ASIC mining. Discusses how adoption by institutions would fundamentally change the security model. Analyzes incentives for double-spend and sabotage attacks via stock-flow models.
