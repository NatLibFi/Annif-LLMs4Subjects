Computer graphics : theory and practice
"Computer Graphics: Theory and Practice provides complete and integrated coverage of the subject, including geometric modeling, graphics interface, and visualization. It focuses on conceptual aspects of computer graphics, covering fundamental mathematical models as well as the inherent problems encountered in the implementation of the models. The approach assumes only a fundamental knowledge of calculus and linear algebra and provides the basis for an introductory course. The text offers a global conceptual view of the field and an understanding of its main problems. For each problem, solution strategies are compared and presented in algorithmic form and complete working implementations are provided in the C language. The complete C source code for the implementation of all the algorithms can be accessed from the books website. Together, the book and electronic portion enable readers to understand and practice with the basic techniques involved in the implementation of a 3D graphics system"--
