Introduction to optics and optical imaging
"With a focus on providing a working knowledge of optical systems and their principles of operation, this book employs today's most important methods for optical analysis: geometrical ray optics, raction integral techniques, and the Abbe plane wave spectrum technique. This thoughtfully organized text uses fundamental electromagnetics as its underlying framework, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of both classical and modern optics theory. Understanding the theories presented in this book is an essential step for readers who want to produce effective design using current software. The author has carefully incorporated practical mathematics throughoutfor readers who want to further their analytical understanding of the material. INTRODUCTION TO OPTICS AND OPTICAL IMAGING will be an indispensable guide for advanced undergraduate engineering students, practicing engineers, and optical scientists seeking a comprehensive background in physical optics
