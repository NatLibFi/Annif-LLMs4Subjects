Ever smaller : nature's elementary particles, from the atom to the neutrino and beyond
"This book is a thorough introduction to particle physics for the reader that has not been trained in mathematics and modern physics. This book is an excellent follow up to The Atom. It follows a similar model in terms of the history and the state-of-art in the research and the future, but it does not shy away from the important equations and it is written by an expert in the field. The book starts with the early notions of the atom, describes the Standard Model of particles and interactions, and ends with the a discussion of the unknown but predicted future of particle physics. The author presents the history of the development of ideas, theories, and experiments in the field. His goal is to stimulate the reader to explore the topic, not learn random facts. He also infuses the presentation with anecdotes and stories of events and people, including his own role as a former group leader at CERN and a leading researcher on neutrino research"--
