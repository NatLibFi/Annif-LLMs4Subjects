From my vast repertoire ... : Guido Altarelli's legacy
"Guido Altarelli was a leading figure in 20th century particle physics. His scientific contributions and leadership played a key role in the development of the Standard Model of fundamental interactions, as well as the current search for new physics beyond it, both at and beyond CERN. This book is a collection of original contributions, at the cutting edge of scientific research, by some of the leading theoretical and experimental high-energy physicists currently in the field. These were inspired by Guido's ideas, whether directly or indirectly. This book is ideal for researchers looking to keep up with the latest developments in high-energy physics."--
