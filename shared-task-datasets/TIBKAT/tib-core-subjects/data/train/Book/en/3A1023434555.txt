Handbook on transport and development
This Handbook provides an extensive overview of the relationships between transport and development. With 45 chapters from leading international authors, the book is organised in three main parts: urban structure and travel; transport and spatial impacts; and wider dimensions in transport and development. The chapters each present commentary on key issues within these themes, presenting the debate on the impacts of urban structure on travel, the impacts of transport investment on development, and social and cultural change on travel. A multitude of angles are considered – leaving the reader with a comprehensive and critical understanding of the field. -- ‘The role of transport in the development of cities and regions is a topic of immense importance. The editors have brought together authors from all over the world with experience of the methods needed to assess the impact of transport and analysis of the evidence of a varied range of projects. The result is a genuine Handbook of the state of the art, but with clear insights into future problems. It is highly recommended reading for researchers, policy makers and politicians.’ (Roger Vickerman, University of Kent, UK).
