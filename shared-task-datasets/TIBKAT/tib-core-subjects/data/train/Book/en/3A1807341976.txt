Git for electronic circuit design : CAD and Version Control for electrical engineers
Work with Git and avoid dangerous mishaps in this popular, cooperative environment, even if you have no software engineering background or previous experience with Git. This book will teach you the basic principles of working cooperatively in Git with software engineers and other team members to handle issues the GUI can’t. You'll start by learning the fundamentals of the Git environment and commands. Concepts such as commits, branches, and Git organization are discussed. To avoid bogging you down with software terminology, advanced topics like setting up a Git server are ignored. Descriptions are worded to keep you away from technical specifications. Examples are presented in easily digestible text files and focus on realistic scenarios and concerns without delving into one-off or advanced, oddball situations. You can see the results without focusing on the jargon. Once you understand the basics of Git, you’ll design a digital system circuit using a computer aided design (CAD) tool. You’ll learn to collaborate effectively through Git between team members, incorporate continuous development philosophy, work with project documentation, and build a solid project structure. Finally, you'll see how Git can also ease maintenance tasks and provide CAD designers unique opportunities. You will: Work with the Git-bash environment Incorporate continuous development philosophy Discover the links between Git and modern CAD programs .
