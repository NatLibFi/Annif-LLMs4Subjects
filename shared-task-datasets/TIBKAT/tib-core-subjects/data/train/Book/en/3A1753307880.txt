Optimization with LINGO-18 : problems and applications
"The objective of this book is to present challenging and useful real-world applications based on decision-making problems in various fields. The modelling of such problems is provided concisely, although all topics start with a more developed resolution. This book consists of several chapters in the specified areas of linear and nonlinear optimization theory and practice. The focus of this book is to provide excellent study material to the reader's so that they enable to understand the basic concepts of optimization with its various application areas. This book provides readers with a valuable compendium of several optimization applications-based case study as a reference to understand the topics. The book chapters are written in reader-friendly manner; theoretical concepts with applications have also been discussed. Chapters of this book provides the basic understanding of various applications of optimization techniques in decision-making problems. After reading this book, the readers will be capable of understanding the theory and formulations of decision-making problems and their solution obtained by appropriate optimization techniques"--
