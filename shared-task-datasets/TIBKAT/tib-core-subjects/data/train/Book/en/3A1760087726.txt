Game theory basics
"This book is an introduction to the mathematics of non-cooperative game theory. Each concept is explained in detail, starting from a main example, with a slowpaced proof of each theorem. The book has been designed and tested for self-study, and as an undergraduate course text with core chapters and optional chapters for different audiences. It has been developed over 15 years for a one-semester course on game theory at the London School of Economics and the distance learning program of the University of London, attended each year by about 200 third-year students in mathematics, economics, management, and other degrees. After studying this book, a student who started from first-year mathematics (the basics of linear algebra, analysis, and probability) will have a solid understanding of the most important concepts and theorems of non-cooperative game theory."
