Relativistic density functional for nuclear structure
"This book is aimed to provide a detailed introduction to the state-of-the-art covariant density functional theory, which follows the Lorentz invariance from the very beginning and is able to describe nuclear many-body quantum systems microscopically and self-consistently. Covariant density functional theory has been introduced in nuclear physics in the seventies and since then it has been developed and used to describe the diversity of nuclear properties and phenomena with great success. In order to provide an advanced and most updated textbook of the covariant density functional theory for graduate students and nuclear physics researchers, the book will summarize the enormous amount of material accumulated in the field of covariant density functional theory over the last few decades as well as the latest developments in this area. Moreover, the book will contain enough details for readers to follow the formalism and theoretical results, and provides exhaustive references to explore the research literature"--
