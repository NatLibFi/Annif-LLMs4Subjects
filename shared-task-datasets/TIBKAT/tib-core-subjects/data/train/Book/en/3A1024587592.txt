Additive manufacturing : applications and innovations
"There has been a lot of development in the past two decades regarding Additive Manufacturing (AM). Recent developments have been highlighted by many researchers. However, until now, there has been a limit to what is available for beginners in a step-by-step format, showcasing the different commercial AM technologies for field application. This book will help fill that gap. The book will offer case studies of commonly used AM technologies with basic numerical problems for better understanding. It will also include hybrid processes and 4D printing applications, which is not currently offered in other AM books"--
