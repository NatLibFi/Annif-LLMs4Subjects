Drilling fluids processing handbook
Introduction; Drilling Fluids; Solids Calculations; Cutpoint Curves; Tank Arrangements; Gumbo Busters; Shale Shakers; Settling Pits/Sand Traps; Degassers; Agitation; Hydrocyclones; Mud Cleaners; Centrifuge; Capture Equations; Dilution; Waste Management; Electric Motors; Centrifugal Pumps; Solids Control During Underbalanced Drilling; Smooth Operations; Glossary and Abbreviations
Describes the method and mechanical systems available to control drilled solids in drilling fluids used in oil well drilling. Explains the fundamentals of good solids control, which is financially rewarding
Written by the Shale Shaker Committee of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, originally of the American Association of Drilling Engineers, the authors of this book are some of the most well-respected names in the world for drilling. The first edition, Shale Shakers and Drilling Fluid Systems, was only on shale shakers, a very important piece of machinery on a drilling rig that removes drill cuttings. The original book has been much expanded to include many other aspects of drilling solids control, including chapters on drilling fluids, cut-point curves, mud cleaners, and many other pieces of equipment that were not covered in the original book. Written by a team of more than 20 of the world's foremost drilling experts, from such companies as Shell, Conoco, Amoco, and BP. There has never been a book that pulls together such a vast array of materials and depth of topic coverage in the area of drilling fluids. Covers quickly changing technology that updates the drilling engineer on all of the latest equipment, fluids, and techniques
