Biophysics of Human Hair : Structural, Nanomechanical, and Nanotribological Studies
This book presents the biophysics of hair. It deals with the structure of hair, its mechanical properties, the nanomechanical characterization, tensile deformation, tribological characterization, the thickness distribution and binding interactions on hair surface. It is the first book on the biophysical properties of hair
