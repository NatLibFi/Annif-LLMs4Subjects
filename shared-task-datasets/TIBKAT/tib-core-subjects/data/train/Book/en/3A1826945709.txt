Storage of LPG in large rock caverns
"This book uses actual construction projects as examples to elaborate the various technologies regarding groundwater control and airtightness guarantees for the construction of large storage rock caverns in complicated geological conditions. It introduces the latest technologies to give hands-on experience on what to do in unexpected geological conditions, and provides insight into the design, construction and operation of underground facilities. The book is hence useful in feasibility studies, developments, and other research into these underground facilities. Drawing on the experience gained from building Japan's largest LPG storage caves, Storage of LPG in Large Rock Caverns is a must-read for engineers, academics and students in the fields of rock mechanics, geotechnical engineering and related disciplines"--
