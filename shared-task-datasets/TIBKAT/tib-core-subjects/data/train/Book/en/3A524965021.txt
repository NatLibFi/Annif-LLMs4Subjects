Electroceramic-Based MEMS : Fabrication-Technology and Applications
The book is focused on the use of functional oxide and nitride thin films to increase functionality and application range of MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) in the large sense, including micro-sensors, micro-actuators, and electronic components for high frequency communications. The book covers major topics and is divided into two parts (a) applications and emerging applications, and (b) materials, fabrication technologies, and functioning issues.
