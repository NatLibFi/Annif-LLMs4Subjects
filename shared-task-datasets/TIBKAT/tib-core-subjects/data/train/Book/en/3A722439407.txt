Rock mechanics : an introduction
"An understanding of rock mechanics is fundamental to a number of civil engineering applications, including tunneling, foundation engineering, slope stabilization and petroleum engineering. Giving you coverage of all the most commonly studied areas of rock mechanics, this book is the ideal introduction to the subject. Outlining the basis of Rock Mechanics and the relevant aspects of Engineering Geology, this book is an ideal starting point for advanced undergraduates and masters students focusing on geotechnical, geological or petroleum engineering"--
