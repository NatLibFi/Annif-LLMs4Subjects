Fundamentals of quantum entanglement
Quantum entanglement (QE) is undoubtedly one of the most, if not the most, mysterious and yet most promising subjects of current physics. With applications in cryptographic space-to-space, space-to-earth, and fibre communications, in addition to teleportation and quantum computing, QE goes beyond fascination and into the pragmatic spheres of commerce and the military. This book is written by Professor Duarte, an expert in the field of quantum optics. He provides the first side-by-side description of the philosophical path and the physical path to quantum entanglement, and does so in a clear and cohesive manner. This is also the first book to describe and explain, in a transparent exposition, the interferometric derivation, Ã  la Dirac, of the ubiquitous probability amplitude for quantum entanglement. The book will be useful for optical engineers working in the field of quantum entanglement and quantum communications as well as graduate students. The book includes 29 succinct, to the point, chapters and utilizes 10 useful appendices to further detail QE. Part of Series in Coherent Sources and Applications.
