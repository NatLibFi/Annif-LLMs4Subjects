Vue.js in action
Vue.js is a lightweight frontend framework, offering easy two-way data binding, a reactive UI, and a common-sense project structure.  It uses UI patterns and modern HTML to deliver impossibly fast page loads, and silky smooth transitions-- all from a tiny code footprint.  It's a delight to develop in Vue using ordinary JavaScript and its integrated Vuex state management tool.  "Vue.js in action" is your guide to building modern web apps.  You'll start by exploring the reactive UI model while you get comfortable with Vue's unique features.  Then, you'll go deeper as you build a shopping cart with an admin interface and the ability to manage stock!  Finally, you'll extend your app, adding transitions, tests, and other key features until it's production ready
