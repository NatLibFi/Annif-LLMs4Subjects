An in depth look at virtual reality
"An In Depth Look at Virtual Reality summarizes research findings relating to virtual reality implementation for pain assessment and treatment, reviewing the literature in pediatric and adult pain care for acute and chronic conditions across several pain populations. The authors provide detailed information about the effect mechanisms of virtual reality for Parkinson's disease, and the virtual reality interventions for rehabilitation of Parkinson's disease in terms of assessment and treatment. Anxiety disorders, such as specific phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and social anxiety disorder have garnered the greatest therapeutic attention due to the advantages that applying exposure therapy techniques in a virtual reality environment has over many real-life exposure situations. Later, in order to further improve the intelligence level of a fully mechanized coal mining face and construct a stable and reliable monitoring system of hydraulic support, a monitoring method of hydraulic support in a virtual environment is proposed. In the concluding study, using meta-analysis methods and combining the basic elements of teaching system design, a quantitative analysis of 60 quasi-experimental or experimental virtual reality and augmented reality studies is conducted"--
