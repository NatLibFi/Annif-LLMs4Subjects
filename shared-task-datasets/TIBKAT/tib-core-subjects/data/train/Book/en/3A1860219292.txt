Virtual reality
Virtual reality (VR) is a powerful technology that promises to transform our lives. This balanced and interdisciplinary text blends the key components from computer graphics, perceptual psychology, human physiology, behavioral science, media studies, human-computer interaction, optical engineering, and sensing and filtering, showing how each contributes to engineering perceptual illusions. Steven LaValle draws on his unique experience as a teacher, researcher, and early founder of Oculus VR, to demonstrate how the best practices and insights from industry are built on fundamental computer science principles. Topics include media history, geometric modeling, optical systems, displays, eyes, ears, low-level perception, neuroscience of vision, graphical rendering, tracking systems, interaction mechanisms, audio, evaluating VR systems, and mitigating side effects. Students, researchers, and developers will gain a clear understanding of timeless foundations and new applications, enabling them to make innovative contributions to this growing field as scientists, engineers, business developers, and content makers
