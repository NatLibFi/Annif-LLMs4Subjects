Food emulsifiers and their applications
"The second edition of Food Emulsifiers and their Applications integrates theoretical background with practical orientation and serves as a reference on the subject. It offers practitioners an overview of the manufacture, analysis, physical properties, interactions and applications of emulsifiers used in processed food. Written for food technologists as well as R & D and product development personnel, the book begins with the design and preparation of emulsifiers (including interactions with other food ingredients), which leads in to product categories, including dairy, infant nutrition, bakery, confectionery, and margarine, followed by nutrition improvement and processing techniques."--Jacket
