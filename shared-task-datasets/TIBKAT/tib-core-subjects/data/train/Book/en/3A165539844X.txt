An Introduction to Algebraic Topology
This book is a clear exposition, with exercises, of the basic ideas of algebraic topology: homology (singular, simplicial, and cellular), homotopy groups, and cohomology rings. It is suitable for a two- semester course at the beginning graduate level, requiring as a prerequisite a knowledge of point set topology and basic algebra. Although categories and functors are introduced early in the text, excessive generality is avoided, and the author explains the geometric or analytic origins of abstract concepts as they are introduced, making this book of great value to the student
