The intimate beauty of a Japanese courtyard
As an extension of the residential space, the Japanese courtyard is unique, featuring traditional Japanese garden designs that date back centuries. This book is a collection of more than 30 residential courtyard design works by many accomplished Japanese designers, interpreted for the modern-day home. Sometimes extending beyond the classical definition of a Japanese courtyard, these green spaces pursue calm, held in nature's embrace, inviting visitors to rest in quietude and contemplate the transience of life and its simple joys to be discovered. Every rock arrangement and tree placement within, and even every scenery framed, is meticulously thought-out to achieve this. With a wealth of colour photos that present the visual beauty of these works, this book inspires designers to behold the idea of nature within a home with fresh eyes, and to let rest old methods as new perceptions are sought, building a different kind of residential space that draws on the essence of a Japanese courtyard
