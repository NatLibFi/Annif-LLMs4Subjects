Analysis of Variance in Experimental Design
As an introductory textbook on the analysis of variance or a reference for the researcher, this text stresses applications rather than theory, but gives enough theory to enable the reader to apply the methods intelligently rather than mechanically. Comprehensive, and covering the important techniques in the field, including new methods of post hoc testing. The relationships between different research designs are emphasized, and these relationships are exploited to develop general principles which are generalized to the analyses of a large number of seemingly differentdesigns. Primarily for graduate students in any field where statistics are used
