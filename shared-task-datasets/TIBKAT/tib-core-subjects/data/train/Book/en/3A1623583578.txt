Gossamer spacecraft : membrane and inflatable structures technology for space applications
The text begins with a broad overview and historical review of membrane and inflatable applications in space technology. It proceeds into theoretical discussion of mechanics and physics of membrane structures; chemical and processing issues related to membrane materials; developments in deployment; and ground testing. The book then proceeds into current applications and case studies. Applications for membrane and inflatable structures in space include lunar and planetary habitats, RF reflectors and waveguides, optical and IR imaging, solar concentrators for solar power and propulsion, sun shades, solar sails, and many others.
