Mine waste management in China : recent development
Traditional Treatment of Mine Waste -- Solutions for Surface Disposal of Mine Tailings -- Case Study of Surface Consolidated Tailings Stockpile -- Case Study of Surface Cemented Tailings Discharge -- Solutions for Underground Placement of Mine Tailings -- Properties of Cemented Tailings Backfill -- Case Study of Cemented Tailings Backfill -- Solutions for Underground Placement of Coal Mine Waste -- Properties of Cemented Coal Gangue-Fly Ash Backfill -- Case Study of Cemented Coal Gangue-Fly Ash Backfill
This book introduces recent development of technologies for mine waste management in China. For hard rock mines, the main mine wastes are tailings, and the tailings can be disposed above-ground and/or underground. The technology of consolidated tailings stockpile (CTS) that disposes tailings above-ground is introduced, and the application of this technology is also demonstrated. Besides, the technology of cemented tailings (or paste) backfill (CTB or CPB) which deals with tailings underground is also discussed. The properties of CTB materials and the utilization of CTB technology are described and analyzed. For coal mines, the main mine wastes are coal gangue and fly ash. The technology of cemented coal gangue-fly ash backfill (CGFB) that manages coal mine waste underground is presented. The THMC coupling properties of CGFB materials are investigated, which can contribute to a better design of stable, durable and environmentally friendly CGFB mixtures. The application of CGFB technology in a coal mine is also presented. This book, which systematically reviews and discusses the development of mine waste management technologies in China, is expected to provide readers comprehensive information about mine waste management
