Mathematics, Computer Science and Logic - A Never Ending Story : The Bruno Buchberger Festschrift
This book presents four mathematical essays which explore the foundations of mathematics and related topics ranging from philosophy and logic to modern computer mathematics. While connected to the historical evolution of these concepts, the essays place strong emphasis on developments still to come. The book originated in a 2002 symposium celebrating the work of Bruno Buchberger, Professor of Computer Mathematics at Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria, on the occasion of his 60th birthday. Among many other accomplishments, Professor Buchberger in 1985 was the founding editor of the Journal of Symbolic Computation; the founder of the Research Institute for Symbolic Computation (RISC) and its chairman from 1987-2000; the founder in 1990 of the Softwarepark Hagenberg, Austria, and since then its director. More than a decade in the making, Mathematics, Computer Science and Logic - A Never Ending Story includes essays by leading authorities, on such topics as mathematical foundations from the perspective of computer verification; a symbolic-computational philosophy and methodology for mathematics; the role of logic and algebra in software engineering; and new directions in the foundations of mathematics. These inspiring essays invite general, mathematically interested readers to share state-of-the-art ideas which advance the never ending story of mathematics, computer science and logic. Mathematics, Computer Science and Logic - A Never Ending Story is edited by Professor Peter Paule, Bruno Buchbergerâ€™s successor as director of the Research Institute for Symbolic Computation.
