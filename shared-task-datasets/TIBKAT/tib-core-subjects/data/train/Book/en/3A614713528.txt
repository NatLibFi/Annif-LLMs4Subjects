Shale engineering : mechanics and mechanisms
"This book on shale engineering addresses the engineering aspects and parameters related to chemical, mechanical and thermal properties, and integrates them into models that can be applied in deep engineering projects, mining and other civil works. It will serve as a reference to model designers and site engineers working with shale in the petroleum industry and other areas. Suited as a textbook for courses in petroleum, mining, geological and civil engineering"--
