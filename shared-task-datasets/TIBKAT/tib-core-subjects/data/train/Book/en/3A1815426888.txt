Mycoagroecology : integrating fungi into agroecosystems
"Fungi serve as partners of plants that can bolster disease resistance and improve crop yields while reducing the need for artificial inputs; as pests that can cause significant diseases of major crops; and as valuable products with nutrient content and low input requirements. This new textbook on mycoagroecology introduces basic concepts of ecology, mycology, and systems of agriculture. It combines this information into an understanding of mycoagroecology, highlighting various roles of fungi in agriculture. This textbook is for students in plants sciences and agriculture departments and contains beautiful color illustrations throughout"--
