Cloud and IoT-based vehicular ad hoc networks
"Optimizing the traffic management operations is a big challenge due to massive global increase in vehicles numbers, traffic congestion and road accidents. This book describes the state-of-the-art of the recent developments of Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing-based concepts have been introduced to improve Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANET) with advanced cellular networks such as 5G networks and vehicular cloud concepts. 5G cellular networks provide consistent, faster and more reliable connections within the vehicular mobile nodes. By 2030, 5G networks will deliver the virtual reality content in VANET which will support vehicle navigation with real time communications capabilities, improving road safety and enhance passenger comfort"--
