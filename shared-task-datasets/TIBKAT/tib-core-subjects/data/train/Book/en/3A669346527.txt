Vortex, Molecular Spin and Nanovorticity : An Introduction
Annotation, This review of the physics of vortices covers the effects of molecular spin on the dynamics of molecular nano-confined fluids, including macroscopic and internal rotation, electrical polarization and other changes in the physical properties of the fluid
The subject of this book is the physics of vortices. A detailed analysis of the dynamics of vortices will be presented. The important topics of vorticity and molecular spin will be dealt with, including the electromagnetic analogy and quantization in superfluids. The effect of molecular spin on the dynamics of molecular nano-confined fluids using the extended Navier-Stokes equations will also be covered -especially important to the theory and applicability of nanofluidics and associated devices. The nanoscale boundary layer and nanoscale vortex core are regions of intense vorticity (molecular
