Program development in computational logic : a decade of research advances in logic-based program development
This book presents a unique state-of-the-art survey on progress in the field of program development making use of computational logic. The motivating idea behind this approach is the belief that declarative paradigms such as logic programming are better suited to program development tasks than traditional non-declarative ones such as imperative paradigms. Closely related to the international workshop and symposium series Logic Program Synthesis and Transformation, later on renamed Program Development in Computational logic, this book presents 15 carefully selected and reviewed articles and surveys by leading researchers in the area. The contributions are grouped in sections on specification and synthesis, semantics, analysis, transformation and specialization, termination, and systems
