Antennas : from theory to practice
"Building upon the success of the first edition, this book covers the important and timely issues involving modern practical antenna design and theory. Developed specifically for university students, engineers and designers who work with radio frequency (RF) engineering, radar and radio communications. The book will cover a) the basics of transmission lines, radiowaves and propagation, and antenna theory; b) antenna analysis and design using the basic antenna theory and industrial standard design software tools; c) antenna measurement equipment, facilities and techniques; d) some special topics, such as mobile antennas and antenna diversity, wide-band and multi-band antennas, electrically small antennas, radio frequency identification (RFID) antennas, ultra-wide band (UWB) antennas, reconfigurable antennas, multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) antennas, radar antennas, smart antennas, terahertz (THz) antennas, nano antennas, and rectennas for wireless power transmission and energy harvesting. New to this edition: Adaptive Impedance Matching, Dipoles and Electrical Antennas, Loops and Magnetic Antennas, Antenna Measurement Facilities, Radiation Pattern Measurements, Efficiency Measurements, RFID Antennas, Smart Antennas, MIMO Antennas, Dielectric Resonant Antennas, On-body and In-body Antennas, THz Antennas, Nano Antennas, Radar Antennas, and Rectennas for Wireless Power transmission and Energy Harvesting"--
