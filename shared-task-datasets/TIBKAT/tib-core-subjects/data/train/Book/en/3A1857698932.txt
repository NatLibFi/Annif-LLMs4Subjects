Entropy beyond the second law : thermodynamics and statistical mechanics for equilibrium, non-equilibrium, classical, and quantum systems
Entropy Beyond the Second Law presents a coherent formulation of all aspects of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics with entropy as the unifying theme. This second edition includes the novel entropic treatment of Bose-Einstein condensation, superfluidity, and high temperature superconductivity. The new physical insights and the quantitative agreement with experimental measurement provide concrete examples of the universal approach based on entropy advocated in the book. Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics are important subjects, and students, academics, and researchers require the fundamental concepts to be clearly and concisely presented, as part of a unified whole, and the mathematical derivations to be explained with detailed physical explanation and applications.
