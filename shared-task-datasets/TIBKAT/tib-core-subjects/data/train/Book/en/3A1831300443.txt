Advanced wind turbines
"Advanced Wind Turbines provides detailed information that is of great practical importance to wind turbine practitioners from small and congested city-states, where the lack of vast land and high wind speed render the conventional wind turbine less effective. It introduces the non-conventional Darrieus and Savonius wind turbines, as well as their hybrid version, covering basic concepts, computational modelling and recent advances in experimental optimization. Floating offshore wind turbines are also discussed, and the dynamics of floating vis-Ã -vis grounded wind turbines are thoroughly expounded upon to aid practitioners in achieving more accurate performance modelling"--
