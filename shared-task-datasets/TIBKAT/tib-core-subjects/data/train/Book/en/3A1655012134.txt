Selected Topics in Nonlinear Wave Mechanics
This comprehensive reference text gives an overview of the current state of nonlinear wave mechanics in both elastic and fluid media. Consisting of self-contained chapters, the book covers new aspects on strong discontinuities (shock waves) and localized self- preserving (permanent) shapes (solitary waves and solitons). Special attention is devoted to the kinematics and dynamics of permanent waves when dissipative effects are added to the original balance between nonlinearity and dispersion. Key features include: * survey chapters written in an accessible style by leading specialists * coverage of emerging topics in the field * interdisciplinary approach integrating mathematical theory and physical applications of nonlinear waves in elastic and fluid media * treatment of the intrinsic mechanisms of propagation of different types of nonlinear waves * presentation of analytical methods for solving wave propagation problems in elastic and fluid media * user-friendly index 'Selected Topics in Nonlinear Wave Mechanics' provides readers with recent developments in the nonlinear propagation and scattering of waves in both elastic solids and liquids. The book is useful for applied mathematicians, physicists, mechanical, civil and aerospace engineers, as well as graduate students in those fields. Contributors: R.M. Axel, C.I. Christov, A.
