Block Pulse Functions and Their Applications in Control Systems
Block pulse functions have been studied and applied extensively in the past fifteen years as a basic set of functions for signal characterizations in systems science and control. Written for staff, students and engineers in industry interested in digital signal processing for system analysis and design, this book presents the principles and techniques ofblock pulse functions in a systematic and uniform manner. Readers who are interested in using these functions in their own problems can obtain an overview of the existing methods and the developing tendency of this area. In comparison with other basic functions or polynomials, block pulse functions can lead more easily to recursive computations to solve concrete problems
