Elements of Abstract Analysis
While there are many books on functional analysis, Elements of Abstract Analysis takes a very different approach. Unlike other books, it provides a comprehensive overview of the elementary concepts of analysis while preparing students to cross the threshold of functional analysis. The book is written specifically for final-year undergraduate students who should already be familiar with most of the mathematical structures discussed - for example, rings, linear spaces, and metric spaces - and with many of the principal analytical concepts - convergence, connectedness, continuity, compactness and completeness. It reviews the concepts at a slightly greater level of abstraction and enables students to understand their place within the broad framework of set-based mathematics. Carefully crafted, clearly written and precise, and with numerous exercises and examples, Elements of Abstract Analysis is a rigorous, self-contained introduction to functional analysis that will also serve as a text on abstract mathematics
