Surveying in early America : the point of beginning, an illustrated history
"In Surveying in Early America: The Point of Beginning, An Illustrated History award-winning photographer Dan Patterson and American historian Clinton Terry vividly and accurately document and retrace the steps surveyors took to map the Ohio River Valley. Patterson and Terry thoroughly create detailed and historically accurate narratives paired with exquisite and vivid photographs of these little known expeditions of our founding father. Working with Colonial re-enactors at sites in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, from Fort Normal to Colonial Williamsburg, Patterson recreates the effort of Washington and his team of surveyors to map the American wilderness and occasionally lay personal claim land to great expanses of land along the way. Through the lens of Patterson camera, readers will see what Washington saw as he worked to learn his trade and then lead expeditions into the American interior using instruments and methods employed 260 years ago"--
