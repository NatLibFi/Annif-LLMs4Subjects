Nature-based design in landscape architecture
"Nature-Based Design in Landscape Architecture showcases a range of built works designed by landscape architects from many countries of the world representing diverse environmental regions and uses. These projects demonstrate the transformative potential of a nature-based approach to landscape design. The nature-based design approach supports and encourages natural regeneration with a view to promoting sustainable environments, preserving natural resources, and mitigating the impacts of development. The projects selected for this book demonstrate the potential of nature-based landscape design to support healthy, natural and managed ecosystems, to sequester carbon, and to support the recovery of biodiversity. In addition to examples of design led environmental interventions, Nature-Based Design in Landscape Architecture the book also demonstrates the potential for nature-based design to improve people's relationship with their surroundings, encouraging them to be active participants in their communities. As such, each project featured in the book promotes a discussion around future scenarios which landscape architects can and will be engaged in, from minimizing environmental impact through sustainable design, to fostering social justice through community engagement. The book will be a welcome supplement for an undergraduate landscape architecture, survey or design studio courses, and may also be used at master's degree level either as part of a landscape architecture survey seminar or early design studio"--
