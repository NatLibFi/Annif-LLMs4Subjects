Handbook of computational statistics : concepts and methods
The "Handbook of Computational Statistics - Concepts and Methodology" ist divided into 4 parts. It begins with an overview over the field of Computational Statistics, how it emerged as a seperate discipline, how it developed along the development of hard- and software including a discussionof current active research. The second part presents several topics in the supporting field of statistical computing. Emphasis is placed on the need of fast and accurate numerical algorithms and it discusses some of the basic methodologies for transformation, data base handling and graphics treatment. The third part focusses on statistical methodology. Special attention is given to smoothing, iterative procedures, simulation and visualization of multivariate data. Finally a set of selected applications like Bioinformatics, Medical Imaging, Finance and Network Intrusion Detection highlight the usefullness of computational statistics.
