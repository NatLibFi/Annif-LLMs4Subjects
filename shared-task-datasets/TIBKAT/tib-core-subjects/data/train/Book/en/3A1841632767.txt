Discrete, finite and Lie groups : comprehensive group theory in geometry and analysis
Publisherâ€™s description: In a self contained and exhaustive work the author covers Group Theory in its multifaceted aspects, treating its conceptual foundations in a proper logical order. First discrete and finite group theory, that includes the entire chemical-physical field of crystallography is developed self consistently, followed by the structural theory of Lie Algebras with a complete exposition of the roots and Dynkin diagrams lore. A primary on Fibre-Bundles, Connections and Gauge fields, Riemannian Geometry and the theory of Homogeneous Spaces G/H is also included and systematically developed. **Group theory is applied in Physics, Chemistry, Crystallography and many further fields. **Discrete and continuous groups are relevant for probability theory, graph theory, in the theory of games and as well in economical and statistical sciences.
