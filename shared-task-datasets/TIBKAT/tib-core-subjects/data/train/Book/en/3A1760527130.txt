Mapping in architectural discourse : place-time discontinuities
"This book explores the notion of mapping in architectural discourse. Firstly locating, positioning and theorising mapping, it then makes explicit the relationship between research and design in architecture through cartography and spatial analysis. It proposes three distinct modalities: tool, operation and concept, showing how these methods lead to discursive aspects of architectural work and highlighting mapping as an instrument in developing architectural form. It emphasises the importance of place and time as fundamental terms with which to understand the role of mapping.
