The analysis and design of linear circuits
"The new edition of Thomas' Analysis and Design of Linear Circuits features more skill examples, exercises, and associated problems. Specific topics emphasized are Thevenin Equivalent Circuits, Nodal and Mesh Analysis, Op-Amp Circuits, and Phasor Analysis. Furthermore the text is enhanced with great support to developing fundamental skills by adding similar-type skill problems. New and additional features include: additions to the IM containing worked-out solutions to many exercises; updated ABET section of the IM to reflect the latest changes to Criteria 2000; improved SM to include worked-out solutions showing key intermediate steps with rationale, and where appropriate, METLAB solutions"--
