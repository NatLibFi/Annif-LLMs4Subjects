Introduction to Complex Analysis in Several Variables
This book gives a comprehensive introduction to complex analysis in several variables. While it focusses on a number of topics in complex analysis rather than trying to cover as much material as possible, references to other parts of mathematics such as functional analysis or algebras are made to help broaden the view and the understanding of the chosen topics. A major focus are extension phenomena alien to the one-dimensional theory, which are expressed in the famous Hartog's Kugelsatz, the theorem of Cartan-Thullen, and Bochner's theorem. The book aims primarily at students starting to work in the field of complex analysis in several variables and instructors preparing a course. To that end, a lot of examples and supporting exercises are provided throughout the text. This second edition includes hints and suggestions for the solution of the provided exercises, with various degrees of support.
