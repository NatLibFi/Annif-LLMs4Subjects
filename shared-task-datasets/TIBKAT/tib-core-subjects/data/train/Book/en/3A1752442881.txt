Nanotechnology in edible food packaging : food preservation practices for a sustainable future
This volume delivers a systematic overview of nanotechnology in the development of edible food packaging with noteworthy characteristics for improved food quality. It covers current research trends, history outlines, and state of the global marketin combination with associated biomaterials and synthesis strategies. The contents detail the use of various emerging bionanostructured materials such as cellulose nanostructures, chitosan nanostructures, and more.It further deliberates an in-depth discussion on various synthesis strategies and routes for the development of edible food packaging in terms of utilizing various nanosystems such as polymeric nanocomposites, nanoencapsulation systems, nanoemulsion systems, and others.Further, it also discusses experimental practices for bionanostructured and edible packaging materials to check the effectivity in terms of offering enhanced shelf life of food products. It also touches upon the socio-techno challenges in-line with developing edible packaging materials using nanotechnology for high performance packaging application. The book is an excellent guide for both the academia and industry especially early career professionals in edible food packaging sectors for selecting proper biomaterial involvingbiofillers, modifiers, cross linkers, compatibilizers and others to enhance the property of edible food packaging for targeted features.
