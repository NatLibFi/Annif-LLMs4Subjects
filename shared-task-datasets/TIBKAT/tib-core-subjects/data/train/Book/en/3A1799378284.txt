Architectural technicities : a foray into larval space
"This book poses a simple question: how is this architecture possible? As such, it focuses on the very conditions of architectural production. To put it in the terms of philosopher Gilbert Simondon, its central concern is how architecture individuates and how can one examine its individuation without referring to anything by architecture itself? Simply put, throughout this book, we will examine how architects can right here and right now design a space that nonetheless is not here and not yet. To achieve this, we will embark on a captivating journey that will take us through many singular architectural concepts. The entasis of Doric columns, Ulysses and desert islands will outline an architectural act that moves beyond representation. A ferryman who stutters will present to us two different architectural minds. A stilus and a theory of signs will reconsider the ways architects can develop a particular kind of intuition, while architectural technicities will bring forth a membranic and territorial understanding of architecture. Finally, as a melody that sings itself, a larval architecture will be introduced, bringing space and time together. Assisting this endeavour, the thought of philosophers like Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, Gilbert Simondon and Raymond Ruyer will meet the latest developments in fields like affect theory, cognitive sciences, environmental studies and neuroanthropology. Eventually, by the end of this book, the reader will have been exposed to a comprehensive and original philosophy of architecture and the built environment"--
