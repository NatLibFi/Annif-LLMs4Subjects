Membrane technology and applications
"Membranes have gained an important place in chemical technology and are used in a broad range of applications. The key property that is exploited is the ability of a membrane to control the permeation rate of a chemical species through the membrane, e.g. in controlled drug delivery. In separation applications, the aim is to allow one component of a mixture to permeate the membrane freely, while hindering permeation of other components."--
