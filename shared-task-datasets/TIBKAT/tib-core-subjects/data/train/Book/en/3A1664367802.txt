"Air Safety is right now in a point where the chances to be killed in an Aviation accident are far lower than the chances to get the big prize in many of the major lotteries. However, keeping or improving that performance level requires a critical analysis of some events that, despite scarce, point to structural failures in the learning process. The effect of these failures could increase in the next future if there is not a clear and right development path. This book tries to identify what is wrong, why there are things to fix and some Human Factors principles to keep in aircraft design and operations"--
