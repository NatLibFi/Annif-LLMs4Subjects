Electromagnetic methods in geophysics : applications in GeoRadar, FDEM, TDEM, and AEM
"In GeoRadar, FDEM, TDEM, and AEM Methods, accomplished researchers Fabio Giannino and Giovanni Leucci deliver an in-depth exploration of the theory and application of four different electromagnetic geophysical techniques: ground penetrating radar, the frequency domain electromagnetic method, the time domain electromagnetic method, and the airborne electromagnetic method. The authors offer a full description of each technique as they relate to the economics, planning, and logistics of deploying each of them on-site. The book also discusses the potential output of each method and how it can be combined with other sources of below- and above ground information to create a digitized common point cloud containing a wide variety of data. Giannino and Leucci rely on 25 years of professional experience in over 40 countries around the world to provide readers with a fulsome description of the optimal use of GPR, FDEM, TDEM, and AEM, demonstrating their flexibility and applicability to a wide variety of use cases."--
