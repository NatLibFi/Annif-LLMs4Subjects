Quantum image watermarking
"This book offers various schemes related to watermarking techniques for quantum images in spatial and frequency domains. The book includes 7 chapters. Chapter 1 is an introductory part, which describes the research background, the significance of topics, literature review and research methods. Chapter 2 is the basis of knowledge, which provides the techniques of the field of quantum computation, such as quantum bit, quantum gate, and quantum circuit. Chapters 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are on various quantum watermarking schemes. We present new quantum watermarking algorithms for binary images, grayscale and color images. These chapters describe the design of quantum watermarking schemes and their corresponding quantum circuits. In addition, the simulated experimental results and analysis demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes in this book"--
