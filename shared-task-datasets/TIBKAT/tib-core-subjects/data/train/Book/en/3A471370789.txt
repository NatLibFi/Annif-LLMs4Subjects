Serre's problem on projective modules
This book covers the area of "Serre's Problem on Projective Modules" quite thoroughly, and from very many different angles. It presents the broadest and most comprehensive view available in the literature on the mathematics of "Serre's Conjecture", its history, its different solutions, and the important subsequent developments. Based on an earlier version of this book (Lecture Notes in Mathematics Vol. 635) this volume has been considerably expanded. Different segments of the material have been added to the existing chapters of the original book and two completely new chapters one for example on Suslin's important work on the K1 analogue of Serre's Conjecture. The second is a new chapter which surveys the subsequent developments in many acts and ramifications on Serre's Conjecture that took place in the "post Quillen-Suslin era". This book is an invaluable summary of research work done in the period from 1978 to the present.
