The economics of staging the Olympics : a comparison of the games, 1972-2008
The Olympic Games is a unique event centering global interest on its host city. The financing of the Games has changed dramatically since Munich (1972) and economic interests and effects are increasingly paramount. It is therefore an anomaly that accurate economic analysis and comparison is not readily available. This is the most detailed study on the economic implications of recent and future Olympic Games over four decades. Holger Preuss analyses the most important issues surrounding the hosting of the Olympics, and its wider economic effects, including: * financial gigantism of the Olympic Games * commercialisation and its control * problems associated with achieving the Olympic requirements and standards * the economic legacy of Olympic Games * the feasibility of developing countries staging future Olympic Games * detailed post Olympic analysis of financial figures * conclusions on the economic related achievements of respective Organising Committees. Academics and researchers of sports economics, international economics, international business and competition will all find this fascinating book of great value. The rigorous and authoritative analysis ensures valuable information will be available for future bid cities, and in a wider context, any city planning to bid for a major sporting event. It will also appeal to those interested in the broader context of the Olympic Games and concerned by their commercialisation and gigantism
