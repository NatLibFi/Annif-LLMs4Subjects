Practical Chemical Process Optimization : With MATLAB® and GAMS®
This text provides the undergraduate chemical engineering student with the necessary tools for problem solving in chemical or bio-engineering processes. In a friendly, simple, and unified framework, the exposition aptly balances theory and practice. It uses minimal mathematical concepts, terms, algorithms, and describes the main aspects of chemical process optimization using MATLAB and GAMS. Numerous examples and case studies are designed for students to understand basic principles of each optimization method and elicit the immediate discovery of practical applications. Problem sets are directly tied to real-world situations most commonly encountered in chemical engineering applications. Chapters are structured with handy learning summaries, terms and concepts, and problem sets, and individually reinforce the basics of particular optimization methods. Additionally, the wide breadth of topics that may be encountered in courses such as Chemical Process Optimization, Chemical Process Engineering, Optimization of Chemical Processes, are covered in this accessible text. The book provides formal introductions to MATLAB, GAMS, and a revisit to pertinent aspects of undergraduate calculus. While created for coursework, this text is also suitable for independent study. A full solutions manual is available to instructors who adopt the text for their course.
