Solar engineering of thermal processes
The fourth edition of the acknowledged leading book on solar engineering, this volume presents the basics of solar energy, then goes on to cover the technologies used to harvest this solar energy, store it, and deliver it, including photovoltaics, solar heaters, and cells. The new edition features an added chapter discussing a simulation problem, allowing students to apply the theory to real world systems. Other simulation problems are offered via a student website and include a solar domestic hot water system, a commercial solar heating application, and a photovoltaic system for a house
