Gallium nitride electronics
Gallium Nitride Electronics covers developments in III-N semiconductor-based electronics with a focus on high-power and high-speed RF applications. Material properties of III-N semiconductors and substrates, the state-of-the-art of devices and circuits, epitaxial growth, device technology, modelling and characterization, and circuit examples are discussed.  The book concludes with device reliability aspects and an overview of integration and packaging. This comprehensive monograph and tutorial is based on more than a decade of research on materials, devices, and circuits. It is of interest to graduate students of electrical engineering, communication engineering, and physics, to materials, device, and circuit engineers in research and industry, and to all scientists with a general interest in advanced electronics.
