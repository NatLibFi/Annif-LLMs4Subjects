Releasing systems in active food packaging : preparation and applications
Valuable progress has been made in food packaging over the past two decades, reflecting advancements in process efficiency, improved safety and quality throughout the supply chain, and the need to reduce product loss and environmental impact. A new generation of food packaging systems, including active and intelligent packaging, is emerging, based on technological breakthroughs that offer the possibility of extending shelf-life, reducing food loss, and monitoring changes in the food product. Releasing Systems in Active Food Packaging closely examines such a technological breakthrough, active releasing systems, which add compounds such as antimicrobials, antioxidants, flavors, colorants, and other ingredients to packaged food products. Chapters detail examples of recent innovations in active releasing systems, and the authors systematically address their application to different food groups. Such an in-depth approach makes this a useful reference researchers, health professionals, and food and packaging industry professionals interesting in innovative food packaging technologies.
