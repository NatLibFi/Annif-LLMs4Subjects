Handbook of Open Source Tools
Handbook of Open Source Tools for Advanced Programs introduces a comprehensive collection of advanced open source tools useful in developing software applications. The tools presented include software construction utilities for compilers, virtual-machines, database, graphics, high-performance computing, OpenGL, geometry, algebra, graph theory , GUIs and more. Special highlights for software construction utilities are presented in the perspective of software development when starting a new project. Each tool is covered in the context of a real like application development setting. Case studies and examples are provided throughout the book as well. This book: Presents a comprehensive discussion of advanced tools, a valuable asset used by most application developers and programmers. Includes a special focus on Mathematical Open Source Software not available in most Open Source Software books. Introduces several tools (eg ACL2 and CLIPS) which are not known outside of select groups, but are very powerful. This reference book is designed for application developers and programmers working with Open Source Tools. Advanced-level students concentrating on Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science will find this reference a valuable asset as well.
