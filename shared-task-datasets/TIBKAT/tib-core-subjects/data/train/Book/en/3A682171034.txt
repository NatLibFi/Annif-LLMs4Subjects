Biosimulation : simulation of living systems
"This practical guide to biosimulation provides the hands-on experience needed to devise, design, and analyze simulations of biophysical processes for applications in biological and biomedical sciences. Through real-world case studies and worked examples, students will develop and apply basic operations through to advanced concepts, covering a wide range of biophysical topics including chemical kinetics and thermodynamics, transport phenomena, and cellular electrophysiology. Each chapter is built around case studies in a given application area, with simulations of real biological systems developed to analyze and interpret data. Open-ended project-based exercises are provided at the end of each chapter, and with all data and computer codes available online (www.cambridge.org/biosim) students can quickly and easily run, manipulate, explore, and expand on the examples inside. This hands-on guide is ideal for use on senior undergraduate/graduate courses, and also as a self-study guide for anyone who needs to develop computational models of biological systems"--
