The chemistry of nitrogen-rich functional groups
"The understanding of functional groups is the key to understanding organic chemistry. In the tradition of Patai's Chemistry of Functional Groups each volume treats all aspects of functional groups, touching on theoretical, analytical, synthetic, biological, and industrial aspects. Nitrogen is unique among the non-carbon atoms in its ability to form single, double, and triple bonds with itself, giving rise to a wide range of organic-chemical groups containing several nitrogen atoms in different states and geometries. The present volume surveys the properties and chemical behaviour of all important nitrogen-rich organic-chemical groups, including azides, azimines, aziridines, diazo compounds, nitramines, nitrenes, nitrosamines polyazine N-oxides, tetrazoles, triazanes, triazenes, and triazoles. A special focus lies on commercially important species which are used, e. g., as powerful explosives. As with all new volumes, the chapters are first published online in Patai's Chemistry of Functional Groups. Once a volume is completed online, it is then published in print format. The printed book offers the traditional quality of the Patai Book Series, complete with an extensive index"--
