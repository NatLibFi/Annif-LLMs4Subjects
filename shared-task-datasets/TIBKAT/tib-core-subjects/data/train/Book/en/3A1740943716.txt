Optical sensing in power transformers
"Optical Sensing in Power Transformers provides abundant first-hand information and knowledge on the optical techniques applied in power transformers, which are important and expensive components in the electric power system. Monitoring systems can help to decrease the transformer life cycle cost and to increase the high level of availability and reliability. It is believed that optical sensing techniques will play an increasingly significant role in online monitoring of power transformers. This book comprehensively presents the different cutting-edge optical principles and methodologies adopted for online monitoring of power transformers. This original work, based on the authors' extensive research, examines optical techniques and high-voltage equipment testing, providing the foundation for further application, prototype and manufacturing. The book builds upon the principles, installation, operation, condition detection, monitoring and fault diagnosis of power transformers, and therefore a basic knowledge of electrical engineering, transformer construction, and optical principles are a pre-requisite."--
