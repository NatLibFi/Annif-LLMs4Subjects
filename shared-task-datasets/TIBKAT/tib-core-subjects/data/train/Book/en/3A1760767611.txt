Extrusion blow molding
Dr.-Ing. Michael Thielen is a PR consultant, editorial service provider, and founder and publisher of the trade journal bioplastics MAGAZINE. As a mechanical engineer, he studied plastics engineering at the RWTH Aachen University, where he also earned his doctorate. After several years in various sales and communication positions, including at the Krupp Research Institute, Krupp Kautex Maschinenbau, and SIG Plastics International, he went freelance in 2003 as a consultant and publicist. He has written several books on blow molding technology and bioplastics and has taught plastics engineering in numerous lectures and teaching assignments at universities of applied sciences in Germany and abroad.
This unique book covers the wide spectrum of extrusion blow-molded hollow bodies, which find application for instance in packaging, storage, and transport or channeling of liquids, gases, or bulk materials, as well as for toys, sporting goods, or technical applications in the automotive or household appliances sectors. The necessary information for fundamental understanding of extrusion blow molding technology is provided, making it easy to comprehend the interrelationships during processing and in applications. This practical knowledge is aimed at facilitating the readerâ€™s daily work and studies. In addition to various fields of application and manufacturing processes, aspects of product development and possibilities of blow molding simulation are presented. Further sections on peripheral equipment, downstream equipment, and recycling round off the book.
