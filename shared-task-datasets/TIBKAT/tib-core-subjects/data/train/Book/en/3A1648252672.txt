Entanglement, Information, and the Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics
This book explores the nature of quantum entanglement and quantum information and their role in the quantum world. Their relations to a number of key experiments and thought experiments in the history of quantum physics are considered, as is a range of interpretations of quantum mechanics that have been put forward as a means of understanding the fundamental nature of microphysics - the traditionally accepted domain of quantum mechanics - and in some cases, the universe as a whole. In this way, the book reveals the deep significance of entanglement and quantum information for our understanding of the physical world. This book is a major accomplishment and invaluable contribution -- Arkady Plotnitsky An encyclopedic treatment of conceptual quantum mechanics as seen from a very up-to-date point of view --Tom Toffoli A mine of ideas for physicists, philosophers, and all intellectuals interested in this scientific revolution -- Giacomo Mauro D'Ariano
