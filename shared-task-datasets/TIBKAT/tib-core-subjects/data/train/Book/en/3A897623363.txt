Cognitive engineering and safety organization in air traffic management
"This book covers the Air Traffic Management (ATM) environment and the controller-crew interactions. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) regulations and organizational procedures are also presented in a succinct manner so that novel and experienced aviation practitioners appreciate how safety organization affects their cognitive performance.
