Séminaire de Probabilités XXVIII
In this volume of original research papers, the main topics discussed relate to the asymptotic windings of planar Brownian motion, structure equations, closure properties of stochastic integrals. The contents of the volume represent an important fraction of research undertaken by French probabilists and their collaborators from abroad during the academic year 1992-1993
