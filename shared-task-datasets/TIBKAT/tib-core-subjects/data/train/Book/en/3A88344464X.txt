Molecular Modeling Applications in Crystallization
Crystallization is an important purification process used in a broad range of industries, including pharmaceuticals, foods, and bulk chemicals. In recent years, molecular modeling has emerged as a useful tool in the analysis and solution of problems associated with crystallization. Modeling allows more focused experimentation based on structural and energetic calculations instead of intuition and trial and error. This book is the first to offer a general introduction to molecular modeling techniques and their application in crystallization. After explaining the basic concepts of molecular modeling and crystallization, the book goes on to discuss how modeling techniques are used to solve a variety of practical problems related to crystal size, shape, internal structure, and properties. With chapters written by leading experts and an emphasis on problem-solving, this book will appeal to scientists, engineers, and graduate students involved in research and the production of crystalline materials
