Lectures on chemical bonding and quantum chemistry
"The concept of a chemical bond evolved from a variety of experimental observations. It became useful to understand, at times even predict, the molecular structure, reactivity and mechanism of chemical reactions. Every aspect of the concept of bonding received a quantitative interpretation from the advent of quantum mechanics and its application to chemistry. In Lectures on Chemical Bonding and Quantum Chemistry the reader will find a comprehensive discourse on the basic interpretation of the chemical bond as well as current understanding in terms of a "dancing" molecule that not only travels, rotates and pulsates around an equilibrium molecular structure, but also interacts and collides with other molecules, thereby transferring linear and angular momentum characteristics and adjusting total energies. One will also find a thorough survey of quantum mechanical methodologies for calculation of molecular characteristics in specific states and their changes under spectroscopic transitions, tunneling, electron and proton transfer phenomena, and so on. Guides to more advanced levels of theory are also provided."--
