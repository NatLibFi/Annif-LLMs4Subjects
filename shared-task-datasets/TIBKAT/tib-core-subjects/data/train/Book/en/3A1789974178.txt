Power flow control solutions for a modern grid using SMART power flow controllers
"The locations for electricity generation are based on the availability of energy sources and environmental acceptance. Electrical energy is transported from the generating point to the point of use through interconnected transmission lines. Electricity flows freely through the path of least resistivity just like water flows through the river from higher elevation to lower. This free flow causes certain transmission lines to be overloaded or underloaded, just as a branch in an interconnected river system can have more or less than the desired amount of water flow. With the use of a Power Flow Controller (PFC), the flow of electricity in a particular line of an interconnected transmission system can be controlled, just as with a lock and dam, the flow of water in a particular branch of an interconnected river system is controlled"--
