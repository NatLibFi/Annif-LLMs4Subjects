Vehicle handling dynamics : theory and application
Vehicle dynamics and control -- Tire mechanics -- Fundamentals of vehicle dynamics -- Vehicle motion by disturbances -- Steering system and vehicle dynamics -- Vehicles roll and vehicle dynamics -- Vehicle motion with traction and braking -- Vehicle dynamics with active motion control -- Vehicle dynamics by human control -- Ease of vehicle control
This is the first book to combine classical vehicle dynamics with electronic control. The equation-based presentation of the theory behind vehicle dynamics enables readers to develop a thorough understanding of the key attribute to both a vehicle's driveability and its active safety. Supported by MATLAB tools, the key areas that affect vehicle dynamics are explored including tire mechanics, the steering system, vehicle roll, traction and braking, 4WS and vehicle dynamics, vehicle dynamics by vehicle and human control, and controllabiliy. As a professional reference volume, this book is an essential addition to the resources available to anyone working in vehicle design and development
