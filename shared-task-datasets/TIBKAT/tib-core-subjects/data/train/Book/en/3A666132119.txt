"Preface to 'Tutorials in Metamaterials" Metamaterials - composite media with unusual optical properties - have revolutionized the landscape of optical science and engineering over the past decades. Metamaterials have transformed science-fiction-like concepts of superresolution imaging and optical cloaking to the realm of science laboratories, and further promise to transform these into the realm of our everyday life. The new era of optical metamaterials calls for the development of experimental and theoretical methods capable of analyzing optical behavior on the multitude of scales, starting from the nanometer scale of individual inhomogeneity, to the micrometer of the metamaterial, to an even larger scale of the metamaterials-based device. Future progress in the areas of photonics, plasmonics, and metamaterials critically depends on our ability to answer this call. This book is a collection of self-contained tutorials describing metamaterial photonics, aimed at upper undergraduates, graduate students, as well as experts in physics and engineering who are willing to familiarize themselves with the state of the art in the metamateirals research. It starts with the most general reviews and progresses to more specialized topics. "--
