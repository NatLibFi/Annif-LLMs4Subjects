Introduction to numerical electrostatics using MATLAB
"Introduction to Numerical Electrostatics contains problem sets, an accompanying web site with simulations, and a complete list of computer codes"--
"The first of its kind uniquely devoted to the field of computational electrostatics, this book dives headfirst into the actual problems that engineers are expected to solve using method of moment (MoM), finite difference, and finite element techniques. Readers are guided step by step through specific problems and challenges, covering all aspects of electrostatics with an emphasis on numerical procedures. Focusing on practical examples, mathematical equations, and common issues with algorithms, this is an ideal text for students in engineering, physics, and electrostatics--and working engineers and physicists"--
