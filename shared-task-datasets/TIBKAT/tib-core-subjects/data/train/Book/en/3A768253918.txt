"This book addresses the practical issues for commercialization of current and future electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (EVs/PHEVs). The volume focuses on power electronics and motor drives based solutions for both current as well as future EV/PHEV technologies. Propulsion system requirements and motor sizing for EVs is also discussed, along with practical system sizing examples. PHEV power system architectures are discussed in detail. Key EV battery technologies are explained as well as corresponding battery management issues are summarized. Advanced power electronic converter topologies for current and future charging infrastructures will also be discussed in detail. EV/PHEV interface with renewable energy is discussed in detail. Included within are practical examples."--Page [4] of cover
