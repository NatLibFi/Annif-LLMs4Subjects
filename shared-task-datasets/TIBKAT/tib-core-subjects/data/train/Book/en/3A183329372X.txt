Spectrum wars : the rise of 5G and beyond
This exciting new book, which builds on the author's previous book, Spectrum Wars: The Policy and Technology Debate, discusses the evolution of spectrum use and management caused by the rise of 5G and beyond in all wireless technologies, from terrestrial wireless, including mobile and fixed, to non-terrestrial including satellite and drone technologies. A survey of these new technologies and use cases are included, allowing the reader to understand the technical, operational, and commercial context of these systems. This book addresses how the traditional methods used in evaluating spectrum management have changed, including the use and need of low, medium, and high band spectrum to meet user demands and the use of tools such as spectrum sharing to make available much needed spectrum for 5G and beyond. The book also examines how governments are making additional spectrum available for all uses, including recent spectrum auctions, clearing, and shared networks. Public policy challenges, such as the digital divide and the impact of the pandemic, are explored in relation to their impact on spectrum management. Finally, the evolution to 6G that is already occurring, and the impact that 6G will likely have on spectrum management in the future, is reviewed. Written by an expert in the field, this book provides a thoughtful approach to the overall spectrum management regime from allocating spectrum to having it released into the market for 5G and beyond
