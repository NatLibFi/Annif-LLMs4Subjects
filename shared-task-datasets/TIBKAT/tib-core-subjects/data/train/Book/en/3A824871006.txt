Plant phosphoproteomics : methods and protocols
This detailed volume addresses recent developments in phosphoproteomic techniques with a particular focus on the plant system. Over the recent decades, proteomic methods were refined to study the significance and dynamics of protein phosphorylation in various biological contexts. However, working with plant tissue imposes particular challenges to the biologist which are attributed to the rigid cell wall making protein extraction more difficult, the skewed protein abundance with Rubisco as a highly abundant protein, and a large central vacuole leading to low protein yield and increased degradative enzyme activity. The methodologies in this book seek to move beyond these issues. Written for the Methods in Molecular Biology series, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Practical and authoritative, Plant Phosphoproteomics: Methods and Protocols serves as an ideal reference for researchers investigating this vital area of plant science. --
