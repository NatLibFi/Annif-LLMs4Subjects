Green Functors and G-sets
This book provides a definition of Green functors for a finite group G, and of modules over it, in terms of the category of finite G-sets. Some classical constructions, such as the associated categroy or algebra, have a natural interpretation in that framework. Many notions of ring theory can be extended to Green functors (opposite Green functor, bimodules, Morita theory, simple modules, centres,..). There are moreover connections between Green functors for different groups, given by functors associated to bisets. Intended for researchers and students in representation theory of finite groups it requires only basic algebra and category theory, though knowledge of the classical examples of Mackey functors is probably preferable
