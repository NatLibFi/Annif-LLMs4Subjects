Carbon-based Membranes for Separation Processes
This book provides a significant overview of carbon-related membranes. It will cover the development of carbon related membranes and membrane modules from its onset to the latest research on carbon mixed matrix membranes. After reviewing progress in the field, the authors indicate future research directions and prospective development. The authors also attempt to provide a guideline for the readers who would like to establish their own laboratories for carbon membrane research. For this purpose, detailed information on preparation, characterization and testing of various types of carbon membrane is provided. Design and construction of carbon membrane modules are also described in detail.
