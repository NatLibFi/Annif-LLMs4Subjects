Technological unemployment, basic income, and well-being
"The main novelty of the fourth Industrial Revolution is the entry of robots and Artificial Intelligence into the production process. This phenomenon could potentially generate high levels of unemployment, or even full unemployment, and therefore calls for innovative public policies. This book adopts an agnostic position on the size of the future impact of technological progress on employment, but proposes a thought experiment built on a full unemployment scenario which focuses on the consequences that these policies might have for people's wellbeing, with particular reference to the provision of a Universal Basic Income (UBI). Relying on some of the principles and models of Behavioral and Happiness Economics it is argued that implementing a UBI that does not change over time may increase wellbeing inequality. A policy mix that combines a rising basic income with other measures is therefore recommended. This book marks a significant contribution to the literature on economic policy, labor economics, the economics of wellbeing and happiness and behavioral economics."
