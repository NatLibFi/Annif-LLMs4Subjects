New Directions in Geometric and Applied Knot Theory
The aim of this book is to present recent results in both theoretical and applied knot theory-which are at the same time stimulating for leading researchers in the @257;eld as well as accessible to non-experts. The book comprises recent research results while covering a wide range of di@256;erent sub-disciplines, such as the young @257;eld of geometric knot theory, combinatorial knot theory, as well as applications in microbiology and theoretical physics
