Programming Constraint Services : High-Level Programming of Standard and New Constraint Services
This book is concerned with the architecture and implementation of constraint engines. The author's main contribution is that constraint services, such as search and combinators, are made programmable; this is achieved by devising computation spaces as simple abstractions for programming constraint services at a high level. State-of-the-art and novel search strategies such as visual interactive search and parallel search are covered.This book is indispensable reading for anyone seriously interested in constraint technology
