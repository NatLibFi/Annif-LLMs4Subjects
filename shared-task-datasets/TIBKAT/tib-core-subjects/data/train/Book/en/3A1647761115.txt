Competence Assessment in Dementia
The increasing number of demented elderly in our societies, the ongoing debate on patientâ€™s rights and autonomy, and the growing body of knowledge on the dementias led the European Dementia Consensus Network to regard competence assessment in dementia as an important topic of debate. To date, no other comprehensive publication on this topic is known to exist. EDCON performed a transeuropean survey and has agreed on a consensus, which takes into account the variability of clinical symptoms of dementia as well as the special functions required for different purposes.  This book contains a summarised consensus as well as chapters on the state of art of neuropsychological functions and how they are related to the areas of competence and chapters which deals with ethical, legal perspectives. The area of competence, e.g. in the field of driving capacity will be discussed in an own chapter. Furthermore, the book contains short contributions on the situation in individual European countries.
The increasing proportion of demented elderly in populations, debates over patient's rights and autonomy, and the growing body of knowledge on dementia has inspired the European Dementia Consensus Network to regard competence assessment in dementia as an important topic of debate. This book contains a summarised consensus as well as chapters on state-of-art neuropsychological functions and how they relate to competence, and chapters discussing ethical, legal perspectives.
