50 hybrid buildings : catalogue on the art of mixing uses
Hybrid buildings are urban artefacts which are often characterised by their mixed-use role in the city. The ones that manage to get built and endure are true survivors of a rare and vigorous category that flourishes in locations of opportunity. This volume presents 50 of these hybrid buildings, designed from the 19th century to the present, as a catalogue of types without any specific typology. Each project is drawn in section, revealing both its functions and a fascinating narrative about how it came to be, as well as its place in the urban context. The publication demonstrates how buildings which insist on mixing uses and users can more naturally incorporate complexity and indeterminacy
