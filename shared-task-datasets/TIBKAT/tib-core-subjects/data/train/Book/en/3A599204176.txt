Advanced analysis and design of steel frames
Steel frames are used in many commercial high-rise buildings, as well as industrial structures, such as ore mines and oilrigs. Enabling construction of ever lighter and safer structures, steel frames have become an important topic for engineers. This book, split into two parts covering advanced analysis and advanced design of steel frames, guides the reader from a broad array of frame elements through to advanced design methods such as deterministic, reliability, and system reliability design approaches. This book connects reliability evaluation of structural systems to advanced analysis of st
The book begins with an introductory chapter to provide you with background knowledge of the different types of steel frames. The following chapter introduces the elastic stiffness equation for beam element, both general and special form is explained, before providing you with application examples of the equation. Next, Beam-column sections are discussed with reference to yielding and hysteric models. The following chapters cover the 'elasto-plastic stiffness equation for beam element', and the 'elastic and elasto-plastic stiffness equations for column element'. Joint panels and beam-to-column connections and their effects on the stiffness of beam columns and beam drift are presented. The concluding chapters focus on the planar frame system and different methods of analysis including elastic analysis, nonlinear analysis, and seismic analysis of stability. The super-FEM model is introduced in the final chapter, and its principles and analysis procedure are discussed in detail
