Adrenomedullin in Cardiovascular Disease
Adrenomedullin in Cardiovascular Disease is an up-to-date review of the most relevant aspects of adrenomedullin. It encompasses a broad range of fields including biochemistry, molecular biology, physiology, pharmacology, pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease and clinical applications of adrenomedullin to cardiovascular disease.

Adrenomedullin was discovered in 1993 in an extract of human pheochromocytoma while monitoring cAMP levels in rat platelets. Adrenomedullin has attracted considerable interest among cardiologists due to its impact on the cardiovascular system which includes a decrease in blood pressure in vivo, an impact on vascular smooth muscle cells, increases cAMP levels, indirectly reduces blood pressure and has role in the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis.Adrenomedullin in Cardiovascular Disease is an up-to-date review of the most relevant aspects ofadrenomedullin.
