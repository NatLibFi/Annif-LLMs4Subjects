Green gasoline : a green spark transportation fuel
Transportation currently takes up around a third of overall energy usage, of which the majority is petroleum-based gasoline. Petroleum is both a finite resource and a big contributor to the carbon emissions that are causing climate change. To continue to benefit from transportation whilst mitigating climate change it is essential to find alternatives to petroleum-based gasoline. Although a lot of recent developments have focused on electrifying transport the infrastructure for large scale uptake of electric vehicles is still lacking and it may be less practical in some parts of the world than others. Biofuels, therefore, still have a role to play in improving the sustainability of our transportation systems. The term green gasoline refers to biofuels intended to be direct drop-in replacements for petroleum-based gasoline. Such products allow vehicles to run on biofuel without any engine modifications and, being made from biomass, they are both renewable and have a better carbon emission profile than petroleum-based gasoline. Green Gasoline covers a range of new technologies being used to produce these biofuels and compares them to petroleum-based fuels in terms of sustainability. It will be an interesting read for those working in fuel chemistry as well as green chemists and anyone with an interest in transport sustainability
