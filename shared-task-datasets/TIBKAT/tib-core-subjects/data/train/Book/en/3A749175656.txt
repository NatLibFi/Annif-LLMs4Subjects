Dual Superconductor Models of Color Confinement
Physicists who wish to understand the modeling of confinement of quantum chromodynamics, as exhibited by dual superconductors, will find this book an excellent introduction. The author focuses on the models themselves, especially the Landau--Ginzburg model of a dual superconductor, also called the Dual Abelian Higgs model. The book addresses graduate students and researchers, and is noteworthy for the remarkable clarity of its exposition
