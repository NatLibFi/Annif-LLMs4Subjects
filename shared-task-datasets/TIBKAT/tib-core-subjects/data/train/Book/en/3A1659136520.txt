Learn physics, engineering, and geology concepts usually seen in high school and college in an easy, accessible style. This second volume addresses these topics for advanced science fair participants or those who just like reading about and understanding science. 3D Printed Science Project Volume 2 describes eight open-source 3D printable models, as well as creative activities using the resulting 3D printed pieces. The files are designed to print as easily as possible, and the authors give tips for printing them on open source printers. As 3D printers become more and more common and affordable, hobbyists, teachers, parents, and students stall out once they've printed some toys and a few household items. To get beyond this, most people benefit from a “starter set” of objects as a beginning point in their explorations, partially just to see what is possible. This book tells you the solid science stories that these models offer, and provides them in open-source repositories
