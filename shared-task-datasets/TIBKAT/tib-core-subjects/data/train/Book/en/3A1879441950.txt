Income distribution in a corporate economy
Income Distribution in a Corporate Economy offers a skilful examination of the influences of financial markets and imperfect competition on the distributive process. Unlike much of the earlier literature, it concentrates upon the short-run, making it suitable for empirical appraisal. After a thorough review of the theoretical and empirical literature of the past 30 years, Russell Rimmer uses a series of models to synthesize results from post Keynesian macroeconomics, investment theory and industrial economics. The final chapters contain an analysis of the short-run effects of changes in pricing strategies and increases in industrial concentration on income shares accruing to households and corporations. By presenting in one place the neo-classical and post Keynesian approaches, the book will serve both as a text and a foundation for future work on distribution. Students new to income distribution will be able to read the text as an introduction to the neoclassical and post Keynesian approaches. A novel contribution is the gathering together of early extensions of post Keynesian theory to the short run, including accounts of attempts to synthesise the major theoretical strands
