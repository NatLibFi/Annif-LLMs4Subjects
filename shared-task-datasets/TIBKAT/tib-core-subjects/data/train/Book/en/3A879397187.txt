The designer's guide to the Cortex-M processor family
Annotation, The Designer's Guide to the Cortex-M Family gives you an easy-to-understand introduction to the concepts required to develop programs in C with a Cortex-M based microcontroller. The book begins with an overview of the Cortex-M family, giving architectural descriptions supported with practical examples, enabling you to easily develop basic C programs to run on the Cortex-M0/M0+/M3 and M4 and M7. It then examines the more advanced features of the Cortex architecture such as memory protection, operating modes and dual stack operation. Once a firm grounding in the Cortex-M processor has been established the book introduces the use of a small footprint RTOS and the CMSIS-DSP library. The Designers guide also examines techniques for software testing and code reuse specific to Cortex-M microcontrollers. With this book you will learn:The key differences between the Cortex-M0/M0+/M3 and M4 and M7How to write C programs to run on Cortex-M based processorsHow to make the best use of the CoreSight debug systemThe Cortex-M operating modes and memory protectionAdvanced software techniques that can be used on Cortex-M microcontrollersHow to use a Real Time Operating System with Cortex-M devicesHow to optimize DSP code for the Cortex-M4 and how to build real time DSP systemsUpdated to include the latest version (5) of MDK-ARM, which introduces the concept of using software device packs and software componentsIncludes overviews of the new CMSIS specificationsCoverage of developing software with CMSIS-RTOS showing how to use RTOS in a real world designA new chapter on the Cortex-M7 Architecture covering all the new featuresA new chapter covering Test driven development for Cortex-M MicrocontrollersA new chapter on creating software components with CMSIS-Pack and device abstraction with CMSIS-DriverA new chapter providing an overview of the ARMv8-M Architecture including the TrustZone hardware security model
