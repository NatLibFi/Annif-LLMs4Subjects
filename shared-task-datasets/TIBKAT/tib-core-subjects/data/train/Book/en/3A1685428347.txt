Handbook of Surface Plasmon Resonance
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) plays a dominant role in real-time interaction sensing of biomolecular binding events.The book is intended as a hands-on guide for all interested in SPR, Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) plays a dominant role in real-time interaction sensing of biomolecular binding events. This book focuses on a total system description including optics, fluidics and sensor surfaces. It covers all commercial SPR systems in the market.  It is the first of its kind and fills a gap in the technical literature as  no other handbook on SPR is currently available. The final chapter discussed new trends and a vision is given for future developments and needs of the SPR market. This excellent handbook provides comprehensive information with easy to use, stand-alone chapters and will be of great use to anyone one working with or affiliated to the technology
