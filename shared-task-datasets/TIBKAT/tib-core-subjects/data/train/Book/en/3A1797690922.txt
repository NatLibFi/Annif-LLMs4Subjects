Additive manufacturing processes in biomedical engineering : advanced fabrication methods and rapid tooling techniques
"Current challenges and opportunities regarding material, design, cost savings, and efficiency are covered along with an outline of the most recent fabrication methods used for converting biomaterials into integrated structures that can fit best in the anatomy while still obtaining the necessary architecture, mechanical reliability, biocompatibility, and anti-bacterial characteristics needed. Additional chapters will also focus on selected areas of applications such as bionics, affordable prostheses, implants, medical devices, rapid tooling and drug delivery"--
