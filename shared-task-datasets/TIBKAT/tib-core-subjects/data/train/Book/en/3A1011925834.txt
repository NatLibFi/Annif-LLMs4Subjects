Lattice Boltzmann modeling of complex flows for engineering applications
Nature continuously presents a huge number of complex and multiscale phenomena, which in many cases, involve the presence of one or more fluids flowing, merging and evolving around us. Since the very first years of the third millennium, the Lattice Boltzmann method (LB) has seen an exponential growth of applications, especially in the fields connected with the simulation of complex and soft matter flows. LB, in fact, has shown a remarkable versatility in different fields of applications from nanoactive materials, free surface flows, and multiphase and reactive flows to the simulation of the processes inside engines and fluid machinery. In this book, the authors present the most recent advances of the application of the LB to complex flow phenomena of scientific and technical interest with focus on the multiscale modeling of heterogeneous catalysis within nano-porous media and multiphase, multicomponent flows.
