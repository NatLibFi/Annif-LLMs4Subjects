Mathematics - key technology for the future : joint projects between universities and industry
Efficient transfer between science and society is crucial for their future development. The rapid progress of information technology and computer systems offers a large potential and new perspectives for solving complex problems. Mathematical modelling and simulation have become important tools not only in scientific investigations but also in analysing, planning and controlling technological and economic processes. Mathematics, imbedded in an interdisciplinary concept, has become a key technology. The book covers the results of a variety of major projects in industrial mathematics following an initiative of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. All projects are collaborations of industrial companies and university-based researchers, and range from automotive industry to computer technology and medical visualisation. In general, the projects presented in this volume prove that new mathematical ideas and methods can be decisive for the solution of industrial and economic problems. The book will be of great interest to everyone working in industrial mathematics and scientific computing
