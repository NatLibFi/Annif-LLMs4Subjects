OECD Territorial Reviews: The Mesoamerican Region 2006 : Southeastern Mexico and Central America
Mesoamerica is a region characterised by high poverty levels, large urban-rural disparities, and a large informal economy, but also having a strategic location, rich natural and cultural resources, and light manufacturing. This pioneering study of the OECD examines how Mesoamerica could better exploit its economic potential. It shows how the region could improve its competitiveness and social cohesion and strengthen governance through a comprehensive development agenda.
