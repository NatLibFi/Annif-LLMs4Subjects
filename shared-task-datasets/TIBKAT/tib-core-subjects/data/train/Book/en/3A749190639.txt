Delay effects on stability : a robust control approach
This monograph is devoted to the effect of delays on the stability properties of dynamical systems. Stability regions with respect to the delay parameters are considered, and some sufficient characterizations are proposed. This monograph addresses general delay problems and offers solutions in some cases. In other cases, approximations of the stability regions can be proposed. The interpretation of delays as uncertainty allows the authors to use the advances in robust control and robust convex optimization to solve or to approximate the solutions of the corresponding problems
