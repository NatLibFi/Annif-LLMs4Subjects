An introduction to computational systems biology : systems-level modelling of cellular networks
"This book delivers a comprehensive and insightful account of applying mathematical modelling approaches to very large biological systems and networks-a fundamental aspect of computational systems biology. The book covers key modelling paradigms in detail, while at the same time retaining a simplicity that will appeal to those from less quantitative fields. The book is highly multi-disciplinary and will appeal to biologists, engineers, computer scientists, mathematicians and others"--
Key features: A hands-on approach to modelling ; Covers a broad spectrum of modelling, from static networks to dynamic models and constraint-based models ; Thoughtful exercises to test and enable understanding of concepts ; State-of-the-art chapters on exciting new developments, like community modelling and biological circuit design ; Emphasis on coding and software tools for systems biology
