X-ray microscopy
Klappentext: "Written by a pioneer in the field, this text provides a complete introduction to x-ray microscopy, providing all of the technical background required to use, understand and even develop x-ray microscopes. Starting from the basics of x-ray physics and focusing optics, it goes on to cover imaging theory, tomography, chemical and elemental analysis, lensless imaging, computational methods, instrumentation, radiation damage, and cryomicroscopy, and includes a survey of recent scientific applications. Designed as a 'one-stop' text, it provides a unified notation, and shows how computational methods in different areas are linked with one another. Including numerous derivations, and illustrated with dozens of examples throughout, this is an essential text for academics and practitioners across engineering, the physical sciences and the life sciences who use x-ray microscopy to analyze their specimens, as well as those taking courses in x-ray microscopy"--
