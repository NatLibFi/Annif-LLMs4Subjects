Selenium : chemistry, analysis, function and effects
Although toxic in large doses, selenium is an essential trace mineral in the animal diet and in some plants. It has a role in making antioxidant enzymes and a particular role in the functioning of the thyroid gland. This volume examines the chemical activity of selenium and its functional health effects eg towards cancers, in the heart and brain. It also covers other areas such as functional food enrichment, whole body metabolism, and the effects of selenium deficiency on health. Part of The Food and Nutritional Components in Focus series, this edited volume pools knowledge across scientific disciplines in a way that increases its applicability to a wide range of audiences. Victor Preedyâ‚‚s own distinguished career in nutritional science has made him a prolific author of research articles and books in this area, and this project fills a gap in providing comprehensive synopses of food substances. Chemists, analytical scientists, forensic scientists, food scientists, as well as course lecturers will all benefit from this interdisciplinary title written by international experts in this area
