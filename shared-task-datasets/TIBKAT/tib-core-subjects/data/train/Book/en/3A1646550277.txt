Ultrashort Laser Pulses in Biology and Medicine
This title helps learn about the many biological and medical applications of ultrashort laser pulses. The authors highlight and explain how the briefness of these laser pulses permits the tracing of even the fastest processes in photo-active bio-systems. They also present a variety of applications that rely on the high peak intensity of ultrashort laser pulses. Easy-to-follow examples cover non-linear imaging techniques, optical tomography, and laser surgery
Sources of ultrashort laser pulses are nowadays commercially available and have entered many areas of research and development. This book gives an overview of biological and medical applications of these laser pulses. The briefness of these laser pulses permits the tracing of the fastest processes in photo-active bio-systems, which is one focus of the book. The other focus is applications that rely on the high peak intensity of ultrashort laser pulses. Examples covered span non-linear imaging techniques, optical tomography, and laser surgery.
