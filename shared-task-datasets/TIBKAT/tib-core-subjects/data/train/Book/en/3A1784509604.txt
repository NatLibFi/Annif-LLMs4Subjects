Energy systems modeling and policy analysis
"This book covers a wide spectrum of policy analysis and optimal operational planning of integrated energy systems using systems approach. It starts with the coverage of importance of energy modeling and policy analysis, system dynamics and linear programming, modeling of energy supply, energy demand, and environmental impacts. With a focus on integrated energy systems at micro and macro levels, application of simulation techniques for integrated rural energy systems and integrated electric power systems/smart grids are covered as well. Features: covers modeling, optimization and control of energy system, and data analysis, collected using SCADA system, uses system dynamics methodology (based on control systems theory) in addition to other modeling tools, focusses on energy and environmental issues, provides optimal operational planning and management of integrated electric power systems and smart grids, and covers simulated planning and management of integrated national electric power systems using system dynamics. This book is aimed at graduate students in electrical engineering, energy technology, microgrid, energy policy, and control systems"--
