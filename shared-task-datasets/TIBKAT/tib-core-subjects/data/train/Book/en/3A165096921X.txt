Encyclopedia of Astrobiology
The encyclopedia comprises approximately 1700 entries from the following fields: Astrophysics -- Astrochemistry -- Planetology -- Space Science -- Space Missions and Planetary Protection -- Geology -- Geochemisty -- Geomicrobiology -- Traces of Life -- Chemistry -- Biochemistry -- Biology -- Microbiology -- Origins of Life -- Artificial Life -- Epistemology. The alphabetical part is complemented by: Astrobiological Data -- Astronomical Data -- Geological Data -- Chemical and Biological Data -- Chronological History of Life on Earth
The interdisciplinary field of Astrobiology constitutes a joint arena where provocative discoveries are coalescing concerning, e.g. the prevalence of exoplanets, the diversity and hardiness of life, and its increasingly likely chances for its emergence. Biologists, astrophysicists, biochemists, geoscientists and space scientists share this exciting mission of revealing the origin and commonality of life in the Universe. The members of the different disciplines are used to their own terminology and technical language. In the interdisciplinary environment many terms either have redundant meanings or are completely unfamiliar to members of other disciplines. The Encyclopedia of Astrobiology serves as the key to a common understanding. Each new or experienced researcher and graduate student in adjacent fields of astrobiology will appreciate this reference work in the quest to understand the big picture. The carefully selected group of active researchers contributing to this work and the expert field editors intend for their contributions, from an internationally comprehensive perspective, to accelerate the interdisciplinary advance of astrobiology
