An Introduction to Observational Astrophysics
An Introduction to Modern Astronomy -- CCD Astronomy -- Imaging -- Photometry -- Astrometry -- Spectography -- Observational Astronomy Projects -- Small Dish Radio Astronomy -- Small Telescopes in Science.
Observational Astrophysics follows the general outline of an astrophysics undergraduate curriculum targeting practical observing information to what will be covered at the university level. This includes the basics of optics and coordinate systems to the technical details of CCD imaging, photometry, spectography and radio astronomy. General enough to be used by students at a variety of institutions and advanced enough to be far more useful than observing guides targeted at amateurs, the author provides a comprehensive and up-to-date treatment of observational astrophysics at undergraduate level to be used with a universityâ€™s teaching telescope. The practical approach takes the reader from basic first year techniques to those required for a final year project. Using this textbook as a resource, students can easily become conversant in the practical aspects of astrophysics in the field as opposed to the classroom.
