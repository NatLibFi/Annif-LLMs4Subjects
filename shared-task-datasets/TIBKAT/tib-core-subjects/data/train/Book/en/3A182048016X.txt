Landscape pattern language : a new approach to landscape expression and spatial reasoning
This book presents a landscape pattern language framework for describing landscape spaces and offers a new approach to landscape expression and spatial reasoning. In addition to describing a conceptual model of landscape pattern language and its inner logical connections, the book discusses the functionality of landscape pattern language from both local and universal perspectivesâ€”effectively demonstrating that it can be used to highlight the individuality and characteristics of landscape space shaping. Given its scope, the book offers a valuable resource for all graduate students, lecturers, researchers, and practitioners in the areas of landscape architecture, landscape planning, and regional planning, especially ecological planning and design. .
