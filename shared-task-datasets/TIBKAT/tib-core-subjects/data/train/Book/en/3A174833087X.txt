MEMS-based integrated navigation
"Due to their micro-scale size and low power consumption, Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are now being utilized in a variety of fields. This leading-edge resource focuses on the application of MEMS inertial sensors to navigation systems. The book shows you how to minimize cost by adding and removing inertial sensors. Moreover, this practical reference provides you with various integration strategies with examples from real field tests. From an introduction to MEMS navigation related applications ... to special topics on Alignment for MEMS-Based Navigation ... to discussions on the Extended Kalman Filter, this comprehensive book covers a wide range of critical topics in this fast-growing area."--Page 4 of cover
