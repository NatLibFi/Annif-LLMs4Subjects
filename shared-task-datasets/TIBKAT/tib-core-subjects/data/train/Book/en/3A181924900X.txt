Atlas of structural geological and geomorphological interpretation of remote sensing images
"The most common geological use of remotely sensed data is in structural geology and geomorphology. Sensors used for remote sensing of the earth surface now have 40 cm resolution on satellite images and 3 cm resolutions on images captured by drones. These very high resolution and very high-quality data have just started coming into service and will lead to rapidly growing usage of these data sets in mapping much of the Earth's surface. Interpretation of images for tectonic geomorphology has become an essential skill for geologists, to strengthen the field findings. Most geologists may even develop virtual field-trips with those data sets and use the same data for academic training and industrial purposes. Interpreting such geological imaging data accurately will require learning analogues and techniques to identify features on high-resolution datasets. These techniques will also propagate to other usages like land-use and land cover, mineralogical mapping, seepage studies, vegetation and snow cover mapping and even mapping the surfaces of other planets and satellites."--
