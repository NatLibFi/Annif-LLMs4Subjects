Hygrothermal behaviour and building pathologies
This book presents recent research in the area of construction pathology, hygrothermal behaviour of buildings, service life and diagnostic techniques, and highlights the latest developments in building physics, hygrothermal behaviour, durability and numerical models applied to building materials analysis. Discussing the state of the art in the field, and covering topics relevant to variety of engineering disciplines, such as civil, materials and mechanical engineering, it will appeal to scientists, students, practitioners, lecturers and other stakeholders.
