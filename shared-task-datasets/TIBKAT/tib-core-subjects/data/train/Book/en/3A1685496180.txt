CMOS millimeter-wave integrated circuits for next generation wireless communication systems
"This book addresses in-depth technical issues, limitations, considerations and challenges facing millimeter-wave (MMW) integrated circuit and system designers in designing MMW wireless communication systems from the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) perspective. It offers both a comprehensive explanation of fundamental theories and a broad coverage of MMW integrated circuits and systems. CMOS Millimeter-Wave Integrated Circuits for Next Generation Wireless Communication Systems is an excellent reference for faculty, researchers and students working in electrical and electronic engineering, wireless communication, integrated circuit design and circuits and systems. While primarily written for upper-level undergraduate courses, it is also an excellent introduction to the subject for instructors, graduate students, researchers, integrated circuit designers and practicing engineers. Advanced readers could also benefit from this book as it includes many recent state-of-the-art MMW circuits"--
