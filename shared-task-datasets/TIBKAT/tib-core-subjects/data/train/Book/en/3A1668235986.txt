Statistics in social work : an introduction to practical applications
"Understanding statistical concepts is essential for social work professionals. However, the statistics textbooks available for social work students do not demonstrate the practicality and immediate application of statistics across the range of roles and contexts in which social workers serve.

Statistics in Social Work guides students through concepts and procedures from descriptive statistics and correlation to hypothesis testing and inferential statistics. Besides presenting key concepts, it focuses on real-world examples that students will encounter in a social work practice.
