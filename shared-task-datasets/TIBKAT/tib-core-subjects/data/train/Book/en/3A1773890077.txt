Low-Voltage Low-Power CMOS Current Conveyors
In Low Voltage, Low Power CMOS Current Conveyors, the authors start by giving a brief history of the first and second generation CC. Then, the second generation current-conveyor (CCII) will be considered as a building block in the main active feedback devices and in the implementation of simple analog functions, as an alternative to OA. In the next chapters, the design of CCII topologies will be considered, together with a further look into CCII modern solutions and future trends. The authors will, therefore, describe LV LP CCII implementations, their evolution towards differential and generalized topologies, and new possible CCII applications in some basic analog functions such as filters, impedance simulators and converters, oscillators, among others. Being a concise and modern book on current conveyors, Low Voltage, Low Power CMOS Current Conveyors considers these kinds of devices both in a general environment and for low-voltage low-power applications. This book can constitute an excellent reference for analog designers and researchers and is suitable for use as a textbook in an advanced course on Microelectronics.
