Structural Impact
Structural Impact is concerned with the behaviour of structures and components subjected to large dynamic loads which produce inelastic deformation. This field is of particular interest for the crash-worthiness design of aircraft, buses, cars, trains, ships and marine structures, and the energy absorbing characteristics of various components for a wide variety of safety calculations. The book begins by introducing rigid plastic methods of analysis for the static behaviour and dynamic response of beams, plates and shells. This is followed by discussions of various phenomena of importance in structural impact, the influence of transverse shear, rotatory inertia, finite-displacements and material strain rate sensitivity. Dynamic progressive buckling and dynamic plastic buckling are also discussed. The book will be of value to anyone working in industries where safety due to structural impact is important.
