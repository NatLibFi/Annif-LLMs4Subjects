Waterfront design in small Mediterranean port towns
"This book addresses issues that waterfronts face in small Mediterranean port towns due to the increase in the tourism industry. Integrating theory and pragmatic approaches, Waterfront Design in Small Port Towns proposes a design matrix which can go on to be implemented to waterfronts globally. The demand for a sustainable regeneration of the urban waterfront is constantly growing and represents the ultimate challenge to preserve and value the uniqueness of the region and to activate an overall redevelopment of small port towns. To understand these issues, Waterfront Design in Small Port Towns contains an in-depth investigation of the cultural and environmental assets and spatial socio-economic factors of the urban waterfront. This is conducted through the author's original methodological framework, the Waterfront Design Matrix, which responds to the specific scales and idiosyncrasies of the archetypical waterfront. The methodological and theoretical approach developed in the book can be applied to different geographical locations and countries, presenting comparable characteristics. This book is an ideal read for professionals and students alike with an interest in urban design and planning"--
