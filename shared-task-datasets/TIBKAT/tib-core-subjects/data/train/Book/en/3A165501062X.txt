Philippe Bénilan was a most original and charismatic mathematician who had a deep and decisive impact on the theory of nonlinear evolution equations. The present volume is dedicated to him and contains research papers written by highly distinguished mathematicians. They are all related to Bénilan's work and reflect the present state of this most active field. The contributions cover a wide range of nonlinear and linear equations. Special topics are Hamilton-Jacobi equations, the porous medium equation, reaction diffusion systems, integro-differential equations and visco-elasticity, maximal regularity for elliptic and parabolic equations, and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator. Also in this volume, the legendary work of Bénilan-Brézis on Thomas-Fermi theory is published for the first time. .
