Climate change in the polar regions
"This book seeks to assess the climatic and environmental changes that have taken place over the last century and set these in the context of our understanding of natural climate variability in the pre-industrial period. We will draw on many of the new climate data sets that have become available in recent years and also make use of the results of modelling experiments. The last few years have seen great advances in our ability to observe, monitor and model the present and past polar climates. In particular, the International Polar Year of 2007-2008 gave us an unprecedented amount of data from the two polar regions and increased our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for climate variability and change at high latitudes"--
