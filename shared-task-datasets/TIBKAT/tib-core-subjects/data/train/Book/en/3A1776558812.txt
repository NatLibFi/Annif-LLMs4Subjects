Understanding properties of atoms, molecules and materials
"The book introduces the readers in material chemistry/engineering to elementary quantum mechanics of atoms, molecules and solids,with methods of statistical mechanics (classical as well as quantum) along with elementary principles of classical MD simulation. The basic concepts are illustrated with easy to grasp examples, thus preparing the readers for an exploration through the world of materials - the exotic and the mundane. The emphasis has been on the phenomena and what shapes them at the fundamental level. A fairly comprehensive description of modern designing principles for materials with examples is a unique feature of the book"--
