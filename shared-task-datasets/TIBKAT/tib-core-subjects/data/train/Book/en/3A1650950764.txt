Optical-Thermal Response of Laser-Irradiated Tissue
The second edition maintains the standard of excellence established in the first edition, while adjusting the content to reflect changes in tissue optics and medical applications since 1995. The material concerning light propagation now contains new chapters devoted to electromagnetic theory for coherent light. The material concerning thermal laser-tissue interactions contains a new chapter on pulse ablation of tissue. The medical applications section now includes several new chapters on optical coherent tomography, acoustic imaging, molecular imaging, forensic optics and nerve stimulation. A
