Philosophical difference and advanced computation in architectural theory : from less to more
"This book presents a new take on the evolution of digital design theories in architecture from modernity to today, as they have been inspired both by contemporary philosophy and the emergence and access to advanced computation. It focuses on how concepts of difference in philosophy transformed architectural design theory and takes on even more significance with the introduction and ubiquitous use of computers within the discipline, changing the architectural design paradigm forever. Beginning with a presentation of American Pragmatism's push towards process, the book continues on to Husserl's influence on the modern movement, mid-century phenomenology, post-structuralist Derridean exchanges with architects, the Deleuzian influence on the smoothing of form, and finally contemporary architectural references to speculative realism. Analyzing the arc of design theory as influenced by philosophical and computational logics, this book presents the transformation to contemporary design approaches that includes more biology, more data and more information, moving from 'less is more' to 'From Less to More!' Philosophical Difference and Advanced Computation in Architectural Theory is an influential read for students and academics of architectural theory, computational design and related areas"--
