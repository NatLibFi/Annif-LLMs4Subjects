Applied polymer science
This companion volume to “Fundamental Polymer Science” (Gedde and Hedenqvist, 2019) offers detailed insights from leading practitioners into experimental methods, simulation and modelling, mechanical and transport properties, processing, and sustainability issues. Separate chapters are devoted to thermal analysis, microscopy, spectroscopy, scattering methods, and chromatography. Special problems and pitfalls related to the study of polymers are addressed. Careful editing for consistency and cross-referencing among the chapters, high-quality graphics, worked-out examples, and numerous references to the specialist literature make “Applied Polymer Science” an essential reference for advanced students and practicing chemists, physicists, and engineers who want to solve problems with the use of polymeric materials. .
