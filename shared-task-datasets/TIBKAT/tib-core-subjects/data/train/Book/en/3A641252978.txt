Thermal measurements and inverse techniques
"The use of inverse problems constitutes a new research paradigm in which groups of theoretical, computational, and experimental researchers synergistically interact to better understand the physical phenomena being studied. This book presents a comprehensive research-based survey of modern inverse techniques and their applications to engineering heat transfer. Written by top-notch contributors, the text provides a concise, single-source reference on the mathematical modeling, measurements, and solution of inverse problems in heat transfer. It covers topics such as multiscale modeling, thermophysical properties, heat flux, and temperature measurements"--
