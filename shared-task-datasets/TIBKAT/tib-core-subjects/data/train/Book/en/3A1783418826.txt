Odour in textiles : generation and control
"Odour in textiles : generation and control presents the essential science and mechanisms behind the formation of odours in textiles. It discusses consumer perception of odour in clothing, the mechanism of odour formation in the skin, and the role of textile fibres and structures in odour formation. It also discusses odour controls and testing methods available for measurement of odours in textiles. This text : fills a gap in the literature as the first book focused on textile and odour interaction, discusses microbiological aspects of odour formation in simple terms, details the role of textile fibres and structures on odour formation, and describes various testing methods, standards, and regulatory norms for odour analysis. The book will appeal to a broad audience including industry professionals in the textiles industry, hygiene and health care, chemical and finishing industry, and odour measurement and testing. It will also interest advanced students and research scholars studying textile engineering, clothing science, and fashion design"--
