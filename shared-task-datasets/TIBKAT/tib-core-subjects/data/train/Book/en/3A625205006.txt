Digital signal processing : system analysis and design
Building on the success of the original, this edition includes new material on random signal processing, a new chapter on spectral estimation, greatly expanded coverage of filter banks and wavelets, and new material on the solution of difference equations.  Additional steps in mathematical derivation make them easier to follow, and an important new feature is the Do-it-yourself section at the end of each chapter, where readers get hands-on experience of solving practical signal processing problems in a range of MATLABÂ® experiments--Cover
