Big data analytics in fog-enabled IoT networks : towards a privacy and security perspective
"Integration of Fog computing with the resource limited IoT network, formulate the concept of Fog-enabled IoT system. Due to large number of deployments of IoT devices, a IoT is a main source of Big data and a very high volume of sensing data is generated by IoT system such as smart cities and smart grid applications. To provide a fast and efficient data analytics solution for Fog-enabled IoT system is a very fundamental research issue. This book focus on Big data Analytics in Fog-enabled-IoT system and provides a comprehensive collection of chapters that are touches different issues related to Healthcare system, Cyber threat detection, Malware detection, security and privacy of big IoT data and IoT network. This book emphasizes and facilitate a greater understanding of various security and privacy approaches using the advance AI and Big data technologies like machine/deep learning, federated learning, blockchain, edge computing and the countermeasures to overcome the vulnerabilities of the Fog-enabled IoT system"--
