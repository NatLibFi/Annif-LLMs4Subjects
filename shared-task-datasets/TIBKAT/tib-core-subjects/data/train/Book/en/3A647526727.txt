Transient Chaos : Complex Dynamics on Finite Time Scales
The aim of this Book is to give an overview, based on the results of nearly three decades of intensive research, of transient chaos. One belief that motivates us to write this book is that, transient chaos may not have been appreciated even within the nonlinear-science community, let alone other scientific disciplines.
