Advanced newtonian rigid dynamics
This book discusses topics on D’Alembert’s principle, virtual work, Eulerian angles, Lagrange’s equation in generalized coordinates and motion of a top. Momental ellipsoid of a point of a rigid body and conservation principle of angular momentum are discussed in detail. This is an essential textbook on Newtonian rigid dynamics, useful for advanced undergraduate and graduate students of physics, mathematics and engineering. This book contains solutions to more than 350 examples as well as more than 350 figures, which are nicely explaining the concept of rigid dynamics. Necessary mathematics have been created at the spot where they are needed. .
