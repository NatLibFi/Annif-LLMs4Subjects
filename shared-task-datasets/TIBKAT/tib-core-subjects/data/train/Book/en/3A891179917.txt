Atom projects : events and people
"This book is a collection of personal memories about the people who participated in the USSR atomic project -- Landau, Alikhanov, Pomeranchuk, Alikhanian, Migdal Jr., Gribov, Zeldovich, Sakharov, Kurchatov, Vannikov, Eldian. As the author is the only living person who was involved in the project, these personal recollections are interesting and unique for a broad audience who has been unfamiliar with the details so far"--
