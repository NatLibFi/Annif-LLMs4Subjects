This volumes presents the proceedings of the FASMI 2020 conference, held at Taipei Veterans General Hospital on November 20-22, 2020. It presents contributions on all aspects of molecular imaging, discovered by leading academic scientists and researchers. It also provides a premier interdisciplinary treatment of recent innovations, trend, and concerns as well as practical challenges and solutions in Molecular Imaging and put an emphasis on Artificial Intelligence applied to Imaging Data. FASMI is the annual meeting of the Federation of Asian Societies for Molecular Imaging.
