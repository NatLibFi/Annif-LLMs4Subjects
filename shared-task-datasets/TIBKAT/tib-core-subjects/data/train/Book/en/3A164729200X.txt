The Growth Hormone/Insulin-Like Growth Factor Axis During Development
Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I is a widely expressed growth factor with diverse effects on many tissues throughout development and in adult life. The purpose of this work is to provide detailed and updated information on the role of the growth hormone (GH)-IGF axis in fetal and postnatal development, as well as its physiological functions and implications in pathology.
