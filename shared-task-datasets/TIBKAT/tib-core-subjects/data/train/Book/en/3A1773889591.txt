Fracture mechanics
Fracture Mechanics is a graduate level text/professional reference that describes the analytical methods used to derive stress and strain functions related to fracture mechanics. The focus of the book will be on modeling and problem solving as tools to be used in interpreting the meaning of a mathematical solution for a particular engineering problem or situation. Once this is accomplished, the reader should be able to think mathematically, foresee metallurgically the significance of microstructural parameters on properties, analyze the mechanical behavior of materials, and recognize realistically how dangerous a crack is in a stressed structure, which may fail catastrophically. This book differs from others in that the subject matter is organized around the modeling and predicating approaches that are used to explain the detrimental effects of crack growth events. Thus, this book will take a more practical approach and make it especially useful as a basic reference for professional engineers.
