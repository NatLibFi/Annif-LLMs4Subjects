Modern churches in Sweden
Modern Churches' in Sweden features some thirty churches built between 1940 and 2014, a period characterized by innovative thinking in both ecclesiastical architecture and liturgy. The book focuses on the architecture?from more well-known buildings such as Sigurd Lewerentz?s St. Peter?s in Klippan to contemporary works like the Tureberg Church in Sollentuna, whose sustainable approach is expressed in an altar made of scrap lumber and chair fabric made from plastic bottles. We also find examples of extraordinary design strategies, such as Vikmanshyttan Church, whose design is inspired by the blast furnace and smithy that frame the everyday toil of the local population
