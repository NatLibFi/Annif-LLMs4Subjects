Notes on projectile impact analyses
This book presents comprehensive experimental, numerical, and theoretical research on projectile impact analysis, such as the rigid projectile penetration/perforation of concrete and metallic targets, and shaped-charge-formed projectile and jet penetrations. Concrete and metal materials are widely used in protective structures in both civil engineering and armored vehicles, such as military fortifications, underground shelters, infantry fighting vehicles, and tanks, which are designed to withstand intentional or accidental impact loadings caused by projectiles and fragments, and the responses of these targets under projectile impact have been a topic of discussion for several decades. Written for researchers and engineers working in the fields of protective structures and high-speed penetration mechanics, the book is also a valuable reference for senior undergraduate and postgraduate students majoring in defense engineering, terminal ballistics and other related fields
