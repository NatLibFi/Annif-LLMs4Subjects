Graphite, graphene, and their polymer nanocomposites
"Perhaps the first of its kind, this book covers physics, chemistry, and applications of graphene relevant to this important and hot research topic. Covering the entire spectrum of graphene-based materials topics, from synthesis to characterization to applications, this state-of-the-art book provides the point of departure for future polymer-based nanocomposites research. The chapter authors, drawn from experts from around the globe, summarize their recent research and provide their perspective for the future by drawing attention to the challenges that must be addressed before research results are fully integrated into the next generation of science and engineering applications. Whether you are a newcomer or a veteran of a few years to this exciting new form of carbon research in the area of polymer nanocomposites, this book provides timely and essential reference reading material"--
"Here we go again. After intercalated compounds of graphite (1974), fullerenes (1985), and carbon nanotubes (1991), it is time for another allotrope of elemental carbon to be at the forefront of scientific curiosity. The allotrope is: "graphene". By graphene, we mean the basal plane of graphite, a one atom thick two dimensional honeycomb layer of sp2 bonded carbon. Conversely, when many graphene layers are stacked regularly in three dimensions, graphite is created"--
