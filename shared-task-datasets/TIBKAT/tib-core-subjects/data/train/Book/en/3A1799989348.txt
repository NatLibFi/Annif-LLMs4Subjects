Unearthing Fermi's geophysics : based on Enrico Fermi's geophysics lectures of 1941
"Nobel Prize-winning physicist Enrico Fermi (1901-1954) is known for his work on experimental particle physics, quantum theory, and statistical mechanics; his contributions to the Manhattan Project during World War II; and for his particular ability to condense complicated problems into approximations for understanding and testing theory in a variety of scientific disciplines. This book is unusual for two reasons; first it is essentially a reconstructed course book from Fermi's notes by two physics professors, Gino Segr√® and John Stack, including photographic facsimiles of Fermi's handwritten calculations. Second, it is on a topic, geophysics, that we do not usually associate with Fermi"--
