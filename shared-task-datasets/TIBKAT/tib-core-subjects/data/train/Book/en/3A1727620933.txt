Defect-Mediated Degradation of Diffusion Barriers
The wide practical use of the diffusion barrier phenomenon in the various areas of science and modern engineering is impossible without the studying of all aspects of their creation, functioning and degradation. The present monograph covers a specific and important aspect of the diffusion barriers damaging process - the deleterious effect of atomic-scale defects in the structure of diffusion barriers. Diffusion, Diffusion Coefficient, Diffusion Barriers, Atomic-Scale Defects, Films, Layers, Deposition, Coatings Materials Science
