Conformal Geometry of Surfaces in S4 and Quaternions
The conformal geometry of surfaces recently developed by the authors leads to a unified understanding of algebraic curve theory and the geometry of surfaces on the basis of a quaternionic-valued function theory. The book offers an elementary introduction to the subject but takes the reader to rather advanced topics. Willmore surfaces in the foursphere, their BÃ¤cklund and Darboux transforms are covered, and a new proof of the classification of Willmore spheres is given
