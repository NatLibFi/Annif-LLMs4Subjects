The finite element method for mechanics of solids with ANSYS applications
"The finite element method (FEM) has become the standard method used by engineers for the solution of static and dynamic problems for elastic and inelastic structures and machines. This volume explores the theory behind the method and instruction in use of ANSYS, a commonly used commercial finite element program. Totally, self contained, the book provides the necessary background on solid mechanics (elasticity, plasticity, viscoelasticity) and mathematics. It includes theory and examples and contains detailed instructions for solutions using ANSYS for small and large deformation elasticity, plasticity, viscoelasicity, vibrations, wave propagation, fracture mechanics, building, plates and shells, and contact problems"--
"The purpose of this book is to explain the application of finite the element method to problems in the mechanics of solids. It is intended for practicing engineers who use the finite element method for stress analysis and for graduate students in engineering who want to understand the finite element method for their research. It is also designed to be a textbook for a graduate course in engineering. The application of the finite element method is illustrated by using the ANSYSÊ¼ computer program. Step by step instructions for the use of ANSYS APDL and ANSYS Workbench in more than 40 examples are included. The required background material in the mechanics of solids is provided so that the work is self-contained for the knowledgeable reader. A more complete treatment of solid mechanics is provided in the book: Continuum Mechanics: Elasticity, Plasticity, Viscoelasticity, by Ellis H. Dill, CRC Press, 2007. References to that book are abbreviated by 'Dill: Chapter --'"--
