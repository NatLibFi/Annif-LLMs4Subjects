Measurement of mobile antenna systems
This resource provides in-depth examinations of all relevant mobile antenna measurement theories, along with practical measurement procedures and examples. Topics include propagation measurement, antenna characteristics measurement, radiation power measurement, human interaction measurement, base station siting and maintenance, and fading and field simulator systems. This thoroughly revised and updated second edition presents critical new material in key areas, including radiation efficiency measurement, mobile phone usage position, and MIMO (multiple-input/multiple-output) antennas. --
