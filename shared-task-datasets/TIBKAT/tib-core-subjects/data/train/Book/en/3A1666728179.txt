(Almost) Impossible Integrals, Sums, and Series
This book contains a multitude of challenging problems and solutions that are not commonly found in classical textbooks. One goal of the book is to present these fascinating mathematical problems in a new and engaging way and illustrate the connections between integrals, sums, and series, many of which involve zeta functions, harmonic series, polylogarithms, and various other special functions and constants. Throughout the book, the reader will find both classical and new problems, with numerous original problems and solutions coming from the personal research of the author. Where classical problems are concerned, such as those given in Olympiads or proposed by famous mathematicians like Ramanujan, the author has come up with new, surprising or unconventional ways of obtaining the desired results. The book begins with a lively foreword by renowned author Paul Nahin and is accessible to those with a good knowledge of calculus from undergraduate students to researchers, and will appeal to all mathematical puzzlers who love a good integral or series
