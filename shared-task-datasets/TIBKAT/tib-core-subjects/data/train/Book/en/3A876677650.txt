Advanced integrated communication microsystems
Learn the fundamentals of integrated communication microsystems Advanced communication microsystems—the latest technology to emerge in the semiconductor sector after microprocessors—require integration of diverse signal processing blocks in a power-efficient and cost-effective manner. Typically, these systems include data acquisition, data processing, telemetry, and power management. The overall development is a synergy among system, circuit, and component-level designs with a strong emphasis on integration. This book is targeted at students, researchers, and industry practitioners in the semiconductor area who require a thorough understanding of integrated communication microsystems from a developer's perspective. The book thoroughly and carefully explores: . Fundamental requirements of communication microsystems. System design and considerations for wired and wireless communication microsystems. Advanced block-level design techniques for communication microsystems. Integration of communication systems in a hybrid environment. Packaging considerations. Power and form factor trade-offs in building integrated microsystems Advanced Integrated Communication Microsystems is an ideal textbook for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses. It also serves as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in circuit design for telecommunications and related fields
