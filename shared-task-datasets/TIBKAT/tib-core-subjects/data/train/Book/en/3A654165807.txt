Coordinate measuring machines and systems
"Since John Bosh edited and published the first version of this book in 1995 the world of manufacturing and Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs) and Systems has changed considerably. In addition to two new editors, one from academia and one from a metrology intensive user industry, this second edition has many new authors and a known cadre of experts who have grown with the field since the last version. The well-rounded coverage includes the evolution of measurements and development of standards, the use of CMMs, accessory elements, application software, performance and financial evaluations, and accuracy"--
