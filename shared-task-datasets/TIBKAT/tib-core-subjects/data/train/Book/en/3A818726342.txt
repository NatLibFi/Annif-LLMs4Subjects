Hydrogen Production : by Electrolysis
Covering the various aspects of this fast-evolving field, thiscomprehensive book includes the fundamentals and a comparison ofcurrent applications, while focusing on the latest, novelachievements and future directions. The introductory chapters explore the thermodynamic andelectrochemical processes to better understand how electrolysiscells work, and how these can be combined to build largeelectrolysis modules. The book then goes on to discuss theelectrolysis process and the characteristics, advantages,drawbacks, and challenges of the main existing electrolysistechnologies. Current manufacturers and the main features ofcommercially available electrolyzers are extensively reviewed. Thefinal chapters then present the possible configurations forintegrating water electrolysis units with renewable energy sourcesin both autonomous and grid-connected systems, and comment on somerelevant demonstration projects.  Written by an internationally renowned team from academia andindustry, the result is an invaluable review of the field and adiscussion of known limitations and future perspectives.
