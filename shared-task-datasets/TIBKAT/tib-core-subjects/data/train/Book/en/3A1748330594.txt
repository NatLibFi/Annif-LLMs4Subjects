An engineer's guide to automated testing of high-speed interfaces
Providing a complete introduction to the state-of-the-art in high-speed digital testing with automated test equipment (ATE), this practical resource is the first book to focus exclusively on this increasingly important topic. Featuring clear examples, this one-stop reference covers all critical aspects of the subject, from high-speed digital basics, ATE instrumentation for digital applications, and test and measurements, to production testing, support instrumentation and text fixture design. This in-depth volume also discusses advanced ATE topics, such as multiplexing of ATE pin channels and testing of high-speed bi-directional interfaces with fly-by approaches
