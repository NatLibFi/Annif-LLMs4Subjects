Wearable solar cell systems
"Wearable Solar Cell Systems looks at possibilities for supporting the energy demand of electronic devices without the need to return to the dreaded wall outlet for recharging. While crystalline silicon dominates world markets, second or third generation solar cell technologies may be more suitable to wearable systems. Array size, architecture, and management must also be chosen to best serve portable and wearable devices and harvest light energy from different light sources. This book is useful for students who desire a basic introduction to solar cell technology and also for professionals seeking a holistic picture of wearable solar cells and systems"--
