Distilled spirits
"Distilled Spirits is the "go-to" guide for identifying the best practices and options available for distilled spirits product development. The book is a valuable reference for current and prospective distillers, including researchers in distilling and chemical engineering and students brewing and distilling programs. With an increase in the number of new start distilleries, the need for guidance on distilled spirits production has risen dramatically. This book examines the impact of raw materials and production processes on spirit quality, flavor and aroma compounds, and as indicators of poor quality. The book covers the entire production process, derivation of flavor and aroma compounds, definition of spirit quality, and identification of defects for Scotch whiskey, vodka, rum, and gin."--Publisher's website
