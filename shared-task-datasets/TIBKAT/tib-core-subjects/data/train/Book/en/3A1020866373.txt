Modern missile guidance
"Missile Guidance, Second Edition provides a timely survey of missile control and guidance theory, based on extensive work the author has done using the Lyapunov approach. This new edition also presents the Lyapunov-Bellman approach for choosing optimal parameters of the guidance laws, and direct and inverse optimal problems are considered. This material is important for readers working in the area of optimization and optimal theory. This edition also contains updated coverage of guidance and control system components, since the efficiency of guidance laws depends on their realization. The text concludes with information on the new generation of intercept systems now in development."--Provided by publisher
