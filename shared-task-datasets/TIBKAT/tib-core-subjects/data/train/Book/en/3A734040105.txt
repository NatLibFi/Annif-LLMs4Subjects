The challenges of dam removal and river restoration
"River restoration is a societal goal in the United States. This collection of research articles focuses on our current understanding of the impacts of removing dams and the role of dam removal in the larger context of river restoration. The papers are grouped by topic: (1) assessment of existing dams, strategies to determine impounded legacy sediments, and evaluating whether or not to remove the dam; (2) case studies of the hydrologic, sediment, and ecosystem impacts of recent dam removals; (3) assessment of river restoration by modifying flows or removing dams; and (4) the concept of river restoration in the context of historical changes in river systems"--Provided by publisher
