Macroalgal biorefineries for the blue economy
Why going to seagriculture? The need for new sources of biomass for bioeconomy and what can seas offer to humanity -- Blue economy and marine biorefinery -- Marine macroalgae -- What is macroalgae biorefinery? -- Environmental impacts of seaweed aquaculture -- The marine biomass feedstock -- Downstream processing -- Examples of applications -- Economics of macroalgae biorefineries.
"This unique compendium provides an insight into the role of emerging marine biorefineries based on macroalgae (seaweeds) in the development of a sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth-blue economy. The useful reference text shows a complete picture on the motivation to develop seaweed technologies, and how the combination of biology, cultivation technologies and downstream processing with economics can address the social challenges through the blue growth"--
