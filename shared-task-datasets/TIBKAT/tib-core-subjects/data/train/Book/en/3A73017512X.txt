Optical magnetometry
"Featuring chapters written by leading experts in magnetometry, this book provides comprehensive coverage of the principles, technology and diverse applications of optical magnetometry, from testing fundamental laws of nature to detecting biomagnetic fields and medical diagnostics. Readers will find a wealth of technical information, from antirelaxation-coating techniques, microfabrication and magnetic shielding to geomagnetic-field measurements, space magnetometry, detection of biomagnetic fields, detection of NMR and MRI signals and rotation sensing. The book includes an original survey of the history of optical magnetometry and a chapter on the commercial use of these technologies. The book is supported by extensive online material, containing historical overviews, derivations, sideline discussion, additional plots and tables, available at www.cambridge.org/9781107010352. As well as introducing graduate students to this field, the book is also a useful reference for researchers in atomic physics"--
