Functional polymers for nanomedicine
Interest in the application of nanotechnology to medicine has surged in recent years and could transform the way we diagnose, treat and prevent diseases such as cancer. However, the clinical success of nanomedicine is limited because of problems with toxicity and therapeutic efficacy. To overcome this it is essential to produce new nanosystems with specific functions, which can be achieved by designing new polymers with particular properties that can be used for nanomedicine. Functional Polymers for Nanomedicine provides a complete overview of the different strategies for designing polymers fo
