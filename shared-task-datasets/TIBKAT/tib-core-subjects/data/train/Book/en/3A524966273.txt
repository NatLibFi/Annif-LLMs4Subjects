Validation in Chemical Measurement
The validation of analytical methods is based on the characterisation of a measurement procedure (selectivity, sensitivity, repeatability, reproducibility). This volume collects 31 outstanding papers on the topic, mostly published in the period 2000-2003 in the journal 'Accreditation and Quality Assurance'. They provide the latest understanding, and possibly the rationale why it is important to integrate the concept of validation into the standard procedures of every analytical laboratory. In addition, this anthology considers the benefits to both: the analytical laboratory and the user of the measurement results.
