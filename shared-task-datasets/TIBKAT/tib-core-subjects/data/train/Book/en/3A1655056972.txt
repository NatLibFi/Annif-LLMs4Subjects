Topological Vector Spaces : Chapters 1–5
This is a softcover reprint of the English translation of 1987 of the second edition of Bourbaki's Espaces Vectoriels Topologiques (1981). This Äsecond editionÜ is a brand new book and completely supersedes the original version of nearly 30 years ago. But a lot of the material has been rearranged, rewritten, or replaced by a more up-to-date exposition, and a good deal of new material has been incorporated in this book, all reflecting the progress made in the field during the last three decades. Table of Contents. Chapter I: Topological vector spaces over a valued field. Chapter II: Convex sets and locally convex spaces. Chapter III: Spaces of continuous linear mappings. Chapter IV: Duality in topological vector spaces. Chapter V: Hilbert spaces (elementary theory). Finally, there are the usual "historical note", bibliography, index of notation, index of terminology, and a list of some important properties of Banach spaces. (Based on Math Reviews, 1983)
