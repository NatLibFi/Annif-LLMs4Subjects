Convex functions, partial orderings, and statistical applications
This research-level book presents up-to-date information concerning recent developments in convex functions and partial orderings and some applications in mathematics, statistics, and reliability theory. The book will serve researchers in mathematical and statistical theory and theoretical and applied reliabilists. Key Features * Presents classical and newly published results on convex functions and related inequalities * Explains partial ordering based on arrangement and their applications in mathematics, probability, statsitics, and reliability * Demonstrates the connection of partial ordering with other well-known orderings such as majorization and Schur functions * Will generate further research and applications
