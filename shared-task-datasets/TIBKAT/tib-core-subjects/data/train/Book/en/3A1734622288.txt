Designing Internet of Things solutions with Microsoft Azure : a survey of secure and smart industrial applications
Build a strong and efficient IoT solution at industrial and enterprise level by mastering industrial IoT using Microsoft Azure. This book focuses on the development of the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) paradigm, discussing various architectures, as well as providing nine case studies employing IoT in common industrial domains including medical, supply chain, finance, and smart homes. The book starts by giving you an overview of the basic concepts of IoT, after which you will go through the various offerings of the Microsoft Azure IoT platform and its services. Next, you will get hands-on experience of IoT applications in various industries to give you a better picture of industrial solutions and how you should take your industry forward. As you progress through the chapters, you will learn real-time applications in IoT in agriculture, supply chain, financial services, retail, and transportation. Towards the end, you will gain knowledge to identify and analyze IoT security and privacy risks along with a detailed sample project. The book fills an important gap in the learning of IoT and its practical use case in your industry. Therefore, this is a practical guide that helps you discover the technologies and use cases for IIoT. By the end of this book, you will be able to build industrial IoT solution in Microsoft Azure with sensors, stream analytics, and serverless technologies. You will: Provision, configure, and connect devices with Microsoft Azure IoT hub Stream analytics using structural data and non-structural data such as images Use stream analytics, serverless technology, and IoT SaaS offerings Work with common sensors and IoT devices.
