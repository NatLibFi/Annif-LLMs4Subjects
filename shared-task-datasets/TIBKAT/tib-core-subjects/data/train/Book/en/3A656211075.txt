Copper-oxygen chemistry
"This newest volume in the Wiley Series on Reactive Intermediates in Chemistry and Biology deals with the subject of oxidative processes mediated by copper ions within biological systems. The book addresses the significantly increasing literature on oxygen-atom insertion and carbon-carbon bond forming reactions as well as enantioselective oxidation chemistries. It covers a wide array of reaction types such as insertion and dehydrogenation reactions that utilize the cheap, abundant, and energy-containing the O2 molecule and progresses from biological systems to spectroscopy and related theory to bioinorganic models and applications"--Provided by publisher
"This book is divided into three logical areas within the topic of Copper/Oxygen Chemistry: Biological Systems, Spectroscopy and Theory, and Bioinorganic Models and Applications"--Provided by publisher
