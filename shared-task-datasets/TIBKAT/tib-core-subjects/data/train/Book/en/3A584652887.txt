Flash of genius : and other true stories of invention
"In Flash of Genius, I explore the moment when inspiration strikes in an otherwise average life, and what happens when that idea moves out into the larger culture and takes on a life - and commercial possibilities - of its own. The title piece in this collection is the David v. Goliath story of Bob Kearns, a professor and inventor who came up with something we all use every chance we get: the intermittent windshield wiper. When Kearns' patents were infringed, he fought General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, and eventually prevailed in a classic American story of never giving up, never backing down. It has been made into a major motion picture starring Greg Kinnear."
