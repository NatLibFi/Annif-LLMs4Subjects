Principles and modern applications of mass transfer operations
"A staple in any chemical engineering curriculum the New edition has a stronger emphasis on membrane separations, chromatography and other adsorptive processes, ion exchange  Discusses many developing topics in more depth in mass transfer operations, especially in the biological engineering area  Covers in more detail phase equilibrium since distillation calculations are completely dependent on this principle  Integrates computational software and problems using Mathcad  Features 25-30 problems per chapter"--
