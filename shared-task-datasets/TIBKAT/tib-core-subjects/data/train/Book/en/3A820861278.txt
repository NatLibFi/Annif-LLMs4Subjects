Dynamic power supply transmitters : envelope tracking, direct polar, and hybrid combinations
"Power is dissipated (lost) when this current flows through any resistance, which includes the amplifier's transistor. This dissipated power is the product of the current in the load times the voltage difference between the supply voltage to the amplifier and the output signal voltage. When the voltage supplied to the amplifier is a constant value, and by far the most common design practice, the situation in Fig. 1-2a results. Power dissipation in the amplifier is maximum when the output signal voltage is 1/2 of the supply voltage. When the output signal voltage is higher, even though the current value is larger the voltage drop is less and the power dissipation is lower. Similarly, when the output signal voltage is small, even though the voltage drop is now large the current in the load is smaller and again the power dissipation is lower"--
