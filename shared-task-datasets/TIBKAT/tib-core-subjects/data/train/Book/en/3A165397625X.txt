Mathematics for Natural Scientists : Fundamentals and Basics
I. Fundamentals -- Basic Knowledge -- Functions -- II. Basics -- Derivatives -- Integral -- Functions of Many Variables: Differentiation -- Functions of Many Variables: Integration -- Infinite Numerical and Functional Series -- Ordinary Differential Equations.
This book, the first in a two part series, covers a course of mathematics tailored specifically for physics, engineering and chemistry students at the undergraduate level. It is unique in that it begins with logical concepts of mathematics first encountered at A-level and covers them in thorough detail, filling in the gaps in students' knowledge and reasoning. Then the book aids the leap between A-level and university-level mathematics, with complete proofs provided throughout and all complex mathematical concepts and techniques presented in a clear and transparent manner. Numerous examples and problems (with answers) are given for each section and, where appropriate, mathematical concepts are illustrated in a physics context. This text gives an invaluable foundation to students and a comprehensive aid to lecturers. Mathematics for Natural Scientists: Fundamentals and Basics is the first of two volumes. Advanced topics and their applications in physics are covered in the second volume.
