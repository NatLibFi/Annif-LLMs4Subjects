Essentials of piezoelectric energy harvesting
"Piezoelectric energy is a renewable alternative energy source that operates on a smaller scale than renewable energy generation plants which generate Mega-Giga Watts of power. Its potential to "eliminate" contemporary batteries, which are classified as hazardous wastes, makes it an important technological advancement in a world increasingly concerned about eliminating waste, increasing sustainability and shifting to more "green" consumption habits. Authored by a pioneer of piezoelectric actuators and piezoelectric energy harvesting, this unique compendium provides a solid theoretical background of piezoelectrics, practical material selection, device design optimization, and energy harvesting electric circuits. Included in each chapter are a list of chapter essentials, check points, example problems and solutions, and practice problems. Written for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, university researchers, and industry engineers studying or working in the field of piezoelectric energy harvesting systems, the useful reference text provides readers with the essential knowledge to conduct research and raises readers' awareness of known pitfalls and mis-directions in the field"--
