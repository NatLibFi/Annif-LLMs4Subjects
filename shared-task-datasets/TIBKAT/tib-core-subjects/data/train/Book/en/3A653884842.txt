Dark matter, neutrinos, and our solar system
This book describes these issues in terms of links, between cosmology, particle and nuclear physics, as well as between cosmology, atmospheric and terrestrial physics. It studies the constituents of dark matter (classified as hot warm and cold) first in terms of their individual structures, and second, in terms of facilities available to detect these structures. Neutrinos are treated as a separate entity. The last chapter details the real-time stories about the "regions" that were not explored thus far, for lack of advanced technology. Their untold stories (which span up to 2010) are illustrated here datewise in full. The book concludes with the latest news that the Large Hadron Collider team at CERN has finally succeeded in producing 7 trillion electronic Volts of energy by creating head-on-collisions of protons and more protons (in search of God-particle)
