Mining haul roads : theory and practice
"Mining operations may be classified into surface mining and underground operations where mining takes place in tunnels and galleries. In both situations roads play a key role as a typical mining operation consists of moving overburden and ore from where the material was formed or deposited to waste dumps or beneficiation plants. This book approaches the subject of how to design, build and operate mine haul roads from the perspectives of safety, economy and technical requirements over the life of a mine. Consideration is given to the geometrical, structural, functional and maintenance management aspects of design and construction, from both theoretical and practical viewpoints"--
