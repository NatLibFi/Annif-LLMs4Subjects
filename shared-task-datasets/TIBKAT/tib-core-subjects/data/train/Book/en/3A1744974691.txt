Creative cities, cultural clusters and local economic development
This book analyses the economic development of cities from the 'cultural economy' and 'creative industry' perspectives, examining and differentiating them as two related but distinct segments of contemporary city economies. The authors argue that although they are normally conflated, the first is largely subsidized while the second is highly entrepreneurial hence they actually make very different kinds of contribution to a city's character, attractiveness and competitiveness
