Organic acids in geological processes
This book provides an overview of an extremely active field of research. From the weathering of surface outcrops to the development of secondary porosity in sedimentary rocks, organic acids have a profound effect on geologic processes. The contributing authors provide both a historical perspective for this important research topic, and discuss in detail the specific role that organic acids play in a variety of geologic environments
