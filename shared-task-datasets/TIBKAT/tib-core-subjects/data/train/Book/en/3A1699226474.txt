Biharmonic submanifolds and biharmonic maps in Riemannian geometry
"Written by two experts in the subject, this is the first book that gives a comprehensive survey on the study of biharmonic submanifolds and maps. Includes detailed proofs of most important results and the relations among various directions in the study of the subject. It is useful to researchers who have been working on the subject or the related topics as well as to graduate students or new researchers who have an interest in studying the subject and the related topics since the book also provides basic knowledge and tools used in the study of biharmonic maps and submanifolds"--
