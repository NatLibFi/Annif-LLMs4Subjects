Optical techniques in regenerative medicine
"This book is focused on the optical techniques that can be applied to regenerative medicine, including optical coherence tomography, acousto-optic imaging, Raman spectroscopy, machine vision, polarized light imaging, fibre optic sensors, second harmonic generation, multi-photon microscopy, coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, and polarized light imaging. It covers applications both in fundamental research and in the regenerative medicine industry for tissue engineering products. Each chapter gives an overview of a particular technique, its advantages and limitations in terms of structural and functional information provided, and examples of applications in regenerative medicine. The book provides a practical guide to the most appropriate techniques for a given application. It also offers a summary of major recent advances, such as use of machine vision for tracking growth of three-dimensional constructs in bioreactors and polarization sensitive optical coherence tomography for monitoring collagen alignment in cartilage growth"--Provided by publisher
