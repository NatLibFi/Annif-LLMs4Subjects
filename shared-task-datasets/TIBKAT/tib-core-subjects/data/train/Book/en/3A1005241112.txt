Database reliability engineering : designing and operating resilient database systems
The infrastructure-as-code revolution in IT is also affecting database administration. With this practical book, developers, system administrators, and junior to mid-level DBAs will learn how the modern practice of site reliability engineering applies to the craft of database architecture and operations. Authors Laine Campbell and Charity Majors provide a framework for professionals looking to join the ranks of today's database reliability engineers (DBRE).   You'll begin by exploring core operational concepts that DBREs need to master. Then you'll examine a wide range of database persistence options, including how to implement key technologies to provide resilient, scalable, and performant data storage and retrieval. With a firm foundation in database reliability engineering, you'll be ready to dive into the architecture and operations of any modern database.   This book covers:   Service-level requirements and risk management  Building and evolving an architecture for operational visibility  Infrastructure engineering and infrastructure management  How to facilitate the release management process  Data storage, indexing, and replication  Identifying datastore characteristics and best use cases  Datastore architectural components and data-driven architectures
