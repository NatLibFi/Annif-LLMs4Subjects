Vibro-acoustics : fundamentals and applications
"The subject of vibro-acoustics is important for the better design of machine elements and structures, to minimize sound generated by them. In view of the design cycles of machines becoming shorter, designers need to design quiet machines at the drawing-board stage rather than applying "band-aid" techniques after the machine has been built. Those interested in low-frequency vibration are generally concerned with the modal approach of using natural frequencies and mode shapes, whereas those interested in vibro-acoustics in medium and high frequencies are generally concerned with the wave approach. Since both approaches have their advantages, it is a good idea to study both together to get the best out of them. This is useful for a better understanding of the physics of vibro-acoustics. Written for students and professionals, this book systematically integrates the relevant aspects of vibro-acoustics from various viewpoints and Covers fundamental aspects of noise and vibration along with statistical energy analysis (SEA) Discusses both modal and wave approaches for studying dynamic systems Simplifies circuit theory concepts Provides a solid understanding of the physics of vibro-acoustics through seamless integration of vibration and acoustics Offers guidance for professionals in using SEA software"--
