The chemistry of evolution : the development of our ecosystem
1. The evolution of earth-the geochemical partner of the global ecosystem (5 billion years of history) -- 2. Basic chemistry of the ecosystem -- 3. Energy, order and disorder, and organised systems -- 4. Outline of biological chemical principles : components, pathways and controls -- 5. First steps in evolution of prokaryotes : anaerobic chemotypes four to three billion years ago -- 6. The evolution of protoaerobic and aerobic prokaryote chemotypes (three to two billion years ago) -- 7. Unicellular eukaryotes chemotypes (about one and a half billion years ago?) -- 8. Multi-cellular eukaryote chemotypes (from one billion years ago) -- 9. The evolution of chemotypes with nerves and a brain (0.5 billion years ago to today) -- 10. Evolution due to mankind : a completely novel chemotype (less than one hundred thousand years ago) -- 11. Conclusion : the inevitable factors in evolution
