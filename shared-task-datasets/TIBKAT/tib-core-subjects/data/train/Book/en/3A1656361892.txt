Structure Theory for Canonical Classes of Finite Groups
The F-hypercentre and its generalizations -- Groups with given systems of X-permutable subgroups -- Between complement and supplement -- Groups with given maximal chains of subgroups -- Formations and Fitting classes
This book offers a systematic introduction to recent achievements and development in research on the structure of finite non-simple groups, the theory of classes of groups and their applications. In particular, the related systematic theories are considered and some new approaches and research methods are described - e.g., the F-hypercenter of groups, X-permutable subgroups, subgroup functors, generalized supplementary subgroups, quasi-F-group, and F-cohypercenter for Fitting classes. At the end of each chapter, we provide relevant supplementary information and introduce readers to selected open problems
