Photoelectrochemical water splitting : materials, processes and architectures
There has been a resurgence of interest in light-induced water splitting as the search for storable carbon neutral energy becomes more urgent. Although the history of the basic idea dates back more than four decades, efficient, economical and stable integrated devices have yet to be realized. In the continuing quest for such devices, the field of photoelectrochemistry is entering a new phase where the extraordinary interdisciplinary of the research and development efforts are opening new avenues. This aspect of current research effort is reflected in the chapters of this book, which encompass
