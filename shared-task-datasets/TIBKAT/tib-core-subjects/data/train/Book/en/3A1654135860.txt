Astrophysical Black Holes
Preface -- An introduction to astrophysical black holes and their dynamical Production -- Warp propagation in astrophysical discs -- The balance of power: accretion and feedback in stellar mass black Holes -- Observing Supermassive Black Holes across cosmic time: from phenomenology to physics -- Orbital Motion in Galactic Nuclei -- Star Formation and Dynamics in the Galactic Centre -- The effective-one-body approach to the general relativistic two body problem -- Index.
Based on graduate school lectures in contemporary relativity and gravitational physics, this book gives a complete and unified picture of the present status of theoretical and observational properties of astrophysical black holes. The chapters are written by internationally recognized specialists. They cover general theoretical aspects of black hole astrophysics, the theory of accretion and ejection of gas and jets, stellar-sized black holes observed in the Milky Way, the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes in galactic centers and quasars as well as their influence on the dynamics in galactic nuclei. The final chapter addresses analytical relativity of black holes supporting theoretical understanding of the coalescence of black holes as well as being of great relevance in identifying gravitational wave signals. With its introductory chapters the book is aimed at advanced graduate and post-graduate students, but it will also be useful for specialists.
