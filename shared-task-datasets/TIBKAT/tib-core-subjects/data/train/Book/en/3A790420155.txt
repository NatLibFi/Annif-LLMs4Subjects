Antennas : Fundamentals, design, measurement
This is a senior undergraduate or first-year graduate level textbook on antenna fundamentals, design, performance analysis, and measurements. In addition to its use as a formal course textbook, it is well-suited for professional training and self-study by practicing engineers, scientists, and technologists who desire to expand their knowledge of antennas. The book provides a broad coverage of antenna types and phenomena, for operations at very low radio frequencies, as well as frequencies up to those of submillimeter wavelengths. Unlike most university-level antenna textbooks, it does not require prior skills in electromagnetic theory, sophisticated mathematics, or computer programming. An additional feature is the downloadable collection of computer solutions in both Mathcadʾ and MATLABʾ to numerous antenna radiation examples, which can be easily implemented and revised by persons not having prior programming experience
