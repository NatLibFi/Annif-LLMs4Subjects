Net locality : why location matters in a networked world
"The first book to provide an introduction to the new theory of Net Locality and the profound effect on individuals and societies when everything is located or locatable. Describes net locality as an emerging form of location awareness central to all aspects of digital media, from mobile phones to online maps to location-based social networks and games. Warns of the dangers that these technologies can present while also outlining the opportunities and the potential for pro-social developments. Provides a theory of the web, not just mobile devices."--
