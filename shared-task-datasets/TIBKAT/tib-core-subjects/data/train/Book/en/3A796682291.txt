Plant endosomes : methods and protocols
"This book contains a collection of protocols and techniques to analyze in vivo trafficking of endocytic/endosomal cargo, including lipids, fluids, proteins, and ligands, ultrastructural features of endosomes by high-pressure freezing/freeze-substitution and electron tomography, protein-protein interactions in the endosomal and endomembrane system, sorting defects in the transport of vacuolar storage proteins, function conservation of plant endosomal proteins, endosomal traffi cking during plant responses to pathogens, protein composition of endosomes and endocytic vesicles, ubiquitination of endosomal cargo proteins, and identifi cation of novel endosomal components by chemical genomics and proteomics."--
