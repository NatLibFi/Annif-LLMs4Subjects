Practical guide to ICP-MS and other atomic spectroscopy techniques : a tutorial for beginners
"Written by one of the very first practitioners of ICP-MS, a Practical Guide to ICP-MS and Other AS Techniques: A Tutorial for Beginners presents ICP-MS in a completely novel and refreshing way. By comparing it with other complimentary atomic spectroscopy (AS) techniques, it gives the trace element analysis user community a glimpse into why the technique was first developed and how the application landscape has defined its use today, 40 years after it was first commercialized in 1983. What's new in the 4th edition... Updated chapters on the fundamental principles and applications of ICP-MS New chapters on complementary AS techniques including AA, AF, ICP-OES, MIP-AES, XRF, XRD, LIBS, LALI-TOFMS Strategies for reducing errors and contamination with plasma spectrochemical techniques Comparison of collision and reaction cells including triple/multi quad systems Novel approaches to sample digestion Alternative sample introduction accessories Comprehensive glossary of terms used in AS New vendor contact information The book is not only suited for novices and beginners, but also for more experienced analytical scientists who want to know more about recent ICP-MS developments and where the technique might be heading in the future. Furthermore, it offers much needed guidance on how best to evaluate commercial AS instrumentation and what might be the best technique, based on your lab's specific application demands"--
