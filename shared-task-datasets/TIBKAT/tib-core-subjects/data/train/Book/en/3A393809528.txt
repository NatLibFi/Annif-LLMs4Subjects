Flow and transport in fractured porous media : with 65 tables
This book addresses the characterization of flow and transport in porous fractured media from experimental and modeling perspective. The volume explores porous media problems, from the origin of the present natural porous structures, to their characterization, and various flow and transport phenomena that exist within the porous media. Examples are miscible displacements in porous media and fractured rock and the physical and chemical interactions within porous fractured aquifers. The book is a comprehensive presentation of investigations performed and analysed on different scales, supporting the understanding and application of experimental studies and numerical simulations.
