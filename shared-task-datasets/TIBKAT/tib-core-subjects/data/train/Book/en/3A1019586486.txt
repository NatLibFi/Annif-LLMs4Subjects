"Taking a thematic and theoretical approach, this textbook examines international organisations (IOs) and their effectiveness in solving global issues. Through the lens of  international relations theory, it focuses on eight key issue areas central to international relations: conflict; weapons; human rights; global health; financial governance; international trade; political and economic unions; development, and the environment. Capturing the best and most up-to-date scholarly research and empirical examples from around the world, the book enables students to develop the theoretical tools to evaluate IOs and answer the key question, 'are IOs a help or a hindrance?'. Text features include suggestions for further reading, questions, highlighted key terms and supplementary online resources, as well as text boxes providing demonstrations of how additional theories and concepts apply to specific IOs in the issue areas discussed. This textbook is an essential resource for undergraduate and graduate courses on global governance, international organisations, and international relations"--
