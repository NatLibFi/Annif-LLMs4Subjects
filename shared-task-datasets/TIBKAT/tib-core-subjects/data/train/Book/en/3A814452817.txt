Rough style : architecture, interior, design
"What used to be considered incomplete or in need of repair has become fashionable today. Abandoning the accustomed ideals of beauty opens up amazing new esthetic horizons that feature the charm of unfinished states or traces of the past in combination with rigorous design concepts. The ubiquitous raw ambience of the projects presented in Rough Style provides each one of them with a very unique authenticity of perfect imperfection."--
