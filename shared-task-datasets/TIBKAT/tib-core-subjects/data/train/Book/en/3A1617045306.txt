Using SPSS : an interactive hands-on approach
"Using SPSS: An Interactive Hands-On Approach" is intended as a self-instructional book in which the reader, be it teacher, student or anyone, can learn to use SPSS on their own, and at their own pace, without the assistance of an instructor. As such, it would make a solid companion text for most statistics or research methods courses. The book uses statistics to teach SPSS, not SPSS to teach statistics. Each chapter includes an introduction and list of performance objectives indicating what the reader will be able to do after reading the chapter. SPSS Version 18 for Windows was used in the preparation of this book. The book is unique in that it encourages the reader to interact with SPSS on the computer as he/she works through examples in each chapter. This approach to learning may be novel to the reader, but the authors feel the best way to learn a subject is to interact with it in a meaningful manner. We have made every effort to ensure the book is 'user friendly' as we guide the reader through the interactive learning process. Bulleted phrases provide a step-by-step procedure to be followed by the reader when completing the exercises.
