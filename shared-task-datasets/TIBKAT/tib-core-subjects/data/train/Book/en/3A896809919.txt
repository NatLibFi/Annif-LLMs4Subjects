Studio O+A : twelve true tales of workplace design
An artfully-designed book which tells O+A's design story in a series of twelve true tales - plus a bonus comic book in the middle of it all - that accentuate the company's spirit of innovation. Each story features a specific series of O+A projects and illustrates aspects of the O+A aesthetic and approach to workplace design. Using project photos, process photos, conceptual drawings, 3D renders and technical plans, the book gives a wide-angle picture of the design studio and a deep-dive look at its efforts to revolutionise what work environments can be. Realised by O+A's in-house creatives to the highest standards of book design and architectural commentary, the book has, in addition, a touch of the offbeat for which O+A is known. Realised projects include workspaces for Yelp, Nike, Cisco, Giant Pixel, Big Space Ship, Kimball and others, as well as forward-looking design experiments in mobile workspace design, product design and branding
