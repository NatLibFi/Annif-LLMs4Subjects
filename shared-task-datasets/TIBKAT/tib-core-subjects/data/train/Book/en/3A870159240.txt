Current developments in biotechnology and bioengineering / editor-in-chief: Ashok Pandey: Biological treatment of industrial effluents
"This volume provides data-based scientific knowledge and state-of-art information on the role and application of environmental biotechnology and engineering in the treatment of industrial effluents. The treatment processes have been broadly classified under aerobic and anaerobic processes, which determine the scope and level of pollutant removal. The chapters review the most recent developments and perspectives at different environmental clean-up operation scales."--
