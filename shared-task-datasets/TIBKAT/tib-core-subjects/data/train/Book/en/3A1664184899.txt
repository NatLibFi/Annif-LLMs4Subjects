Nonlinear dynamics of structures under extreme transient loads
"The book covers model building for different engineering structures and provides detailed presentations of extreme loading conditions. A number of illustrations are given: quantifying a plane crash or explosion induced impact loading, quantifying the effects of strong earthquake motion, quantifying the impact and long-duration effects of strong stormy winds - along with a relevant framework for using modern computational tools. The book considers the levels of reserve in existing structures, and ways of reducing the negative impact of high-risk situations by employing sounder design procedures"--
