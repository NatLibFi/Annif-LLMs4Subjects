Jonas Lindvall - architecture and form 1991-2015
Though ostensibly the works of Jonas Lindvall may fit into the Nordic tradition, his rejection of any particular style or trend sets him apart from his contemporaries. Unlike the wider Swedish design scene which largely revolves around Stockholm, Lindvall chooses to continue his work from Malm√∂, his hometown, and spans the disciplines of architecture and furniture design. Among his most iconic designs to date are his Oak and Papa chairs for Skandiford  simple, beautiful concepts with a nod to the Scandinavian modern style. In addition to design and residential projects, Lindvall also takes on commercial architecture0and interior design  from offices to retail schemes  with memorable results. His interior design for the Japanese restaurant Izakaya Koi won the Golden Chair Award in 2005. This monograph invites readers to explore his impressive back catalogue and sneak a peek at projects in the pipeline
