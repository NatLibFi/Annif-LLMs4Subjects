On the high line : exploring New York's most original urban park
On the High Line, first published in 2012, is an engaging guide to everything a visitor sees when strolling through the park: the innovative gardens and their thousands of native and exotic plant species; the architecture, both old and new, industrial and residential; and a neighborhood whose colorful history includes the birth of the railroad, the Manhattan Project, S&M clubs, and the legendary Tenth Avenue Cowboy. In 2014, the final half-mile section of the park will open, and visitors will encounter a very different High Line experience: stunning vistas of the Hudson River; a birds-eye view of the trains in the working Hudson Rail Yards; and the original, self-sown landscape that emerged in the abandoned rail bed and inspired the High Line's early champions. Striking new views of the city will be opened throughout. The updated edition includes sixteen new pages devoted to the final section of the park, with original photography, design renderings, and a new essay by Rick Darke. The book has also been updated throughout to reflect dozens of changes in the neighborhood since first publication
