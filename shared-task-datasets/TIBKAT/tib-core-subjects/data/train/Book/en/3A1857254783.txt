Differentiated instruction around the world : a global inclusive insight
14 different countries, various research methods, 1 topic: Differentiated Instruction.With increasingly diverse student populations in schools, the establishment of inclusive classrooms has become a top international priority. Teachers around the world are urged to differentiate their instruction in order to support all studentsâ€™ learning needs. Although there is research on the topic, there are still important gaps to explore, especially the  underrepresented international research output. This book tackles such limitations and provides a first ever publication concerning global insights into differentiated instruction. A total of 14 countries from 5 continents provide empirical evidence, theoretical and practical approaches to the topic. The book wraps up with a contribution from Prof. Dr. John Hattie, University of Melbourne, who shares eight theses to help the continuing debate and research on differentiated instruction.
