Geometry : Our Cultural Heritage
This book contains selected topics from the history of geometry, with 'modern' proofs of some of the results, as well as a fully modern treatment of selected basic issues in geometry. It is geared towards the needs of future mathematics teachers. One of my goals for this book is to open up for the dynamic character of geometry as such, and to extend an invitation to geometry as a gateway to mathematics in general. It is unfortunate that today, at a time when mathematics is more important than ever, phrases like math avoidance and math anxiety are very much in the public vocabulary. Making a serious effort to heal these ills is an essential task. Thus the book also aims at an informed public, interested in making a new beginning in math For the 2nd edition, some of the historical material has been expanded and numerous illustrations have been added, as has a chapter on polyhedra and tessellations and their symmetries. A large number of exercises with some suggestions for solutions is also included.
