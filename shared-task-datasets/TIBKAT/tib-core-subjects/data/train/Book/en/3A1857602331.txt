Organic light emitting diode (OLED) toward smart lighting and displays technologies : material design strategies, challenges and future perspectives
"The book, "Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) Toward Smart Lighting and Displays Technologies" strives to address the multiple aspects of OLEDs and their applications in developing smart lightings and displays. OLEDs have been used in almost all kinds of digital displays like those of mobile phones, laptops, tablets, phablets, TVs, etc. due to their outstanding features including superior color quality, low cost, wide viewing angle, easy fabrication, mercury-free manufacture, tenability, stretchability, flexibility, etc. Investigations related to synthesis of new organic materials and fabrication techniques have inspired us to write this book which will fulfill the needs of OLEDs based researchers"--
