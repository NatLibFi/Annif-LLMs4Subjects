Learn the things you need for a complete game, such as translations and tutorials, and improve the things you've already written to raise their standard to that of a professional level. This is a practical guide covering every discipline: art, music, writing, and code. In the case of the latter, code examples are included to demonstrate how to implement the functionality to make the game shine. Polished Game Development acts as a comprehensive checklist of everything your game should, and should not, do, in order to be as good as it possibly can. It is more than just a book on theoretical game design principles. Explains the difference between a pet project, and a professional one. Covers how to test for the problems and bugs you don't know you'll have. Details simple, but effective, visual improvements that can be done with very little effort. Regardless of platform (web, mobile, or console), or language (C++, C#, JavaScript) there is a wealth of common (and specific) tips within these pages that will enable you to make the most professional games you can. The book also features a complete game, Space Bounce, which is built in stages throughout the book, to explain in practical terms the ideas expressed. This journey is all encompassing as it starts at the design stage, explaining all the design ideas and ramifications, and continues until it's completely deployed on a website, exemplifying the fact that polish goes down to the roots.
