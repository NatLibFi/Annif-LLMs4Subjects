Flexible Robot Dynamics and Controls
This volume will guide professional engineers whose disciplines include: robotics, controls, mechanical, electrical, computer science and electrical, etc., to a better, or first understanding of how to develop and control robotics or other systems with inherent or desirable structural flexibility. Furthermore, senior and graduate mechanical, electrical, and computer science engineering students, particular those new to a government or private sector research institution, will benefit from the academic study of this volume. In addition, it will guide the reader through a review and application of several necessary advanced mathematics, engineering and scientific principles
