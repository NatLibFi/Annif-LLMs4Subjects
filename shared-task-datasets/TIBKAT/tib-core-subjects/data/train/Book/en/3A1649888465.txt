Lithium-Ion Batteries : Science and Technologies
This book is a compilation of up-to-date information relative to Li-Ion technology. It provides the reader with a single source covering all important aspects of Li-Ion battery operations. It fills the gap between the old original Li-Ion technology and present state of the technology that has developed into a high state of practice. The book is designed to provide a single source for an up-to-date description of the technology associated with the Li-Ion battery industry. It will be useful to researchers interested in energy conversion for the direct conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy as a textbook. University people will find a comprehensive description of the state-of-the-art of the Li-Ion system. TOC:History of lithium-ion batteries.- Review of Early Positive Electrode Materials.- An Overview of Graphite Anode Materials.- Silicon materials for Negative Electrode.- Advanced LiCoO2 Cathode Materials.- LiNiO2 and related compounds.- Mn-Containing Cathode Active Materials for Lithium Ion Batteries.- Iron-related cathode materials.- Overcharge Behavior of Metal-Oxide Coated Cathode Materials.- Role Assigned Electrolytes.- Flame-Retardant Additives.- Separator Materials.- Characteristics of PVDF Binders.- Advantages of Rubber (SBR) Binder.- Gel Polymer Batteries.- HEV Application.- Li-ion Production Processes
Here in a single source is an up-to-date description of the technology associated with the Li-Ion battery industry. It will be useful as a text for researchers interested in energy conversion for the direct conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy.
