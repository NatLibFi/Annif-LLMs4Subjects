Handbook of contemporary acoustics and its applications
"The Handbook of Contemporary Acoustics and Its Applications systematically covers the theoretical principle and analytical methodology of generation, propagation and reception of acoustic waves in an ideal (inviscid) and non-ideal fluid media. The topics include the transduction, radiation, scattering, diffraction and reception of the acoustic wave. It also discusses the acoustic field in a duct/pipe, waveguide and cavity, the wave propagation in the multi-layers, nonlinear finite amplitude wave propagation and the mechanisms of physical and biological effects and their broad modern applications such as sonoporation, targeted drug delivery, acoustic tweezers, noninvasive high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) surgery, as well as sonoluminscence. Readers are also provided with the fundamental mathematic background and relevant references necessary for their creative inventions and applications"--
