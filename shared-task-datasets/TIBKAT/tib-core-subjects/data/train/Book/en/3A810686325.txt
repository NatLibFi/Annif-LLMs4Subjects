Motions of Celestial Bodies : computer simulations
Phenomena and concepts in celestial mechanics : an introductory approach -- Newton's law of universal gravitation -- Potential energy of a body in the Newtonian gravitational field -- Circular velocity and escape velocity -- Geometric properties of Keplerian orbits -- Initial conditions and parameters of Keplerian orbits -- A satellite in the atmosphere -- Trajectories of a landing module -- A space probe -- Space rendezvous -- Kepler's laws and the solar system -- An approximate approach to the restricted three-body problem
Three-body systems -- The restricted three-body problem -- Managing the program 'Planet with a satellite' -- Satellites of a planet that orbits a star -- Exact particular solutions to the three-body problem -- A space flight over the back side of the Moon -- Lunar perturbations of a satellite's orbit -- A space voyage to a distant planet and back -- Comets : interplanetary vagabonds -- A double star with a planet
This book, together with the accompanying software, is written for a wide range of graduate and undergraduate students studying various courses in physics and astronomy. The primary aim of the book is the understanding of the foundations of classical and modern physics, while their application to celestial mechanics is used to illustrate these concepts. The simulation programs create vivid and lasting impressions of the investigated phenomena, and provide students and their instructors with a powerful tool to explore basic concepts that are difficult to study and teach in an abstract conventional manner
