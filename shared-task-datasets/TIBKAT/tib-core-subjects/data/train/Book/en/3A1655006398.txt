Diophantine Equations and Power Integral Bases : New Computational Methods
This monograph investigates algorithms for determining power integral bases in algebraic number fields. It introduces the best-known methods for solving several types of diophantine equations using Baker-type estimates, reduction methods, and enumeration algorithms. Particular emphasis is placed on properties of number fields and new applications. The text is illustrated with several tables of various number fields, including their data on power integral bases. Good resource for solving classical types of diophantine equations. Aimed at advanced undergraduate/graduate students and researchers.
