Small signal audio design
"This second edition of Small Signal Audio Design is the essential and unique guide to the design of high-quality analogue circuitry for preamplifiers, mixing consoles, and many other signal-processing devices. You will learn to use inexpensive and readily available parts to obtain state-of-the-art performance in all the vital parameters of noise, distortion, crosstalk, etc. This practical handbook provides a repertoire of circuit blocks from which almost any type of audio system can be built. Essential points of theory that determine practical performance are lucidly and thoroughly explained, with the mathematics at a minimum. Virtually every page reveals nuggets of specialized knowledge not found elsewhere. Douglas' background in design for manufacture ensures he keeps a wary eye on the cost of things. Learn how to: - Make amplifiers with apparently impossibly low noise - Design discrete circuitry that can handle enormous signals with vanishingly low distortion - Use ordinary bipolar transistors to make amplifiers with an input impedance of more than 50 Megohms - Transform the performance of low-cost-opamps, and how to make filters with very low noise and distortion - Make incredibly accurate volume controls - Make a huge variety of audio equalisers - Make magnetic cartridge preamplifiers that have noise so low it is limited by basic physics - Sum, switch, clip, compress, and route audio signals effectively - Build reliable power-supplies, with many practical ways to keep both the noise and the cost down"--
