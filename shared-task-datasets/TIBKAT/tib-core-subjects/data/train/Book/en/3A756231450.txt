Design of steel-concrete composite bridges to Eurocodes
"The book is aimed at students, especially at MSc level, and practicing engineers who need to become familiar with the new design rules incorporated in the EN-versions of the Eurocodes. Its focus is mainly on road bridges, although some information is provided for railway bridges. Material is presented in a concise manner"--
"Preface: Bridges have a strong symbolism as they connect opposite sides. It is not a coincidence that bridges are illustrated on one side of Euros. For many engineers, bridge design assumes top priority in their practice. In fact, the design of the optimal, technical, economical, and aesthetical solution with existing tools and means is a challenge for any structural engineer. International best practices show that the search for alternative solutions and the choice of the optimal one are essential for the construction of a successful bridge. The criteria for selection may be governed by technical, economical, operational, aesthetical, and environmental considerations and may be the choice of either the owner, the contractor, the designer, or the user. As a result, bridge construction builds a healthy competition as regards structural types, construction materials, construction methods, and other parameters that result in a polymorphy of bridges. In some aspects, bridges reflect the technological development in a period or in a country. Among the different types of bridges, composite bridges have a significant place, because the combination of the most common construction materials, steel and reinforced concrete, allows the construction of safe, operational, durable, and robust bridges economically"--
