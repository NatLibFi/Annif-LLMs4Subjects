High-density and de-densified smart campus communications : technologies, integration, implementation and applications
"High-density campus communications have traditionally been important in many environments, including airports; stadiums; convention centers; shopping malls; classrooms; hospitals; cruise ships; train and subway stations; evangelical megachurches; large multiple dwelling units; boardwalks; (special events in) parks; dense smart cities; and other venues. These communications span several domains: people-to-people, people-to-websites, people-to-applications, sensors-to-cloud analytics, and machines-to-machines/device-to-device. While the later Internet of Things (IoT) applications are generally (but not always) low speed, the former applications are typically high-speed. In many settings, people access videos (a la Over The Top [OTT] mode) or websites and applications that often include short videos or other high data-rate content. Deploying optimally-performing high-density campus communication systems is desired and required in many cases, but it can, at the same time, be a complex task to undertake successfully."--
