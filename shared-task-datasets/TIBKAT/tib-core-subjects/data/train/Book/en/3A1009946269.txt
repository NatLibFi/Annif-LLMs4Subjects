Spaceshop Architekten
Spaceshop, an exciting name for an exciting group. Spaceshop is comprised of four Biel-based architects: Beno Aeschlimann, Stefan Hess, Reto Mosimann and Hanspeter Stauffer. Since 1998, they have produced impressive, high-quality work, including excellent school buildings and other public facilities. They often respond to unorthodox building tasks with a great deal of initiative, and one of their most impressive projects to date - covered fully in this volume - was the restoration of a prominent steel and glass building by Max Schlup in Magglingen
