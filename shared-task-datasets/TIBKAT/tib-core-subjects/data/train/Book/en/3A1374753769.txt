Chemistry of nanocrystalline oxide materials : combustion synthesis, properties and applications
The book is particularly instructive in bringing readers one step closer to the exploration of nanomaterials. Students of nanoscience can acquaint themselves with the actual production and evaluation of nanopowders by this route, while academic researchers and industrial scientists will find answers to a host of questions on nano-oxides. The book also provides an impetus for scientists in industrial research to evaluate and explore new ways to scale up the production of nanomaterials, offering helpful suggestions for further research.
