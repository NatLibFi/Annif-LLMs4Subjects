Advanced Nanoscale ULSI Interconnects:  Fundamentals and Applications
This book presents one of the new frontiers of modern electrochemistry science and technology: electrochemical processes for Ultra-large-Scale Integration (ULSI) technology for Integrated Circuits (ICs) applications. This is a field which influences our day to day life and still presents major technological and scientific challenges. This book reviews ULSI technology in light of all the novel electrochemical processes which make ULSI technology possible. The book will focus on sub-100 nm CMOS technology, mainly on copper-based metallization.
