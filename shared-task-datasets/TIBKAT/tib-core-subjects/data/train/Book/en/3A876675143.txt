Real-time systems design and analysis
The leading guide to real-time systems design-revised and updated This third edition of Phillip Laplante's bestselling, practical guide to building real-time systems maintains its predecessors' unique holistic, systems-based approach devised to help engineers write problem-solving software. Dr. Laplante incorporates a survey of related technologies and their histories, complete with time-saving practical tips, hands-on instructions, C code, and insights into decreasing ramp-up times. Real-Time Systems Design and Analysis, Third Edition is essential for students and practicing software engineers who want improved designs, faster computation, and ultimate cost savings. Chapters discuss hardware considerations and software requirements, software systems design, the software production process, performance estimation and optimization, and engineering considerations. This new edition has been revised to include: * Up-to-date information on object-oriented technologies for real-time including object-oriented analysis, design, and languages such as Java, C++, and C# * Coverage of significant developments in the field, such as: New life-cycle methodologies and advanced programming practices for real-time, including Agile methodologies Analysis techniques for commercial real-time operating system technology Hardware advances, including field-programmable gate arrays and memory technology * Deeper coverage of: Scheduling and rate-monotonic theories Synchronization and communication techniques Software testing and metrics Real-Time Systems Design and Analysis, Third Edition remains an unmatched resource for students and practicing software engineers who want improved designs, faster computation, and ultimate cost savings
