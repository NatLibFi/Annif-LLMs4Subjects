Principles of reinforced concrete
Mechanical behavior of concrete. Basic mechanical behavior -- Behavior under influence of main factors -- Various structural concrete -- Multiaxial strength and constitutive relation -- Combination function of reinforcement and concrete. Mechanical behavior of reinforcement -- Bond between reinforcement and concrete -- Mechanical behavior under axial force -- Confined concrete -- Mechanical response of deformation difference -- Strength and deformation of structural member. Strength of member under compression and bending -- Tensile crack -- Flexural stiffness and deformation -- Strength of member under shear force -- Strength of member under torsion -- Special behaviors of structural members. Seismic resistance -- Fatigue resistance -- Explosion resistance -- Fire resistance -- Durability
