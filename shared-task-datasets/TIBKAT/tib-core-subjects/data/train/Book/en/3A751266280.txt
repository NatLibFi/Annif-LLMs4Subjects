Interactive Quantum Mechanics
Interactive Quantum Mechanics under Java presents the most up-to-date approach to elementary quantum mechanics. Based on the interactive program INTERQUANTA (included on a CD-ROM and ready to run under the WINDOWS, LINUX and MACINTOSH operating systems) and its extensive 3D color graphic features, the book guides its readers through computer experiments on free particles and wave packets, bound states in various potentials, coherent and squeezed states in time-dependent motion, scattering and resonances, analogies in optics, quantized angular momentum, distinguishable and indistinguishable particles, special functions of mathematical physics. A realm for everybody who wants to work on quantum mechanical problems
