Automotive transmissions : design, theory and applications
This book introduces readers to the theory, design and applications of automotive transmissions. It covers multiple categories, e.g. AT, AMT, CVT, DCT and transmissions for electric vehicles, each of which has its own configuration and characteristics. In turn, the book addresses the effective design of transmission gear ratios, structures and control strategies, and other topics that will be of particular interest to graduate students, researchers and engineers. Moreover, it includes real-world solutions, simulation methods and testing procedures. Based on the authorâ€™s extensive first-hand experience in the field, the book allows readers to gain a deeper understanding of vehicle transmissions. .
