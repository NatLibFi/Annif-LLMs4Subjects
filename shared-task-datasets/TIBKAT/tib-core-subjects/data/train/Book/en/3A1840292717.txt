Introduction to nonthermal biocompatible gas plasma : Physical and chemical basis -- Application in cancer treatment by nonthermal plasma technology -- Plasma based immunomodulations -- Cold plasma in dentistry -- Nonthermal plasma based sterlization and decontamination (antibacterial/ antiviral) -- Cold Plasma based wound healing application -- Clinical studies on cold gas plasma applications -- Safety aspects and standardization.
This book describes the updates that have been made in the field of Plasma Biosciences and Medicine over the past few years. This book provides detailed introduction and includes recent research information on plasma sources and their biological and medical applications. The opening chapters discuss plasmas physics and chemistry and plasma-activated liquids. The later part of the book discusses emerging application in medicine and biology. This book also provides valuable clinical insights into the treatment of ulcerations, wounds, cancer, dentistry, or the use of cold plasma in health and hygiene. Main target audience of this book are researchers, graduate and undergraduate students, government agencies, academiciansâ€™, engineers, biologists, medical doctor, biochemists, and industries.
