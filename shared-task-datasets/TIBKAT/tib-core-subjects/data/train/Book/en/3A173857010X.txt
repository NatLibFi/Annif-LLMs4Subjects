Juliaan Lampens 1950-1991
Juliaan Lampens 1950-1991' is the reissue of the catalogue published by the deSingel Arts Centre in 1991. The hand of the master is present in every facet of this publication, which makes this a unique reference work. In both a literal and figurative sense, Lampens helped shape the book: he selected the texts and images, wrote specifically for the publication and collaborated with the designer.0Publications about Juliaan Lampens are scarce and highly sought after. Interest in the architect's oeuvre has only increased in recent years, including internationally, as demonstrated by the special edition of the renowned Japanese architecture magazine a+u that was devoted to Lampens.0With this reissue, supplemented by an updated biography, the Flanders Architecture Institute is responding to an ever-growing demand. Previously untranslated texts are now provided in both French and English, thereby offering the reader three equivalent language editions in one volume
