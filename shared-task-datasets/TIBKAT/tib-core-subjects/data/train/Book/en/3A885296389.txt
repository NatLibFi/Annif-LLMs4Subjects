Type-driven development with Idris
Introduction. Overview ; Getting started with Idris -- Core Idris. Interactive development with types ; User-defined data types ; Interactive programs : input  and output processing ; Programming with first-class types ; Interfaces : using constrained generic types ; Equality : expressing relationships between data ; Predicates : expressing assumptions and contracts in types ; Views : extending pattern matching -- Idris and the real world. Streams and processes : working with infinite data ; Writing programs with state ; State machines L verifying protocols in types ; Dependent state machines : handling feedback and errors ; Type-safe concurrent programming
