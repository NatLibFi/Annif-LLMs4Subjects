Handbook of pattern recognition and computer vision
"Pattern recognition, image processing and computer vision are closely linked areas which have seen enormous progress in the last fifty years. Their applications in our daily life, commerce and industry are growing even more rapidly than theoretical advances. Hence, the need for a new handbook in pattern recognition and computer vision every five or six years as envisioned in 1990 is fully justified and valid. The book consists of three parts: (1) Pattern recognition methods and applications; (2) Computer vision and image processing; and (3) Systems, architecture and technology. This book is intended to capture the major developments in pattern recognition and computer vision though it is impossible to cover all topics. The chapters are written by experts from many countries, fully reflecting the strong international research interests in the areas. This fifth edition will complement the previous four editions of the book."--
