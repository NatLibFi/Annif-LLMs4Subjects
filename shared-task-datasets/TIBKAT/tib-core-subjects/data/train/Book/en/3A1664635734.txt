Numerical analysis : theory and experiments
Brian Suttonâ€™s 2019 book stands out in the crowded market, in part because it is remarkably up-to-date with the evolution of numerical analysis, even though it is aimed directly at beginning numerical analysis students. I believe that this will make an exceptionally good textbook for a beginning course. It has 34 chapters and four appendices, arranged in seven sections. The topics covered are, in order: I. Computation, II. Interpolation, III. Integration (with a chapter on differentiation first), IV. Systems of Linear Equations, V. Linear Differential Equations, VI. Zero finding, and VII. Nonlinear Differential Equations. The four appendices cover interpolation with repeated nodes, complex functions, interpolation in the complex plane, and additional proofs for Newton-Cotes quadrature. Each chapter has about twenty or so student-level exercises.
