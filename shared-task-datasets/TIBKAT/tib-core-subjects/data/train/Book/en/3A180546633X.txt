Mathematical modeling for intelligent systems : theory, methods, and simulation
"Mathematical Modeling for Intelligent Systems: Theory, Methods and Simulation aims to provide a reference for the applications of mathematical modeling using intelligent techniques in various unique industry problems in the era of Industry 4.0. Providing a thorough introduction to the field of soft computing techniques, the book covers every major technique in artificial intelligence in a clear and practical style. It also highlights current research and applications, addresses issues encountered in the development of applied systems, and describes a wide range of intelligent systems techniques, including neural networks, fuzzy logic, evolutionary strategy, and genetic algorithms. The book demonstrates concepts through simulation examples and practical experimental results. The book offers a well-balanced mathematical analysis of modelling physical systems. Summarizes basic principles in differential geometry and convex analysis as needed. The book covers a wide range of industrial and social applications, and bridges the gap between core theory and costly experiments through simulations and modelling. The focus of the book is manifold ranging from stability of fluid flows, nano fluids, drug delivery, and security of image data to Pandemic modeling etc. The book is primarily aimed at advanced undergraduates and postgraduate students studying computer science, mathematics and statistics. Researchers and professionals will also find this book useful"--
