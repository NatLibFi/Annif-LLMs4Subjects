Multilayered Low Temperature Cofired Ceramics (LTCC) Technology
In recent years, Low Temperature Cofired Ceramics (LTCC) have become an attractive technology for electronic components and substrates that are compact, light, and offer high-speed and functionality for portable electronic devices such as cellular phones, personal digital assistants (PDA) and personal computers used for wireless voice and data communication in rapidly expanding mobile network systems. LTCC are especially suitable for the high frequency circuits required for high-speed data communications.
