Essentials in modern HPLC separations
This book discusses in a systematic manner the role of separation in HPLC, the types and characteristics of stationary phases and of mobile phases used in this technique, as well as other factors influencing the separation. The selection process of stationary and mobile phase for a specific separation is described as related to the physico-chemical characteristics of the molecules to be separated and of their matrix. All these subjects are discussed from the point of view of the new developments in HPLC. The book also includes a part presenting the practice of modern HPLC as necessary for applications, particularly related to the analysis of pharmaceutical and biological samples, food and beverages, environmental samples, etc. Gives a clear presentation of notions and conceptsDiscusses key parameters in HPLC separationIncludes modern developments in HPLCDescribes interrelation between various HPLC features (solvent pressure, separation, detection)Includes a large number of references
