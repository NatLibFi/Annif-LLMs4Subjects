This volume is an original collection of articles by 44 leading mathematicians on the theme of the future of the discipline. The contributions range from musings on the future of specific fields, to analyses of the history of the discipline, to discussions of open problems and conjectures, including first solutions of unresolved problems. Interestingly, the topics do not cover all of mathematics, but only those deemed most worthy to reflect on for future generations. These topics encompass the most active parts of pure and applied mathematics, including algebraic geometry, probability, logic, optimization, finance, topology, partial differential equations, category theory, number theory, differential geometry, dynamical systems, artificial intelligence, theory of groups, mathematical physics and statistics.
