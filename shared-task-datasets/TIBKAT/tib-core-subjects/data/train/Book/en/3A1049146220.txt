Spaces of culture : new cultural venues in Amsterdam : research and strategies
Cultural flagships, from trendy breeding grounds to iconic cultural palaces, form the core of many urban cultural landscapes. 'Spaces of Culture' is about the new construction and redevelopment of cultural buildings in Amsterdam in the period 2000-2016.0In the construction and development of new cultural spaces in the city, the precise location and architecture play a major role in connecting the venue to the changing needs of the public, the makers and the neighbourhood. Using various case studies, 'Spaces of Culture' shows that the cultural sector could benefit from knowledge exchange between urban planners, developers and the world of architecture.0This book is relevant to cultural organisations, architects, governments and researchers in the Netherlands and abroad who want to know more about culture in relation to placemaking and the sense of belonging
