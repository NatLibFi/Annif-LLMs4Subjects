Polymer based bio-nanocomposites : properties, durability and applications
This book gives a comprehensive overview of bionanocomposites, a class of materials that consist of a biopolymer matrix which is embedded with nanoparticles and natural fibres as reinforcement to produce novel material and achieve superior physico-chemical and mechanical properties. The book looks into the synthesis of various forms of nanoparticles, the fabrication methods, and the characterization of bionanocomposites. It also includes topics related to the sustainability and life prediction of bionanocomposites such as biodegradability, recycling, and re-use. An important aspect in the designing of bionanocomposites includes computational modeling, and the suitability of the bionanocomposites in various applications is presented. This book appeals to students, researchers, and scientists looking to gain fundamental knowledge, know about recent advancements in the research on bionanocomposites and their applications.
