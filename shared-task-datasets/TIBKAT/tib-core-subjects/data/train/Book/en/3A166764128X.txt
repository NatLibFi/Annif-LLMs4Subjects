Nonlinear dynamics : a hands-on introductory survey
This book uses a hands-on approach to nonlinear dynamics using commonly available software, including the free dynamical systems software Xppaut, Matlab (or its free cousin, Octave) and the Maple symbolic algebra system. Detailed instructions for various common procedures, including bifurcation analysis using the version of AUTO embedded in Xppaut, are provided. This book also provides a survey that can be taught in a single academic term covering a greater variety of dynamical systems (discrete versus continuous time, finite versus infinite-dimensional, dissipative versus conservative) than is normally seen in introductory texts. Numerical computation and linear stability analysis are used as unifying themes throughout the book. Despite the emphasis on computer calculations, theory is not neglected, and fundamental concepts from the field of nonlinear dynamics such as solution maps and invariant manifolds are presented.
