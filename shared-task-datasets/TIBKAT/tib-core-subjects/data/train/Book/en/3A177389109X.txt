Missile Guidance and Control Systems
Though originally inspired by military applications, the advent of missile guidance and control systems has led to applications in a variety of fields -- in robotics, industrial process control, and in commercial transportation networks such as Global Positioning System technology. This book offers a comprehensive and up-to-date account of the technology behind tactical and strategic missiles and the guidance, control, and instrumentation required to reach a given "target." Topics covered include: missile aerodynamic forces and moments, the missile mathematical model, weapon delivery, GPS (Global Positioning System) and TERCOM (terrain contour matching) guidance, cruise missile mechanization equations, and a detailed analysis of ballistic missile guidance laws. The presentation assumes familiarity with calculus, ordinary differential equations, and some knowledge of modern control theory. The text is replete wuith practical examples designed to illustrate important concepts. This book will be an essential resource for students of aeronautical/aerospace engineering, as well as practicing engineers involved in the design, development, and analysis of modern aerospace guidance and control systems.
