Superconductivity : basics and applications to magnets
This book presents the basics of superconductivity and applications of superconducting magnets. It explains the phenomenon of superconductivity, describes theories of superconductivity, and discusses type II and high-temperature cuprate superconductors. The main focus of the book is the application of superconducting magnets in accelerators, fusion reactors and other advanced applications such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), high-gradient magnetic separation (HGMS), and superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES). This new and significantly extended second edition covers the state of the art in the development of novel superconductors for advanced magnet applications, as well as the production of practical superconducting wires, tapes, and ultra high current cables used for high-field magnets. It includes two new chapters each devoted to MgB2 and Fe-based superconductors, and discusses the recently developed and world record-setting 45.5-Tesla magnetic field generated by a combination of conventional and high-temperature cuprate superconducting magnets. In addition, it discusses the status and outlook of all current and future nuclear fusion reactors worldwide. The chapter on accelerators includes the ongoing efforts to build high luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), the high-energy 28 TeV LHC (HE-LHC), the future circular collider (FCC) at CERN, and the just launched electro-ion collider (EIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The book is based on the long-standing experience of the author in studying superconducting materials, building magnets and delivering numerous lectures to research scholars and students. The book provides comprehensive and fundamental knowledge in the field of applied superconductivity, greatly benefiting researchers and graduate students wishing to learn more about the various aspects of superconductivity and advanced magnet applications. .
