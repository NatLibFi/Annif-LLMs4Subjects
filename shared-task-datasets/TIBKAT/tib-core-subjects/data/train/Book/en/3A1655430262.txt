Winning Solutions
This book is intended to provide students with the appropriate mathematical tools and problem-solving experience to successfully compete in high-level problem solving competitions. In each section, the authors attempt to "fill in" the appropriate background and then provide the student with a variety of worked examples and exercises to help bridge the gap between what he or she may already know and what is required for high-level competitions. Answers or sketches of the solutions are given for all exercises. The book makes an attempt to introduce each area "gently" assuming little in the way of prior background - and teach the appropriate techniques, rather than simply providing a compilation of high-level problems
