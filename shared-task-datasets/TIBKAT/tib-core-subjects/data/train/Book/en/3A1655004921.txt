Pseudodifferential Operators and Spectral Theory
This is the second edition of Shubin's classical book. It provides an introduction to the theory of pseudodifferential operators and Fourier integral operators from the very basics. The applications discussed include complex powers of elliptic operators, HÃ¶rmander asymptotics of the spectral function and eigenvalues, and methods of approximate spectral projection. Exercises and problems are included to help the reader master the essential techniques. The book is written for a wide audience of mathematicians, be they interested students or researchers
