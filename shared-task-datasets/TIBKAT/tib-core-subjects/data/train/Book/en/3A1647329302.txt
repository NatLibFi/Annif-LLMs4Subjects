Cardiovascular Regeneration Therapies Using Tissue Engineering Approaches
The fact that the cardiovascular system transports oxygen and nutrients to all parts of the body makes any threat to its well-being a serious hazard to organs, tissues, and cells. This fundamental truth underlines the importance of research into cardiovascular regeneration and, therefore, of this collection outlining the latest developments in the field. With input from many of the leading researchers and practitioners, this book describes techniques for therapeutic angiogenesis and vasculogenesis for the treatment of ischemic diseases and examines the current approaches to angiogenic cytokines, cardiovascular stem cells, and tissue-engineering tools. The latest clinical results using bone marrow-derived mononuclear cell therapy for intractable circulatory disorders are also covered. This body of work will be a valuable resource for professionals in the fields of cardiovascular surgery, regenerative medicine, and tissue engineering.
