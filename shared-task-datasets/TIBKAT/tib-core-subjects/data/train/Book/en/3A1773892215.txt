Concise Catalog of Deep-sky Objects : Astrophysical Information for 500 Galaxies, Clusters and Nebulae
Here is a unique and fascinating reference book for every serious deep-sky observer! Entries for each of more than 500 deep-sky objects provide far more than the usual astronomical data - they also detail, in every case, the most interesting facts. Physical factors, astrophysical information, evolution, unusual features, the list is endless. The objects are all listed in NGC order, which were originally assigned in approximate order of location from west to east, convenient for reference because objects that can be seen on a given night will occur within a few pages of each other in the book. Astronomers can now get an insight into exactly what they are looking at, to add a new level of insight and enjoyment to deep-sky observing.
