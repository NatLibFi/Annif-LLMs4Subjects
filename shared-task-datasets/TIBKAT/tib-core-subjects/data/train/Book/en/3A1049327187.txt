Supersymmetric methods in quantum, statistical and solid state physics
As with the earlier edition, this book provides an accessible introduction to supersymmetric quantum mechanics and its applications in quantum, statistical and solid state physics. Building on the earlier edition it now encapsulates the substantial developments that have been made in supersymmetric quantum mechanics in recent years including conditionally exactly solvable systems, models of classical field theory and the many new interesting aspects within the area of stochastic dynamics, the Pauli and Dirac Equation, coherent states and non-linear algebras. Aimed at graduate students and scientists this book provides a thorough review on supersymmetric quantum mechanics and now includes problems and solutions.
