Optical and EUV lithography : a modeling perspective
"State-of-the-art semiconductor lithography combines the most advanced optical systems of our world with cleverly designed and highly optimized photochemical materials and processes to fabricate micro- and nanostructures that enable our modern information society. The precise fabrication and metrology of nanopatterns requires an in depth understanding of all involved physical and chemical effects. This book tries to support such understanding from a modeling-driven perspective, but without a heavy mathematical apparatus. The material for this book was compiled in many years of teaching lectures on "Optical lithography Technology, Physical Effects, and Modeling" at the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg and in the preparation of dedicated courses on special aspects of lithography. The book is intended to help interested students with background in physics, optics, computational engineering, mathematics, chemistry, material science, nanotechnology and other areas to get started in the fascinating field of lithographic techniques for nanofabrication. It should also help senior engineers and managers to widen their view on alternative methods and applications"
