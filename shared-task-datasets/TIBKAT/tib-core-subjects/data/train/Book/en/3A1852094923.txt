Women in architecture : documents and histories
'Women in Architecture' sheds light on how women in all their different roles contribute to architecture, from the past to the present. Despite the essential and varied contributions of women, the narrative surrounding architecture remains deeply rooted in masculinity. Nonetheless, women have played crucial roles throughout architectural history. This publication sheds light on the reasons behind the absence of women in archives and publications, and how that exclusion continues to perpetuate the invisibility of women in architecture today. By bringing together these stories, the publication adds a crucial chapter to the history of architecture in the Netherlands and advocates for greater diversity in the current architectural discourse
