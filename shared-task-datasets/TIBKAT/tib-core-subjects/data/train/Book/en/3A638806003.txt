Testing complex and embedded systems
"Using combinatorial approaches, this book aims to motivate testers and testing organizations to perform meaningful testing. The text details planning activities prior to testing, how to scope the work, and how to achieve a successful conclusion. Rather than presenting the entire continuum of testing for a particular product or design attribute, this volume focuses on boundary conditions. The authors provide various techniques that can be used to streamline testing and help identify problems before they occur, including turbocharge testing methods from Six Sigma. Coverage includes testing, simulation, and emulation"--
