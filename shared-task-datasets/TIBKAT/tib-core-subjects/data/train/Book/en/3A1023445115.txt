Managing emerging technologies for socio-economic impact
The development of emerging technologies demands a rapidly expanding knowledge base and intensive collaboration across organizational, institutional and cultural borders. This book is the first of its kind to focus on the management of key emerging technologies and their social and economic impact in Europe. Split into four parts, across 17 chapters, the scholars offer multiple levels of analysis concerning the management of emerging technologies across various sectors ranging from nanotechnology, renewable energy and cloud computing to synthetic biology and particle therapy for cancer. They present their research findings in critical areas including: organizational capabilities for technological innovation in key enabling technologies; collaboration and networking to shape their emergence and progression; strategic challenges for policy makers who influence the sustainable and responsible development of emerging technologies; how such technologies affect work and communication practices in a variety of organizational settings. This book is a must-read for innovation practitioners, academics and policy makers who take interest in the on going debate about how to shape innovation policy and manage emerging technologies
