Circuit Design For RF Transceivers
RF Design: Concepts and Technology -- Antennas, Interface and Substrate -- Low Noise Amplifiers -- Mixers -- RF power amplifiers -- Oscillators -- Frequency Synthesizers.
Circuit Design for RF Transceivers covers key building blocks which are needed to make an integrated transceiver for wireless and cellular applications, that is low-noise amplifiers, mixers, voltage controlled oscillators, RF power amplifiers and phase-locked loop systems. Starting from detailed RF concepts and specifications, the authors discuss the circuits in detail and provide solutions to many design problems. The circuits are implemented in a wide range of modern technology processes. Production requirements are taken into account, and measurement results are presented and discussed. Several of the presented circuits are used in IC products. The text also includes several RF technologies (for example double-poly, Silicon-on-Anything, SiGe-bipolar, RF-CMOS, etc.) and microwave design techniques, such as transmission line concepts. In addition, the problem of connecting the RF signals on-chip to the PCB and to the antenna will be discussed, including the influence of the package, ESD and bond pads. The contents of Circuit Design for RF Transceivers 2nd edition are based on research activities carried out at Philips Research. Many internal and external publications contributed to make the presented material state-of-the-art. The book is written for people who have a basic knowledge of analogue IC design. The second edition of this successful 2001 RF Circuit Design book has been updated, latest technology reviews have been added as well as several actual case studies. Due to the authors being active in industry as well as academia, this should prove to be an essential guide on RF Transceiver Design for students and engineers.
