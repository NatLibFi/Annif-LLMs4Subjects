Industrial wireless sensor networks : applications, protocols, and standards
"Preface In today's competitive industry marketplace, the companies face growing demands to improve process efficiencies, comply with environmental regulations, and meet corporate financial objectives. Given the increasing age of many industrial systems and the dynamic industrial manufacturing market, intelligent and low-cost industrial automation systems are required to improve the productivity and efficiency of such systems. The collaborative nature of industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) brings several advantages over traditional wired industrial monitoring and control systems, including self-organization, rapid deployment, flexibility, and inherent intelligent-processing capability. In this regard, IWSN plays a vital role in creating a highly reliable and self-healing industrial system that rapidly responds to real-time events with appropriate actions. In this book, detailed reviews about the emerging and already employed industrial wireless sensor network applications and technologies are presented. In addition, technical challenges and design objectives are introduced. Specifically, radio technologies, energy harvesting techniques and network and resource management for IWSNs are discussed. Furthermore, industrial wireless sensor network standards are presented in detail. Overall, this book covers the current state of the art in IWSNs and discuss future research directions in this field. The remainder of this book is organized as follows. Applications of Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks Chapter X analyzes and evaluates Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks (IWSN) applications classified into three main groups, that is environmental sensing, condition monitoring and process"--
