Architectural structures : visualizing load flow geometrically
"Architectural Structures presents an alternative approach to understanding structural engineering load flow using a visually engaging and three-dimensional format. This book presents a groundbreaking new way of establishing equilibrium in architectural structures using the Modern MÃ¼ller-Breslau method. While firmly grounded in mechanics principles, this method does not use traditional algebraic statics, nor does it use classical graphic statics. Rather, it solely uses new geometric tools. Both statically determinate and statically indeterminate structures are analyzed using this graphic method to provide a geometric understanding of how load flows through architectural structures. This book includes approachable coverage of parametric modeling of two-dimensional and three-dimensional structures, as well as more advanced topics such as indeterminate structural analysis and plastic analysis. Hundreds of detailed drawings created by the author are included throughout to aid understanding. Architecture and structural engineering students can employ this novel method by hand sketching, or by programming in parametric design software. A detailed, yet approachable guide, Architectural Structures is ideal for students of architecture, construction management, and structural engineering, at all levels. Practitioners will find the method extremely useful for quickly solving load tracing problems in three-dimensional grids"--
