Fluorescence microscopy : from principles to biological applications
This is the first title on the topic designed specifically to allow students and researchers with no background in physics to understand novel light microscopy techniques. Each chapter is written by a renowned expert with many contributions by pioneers in the field, but the editors have ensured that all commonly used methods are covered and that each chapter is comprehensible for non-experts and conforms to the same easily legible standard and style. A companion website with additional examples and video material makes this a valuable teaching resource.--
