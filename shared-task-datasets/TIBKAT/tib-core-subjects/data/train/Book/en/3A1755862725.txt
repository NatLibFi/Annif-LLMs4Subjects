Magnetic memory technology : spin-transfer-torque MRAM and beyond
"This book first provides the basics of magnetism that electrical engineering students in the semiconductor curriculum can easily understand. Then, it goes one step forward to discuss electron spin. Following the above background discussion, readers are taught the physics of magnetic tunnel junction device (MTJ), the work horse of MRAM, for memory applications. At the end of this book, the author gives a comparison of emerging non-volatile memories (PCM, ReRAM, FeRAM and MRAM). The author also explores MRAM's unique quality among emerging memories, in that is the only one in which the atoms in the device do not move when switching states. This property makes it the most reliable and low power"--
