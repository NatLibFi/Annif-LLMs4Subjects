Agent-based modeling and simulation with Swarm
"Swarm-based multi-agent simulation leads to better modeling of tasks in biology, engineering, economics, art, and many other areas. It also facilitates an understanding of complicated phenomena that cannot be solved analytically. Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation with Swarm provides the methodology for a multi-agent-based modeling approach that integrates computational techniques such as artificial life, cellular automata, and bio-inspired optimization. Each chapter gives an overview of the problem, explores state-of-the-art technology in the field, and discusses multi-agent frameworks."--
