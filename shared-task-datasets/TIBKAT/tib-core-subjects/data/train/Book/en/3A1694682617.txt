Landscape modelling and decision support
This book contributes to a deeper understanding of landscape and regional modelling in general, and its broad range of facets with respect to various landscape parameters. It presents model approaches for a number of ecological and socio-economic landscape indicators, and also describes spatial decision support systems (DSS), frameworks, and model-based tools, which are prerequisites for deriving sustainable decision and solution strategies for the protection of comprehensively functioning landscapes. While it mainly focuses on the latest research findings in regional modelling and DSS in Europe, it also highlights the work of scientists from Russia. The book is intended for landscape modellers, scientists from various fields of landscape research, university teaching staff, and experts in landscape planning and management, landscape conservation and landscape policy.
