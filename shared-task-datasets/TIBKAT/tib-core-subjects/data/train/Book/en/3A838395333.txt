Design and implementation of autostereoscopic displays
"Autostereoscopic (glasses-free) displays provide perspectives of images according to the position of the observer. This book introduces various autostereoscopic technologies, from the fundamental principles of parallax barrier to the latest multiprojection supermultiview displays for readers ranging from undergraduate students to display manufacturers in the industry. Display basics and fundamentals of 3D displays are followed by descriptions of multiview system configurations. For readers already having of 3D display technologies, detailed explanations of advanced display technologies such as slanted lens technique and multiprojection system are also included. Because technological advancement of conventional 2D display affects the development of 3D displays, the book also covers the basics of 2D displays, including flat panel displays and projection-type displays"--
