Atoms and photons and quanta, oh my! : ask the physicist about atomic, nuclear, and quantum physics
This is the second book in the 'Ask the Physicist' series. The first book, From Newton to Einstein: Ask the physicist about mechanics and relativity, provides an excellent foundation for this book that covers topics in 'modern' physics. The main emphasis of this volume is providing an accessible introduction to quantum physics, atomic physics, and nuclear physics to anyone with at least high-school physics knowledge.
