Understanding quantum phase transitions
"Exploring a steadily growing field, this book focuses on quantum phase transitions (QPT), frontier area of research. It takes a look back as well as a look forward to the future and the many open problems that remain. The book covers new concepts and directions in QPT and specific models and systems closely tied to particular experimental realization or theoretical methods. Although mainly theoretical, the book includes experimental chapters that make the discussion of QPTs meaningful. The book also presents recent advances in the numerical methods used to study QPTs"--
