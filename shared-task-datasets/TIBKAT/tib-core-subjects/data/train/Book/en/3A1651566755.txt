Quantitative ecology : measurement, models and scaling
A follow up to the highly successful first edition, this book reviews the manifold ways that scale influences the interpretation of ecological variation. As scale, magnitude, quantity, and measurement occupy an expanding role in ecology, this second edition will be an indispensable addition to individual and institutional libraries. In providing a context for resolution of ecological problems, Ecologists will appreciate the significance of scale and magnitude addressed in this book. Written for advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty researchers, this book synthesizes a burgeoning literature on the influences of scale. * Expanded by numerous explanatory figures and wide coverage of material * Topic is of crucial importance to Ecologists * The most thorough, complete coverage available on quantitative ecology in the market
