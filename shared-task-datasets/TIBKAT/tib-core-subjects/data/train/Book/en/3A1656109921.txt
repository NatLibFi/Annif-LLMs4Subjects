Supramolecular systems in biomedical fields
Non-covalent interactions, which are the heart of supramolecular chemistry are also the basis of most important functions of living systems. The ability to apply supramolecular chemistry principles to the life sciences, such as designing synthetic host compounds to selectively interact within biological targets, has gained wide appeal due the vast number of potential applications. Supramolecular Systems for Biomedical Fields provides in sixteen chapters a comprehensive overview of these applications. Each chapter covers a specific topic and is written by internationally renowned experts in tha
