Statistical Physics of Non Equilibrium Quantum Phenomena
This book provides an introduction to topics in non-equilibrium quantum statistical physics for both mathematicians and theoretical physicists. The first part introduces a kinetic equation, of Kolmogorov type, which is needed to describe an isolated atom (actually, in experiments, an ion) under the effect of a classical pumping electromagnetic field which keeps the atom in its excited state(s) together with the random emission of fluorescence photons which put it back into its ground state. The quantum kinetic theory developed in the second part is an extension of Boltzmann's classical (non-quantum) kinetic theory of a dilute gas of quantum bosons. This is the source of many interesting fundamental questions, particularly because, if the temperature is low enough, such a gas is known to have at equilibrium a transition, the Boseâ€“Einstein transition, where a finite portion of the particles stay in the quantum ground state. An important question considered is how a Bose gas condensate develops in time if its energy is initially low enough
