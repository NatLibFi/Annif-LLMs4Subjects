Creating materials with a desired refraction coefficient
Creating Materials with a Desired Refraction Coefficient' provides a recipe for creating materials with a desired refraction coefficient, and the many-body wave scattering problem for many small impedance bodies is solved. The physical assumptions make the multiple scattering effects essential. On the basis of this theory, a recipe for creating materials with a desired refraction coefficient is given. Technological problems are formulated which, when solved, make the theory practically applicable. The Importance of a problem of producing a small particle with a desired boundary impedance is emphasized, and inverse scattering with non-over-determined scattering data is considered.
