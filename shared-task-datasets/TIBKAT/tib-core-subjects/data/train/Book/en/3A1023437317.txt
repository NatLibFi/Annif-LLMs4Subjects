Industrial location economics
pt. 1. Analytical approaches to industrial location -- pt. 2. Cities and industrial clusters -- pt. 3. Multinational firms and location behaviour
Because space is not homogenous, economic activities occur in different locations. Understanding the reasons behind this and understanding exactly how industries are spatially organized is the central theme of this book. Industrial Location Economics discusses different aspects of industrial location behaviour from a variety of theoretical and empirical perspectives. Each of the analytical traditions provides insights into the nature of industrial location behaviour and the factors which can influence it
