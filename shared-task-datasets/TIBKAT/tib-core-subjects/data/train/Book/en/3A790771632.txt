Plant MAP kinases : methods and protocols
"Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are versatile phosphorylating enzymes which regulate multiple proteins involved in gene expression, cell architecture, plant development and reaction to diverse abiotic and biotic factors. The main aim of Plant MAP Kinases: Methods and Protocols is to provide established and new MAPK protocols adapted to the challenges posed by working with plants. The book contains 19 chapters which encompass a wide array of methods progressively scaling from the single gene, protein or cell level to large-scale arrays of proteomic, phosphoproteomic and interactomic data in order to uncover previously unidentified plant MAPK signaling pathways and to tackle with the challenging task of substrate identification. Techniques for MAPK sequence analysis and subcellular localization helping to identify their substrates and subcellular compartmentalization are also provided. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols and key tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Authoritative and practical, Plant MAP Kinases: Methods and Protocols represents a collection of useful plant MAPK protocols written by experts in the field for researchers and students." --
