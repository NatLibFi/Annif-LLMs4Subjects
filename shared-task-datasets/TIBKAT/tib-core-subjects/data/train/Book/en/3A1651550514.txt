Power electronics handbook : devices, circuits, and applications
Power electronics, which is a rapidly growing area in terms of research and applications, uses modern electronics technology to convert electric power from one form to another, such as ac-dc, dc-dc, dc-ac, and ac-ac with a variable output magnitude and frequency. Power electronics has many applications in our every day life such as air-conditioners, electric cars, sub-way trains, motor drives, renewable energy sources and power supplies for computers. This book covers all aspects of switching devices, converter circuit topologies, control techniques, analytical methods and some examples of their applications. * 25% new content * Reorganized and revised into 8 sections comprising 43 chapters * Coverage of numerous applications, including uninterruptable power supplies and automotive electrical systems * New content in power generation and distribution, including solar power, fuel cells, wind turbines, and flexible transmission
