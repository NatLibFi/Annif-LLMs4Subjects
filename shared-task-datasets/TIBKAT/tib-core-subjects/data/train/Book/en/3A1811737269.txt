Nanobiotechnology for safe bioactive nanobiomaterials
"This book initiates with introduction of nanobiotechnology followed by biosyntheses of AgNPs, development of silver/chitosan (Ag/CS) polymer nanocomposites, synthesis of silver/chitosan-g-poly acrylamide (Ag/CS-g-PAAm) nanocomposite hydrogel, and silver/chitosan/poly vinyl chloride (Ag/CS/PVC) blend. Finally, it presents novel bioengineering of polyfunctional metallic nanostructures other than Ag, emphasizing biomass utilization and value-added conversion on an extended span including life cycle assessment of the synthesized nanostructures. Features: Includes prospective cost effective, eco-friendly, and safe nanomaterials, synthesized through facile path. Covers synergistic effect of phytochemicals and nano-Ag antimicrobial agents from antiviral perspective. Includes surface coating systems, super absorbent materials, etc. for biomedical purposes. Discusses nanobiotechnological applications for generating nanoalloys with synchronized nanostructural arrangement of alkaline earth metals and nanoscale dots of transition metal. Explores life cycle assessment of the synthesized nanomaterials. This book aims at Researchers, Graduate students in Biomaterials, Chemical Engineering, Green Chemistry, Nanomaterials, and Biotechnology"--
