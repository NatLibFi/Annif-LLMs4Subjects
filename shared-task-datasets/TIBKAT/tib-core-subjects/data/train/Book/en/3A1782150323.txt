Flexible supercapacitors : materials and applications
"This book includes chapters from leading scientists working in the field of flexible SCs. As well as summarizing the current research work; the book systematically introduces SCs, from fundamental understanding to electrode materials to devices, represented by on-chip micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) and fiber SCs. The latest progress and advantages of stretchable and healable SCs for wearable devices are also covered. Lastly, the book concludes with the problems and challenges encountered in the development of flexible SC devices and also puts forward corresponding suggestions and perspectives"--
