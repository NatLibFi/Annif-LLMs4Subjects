Holography is the only truly three-dimensional imaging method available, and MATLAB has become the programming language of choice for engineering and physics students. Whereas most books solely address the theory behind these 3D imaging techniques, this monograph concentrates on the exact code needed to perform complex mathematical and physical operations. The text and included examples spare students and researchers from the tedium of programming complex equations so that they can focus on their experiments instead. Topics include a brief introduction to the history, types, and materials of holography; the basic principles of analog and digital holography; a detailed explanation of famous fringe-deciphering techniques for holographic interferometry; holographic and non-holographic 3D display technologies; and cutting-edge concepts such as compressive, coherence, nonlinear, and polarization holography
