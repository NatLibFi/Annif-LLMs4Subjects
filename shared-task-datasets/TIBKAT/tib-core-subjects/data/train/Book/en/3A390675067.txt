Differential evolution : a practical approach to global optimization ; with 48 tabeles
Problems demanding globally optimal solutions are ubiquitous, yet many are intractable when they involve constrained functions having many local optima and interacting, mixed-type variables. The Differential Evolution algorithm (DE) is a practical approach to global numerical optimization that is easy to understand, simple to implement, reliable, and fast. Packed with illustrations, computer code, new insights, and practical advice, this volume explores DE in both principle and practice. It is a valuable resource for professionals needing a proven optimizer and for students wanting an evolutionary perspective on global numerical optimization. A companion CD includes DE-based optimization software in several programming languages, including C and MATLAB
