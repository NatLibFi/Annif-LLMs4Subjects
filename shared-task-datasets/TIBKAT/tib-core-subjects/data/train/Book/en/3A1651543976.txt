DSP is utilized in just about every electronic system or device. DSP is taking one piece of information be it data, image, video, or audio, most likely compressing, sending, and filtering it to another location within your application to appear in the form of a document, picture or video. Like Smith before it, this book is different to most on the market by following a popular applied approach to this tricky subject, and will be the perfect starting point for engineers who need to get into DSP from the ground floor. This book starts with the absolute basics of this integral process. No experience is expected and with no prior knowledge taken for granted, a refresher chapter on complex numbers and trigonometry can be found at the very beginning of the material. Real-world worked examples, reference designs, and tools - including online applets that enable readers to visualize key principles - complete a package that will help engineers who that needs to learn anew or refresh their memory on this essential technology as they move to projects that require DSP familiarity. Dismayed when presented with a mass of equations as an explanation of DSP? This is the book for you! Clear examples and a non-mathematical approach gets you up to speed with DSP Includes an overview of the DSP functions and implementation used in typical DSP-intensive applications, including error correction, CDMA mobile communication, and radar systems ~
