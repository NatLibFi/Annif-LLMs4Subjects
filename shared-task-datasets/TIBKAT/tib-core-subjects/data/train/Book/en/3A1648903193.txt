Evolutionary genetics
This textbook, aimed at advanced undergraduates, covers those aspects of genetics - molecular and population - needed to understand the mechanisms of evolution. It discusses the mechanisms of evolution as opposed to describing the techniques, molecular, biometric or cladistic whereby phlogenies can be constructed. It covers basic population and quantitative genetics; evolutionary game theory; evolution of behaviour; prokaryote evolution; evolution of the genomes; sex recombination, breeding systems and sexual selection; speciation and macroevolution. It applies the basic theory to topics such as social behaviour, molecular evolution, reiterated DNA and sex, which are the main subjects of current research in evolutionary biology. Each chapter contains a set of problems (with answers) and suggested computer projects. These are important because they combine population and molecular approaches to evolution, and show how population genetics can be applied to biological problems.
