Edible food packaging with natural hydrocolloids and active agents
"The main aim of this book is to review the technologies, principles, strategies and recent developments in the delivery of natural agents to achieve antimicrobial, antioxidant and bioactive packaging. Each active compound discussed was selected carefully considering its industrial availability, economic feasibility and applicability for packaging purposes from its stability during material development to effectiveness in achieving target activities in food. The book focuses on understanding appropriate strategies during selection of suitable natural active agents and edible delivery tools for different food categories. In this way the book helps in understanding necessary parameters in designing an active packaging that is fully natural and effective in the food system. Readers are primed for the first time on how to design fully natural delivery tools in "edible packaging material dependent", "food system dependent" and "natural active agent dependent" studies. This book is different from most of the similar books available as it provides neither methodologies and systematic information about classical antimicrobial packaging based on chemicals and fossil polymeric films nor is it a thorough collection of packaging applications. It is also not a book that concentrates on physicochemical characterization methods and engineering aspects of packaging. Instead, this is a book that provides systematic knowledge about key methods of evaluating natural resources, agro-industrial wastes and by products for development of packaging, and concentrates on technologies, concepts, strategies, and applications of packaging based solely on natural components. It is designed to share both positive and negative experiences in an emerging field that is expected to play a central role in improving food safety and quality, human health and environmentally friendly practices"--
