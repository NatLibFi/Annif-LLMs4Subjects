From Sociology to Computing in Social Networks : Theory, Foundations and Applications
Important aspects of social networking analysis are covered in this work by combining experimental and theoretical research. A specific focus is devoted to emerging trends and the industry needs associated with utilizing data mining techniques. Some of the techniques covered include data mining advances in the discovery and analysis of communities, in the personalization of solitary activities (like searches) and social activities (like discovering potential friends), in the analysis of user behavior in open fora (like conventional sites, blogs and fora) and in commercial platforms (like e-auctions), and in the associated security and privacy-preservation challenges, as well as social network modeling, scalable, customizable social network infrastructure construction, and the identification and discovery of dynamic growth and evolution patterns using machine learning approaches or multi-agent based simulation. These topics will be of interest to practitioners and researchers alike in this dynamic and growing field.
