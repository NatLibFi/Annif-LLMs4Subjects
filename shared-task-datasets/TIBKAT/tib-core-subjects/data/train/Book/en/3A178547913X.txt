Bioepoxy/clay nanocomposites : fabrication optimisation, properties and modelling
This book highlights current advanced developments in bioepoxy and bioepoxy/clay nanocomposites and an optimisation of material formulation and processing parameters on fabrication of bioepoxy/clay nanocomposites in order to achieve the highest mechanical properties in relation to their morphological structures, thermal properties, as well as biodegradability and water absorption, which is based on the use of Taguchi design of experiments with the consideration of technical and economical point of view. It also elaborates holistic theoretical modelling of tensile properties of such bionanocomposites with respect to the effect of contents of nanoclay fillers and epoxydised soybean oil (ESO). .
