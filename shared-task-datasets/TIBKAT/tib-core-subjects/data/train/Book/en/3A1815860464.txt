Space-Division Multiplexing in Optical Communication Systems : Extremely Advanced Optical Transmission with 3M Technologies
This book presents new frontiers in data communication. To transcend the physical limitations of current optical communication technologies, totally new multiplexing schemes beyond TDM/WDM, novel transmission optical fibers handling well above Pbit/s capacity, and next-generation optical submarine cable systems will need to be developed. The book offers researchers working at the forefront, as well as advanced Ph.D. students in the area of optical fiber communications systems and related fields, an essential guide to state-of-the-art optical transmission technologies. It explores promising new technologies for the exabit era; namely, the three “M technologies”: multi-level modulation, multi-core fiber, and multi-mode control.
Introduction -- Optical Fibers for Space-Division Multiplexing -- Optical Connection Technologies -- Optical Amplification Technologies -- Optical Transmission Technologies.
