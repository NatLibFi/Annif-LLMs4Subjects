Mathematics of optimization : how to do things faster
This book gives an introduction to optimization theory, which has a large overlap with Operation Research (OR). While this book touches on some standard problems in OR, one subject matter is deliberately wider, as one of the goals is to showcase commonalities between very different areas of mathematics. The book has the following chapters: Chapter 1: Efficient Multiplication I Chapter 2: Efficient Multiplication II Chapter 3: Introduction to Linear Programming Chapter 4: The Canonical Linear Programming Problem Chapter 5: Symmetries and Dualities Chapter 6: Basic Feasible and Basic Optimal Solutions Chapter 7: The Simplex Method Chapter 8: Integer Programming Chapter 9: Integer Optimization Chapter 10: Multi-Objective and Quadratic Programming Chapter 11: The Traveling Salesman Problem Chapter 12: Introduction to Stochastic Linear Programming Chapter 13: Introduction to Fixed Point Theorems Chapter 14: Contraction Maps Chapter 15: Sperner’s Lemma Chapter 16: Brower’s Fixed Point Theorem Chapter 17: Gale-Shapley Algorithm Chapter 18: Interpolating Functions Chapter 19: The Four Color Problem Chapter 20: The Kepler Conjecture.
