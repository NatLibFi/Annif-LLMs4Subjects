A practical guide to seismic reservoir characterization
This book covers in detail the entire workflow for quantitative seismic interpretation of subsurface modeling and characterization. It focusses on each step of the geo-modeling workflow starting from data preconditioning and wavelet extraction, which is the basis for the reservoir geophysics described and introduced in the following chapters. This book allows the reader to get a comprehensive insight of the most common and advanced workflows. It aims at graduate students related to energy (hydrocarbons), CO2 geological storage, and near surface characterization as well as professionals in these industries. The reader benefits from the strong and coherent theoretical background of the book, which is accompanied with real case examples
