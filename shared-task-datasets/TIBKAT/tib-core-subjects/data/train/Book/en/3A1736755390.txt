Artificial intelligence : from beginning to date
"This English edition monograph is developed and updated from China's best-selling, and award-winning, book on Artificial Intelligence (AI). It covers the foundations as well as the latest developments of AI in a comprehensive and systematic manner. It is a valuable guide for students and researchers on artificial intelligence. A wide range of topics in AI are covered in this book with four distinct features. First of all, the book comprises a comprehensive system, covering the core technology of AI, including the basic theories and techniques of "traditional" artificial intelligence, and the basic principles and methods of computational intelligence. Secondly, the book focuses on innovation, covering advanced learning methods for machine learning and deep learning techniques and other artificial intelligence that have been widely used in recent years. Thirdly, the theory and practice of the book are highly integrated. There are theories, techniques and methods, as well as many application examples, which will help readers to understand the artificial intelligence theory and its application development. Fourthly, the content structure of the book is quite characteristic, consisting of three parts: (i) knowledge-based artificial intelligence, (ii) data-based artificial intelligence, and (iii) artificial intelligence applications. It is closely related to the core technologies of artificial intelligence, namely knowledge, data, algorithms, and computing powers. This reflects the authors' deep understanding of the artificial intelligence discipline"--
