Relativistic Quantum Mechanics. Wave Equations
Relativistic Quantum Mechanics - Wave Equations concentrates mainly on the wave equations for spin-0 and spin-1/2 particles. The first chapter deals with the Klein-Gordon equation and its properties and applications. The chapters that follow introduce the Dirac equation, investigate its covariance properties, and present various approaches to obtaining solutions. Numerous applications are discussed in detail, including the two-centre Dirac equation, hole theory, CPT symmetry, Klein's paradox, and relativistic symmetry principles. Relativistic wave equations for higher spin (Proca, Rarita-Schwinger, and Bargmann-Wigner) are also presented. The extensive presentation of the mathematical tools and the 62 worked examples and problems make this a unique text for an advanced quantum mechanics course. This third edition has been slightly revised to bring the text up-to-date
