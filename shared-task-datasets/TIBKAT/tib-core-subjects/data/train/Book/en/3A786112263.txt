Polyoxymethylene handbook : structure, properties, applications and their nanocomposites
In recent decades, Polyoxmethylene (POM) has been positioned as a high performance engineering polymer with increasing worldwide demand, particularly in the automotive, electronics, medical, and consumer goods industries. Despite this interest in POM, there has not been a book devoted to this compound. This volume rectifies this situation by bringing together the knowledge of leading scientists from industry and academia to present research results and applications of POM, including their structure, properties, manufacture, additives, processing and applications, as well their nanocomposites and other compounds.
