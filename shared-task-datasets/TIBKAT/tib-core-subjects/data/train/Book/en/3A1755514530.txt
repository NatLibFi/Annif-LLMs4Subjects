Software-defined networking for future internet technology : concepts and applications
"The growing usage of networks presents many challenges for network administrators. Network infrastructures are growing rapidly to meet needs of business, but the required re-policing and reconfiguration provide challenges that need to be addressed. The software-defined network (SDN) is the future generation of Internet technology that can help meet these challenges of network management. This book, Software-Defined Networking for Future Internet Technology: Concepts and Applications, includes quantitative research, case studies, conceptual papers, model papers, review papers, theoretical backing, etc. This book investigates areas where SDN can help other emerging technologies for delivering more efficient services, such as IoT, industrial IoT, NFV, big data, blockchain, cloud computing, and edge computing. The book demonstrates the many benefits of SDN, such as reduced costs, ease of deployment and management, better scalability, availability, flexibility and fine-grained control of traffic, and security. Chapters in the volume address: Design consideration for security issues and detection methods State-of-the-art approaches for mitigating DDos attacks using SDN Big data using Apache Hadoop for processing and analyzing large amounts of data Different tools used for attack simulation Network policies and policy management approaches that are widely used in the context of SDN Dynamic flow tables, or static flow table management A new four-tiered architecture that includes cloud, SDN-controller, and fog computing Architecture for keeping computing resources available near the industrial IoT network through edge computing The impact of SDN as an innovative approach for smart city development More The book will be a valuable resource for SDN researchers as well as academicians, research scholars, and students in the related areas"--
