Site matters : strategies for uncertainty through planning and design
"In the era of the Anthropocene, site matters are more pressing than ever. Building on the concepts, theories and multi-disciplinary approaches raised in the first edition, this publication strives to address the changes that have taken place over the last fifteen years with new material to complement and re-position the initial volume. Reaching across design disciplines, this highly-illustrated anthology assembles essays from architects, landscape architects, urban designers, planners, historians and artists to explore ways to physically and conceptually engage site. Thoughtful discourse and empirically grounded pieces combine to provide the language and theory to contextualise the meanings of site in the built environment. The increasingly complex hybridity of constructed environments today demands new tools for thinking about and working with site. Drawing contributions from outside and within the traditional design disciplines, this edition will trace important developments in site thinking with new essays on topics such as climate change, landscape as infrastructure, shifts from global to planetary urbanization debates, and the proliferation of participatory site transformation practices. Edited by two leading practitioners and academics, Site Matters juxtaposes timeless contributions from individuals including Elizabeth Meyer, Robert Beauregard and Robin Dripps with original new writings from Peter Marcuse, Jane Wolff, Neil Brenner and Thaisa Way, amongst others, to recontextualise and reignite the debate around site. An ideal text for students, academics and researchers interested in site and design theory"--
