Handbook of water and wastewater microbiology
'Access to safe water is a fundamental human need and therefore a basic human right' Kofi Annan, United Nations Secretary General Edited by two world-renowned scientists in the field, The Handbook of Water and Wastewater Microbiologyprovides a definitive and comprehensive coverage of water and wastewater microbiology. With contributions from experts from around the world, this book gives a global perspective on the important issues faced in the provision of safe drinking water, the problems of dealing with aquatic pollution and the processes involved in wastewater management.  Starting with an introductory chapter of basic microbiological principles, The Handbook of Water and Wastewater Microbiologydevelops these principles further, ensuring that this is the essential text for process engineers with little microbiological experience and specialist microbiologists alike.  Comprehensive selection of reviews dealing with drinking water and aquatic pollution Provides an understading of basic microbiology and how it is applied to engineering process solutions Suitable for all levels of knowledge in microbiology -from those with no background to specialists who require the depth of information
