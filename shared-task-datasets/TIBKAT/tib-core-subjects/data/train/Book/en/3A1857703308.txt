Metamaterials and metasurfaces : basics and trends
Metamaterials are commonly known to make things invisible. As artificially structured metal-dielectric composites mimicking natural materials they exhibit properties that are not available in Nature, including: negative refractive index, reversal of Doppler effect and the reversed Ã©Cerenkov effect. Metasurface is a planar version of metamaterial exhibiting a number of novel functionalities. This book reviews the physics, technology, and design issues related to metamaterials and metasurfaces. The text covers the fundamental concepts and potential applications as well as future trends. It explores all aspects of metamaterial's and metasurface's physics and engineering operating in the electromagnetic spectrum covering microwave, terahertz and optical domain. This is a suitable text for teaching in bachelor's and master's degree courses on metamaterials and metasurfaces in universities and engineering colleges. The key audience for this book includes students enrolled on metamaterials and metasurfaces modules, researchers, as well as industry professionals. Part of IOP Series in Electromagnetics and Metamaterials.
