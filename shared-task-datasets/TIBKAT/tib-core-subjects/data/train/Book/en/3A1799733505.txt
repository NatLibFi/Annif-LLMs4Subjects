Neutron imaging : basics, techniques and applications
This book comprehensively presents the concepts of neutron physics and imaging including neutron properties, neutron matter interaction, neutron imaging, comparison with X-ray and physics and design of neutron sources. It discusses how neutron imaging has gained importance as a powerful non-destructive technique to understand the internal structures of materials/engineered components in wide range of industries, including defense, aerospace, and healthcare. The book also covers the topics of neutron optics and detectors, basic principles of neutron radiography and tomography, and standards, safety and regulations in neutron imaging. In the last section of the book, it covers wide range of applications of neuro imaging in the areas of aerospace industry, nuclear power and manufacturing industry, 3D printing, materials science and engineering, geomechanics, archeology and palaeontology, national security, biological, and medical industries. Given its scope, the book will be highly useful for postgraduate students, researchers and industry professionals working in the area of engineering and physics, especially non-destructive testing and non-destructive evaluation of neutron imaging.
