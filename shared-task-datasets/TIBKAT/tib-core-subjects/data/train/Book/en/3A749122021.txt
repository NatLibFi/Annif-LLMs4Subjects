Tools and Applications of Biochemical Engineering Science
This volume presents 12 comprehensive and timely review articles on some of the new tools and applications of biochemical engineering and biotechnology. The tools range from screening methods for novel biocatalysts and products, fluorescence spectroscopy and mass spectrometry for monitoring and analysis of cellular processes via mathematical models and protein expression systems for metabolic engineering to new bioreaction and separation devices. The applications cover the uses of animal and tissue cultures, insect cells, recombinant and marine microorganisms for the production of a variety of important bioproducts
