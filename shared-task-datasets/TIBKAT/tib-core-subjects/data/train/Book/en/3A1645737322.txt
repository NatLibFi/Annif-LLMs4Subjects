Quantum Mechanics
This introductory course on quantum mechanics is the basic lecture which precedes and completes the author's second book Advanced Quantum Mechanics. The new edition is again up-to-date and has been revised. Numerous new and newly drawn figures deepen the understanding of the topic. The book meets the students' needs by giving all mathematical steps, worked examples with applications throughout the text, and many problems at the end of each chapter. It contains nonrelativistic quantum mechanics and a short treatment of the quantization of the radiation field. Besides the essentials, topics such as the theory of measurement, the Bell inequality, decoherence, entanglement and supersymmetric quantum mechanics are discussed. 'Any student wishing to develop mathematical skills and deepen their understanding of the technical side of quantum theory will find Schwabl's Quantum Mechanics very helpful'. #Contemporary Physics#
