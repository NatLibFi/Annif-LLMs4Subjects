The Philip Johnson glass house : an architect in the garden
From its completion in 1949 to the present day, Philip Johnson's Glass House has drawn cognoscenti and the curious from around the world to New Canaan, Connecticut, to experience what might be the most photographed modernist residence in America. The property - an architectural playground on forty-seven acres with eleven Johnsonian follies dating from 1949 to 1995 - is an icon of twentieth century architectural and landscape design. The book chronicles how Philip Johnson and David Whitney, the architect and the plantsman, lived on the property for decades and used the landscape as an ever-changing canvas for their designs-the result of a unique synthesis of influences and ideas from across history and geography. New research reveals Johnson's and Whitney's interaction with the landscape and the evolution of the site from a five-acre parcel to a world-renowned gentlemanly estate for modern times. The Philip Johnson Glass House- beautifully illustrated with vintage and commissioned photography-will be a must-have for connoisseurs of architecture, landscape design, photography, and social history
