Managing Mathematical Projects â€” with Success!
Based on over twenty years' experience as supervisor and external examiner of project work in mathematics, Phil Dyke shows you how to get the best out of degree projects and case studies in mathematics. There are guidelines on setting up a project - be it individual or group - advice on time management, and tips on how to get the most out of verbal presentations and how to succeed in peer assessment. Pointers as to what the assessor will be looking for and advice on the all-important project write-up also provide an essential head start. This practical guide will be essential reading for students in the second or final year of a mathematics degree - or other courses with a high mathematical content - and a useful resource for lecturers and project advisors looking for ideas on how to devise, assess and manage projects.
