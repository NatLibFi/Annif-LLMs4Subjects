Fundamentals of Photonics is designed for first- and second-year college students, but it is also suitable for both traditional and non-traditional students interested in learning the basics. We hope the contents of this book will meet the needs of students of all ages, including life-long learners, who want to develop their interest in the continuously evolving fields of optics and photonics
