Advances in 40 Ar/39 Ar dating : from archaeology to planetary sciences
Decoding the complete history of Earth and our solar system requires the placing of the scattered pages of Earth history in a precise chronological order, and the ⁴⁰Ar/³₉Ar dating technique is one of the most trusted dating techniques to do that. The ⁴⁰Ar/³₉Ar method has been in use for more than 40 years, and has constantly evolved since then. The steady improvement of the technique is largely due to a better understanding of the K/Ar system, an appreciation of the subtleties of geological material and a continuous refinement of the analytical tools used for isotope extraction and counting. The ⁴⁰Ar/³₉Ar method is also one of the most versatile techniques with countless applications in archaeology, tectonics, structural geology, orogenic processes and provenance studies, ore and petroleum genesis, volcanology, weathering processes and climate, and planetary geology. This volume is the first of its kind and covers methodological developments, modelling, data handling, and direct applications of the ⁴⁰Ar/³₉Ar technique.--
