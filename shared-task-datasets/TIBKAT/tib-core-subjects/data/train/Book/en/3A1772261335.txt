Wavefront shaping and pupil engineering
This book presents a simple, yet comprehensive, treatment of the basic principles and applications of novel phase masks and non-uniform optical windows under the increasingly popular umbrella term “pupil engineering.” It discusses current research topics in the areas of phase-space representations for engineering imaging devices with extended depth of field, as well as sparse optical sensing and emergent phenomena such as vortices and singularities, highlighting the heuristic applications of key concepts in novel models and their graphic representations. The book is appealing to anyone interested in robotic vision and is a valuable resource for upper-level students, teachers, scientists, and engineers in the field of image science, lasers, and digital image processing.
