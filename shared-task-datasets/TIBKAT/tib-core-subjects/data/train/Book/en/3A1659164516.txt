Population dynamics in prehistory and early history : new approaches using stable isotopes and genetics
The state of migration research has undergone rapid change since methods of analysis involving stable and radiogen isotopes and molecular genetics have started to be applied. At a conference held in Berlin in March 2010, groups whose research looks at population dynamics in pre and early, or in more recent history presented their insights about methodological approaches, research results and perspectives. The aim of this volume is to conduct a dialogue between archaeologists, geneticists and archaeometrists for the purpose of a reconstruction of (pre)historic population history.
