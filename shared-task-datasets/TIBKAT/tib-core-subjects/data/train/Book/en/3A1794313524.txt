Biomethane : developments and prospects
"This book presents a comprehensive synopsis of the production and utilization of biomethane along with important recent advances. Biomethane production offers valuable alternative energy solutions for the replacement of fossil fuels to lessen the environmental impacts and strategize for mitigating global warming and climate change. Chapters first focus on the production of biogas (or biomethane) with emphasis on the different biomass utilization for industrial and domestic applications and describe the characteristics, parameters, and process design of anaerobic digesters for biomethane production from waste biomass. The book then goes on to discuss advanced genetic engineering tools and techniques to enhance biomethanation and biomethane production. The volume also offers a state-of-the-art review of anaerobic digestion of biogenic solid wastes, the impact of different chemical pretreatment processes and products, and the influence of operating parameters on biomethane yields. Differentiating between the thermochemical technologies (e.g., gasification and pyrolysis) and biological technologies (e.g., anaerobic digestion) for biomethane production, the book assesses some recent advancements in biomethane production along with its socioeconomic impacts and applications. Other topics include gasification technology and syngas cleaning for biosynthetic natural gas production, the use of catalysts for enhanced synthetic natural gas production, biohythane fuel produced from microbial fermentative pathways, and more. Biomethane: Developments and Prospects offers valuable insight and information on the current status of production and utilization of biomethane that has cross-disciplinary value in biotechnology, fermentation technology, bioprocess engineering, chemical engineering, and environmental technology with a common interest in biofuels and bioenergy"--
