Quantum Plasmonics
Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics -- Quantum Emitters for Plasmonics -- New Materials for Quantum Plasmonics -- Collective Strong Coupling -- Lasing in Plasmonic Structures -- Quantum Effects in Nanogaps.
This book presents the latest results of quantum properties of light in the nanostructured environment supporting surface plasmons, including waveguide quantum electrodynamics, quantum emitters, strong-coupling phenomena and lasing in plasmonic structures. Different approaches are described for controlling the emission and propagation of light with extreme light confinement and field enhancement provided by surface plasmons. Recent progress is reviewed in both experimental and theoretical investigations within quantum plasmonics, elucidating the fundamental physical phenomena involved and discussing the realization of quantum-controlled devices, including single-photon sources, transistors and ultra-compact circuitry at the nanoscale. .
