Current-Induced Nonequilibrium Phenomena in Quasi-One-Dimensional Superconductors
Starting from the early experiments, this detailed presentation, containing more than 500 references, provides a comprehensive review on current-induced nonequilibrium phenomena in quasi-one-dimensional superconductors, leading the reader from the fundamentals to the most recent research results. Experiments on monocrystalline filaments (whiskers) - including those obtained by the author - are compared with results on long thin film microbridges and related species and interpreted within the theoretical framework. Instructions on experimental techniques are given and yet unresolved problems are discussed. The book is well suited as an introduction for the novice and as a handbook for the active researcher
