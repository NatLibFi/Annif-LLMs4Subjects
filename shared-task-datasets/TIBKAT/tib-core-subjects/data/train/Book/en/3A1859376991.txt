Advanced computer science applications : recent trends in AI, machine learning, and network security
"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are two areas of computer science that have seen drastic advancement in recent years. Keeping track of this rapid development, this book, Advanced Computer Science Applications: Recent Trends in AI, Machine Learning, and Network Security, brings together the most recent trends related to AI, ML and Network Security. The book consists of three parts with each part focusing on a specific aspect of AI, machine learning, and network security. The chapters cover such diverse topics including machine learning algorithms and security analytics, AI and machine learning, and network security applications. The book presents a variety of design algorithms including convolutional neural networks (CNN), random forest algorithm, k-nearest neighbor (KNN), Apriori algorithm, MapReduce algorithm, and the Genetic Algorithm used in IoT applications. The volume presents a survey of speculative parallelism techniques, performance reviews, and efficient power consumption. It discusses measuring perceived quality of software ecosystems based on transactions in customer management tools and offers a study of the background modelling and background subtraction along with various other literature studies that justify the role of moving object detection in computer vision. The book also covers the concepts of IoT, security early detections for COVID-19, multimetric geographical routing in VANETs, V2X communication in VANET, and optimization of congestion control scheme for VANETs"--
