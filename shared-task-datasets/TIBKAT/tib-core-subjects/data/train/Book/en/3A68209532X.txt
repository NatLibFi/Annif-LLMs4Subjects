Biostatistics with R : An Introduction to Statistics Through Biological Data
Biostatistics with R is designed to mimic the interaction between theory and application in statistics. Most topics are motivated by real examples first, and after discussing a topic, the author shows how it can be applied to the problem that motivated it. Topics include data exploration, estimation, and clustering with two appendices on installing and running R and R-commander. This author discusses basic statistical analysis through a series of biological examples using R and R-Commander as computational tools. The book is intended for a wide range of readers from people with relatively stro
Biostatistics with R is designed around the dynamic interplay among statistical methods, their applications in biology, and their implementation.¡ The book explains basic statistical concepts with a simple yet rigorous language.¡ The development of ideas is in the context of real applied problems, for which step-by-step instructions for using R and R-Commander are provided.¡ Topics include data exploration, estimation, hypothesis testing, linear regression analysis, and clustering with two appendices on installing and using R and R-Commander.¡ A novel feature of this book is an elementary introduction to the basic of Bayesian analysis. This author discusses basic statistical analysis through a series of biological examples using R and R-Commander as computational tools.¡ The book is ideal for instructors of basic statistics for biologists and other health scientists.¡ The step-by-step application of statistical methods discussed in this book allows readers, who are interested in statistics and its application in biology, to use the book as a self-learning text.¡
