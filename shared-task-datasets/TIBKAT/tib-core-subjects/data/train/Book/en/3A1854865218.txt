Macías Peredo : arquitectura 2012-2022
"This new issue of TC is dedicated to Macías Peredo. We develop the last decade of his career with 17 essential projects that define the way of approaching and understanding architecture, with a prologue by Manuel Cervantes and an essay by Juan Vergara Newton. Almost 300 pages with photographs, plans and construction details teach us in depth the keys to the architecture of one of the most interesting studios on the Mexican scene." -- Provided by publisher
