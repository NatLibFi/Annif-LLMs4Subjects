Fundamentals of supramolecular chirality
"Fundamentals of Supramolecular Chirality is a critical description of the start and advancement of supramolecular chirality. This book focuses on the noncovalent approach with some supplementary examples of covalent supramolecular chirality. This contribution to supramolecular chirality is not intended to be a mere catalogue and description of the work done. It also traces a philosophical path following the development and possible perspectives of this topic, providing not a review but a critical examination of the field"--
