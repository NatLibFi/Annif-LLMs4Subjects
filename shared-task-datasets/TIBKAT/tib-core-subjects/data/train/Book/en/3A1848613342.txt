Metal oxide-based carbon nanocomposites for environmental remediation and safety
"This book focusses on nanotechnology for the preparation of metal oxide-based carbon nanocomposite materials for environmental remediation. It analyses the use of nanomaterials for water, soil, and air solutions, emphasizing on environmental risks of pollution. It further explores how magnetic and activated carbon nanomaterials are being used for sustainable environmental protection of water and soil, and detection of harmful gases. Status and major challenges of using carbon-based nanomaterials on a large scale are explained supported by relevant case studies. Features: Exhaustively covers nanotechnology, metal oxide- carbon nanocomposites and their application in soil, water and air treatments. Explores pollutants nano-sensing and their remediation towards environmental safety. Includes economics analysis and environmental aspects of metal oxide materials. Describes why properties of oxide-carbon based nanomaterials useful for environmental applications. Discusses current cases studies of remediation technologies. This book is aimed at graduate students and researchers in nanotechnology, environmental technology and remediation"--
