Graph algorithms : practical examples in Apache Spark and Neo4j
Introduction -- Graph theory and concepts -- Graph platforms and processing -- Pathfinding and graph search algorithms -- Centrality algorithms -- Community detection algorithms -- Graph algorithms in practice -- Using graph algorithms to enhance machine learning.
Learn how graph algorithms can help you leverage relationships within your data to develop intelligent solutions and enhance your machine learning models.  With this practical guide, developers and data scientists will discover how graph analytics deliver value, whether they're used for building dynamic network models or forecasting real-world behavior.  Mark Needham and Amy Hodler from Neo4j explain how graph algorithms describe complex structures and reveal difficult-to-find patterns, from finding vulnerabilities and bottlenecks to detecting communities and improving machine learning predictions.  You'll walk through hands-on examples that show you how to use graph algorithms in Apache Spark and Neo4j, two of the most common choices for graph analytics
