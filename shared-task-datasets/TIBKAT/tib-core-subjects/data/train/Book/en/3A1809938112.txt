Algorithms for a new world : when big data and mathematical models meet
1 Epidemic -- 2 Retrospective -- 3 Interlude: the revolution that did not happen and the revolution that was unforeseen -- 4 Artificial intelligence, learning computers, artificial neural networks -- 5 A bit of maths (behind artificial intelligence and machine learning) -- 6 BIG DATA - BIG BROTHER (or, on the ethical and moral aspects of artificial intelligence).
Covid-19 has shown us the importance of mathematical and statistical models to interpret reality, provide forecasts, and explore future scenarios. Algorithms, artificial neural networks, and machine learning help us discover the opportunities and pitfalls of a world governed by mathematics and artificial intelligence.
