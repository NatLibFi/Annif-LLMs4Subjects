Mountain modern : contemporary homes in high places
High up in mountains around the world, houses that have long been constructed following local building traditions are being transformed. Intrepid young architects using new technologies and materials are refashioning these traditions, with results that range fromgemutlich (cozy) retreats to glamorous hilltop villas. Houses are presented in three sections: Cabin, Chalet, and Villa. Photographs of each house reveal its architecture, interior design, and striking setting, while plans provide an additional layer of information. Texts tell the story of how the dwelling was sited to make the most of its location, how new construction innovations were introduced, and how these solutions provide a comfortable space from which families can enjoy the great outdoors. While our cities become ever more concentrated, there is an increasing desire to experience nature as directly as possible. From the Highlands of Scotland to the breathtaking summits of the Alps and the adrenaline-fuelled mountain resorts of California, Mountain Modern is a journey to the most stunning homes of our planet
