Dual superconductor models of color confinement
Physicistsintending to acquire an understanding of modeling the confinement of Quantum Chromodynamicsasexhibited bydual superconductors will find this book an excellent introduction. The author focuses on the models themselves, especially the Landau- Ginzburg model of a dual superconductor, also called the Dual Abelian Higgs model. The book addresses graduate students and researchers, and is noteworthy forthe remarkable clarityof itsexposition.
