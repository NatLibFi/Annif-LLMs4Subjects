Nuclear materials science
Concerns around global warming have led to a nuclear renaissance in many countries, meanwhile the nuclear industry is warning already of a need to train more nuclear engineers and scientists, who are needed in a range of areas from healthcare and radiation detection to space exploration and advanced materials as well as for the nuclear power industry. Here Karl Whittle provides a solid overview of the intersection of nuclear engineering and materials science at a level approachable by advanced students from materials, engineering and physics. The text explains the unique aspects needed in the design and implementation of materials for use in demanding nuclear settings. In addition to material properties and their interaction with radiation the book covers a range of topics including reactor design, fuels, fusion, future technologies and lessons learned from past incidents. Accompanied by problems, videos and teaching aids the book is suitable for a course text in nuclear materials and a reference for those already working in the field.
