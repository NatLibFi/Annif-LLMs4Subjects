Innovation in low-tech firms and industries
pt 1. Innovations in LMT : conditions and requirements -- pt. 2. Technological diffusion and interrelationships between sectors -- pt. 3. Local versus global perspectives in innovation
It is a general understanding that the advanced economies are currently undergoing a fundamental transformation into knowledge-based societies. There is a firm belief that this is based on the development of high-tech industries. Correspondingly, in this scenario low-tech sectors appear to be less important. A critique of this widely held belief is the starting point of this book. It is often overlooked that many of the current innovation activities are linked to developments inside the realm of low-tech. Thus the general objective of the book is to contribute to a discussion concerning the relevance of low-tech industries for industrial innovativeness in the emerging knowledge economy
