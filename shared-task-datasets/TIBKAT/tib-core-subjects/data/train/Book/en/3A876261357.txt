SupraSensitivity in architecture
The 'SupraSensitivity in Architecture' exhibition, that opens at the Centro Pecci on the occasion of its inauguration of October 16, features 120 art works made by different architects invited by Maurice Nio to contribute to the SupraSensitivity in Architecture book soon to be released by Dutch publisher UITGEVERIJ 1001. Among the invited architects: Giacomo Garziano, Martin Vyb√≠ral, Radek Brunecky, Nailia Aizatullova and Si [Muse] Miao & Tatiana Plakhova. The 120 artist-works give us insight in what we can see with our mind's eye, the eye that feels and develops awareness. They are glimpses of the potential of limitless sensory power.
