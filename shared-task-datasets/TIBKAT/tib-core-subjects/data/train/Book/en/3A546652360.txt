Micromechanical Photonics
The purpose of this book is to give the engineering student and the practical engineer a systematic introduction to optical MEMS (Micro electro mechanical systems) and micromechanical photonics through not only theoretical and experimental results, but also by describing various products and their fields of application. After an overview on optical MEMS and micromechanical photonics, the book describes extremely-short-external-cavity laser diodes tunable laser diodes, a resonant sensor and an integrated optical head. It then addresses optical tweezers, the new technology employed to manipulate various types of objects in a variety of research and industrial fields. Coverage progresses through topics on the design and fabrication of an optical rotor and evaluation of mixing performances of micro-liquids for future fluidic applications. In the final chapter, the fundamentals and applications of the near field are described for the future development of micromechanical photonics, as well as near-field features, theoretical analyses, experimental analyses and applications mainly related to optical recording.
