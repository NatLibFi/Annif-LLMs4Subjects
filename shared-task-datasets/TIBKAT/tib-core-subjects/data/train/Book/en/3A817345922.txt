Springer Handbook of Acoustics
Acoustics, the science of sound, has developed into a broad interdisciplinary field encompassing the academic disciplines of physics, engineering, psychology, speech, audiology, music, architecture, physiology, neuroscience, and electronics. The Springer Handbook of Acoustics is also in his 2nd edition an unparalleled modern handbook reflecting this richly interdisciplinary nature edited by one of the acknowledged masters in the field, Thomas Rossing. Researchers and students benefit from the comprehensive contents. This new edition of the Handbook features over 11 revised and expanded chapters, new illustrations, and 2 new chapters covering microphone arrays  and acoustic emission.  Updated chapters contain the latest research and applications in, e.g. sound propagation in the atmosphere, nonlinear acoustics in fluids, building and concert hall acoustics, signal processing, psychoacoustics, computer music, animal bioacousics, sound intensity, modal acoustics as well as new chapters on microphone arrays and acoustic emission with numerous applications. These improvements make the handbook even more useful as a reference and a guide for researchers and students in every branch of acoustics Key Topics Physical and Engineering Acoustics Signal Processing in Acoustics Physiological and Psychological Acoustics Architectural Acoustics Medical Acoustics Ocean Acoustics Noise Control Musical Acoustics, Human Speech and Singing Animal Acoustics Acoustic emission Microphone arrays   Features Contains almost 1000 color illustrations. Includes over 80 comprehensive tables. Emphasizes physical concepts over extensive mathematical derivations. Delivers a wealth of up-to-date references. Parts and chapters with summaries.
