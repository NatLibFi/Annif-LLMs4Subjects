"Nanomaterials in rocket propulsion systems covers the fundamentals of nanomaterials and examines a wide range of innovative applications, presenting the current state-of-the-art in the field. Opening with a chapter on nano-sized energetic materials, the book examines metal nanoparticles-based fuels, ballistic modifiers, stabilizers and catalysts as the components of rocket propellants. Hydrogen storage materials for rocket propulsion based on nanotubes are then discussed, as are nano-porous materials and metal organic frameworks, nano-gelled propellants, nano-composite ablators and ceramic nano-composites. Other applications examined include high thermal conductivity metallic nano-composite nozzle liners, nano-emitters for Coulomb propulsion of space-crafts, and highly thermostable nano-ceramics for rocket motors. The book finishes with coverage of combustion of nano-sized rocket fuels, nano-particles and their combustion in micro- and nano-electromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS), plasma propulsion and nano-scale physics. Users will find this to be a valuable resource for academic and government institutions, professionals, new researchers and graduate students working in the application of nanomaterials in the aerospace industry"
