Nanomedicines : design, delivery and detection
Nanomedicines and nanopharmacology is a rapidly developing and evolving field with new techniques and applications under constant development. This book will provide an overview of the chemistry of nanocarrier design and the considerations that need to be made when developing a nanomedicine. Providing an understanding of the relationship of nanocarrier, drug and targetting moieties and physico-chemical properties, this title will provide an accurate and current representation of the field by addressing the promises, prospects and pitfalls of nanomedicine. Covering a wide range of areas in detail, this book will provide an excellent companion for medicinal chemists, pharmacologists and biochemists working in industry or academia
