Evaluating Measurement Accuracy : A Practical Approach
Experimental scientists and engineers of all disciplines who work with instrumentation will find the latest metrology in this comprehensive survey of the most cutting-edge theoretical and practical information on the subject. It is also a good tool for undergraduate and graduate natural science and engineering students and for technicians performing complex measurements in industry.   From developing the theory of indirect measurements to proposing new methods of reduction in place of the traditional ones, this work encompasses the full range of measurement data processing. It includes many solid examples that exemplify typical problems encountered in measurement practice, from general theory to practical applications. As a result, Evaluating Measurement Accuracy serves as an inclusive reference work for data processing of all types of measurements: single and multiple, dependent and independent indirect, combined, and simultaneous. Notable additions to the second edition are finer calibrated methods for indirect measurement and a guide to the current standards established by the International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM) and the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). Offering recommendations on a range of sample real-world scenarios, it has practical solutions for all types of practioners. Here is what is new in this edition:   Lengthy introduction and explanation of the Method of Enumeration for more accurate indirect measurements Includes a brand-new chapter devoted to the newly published International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM) and the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) Updates make this the only comprehensive reference for measurement data processing
