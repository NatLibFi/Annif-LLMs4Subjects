Leuven Railway Station : Philippe Samyn and Partners, architects and engineers
Summary: In 1999, the NMBS (Nationale Maatschappij der Belgische Spoorwegen) arranged an architectural competition for the construction of a new platform covering for Leuven station. The winning project of Philippe Samyn and Partners is a case study in which the appropriate integration of the surroundings, a minimal use of material, and an optimum comfort for travellers stands paramount. This book highlights the technical studies which helped define the key points of the competition design. The applied design principles were strictly adhered to during the entire building process. Building site photos and drawings give a chronological and didactic rendering of the construction process. Not only does this book give a clear insight into how the station was constructed, it also reveals specifically why it was done in this way. Clear, concise, and well thought-out: this is the story of applying principles and making choices
