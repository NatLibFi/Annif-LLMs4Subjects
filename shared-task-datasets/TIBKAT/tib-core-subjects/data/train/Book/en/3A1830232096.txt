This book takes an interest in the collapse and formation of the state and is primarily concerned with exploring and comparing the emergence of Kosovo and South Sudan. It contends that both have emerged in the stateness problem experienced by Serbia and Sudan. It demonstrates that the collection of the following three variables has determined their emergence: The occurrence of violence in Serbia and Sudan; The external involvement in this circumstance; and The regional and global support for their emergence. The book develops an independent conceptual framework and deeply explores and compares the emergence of Kosovo and South Sudan. It provides valuable insights for the academic and policymaking communities, given its treatment of the significant collapse and formation of the state in the twenty-first century.
