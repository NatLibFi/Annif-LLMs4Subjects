Statistical modelling of occupant behaviour
"Statistical Modelling of Occupant Behaviour covers a range of statistical methods and models used for modelling energy related occupant behaviour in buildings. It is a classical textbook on statistics including many practical examples related to occupant behaviour, that are either taken from real research problems or adapted from such. The main focus is traditional statistical techniques based on the likelihood principle that can be applied to occupant behaviour modelling, including: General, and generalized linear, and survival models Mixed effect and hierarchical models Linear time series and Markov models Linear state space and hidden Markov models llustration of all methods using occupant behaviour examples implemented in R The built environment affects occupants that live and work in it, and occupants affect the built environment by adapting it to their needs, e.g. adapt their indoor environments by interacting with building components and systems. These adaptive behaviours account for a great uncertainty in prediction of building energy use and indoor environmental conditions. Occupant behaviour is complex and multi-disciplinary but can be successfully modelled using statistical approaches. Statistical Modelling of Occupant Behaviour is written for researchers and advanced practitioners who work with real-world applications and modelling of occupant data. It describes the kinds of statistical models that may be used in various occupant behaviour modelling research. It gives a theoretical overview of these methods and then applies them to the study of occupant behaviour using readily replaceable examples in the R environment that are based on actual and experimental data"--
