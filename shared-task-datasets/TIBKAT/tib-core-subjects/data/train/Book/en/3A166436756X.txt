Explosive ferroelectric generators : from physical principles to engineering
"Explosive Ferroelectric Generators: From Physical Principles to Engineering is an exciting new book that takes the readers inside the world of explosive ferroelectric generators guided by international expert, Dr Sergey I Shkuratov. It acquaints the reader with the principles of operation of ferroelectric generators and provides details on how to design, build and test the devices which are the most developed and the most near-term for practical applications. Containing a considerable amount of experimental data that has been obtained by the author and his team over a period of 20 years, this is the first book that provides key information on theory, performance and applications of ferroelectric generators. It is a fabulous reference for electrical and electronic engineers working with pulsed power systems, researchers, professors, postgraduate, graduate and undergraduate students"--
