Quantum-Statistical Models of Hot Dense Matter : Methods for Computation Opacity and Equation of State
The widely used theoretical models for calculating properties of hot dense matter are studied in this book. Calculations using the presented formulas and algorithms are illustrated by plots, tables, and also are compared with experimental results. The purpose is to help understanding atomic physics in hot plasma and in developing efficient and robust computer codes for calculating opacity and equations of state for arbitrary material in a wide range of temperatures and densities.Key features:- complicated problems of atomic physics are clearly presented- most parts of the book are accessible to students- models are reduced to formulas and algorithms - emphasis on computational aspects of the models, in particular on the computation of opacity and the equations of state for high-temperature plasmas.
