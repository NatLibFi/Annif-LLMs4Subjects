Handbook of ordinary differential equations : exact solutions, methods, and problems
The new edition of this popular handbook contains more equations and methods used in the field than any other book currently available. Encompassing more than 7,000 ODEs with solutions, it presents many asymptotic, approximate analytical, symbolic, and quantitative methods used for analyzing and solving linear and nonlinear equations. This edition covers first-, second-, third-, fourth- and higher-order differential equations and systems along with new nonlinear equations, formulas for effectively constructing solutions, and various equations arising in applications, such as heat and mass transfer, hydrodynamics, and other areas. --
