This book provides a comprehensive yet informal introduction to differentiating and integrating real functions with one variable. It also covers basic first-order differential equations and introduces higher-dimensional differentiation and integration. The focus is on significant theoretical proofs, accompanied by illustrative examples for clarity. A comprehensive bibliography aids deeper understanding. The concept of a function's differential is a central theme, relating to the "differential" within integrals. The discussion of indefinite integrals (collections of antiderivatives) precedes definite integrals, naturally connecting the two. The Appendix offers essential math formulas, exercise properties, and an in-depth exploration of continuity and differentiability. Select exercise solutions are provided. This book suits short introductory math courses for novice physics/engineering students. It equips them with vital differential and integral calculus tools for real-world applications. It is also useful for first-year undergraduates, reinforcing advanced calculus foundations for better Physics comprehension.
