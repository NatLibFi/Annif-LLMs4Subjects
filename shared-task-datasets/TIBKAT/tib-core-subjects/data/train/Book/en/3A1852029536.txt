Quantum mechanics : formalism, methodologies, and applications
"This book has developed from the author's four decades of zealous teaching of classical mechanics, quantum theory, and atomic physics at premium IITs in India, and from his lectures on these subjects delivered for the popular National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL) and SWAYAM PRABHA online channels, which are effective initiatives of the Government of India. Quantum Mechanics: Formalism, Methodologies, and Applications covers the current curriculum requirements of most courses offered in different programs of physics. It will be particularly useful for masters and PhD students taking core courses on quantum mechanics, atomic, molecular, and optical physics, condensed matter, and nuclear and particle physics. It will also be useful to students learning quantum information science and quantum computing. It discusses a wide range of topics beginning with a pedagogical formulation of quantum mechanics including vector space formalism, matrix mechanics, path integrals, and also relativistic quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics of many-electron atoms is discussed, and applications in spectroscopy and quantum collisions are covered. Topics like the optical and the reciprocity theorems, Eisenbud-Wigner-Smith scattering time delay, and an introduction to quantum computing and teleportation are also included. These topics represent major milestones in the advances in our understanding of atomic physics and condensed matter. They have propelled revolutions in nanosciences and nanotechnologies, atomic clocks and ultrafast dynamics, and quantum information science and quantum computing. Quantum Mechanics: Formalism, Methodologies, and Applications would serve a modern graduate curriculum very well, since it provides a rapid but gentle ramp-up from the basics of quantum mechanics to the methodologies of its applications in the frontiers technology"--
