Analysis on real and complex manifolds
Chapter 1 presents theorems on differentiable functions often used in differential topology, such as the implicit function theorem, Sard's theorem and Whitney's approximation theorem. The next chapter is an introduction to real and complex manifolds. It contains an exposition of the theorem of Frobenius, the lemmata of Poincar√© and Grothendieck with applications of Grothendieck's lemma to complex analysis, the imbedding theorem of Whitney and Thom's transversality theorem. Chapter 3 includes characterizations of linear differentiable operators, due to Peetre and Hormander. The inequalit
