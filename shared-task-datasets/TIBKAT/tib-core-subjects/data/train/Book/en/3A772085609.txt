Plant cell morphogenesis : methods and protocols
Plant Cell Morphogenesis: Methods and Protocols provides a collection of experimental techniques used in current research on the cellular aspects of plant morphogenesis.Methods and techniques include contemporary takes on classical light microscopy and histochemistry through automated microscopy applications, use of advanced optical tools, quantitative image analysis, study of cellular dynamics of apical meristems, specialized electron microscopy techniques, and methods used to study specific model plant cell types and protocols for using heterologous expression in yeast to study cell morphogenesis genes. Individual chapters in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format are written by expert researchers in the field and include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step laboratory protocols, and key tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls
