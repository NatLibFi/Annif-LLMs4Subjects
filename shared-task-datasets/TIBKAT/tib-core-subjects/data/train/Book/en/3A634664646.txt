PEDOT : principles and applications of an intrinsically conductive polymer
"A handbook and a guide, this resource provides the full chemical, physical, and technical information about the most forwardly developed electrically conductive polymer, Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), otherwise known as PEDOT. Discussing basic knowledge and exploring technical applications, the book is based on information generated by universities and academic research, as well as by industrial scientists, giving the full picture of the experimental and the practical. While there is information available in handbooks on polythiophene chemistry and physics, under which PEDOT falls, until now there has been no book focusing exclusively on this important conducting polymer"--Provided by publisher
