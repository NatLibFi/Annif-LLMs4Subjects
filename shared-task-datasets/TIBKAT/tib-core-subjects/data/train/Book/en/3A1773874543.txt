Principles of Digital Transmission : With Wireless Applications
and motivation -- A mathematical introduction -- Basic results from information theory -- Waveform transmission over the Gaussian Channel -- Digital modulation schemes -- Modulations for the wireless channel -- Intersymbol interference channels -- Adaptive receivers and channel equalization -- Carrier and clock synchronization -- Improving the transmission reliability: Block codes -- Convolutional and concatenated codes -- Coded modulation -- Digital transmission over fading channels -- Digital transmission over nonlinear channels -- Useful formulas and approximations -- Some facts from matrix theory -- Variational techniques and constrained optimization -- Transfer functions of directed graphs -- Approximate computation of averages -- Viterbi algorithm.
Principles of Digital Transmission is designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate level students and professions in telecommunications. Teachers and learners can mix and match chapters to create four distinct courses: (1) a one-term basic course in digital communications; (2) a one-term course in advanced digital communications; (3) a one-term course in information theory and coding; (4) a two-term course sequence in digital communications and coding. The book provides rigorous mathematical tools for the analysis and design of digital transmission systems. The authors emphasize methodology in their aim to teach the reader how to do it rather than how it is done. They apply the fundamental tools of the discipline onto a number of systems, such as wireless data transmission systems.
