Introduction to computational modeling using C and open-source tools
"Because computational models usually require high-performance computing to solve large and complex scientific problems, this book presents an introduction to computational models and their implementation using the C programming language. Its primary goal is to present basic to semi-advanced principles of computational modeling, at the level of Calculus and Intermediate Programming. Emphasis is on reasoning about problems, conceptualizing the problem, mathematical modeling, and their computational solution that involves computing results and visualization. "--
