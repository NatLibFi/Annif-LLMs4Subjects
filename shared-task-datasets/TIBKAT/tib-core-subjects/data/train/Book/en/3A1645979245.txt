Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Statistics
This concise and readable book addresses primarily readers with a background in classical statistical physics and introduces quantum mechanical notions as required. Conceived as a primer to bridge the gap between statistical physics and quantum information, a field to which the author has contributed significantly himself, it emphasizes concepts and thorough discussions of the fundamental notions and prepares the reader for deeper studies, not the least through a selection of well chosen exercises.
