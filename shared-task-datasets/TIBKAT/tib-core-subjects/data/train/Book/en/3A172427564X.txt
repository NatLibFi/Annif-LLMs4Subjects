Developments in mathematical and conceptual physics : concepts and applications for engineers
This book presents concepts of theoretical physics with engineering applications. The topics are of an intense mathematical nature involving tools like probability and random processes, ordinary and partial differential equations, linear algebra and infinite-dimensional operator theory, perturbation theory, stochastic differential equations, and Riemannian geometry. These mathematical tools have been applied to study problems in mechanics, fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, nonlinear dynamical systems, general relativity, cosmology, and electrodynamics. A particularly interesting topic of research interest developed in this book is the design of quantum unitary gates of large size using the Feynman diagrammatic approach to quantum field theory. Through this book, the reader will be able to observe how basic physics can revolutionize technology and also how diverse branches of mathematical physics like large deviation theory, quantum field theory, general relativity, and electrodynamics have many common issues that provide the starting point for unifying the whole of physics, namely in the formulation of Grand Unified Theories (GUTS).
