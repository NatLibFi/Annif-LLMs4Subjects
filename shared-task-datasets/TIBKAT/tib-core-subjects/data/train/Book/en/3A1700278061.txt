Oil-in-water nanosized emulsions for drug delivery and targeting
"Among the different nanoparticulate systems that have been proposed for drug delivery and drug targeting purposes, oil-in-water nanosized emulsions having either positive (cationic) or negative (anionic) charges are being emerged as successful systems to manufacture through?not only in a laboratory level, but also on an industrial scale. This book combines knowledge on emulsion, microemulsion, and nanoemulsion into one comprehensive volume, making it an ideal resource for researchers, professionals, and students. It provides an overview of the emulsion preparation methods and characterization techniques via different sophisticated analytical instruments, and it covers clinical implications through various case studies/examples. Regulatory view on nanosized emulsions are discussed comprehensively in this book"--
