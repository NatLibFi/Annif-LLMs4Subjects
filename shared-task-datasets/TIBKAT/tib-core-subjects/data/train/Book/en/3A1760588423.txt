Chemistry : a molecular approach
For courses in chemistry.   Actively engage students to become expert problem solvers and critical thinkers Nivaldo Tro s Chemistry: A Molecular Approach presents chemistry visually through multi-level images macroscopic, molecular, and symbolic representations   to help students see the connections between the world they see around them, the atoms and molecules that compose the world, and the formulas they write down on paper. Interactive, digital versions of selected worked examples instruct students how to break down problems using Tro s unique  Sort, Strategize, Solve, and Check  technique and then complete a step in the example. To build conceptual understanding, Dr. Tro employs an active learning approach through interactive media that requires students to pause during videos to ensure they understand before continuing.    The 5th Edition pairs digital, pedagogical innovation with insights from learning design and educational research to create an active, integrated, and easy-to-use framework. The new edition actively engages students in becoming expert problem solvers and makes it possible for professors to teach the general chemistry course easily and effectively
