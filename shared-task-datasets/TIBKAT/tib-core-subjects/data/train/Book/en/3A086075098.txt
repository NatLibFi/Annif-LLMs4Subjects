Optical communications technology is growing increasingly in importance, with a rapid pace of development. Innovative optical devices have emerged from the integration of semiconductor laser diodes, amplifiers and filters with optical waveguide technology. This well-researched volume traces the evolution of semiconductor laser amplifiers (SLAs) from these technologies. Focusing on the principle applications of SLAs, the author illustrates the growing importance of these functional components in the future of optical communications systems. This book will provide engineering and science students with a basic understanding of laser diode and optical amplification through the analysis of the performance characteristics of these devices both in theory and application. Practicing device engineers wishing to consolidate their knowledge in lightwave technology will also find this book an invaluable reference
