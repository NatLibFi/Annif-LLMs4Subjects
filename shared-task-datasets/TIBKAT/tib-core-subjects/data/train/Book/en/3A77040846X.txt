General aviation aircraft design : applied methods and procedures
The aircraft design process -- Aircraft cost analysis -- Initial sizing -- Aircraft conceptual layout -- Aircraft structural layout -- Aircraft weight analysis -- Selecting the power plant -- The anatomy of the airfoil -- The anatomy of the wing -- The anatomy of lift enhancement -- The anatomy of the tail -- The anatomy of the fuselage -- The anatomy of the landing gear -- The anatomy of the propeller -- Aircraft drag analysis -- Performance : introduction -- Performance : take-off -- Performance : climb -- Performance : cruise -- Performance : range analysis -- Performance : descent -- Performance : landing -- Miscellaneous design notes
"Provides the practicing engineer with a versatile handbook that serves as the first source for finding answers to realistic aircraft design questions. The book is structured in an equation/derivation/solved example" format for easy access to content. Readers will find it a valuable guide to topics such as sizing of horizontal and vertical tails to minimize drag, sizing of lifting surfaces to ensure proper dynamic stability, numerical performance methods, and common faults and fixes in aircraft design. In most cases, numerical examples involve actual aircraft specs."--Provided by publisher
