Diffusion-Weighted MR Imaging of the Brain
Diffusion-weighted MR imaging is widely accepted as a means to identify stroke, thus enabling rapid and effective treatment. Over the past four years, these expert authors have presented over 30 exhibits and scientific reports on diffusion-weighted imaging at the RSNA and the American Society of Neuroradiology (ASNR), and more than 10 of these presentations have been recognized by specific awards. Diffusion-Weighted MR Imaging of the Brains chapters range from basic principles to interpretation of diffusion-weighted MR imaging and specific disease. This is a valuable reference for radiologists, neurologists, neurosurgeons as well as residents, fellows, radiology technologists.
