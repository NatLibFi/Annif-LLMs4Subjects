Linux server security : hack and defend
Linux Server Security: Hack and Defend presents a detailed guide for experienced administrators, aspiring hackers and other IT professionals seeking a more advanced understanding of Linux security. Written by a 20-year veteran of Linux server deployment, this book provides the insight of experience along with highly practical instruction. The topics range from the theory of past, current, and future attacks, to the mitigation of a variety of online attacks, all the way to empowering you to perform numerous malicious attacks yourself (in the hope that you will learn how to defend against them). By increasing your understanding of a hacker's tools and mindset you're less likely to be confronted by the all-too-common reality faced by many administrators these days: someone else has control of your systems. The techniques presented apply to almost all Linux distributions including the many Debian and Red Hat derivatives and some other Unix-type systems
