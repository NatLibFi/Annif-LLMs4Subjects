Forest-based biomass energy : concepts and applications
"Why a text on Forest-Based Biomass Energy? Good question. A better question might be: What is Forest-Based Biomass Energy? Simply, forest-based biomass energy is energy and energy products that are derived from forest biomass in forest-lands. Forest biomass (trees, shrubs, limbs, and vegetation debris) can be converted to energy and energy products in a number of ways: direct combustion, pellets, gasification, and co-firing. Many of these uses are described in this text"--
"This reference covers renewable energy derived from natural processes that are replenished continuously in various forms, such as biofues, bio-products, and bio-power. The book provides an overview of renewable and sustainable energy and an explanation of the science and mathematics of biomass. It examines numerous types of biomass feedstocks, and includes coverage on converting biomass waste into useable energy. Tree stocks covered include Poplar, Willow, American Sycamore, Sweetgum, and Loblolly. It also offers information on the benefits of Agroforestry, the approach of combining crops with livestock.
