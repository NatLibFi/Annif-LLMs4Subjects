Surface design : applications in bioscience and nanotechnology
Surface Design: Applications in Bioscience and Nanotechnology; Foreword; Contents; List of Contributors; 1 Tutorial Reviews; 1.2 Tutorial Review: Surface Plasmon Resonance-Based Biosensors; 1.3 Tutorial Review: Surface Modification and Adhesion; 1.4 Tutorial Review: Modern Biological Sensors; 2 Functional Thin Film Architecture and Platforms Based on Polymers; 3 Biointerfaces, Biosensing, and Molecular Interactions; 3.2 Modification of Surfaces by Photosensitive Silanes; 3.3 Solid-Supported Bilayer Lipid Membranes; 3.4 Interaction of Structured and Functionalized Polymers with Cancer Cells.
This carefully selected balance of tutorial-like review chapters and advanced research covers hot topics in the field of biointerfaces, biosensing, nanoparticles at interfaces, and functionalized quantum dots. It also includes chapters arising from non-published work with topics such as surface design and their applications, as well as new developments in analytical tools for materials science and life science. Based on the very close and complementary collaboration of three distinguished leading research groups, this book highlights recent advances in the field ranging from synthesis and fabr
