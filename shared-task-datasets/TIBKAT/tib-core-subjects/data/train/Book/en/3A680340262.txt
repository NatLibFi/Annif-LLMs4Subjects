Complex-shaped metal nanoparticles : bottom-up syntheses and applications
"Recent years have witnessed the development of non-spherical metal nanoparticles with complex morphologies, such as polyhedra, plates, prisms, rods, wires, nanoboxes, nanocages or dumbbells, that offer tremendous potential in materials science, biochemistry and medicine. Covering all important aspects and techniques of preparation and characterization of nanoparticles with controlled morphology and architecture, this book provides a sound overview -- from the basics right up to recent developments. Renowned research scientists from all over the world present our existing knowledge of the field."--Provided by publisher
