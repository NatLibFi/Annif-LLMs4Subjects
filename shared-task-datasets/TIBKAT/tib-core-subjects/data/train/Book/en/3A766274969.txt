Copper-mediated cross-coupling reactions : [complete, up-to-date collection of available catalytic systems and processes]
"Providing insight into the use of copper in cross-coupling reactions as a cost-efficient alternative to palladium, Copper-Mediated Cross Coupling Reactions provides a complete up-to-date collection of the available catalytic systems and processes. This essential reference covers a broad scope of copper-mediated reactions, their variations, key advances, improvements, and an array of applications that have revolutionized copper catalysis for any industry involving organic synthesis. The text discusses recently developed methods for conducting copper-mediated reactions with supported catalysts, which allow for recyclable and reusable systems"--
"This book is divided into three parts: Formation of C-Heteroatom Bonds, Formation of C-C Bonds, and Applications of Copper Catalyzed Cross Coupling Reactions: Heterocycles, Natural Products, Process and Sustainable Chemistry"--
