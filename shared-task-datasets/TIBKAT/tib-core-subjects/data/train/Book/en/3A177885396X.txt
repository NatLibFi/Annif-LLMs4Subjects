An in-depth look at carbon emissions
"While sustainable growth confronts a progressively decisive role, and governments embrace measures to authorize reduced carbon emissions, understanding pioneering methods to provide supply chains in an environmental context epitomizes a significant purpose in diverse sectors. This book, An In-depth Look at Carbon Emissions, concentrates on carbon emissions in different sectors owing to energy use and associated features. It gives an overview of recently established systems, practices, methods, and strategies accompanied by exploiting sufficient source examination of carbon emissions that are released from fossil fuel/hydrocarbon reservoirs, automobiles, transportation, agricultural terrains, farms, buildings, and so forth. In recent years, global carbon emissions have reached an all-time high and are increasing. It is high time that we pay specific consideration to carbon emissions and comprehend potential solutions, especially to meet the Paris climate agreement objective. This book will offer established approaches to cut carbon, with studies on transportation, home energy use, energy consumption, as well as how best to inspire the workplace and community by behavior. This book aims at empowering readers to meet the possibility of low carbon living to challenge our society's utmost threats. This book will surely provide state-of-the-art materials in abundance for implementing energy conservation measures and carbon emission reduction"--
