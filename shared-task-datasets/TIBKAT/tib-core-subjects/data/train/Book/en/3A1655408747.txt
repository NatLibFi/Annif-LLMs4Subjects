Bifurcations and Catastrophes : Geometry of Solutions to Nonlinear Problems
Based on a lecture course at the Ecole Polytechnique (Paris), this text gives a rigorous introduction to many of the key ideas in nonlinear analysis, dynamical systems and bifurcation theory including catastrophe theory. Wherever appropriate it emphasizes a geometrical or coordinate-free approach which allows a clear focus on the essential mathematical structures. Taking a unified view, it brings out features common to different branches of the subject while giving ample references for more advanced or technical developments
