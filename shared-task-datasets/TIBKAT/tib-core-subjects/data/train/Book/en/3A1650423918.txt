Relativistic Quantum Mechanics
* Which problems do arise within relativistic enhancements of the Schrodinger theory, especially if one adheres to the usual one-particle interpretation? * To what extent can these problems be overcome? * What is the physical necessity of quantum field theories? In many textbooks, only insufficient answers to these fundamental questions are provided by treating the relativistic quantum mechanical one-particle concept very superficially and instead introducing field quantization as soon as possible. By contrast, this book emphasizes particularly this point of view (relativistic quantum mechanic
