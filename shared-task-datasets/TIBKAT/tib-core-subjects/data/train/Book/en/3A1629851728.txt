Design and construction of modern steel railway bridges
"This second edition of design and construction of modern steel railway bridges updates what is perhaps the first book on this topic in many decades. It complements the recommended practices outlined in chapter 15 - steel structures in the manual for railway engineering (MRE), published annually by the American Railway Engineering and Maintenance-of-Way Association (AREMA). The book has been carefully designed to remain valid through many editions of the MRE." --
