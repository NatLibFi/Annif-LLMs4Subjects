Aldo van Eyck
"Aldo van Eyck (1918-1999) was a Dutch architect, writer, and teacher who helped redefine Modern architecture in the second half of the 20th century.  As an advocate for architecture's  engagement with history, culture, climate, and the lived human experience of buildings and urban spaces, he created designs that privileged place and the daily rituals in the lives of its inhabitants over universal ideals. In this volume, enlivened by 300 illustrations from the Aldo van Eyck Archive, Robert McCarter provides the first comprehensive study of Van Eyck's 50-year career since his death, guiding readers through the architect's buildings and unrealized projects, with a focus on the interior spatial experience and on the design and construction processes..." --Front jacket flap
