Wastewater treatment with the Fenton process : principles and applications
"The presence of refractory organic compounds in wastewater is a global problem. Advanced Oxidation Processes and the Fenton Oxidation Process are alternative technologies for wastewater and water treatment. This book gives an overview of Fenton process principles, explains the main factors influencing this technology, includes applications, kinetic and thermodynamic calculations, and presents a strong overview on the heterogeneous catalytic approach. It demonstrates that the iron-based heterogeneous Fenton process is highly efficient, environmentally friendly, and can be suitable for wastewater treatment and industrial wastewater"--
