Mathematical summary for digital signal processing applications with Matlab
Mathematical Summary for Digital Signal Processing Applications with Matlab consists, of Mathematics which is not usually dealt in the DSP core subject, but used in DSP applications. Matlab programs with illustrations are given for the selective topics such as generation of Multivariate Gaussian distributed sample outcomes, Bacterial foraging algorithm, Newtons iteration, Steepest descent algorithm, etc. are given exclusively in the separate chapter. Also Mathematical Summary for Digital Signal Processing Applications with Matlab is written in such a way that it is suitable for Non-Mathematical readers and is very much suitable for the beginners who are doing research in Digital Signal Processing. --
