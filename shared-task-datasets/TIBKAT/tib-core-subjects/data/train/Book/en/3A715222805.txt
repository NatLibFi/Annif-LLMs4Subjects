The live web : building event-based connections in the cloud
Annotation, Imagine a world in which your phone automatically mutes the ringer when you start watching a movie. Imagine a world in which your alarm clock sets itself based on your schedule and other information like the weather, the traffic, and your past behavior. Imagine a world in which the mundane parts of business travel or scheduling an appointment with a new doctor are automatically taken care of according to your preferences. That world is the Live Web. THE LIVE WEB: BUILDING EVENT-BASED CONNECTIONS IN THE CLOUD is a book about specific concepts, architectures, and technologies you can use to build these types of Live Web experiences. You'll discover specific techniques for building Live Web applications using the Kinetic Rules Language (KRL), designed from the ground up with the Live Web in mind, and the Kinetic Rules Engine. The premise of this book is simple, but profound: The Web of the future--the Live Web--will link our lives in ways we can hardly imagine and you can start building that Web today
