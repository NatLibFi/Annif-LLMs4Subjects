The quarantine atlas : mapping global life under COVID-19
"In April 2020, Bloomberg CityLab journalists Laura Bliss and Jessica Lee Martin asked readers to share homemade maps of their lives during the coronavirus pandemic. The response was astonishing: the hundreds of maps and accompanying stories received served as windows into what individuals around the world were experiencing during the crisis and its resonant social consequences. In 'The quarantine atlas', Bliss distills these stunning submissions into themes that defined the pandemic year, including the erasure of work-life boundaries, the burdens placed on frontline workers, and heightened awareness of neighborhood life. She pairs them with essays by journalists and authors ..., as well as notes from the original mapmakers."--
