Getting to know ArcGIS : ModelBuilder ; [includes exercise data on DVD ; for ArcGIS 10]
Getting to Know ArcGIS ModelBuilder teaches readers how to develop and run reusable geoprocessing workflows and models in ModelBuilder, a visual programming technology available in ArcGIS. Getting to Know ArcGIS ModelBuilder presents basic and more complex concepts and demonstrates best practices through hands-on exercises. Divided into seven chapters addressing model basics, interactive models, flow control, multiple inputs, model iterations, model environment, and building documentation, this book fosters a comprehensive knowledge of ModelBuilder for the classroom and for self-learners. All the data needed for the exercises, as well as examples of models, Python scripts, and custom applications, are included in a companion DVD.  As GIS manager for the city of Euless, Texas, David Allen designed data structures and custom applications from scratch. He has used his knowledge of GIS as an instructor at Tarrant County College for the past eight years, during which time he assisted in the development of a GIS degree program, and worked to establish a state standard for GIS degree programs in Texas. Allen is the author of GIS Tutorial 2: Spatial Analysis Workbook (Esri Press 2010) and coauthor of GIS Tutorial 3: Advanced Workbook (Esri Press 2010).
