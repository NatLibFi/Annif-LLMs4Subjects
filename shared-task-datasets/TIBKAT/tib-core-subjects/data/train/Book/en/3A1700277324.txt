Requirements modeling and coding : an object-oriented approach
"Requirements Modeling and Coding attempts to bridge the gap between modeling and coding and serves the growing trend of agile development better than existing textbooks in the area. Instead of using toy tools to create modeling and coding examples, the author teaches IBM Rational Rhapsody as a modeling tool and Microsoft Visual C# as a programming tool. C# is the purest object-oriented programming language and the best tool for developing graphical user interfaces, while Rhapsody is a visual development environment that real software developers use to create real-time or embedded systems. This book serves as a text for a capstone course on Systems Analysis and Design in Information Systems programs. It conceptualizes business objects and functions, develops business models and software architectures, and enriches the models and the architectures by storyboarding use cases along with user interface designs"--
