Bounded rationality and economic evolution : a contribution to decision making, economics, and management
This seminal work advances beyond neoclassical economics to provide an integrated overview of economic decision making, and the management of bounded rationality and its evolutionary consequences. Clem Tisdell successfully combines recent developments in learning and game theory, transaction costs and evolutionary economics to provide new insights into economic and managerial phenomena. The results are applied to different levels of decision-making, including decisions by individuals, taking into account learning possibilities, decisions by groups and economic organizations including optimal communication within organizations. Bounded Rationality and Economic Evolution will be of particular use to economists, academics in management, business administration and public administration, and social scientists interested in group behaviour
