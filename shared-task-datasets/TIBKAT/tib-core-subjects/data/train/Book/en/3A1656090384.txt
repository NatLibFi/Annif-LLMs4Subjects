Pattern recognition
A classic -- offering comprehensive and unified coverage with a balance between theory and practice! Pattern recognition is integral to a wide spectrum of scientific disciplines and technologies including image analysis, speech recognition, audio classification, communications, computer-aided diagnosis, and data mining. The authors, leading experts in the field of pattern recognition, have once again provided an up-to-date, self-contained volume encapsulating this wide spectrum of information. Each chapter is designed to begin with basics of theory progressing to advanced topics and then discusses cutting-edge techniques. Problems and exercises are present at the end of each chapter with a solutions manual provided via a companion website where a number of demonstrations are also available to aid the reader in gaining practical experience with the theories and associated algorithms. This edition includes discussion of Bayesian classification, Bayesian networks, linear and nonlinear classifier design (including neural networks and support vector machines), dynamic programming and hidden Markov models for sequential data, feature generation (including wavelets, principal component analysis, independent component analysis and fractals), feature selection techniques, basic concepts from learning theory, and clustering concepts and algorithms. This book considers classical and current theory and practice, of both supervised and unsupervised pattern recognition, to build a complete background for professionals and students of engineering.
