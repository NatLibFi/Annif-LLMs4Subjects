Mechatronics : dynamical systems approach and theory of holors
Mechatronics offers new solutions and unprecedented flexibility in developing and understanding transportation systems, industrial production processes, and aerospace, automotive and traction components, etc. This book focusses on exploiting a dynamical systems approach and theory of holors in mechatronics for modelling and characterization of various dynamical systems. Written as an introductory textbook for advanced students, it can be used by teachers and students both in lessons and independently. It includes subject knowledge and pedagogical support for teachers of mechatronics. This title will also be an essential reference for practicing scientists and engineers working in the field of mechatronics.
