Hydrocarbon seepage : from source to surface
"With the increased resolution power of many geophysical methods, we are seeing direct evidence of seeps on a wide variety of data, including conventional seismic. New methods and technology have also evolved to better measure and detect seeps and their artifacts and reservoir charge and to map migration and remigration routes. In addition, detection of seepage is important for minimizing the risks associated with shallow gas drilling hazards, ensuring platform stability, and preventing well blow-outs. This volume is organized into three sections, each with a different focus. The first section, "Descriptions and Observations of Seeps", includes field studies, observations of seep environments, migration systems, and use of modern sampling techniques. The second section, "Science of Seepage -- Methodology", discusses new techniques including DNA sampling, use of biomarkers, Neural Network analysis, and remote multispectral analysis. The final section, "Implications of Seeps", shows how seeps may be used to reduce prospect risk and assess risk elements such as trap seal and fault leakage. This volume is intended to be a reference for understanding seep occurrences and demonstrating the development and use of new technologies to image them with a focus on exploration and field development applications. It will be a valuable reference to geologists, geophysicists, and petroleum engineers everywhere"--Provided by publisher
