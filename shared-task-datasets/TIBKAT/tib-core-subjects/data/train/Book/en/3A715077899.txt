Fundamentals of wastewater treatment and engineering
"All societies depend on effective wastewater treatment and engineering, and every good civil engineer needs an understanding of the subject. This textbook presents the material necessary for a semester-long course for undergraduates and graduate students in civil and environmental engineering, and environmental technology. Each main chapter presents a topic as a theoretical section followed by example problems, and a set of questions and problems. Applicable regulations and standards are given from the World Health Organization and United States Environmental Protection Agency. Readers will get a strong grounding in the principles, and should be able to design the unit processes used in wastewater treatment operations"--
