Targeted genome editing using site-specific nucleases : ZFNs, TALENs, and the CRISPR/Cas9 system
"This book serves as an introduction to targeted genome editing, beginning with the background of this rapidly developing field and methods for generation of engineered nucleases. Applications of genome editing tools are then described in detail, in iPS cells and diverse organisms such as mice, rats, marine invertebrates, fish, frogs, and plants. Tools that are mentioned include zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and CRISPR/Cas9, all of which have received much attention in recent years as breakthrough technologies."--
