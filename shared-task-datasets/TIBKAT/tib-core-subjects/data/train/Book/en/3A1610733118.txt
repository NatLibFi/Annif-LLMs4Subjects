Photopolymers : photoresist materials, processes, and applications
"Advancements in photopolymers have led to groundbreaking achievements in electronic, optical, and medical engineering. At present, photopolymers have myriad applications in semiconductor device manufacturing, printed circuit boards (PCBs), ultraviolet (UV) curing, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and medical materials. Addressing topics such as chemically amplified resists, immersion lithography, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, and nanoimprinting, this book covers photopolymers from core concepts to industrial applications, providing the chemical formulae and structures of the materials discussed as well as practical case studies from some of the world's largest corporations"--
