Integrable Systems in the realm of Algebraic Geometry
Integrable systems are related to algebraic geometry in many different ways. This book deals with some aspects of this relation, the main focus being on the algebraic geometry of the level manifolds of integrable systems and the construction of integrable systems, starting from algebraic geometric data. For a rigorous account of these matters, integrable systems are defined on affine algebraic varieties rather than on smooth manifolds. The exposition is self-contained and is accessible at the graduate level; in particular, prior knowledge of integrable systems is not assumed
