Handbook of renewable energy technology and systems
"Worldwide, the effects of global warming, pollution due to power generation from fossil fuels, and its depletion have led to the rapid deployment of renewable energy-based power generation. The leading renewable technologies are wind and photovoltaic (PV) systems. The incorporation of this generation of technologies has led to the development of a broad array of new methods and tools to integrate renewable generation into power system networks. The handbook of renewable energy technology & systems comprises 22 chapters, arranged into four sections, which present a comprehensive analysis of various renewable energy-based distributed generation (DG) technologies. Aspects of renewable energy covered include wind and photovoltaic power systems and technology, micro-grids, power electronic applications, power quality, and the protection of renewable distributed generation"--
