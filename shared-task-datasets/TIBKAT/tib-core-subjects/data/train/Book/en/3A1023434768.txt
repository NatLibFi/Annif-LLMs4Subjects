Building knowledge regions in North America : emerging technology innovation poles
1. The key elements of innovation infrastructure and the evolution of knowledge regions : a framework for analysis -- 2. US technology infrastructure and the development of regional innovation poles through incubation mechanisms -- 3. Canada's innovation poles and their role as technology incubation spaces -- 4. Mexico : the challenge to create regional innovative environments -- 5. Comparative analysis of the selected North American knowledge regions : lessons and conclusions
Focusing on emerging technology regions of the US, Canada and Mexico, the authors provide an analysis of firms' innovative milieus in three contexts: national systems of innovation, knowledge regions and incubation mechanisms. An overview of the evolution of each region over the past quarter century is presented, along with an evaluation of the effectiveness of science parks and technology incubators in various regional and national environments
