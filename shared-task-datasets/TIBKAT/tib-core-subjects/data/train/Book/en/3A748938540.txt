Digital image processing : concepts, algorithms, and scientific applications
From the reviews of the first edition: "I recommend this book to anyone seriously engaged in image processing. It will clearly stretch the horizon of some readers and be a good reference for others. This is not just another image processing book; it is a book worth owning and a book worth reading several times .." #J. Electronic Imaging# This practical guidebook uses the concepts and mathematics familiar to students of the natural sciences to provide them with a working knowledge of modern techniques of digital image processing. It takes readers from basic concepts to current research topics and demonstrates how digital image processing can be used for data gathering in research. Detailed examples of applications on PC-based systems and ready-to-use algorithms enhance the text, as do nearly 200 illustrations (16 in color). The book also includes the most exciting recent advances such as reconstruction of 3-D objects from projections and the analysis of stereo images and image sequences
