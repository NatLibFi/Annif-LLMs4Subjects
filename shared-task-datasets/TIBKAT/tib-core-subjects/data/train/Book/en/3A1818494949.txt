Landscape performance modeling using Rhino and Grasshopper
"This is a guidebook for landscape architects to learn the fundamental practices and use of the computational software Rhino 3D and the plugin Grasshopper for parametric modelling, landscape inventory, and performative analysis. This process visually connects intangible and abstract information with physical and spatial relationships to signify the impact ecological, climate, and cultural factors have on landscape performance and decision making. Each chapter begins with a summary of the performance method and its application in different projects, outlining the expected goals from industry standard equations and operations. Chapters cover parametric modelling scripts to measure ecosystem services of stormwater management, erosion control, tree benefits, outdoor comfort, accessibility, and many others. Using photographs, tables, and parametric scripts to create qualitative and quantitative representations of landscape performance and ecosystem services, readers will learn to communicate the impact and significance of their outputs. This book will be beneficial to educators, students and professionals interested in using computational modelling as a performance assessment and graphic visualization tool"--
