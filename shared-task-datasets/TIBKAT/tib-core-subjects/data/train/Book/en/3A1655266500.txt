Elemental Methods in Ergodic Ramsey Theory
This book, suitable for graduate students and professional mathematicians alike, didactically introduces methodologies due to Furstenberg and others for attacking problems in chromatic and density Ramsey theory via recurrence in topological dynamics and ergodic theory, respectively. Many standard results are proved, including the classical theorems of van der Waerden, Hindman, and Szemer√©di. More importantly, the presentation strives to reflect the extent to which the field has been streamlined since breaking onto the scene around twenty years ago. Potential readers who were previously intrigued by the subject matter but found it daunting may want to give a second look
