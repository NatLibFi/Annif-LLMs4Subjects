Transport of information-carriers in semiconductors and nanodevices
Introduction to information carriers & transport models -- Semiclassical transport theory of charge carriers -- Semiclassical transport theory of charge carriers -- Quantum transport theory of charge carriers -- Carrier transport in LDS and nanostructures -- Carrier transport in nanotubes & nanowires -- Phonon transport & heat flow -- Photon transport -- Spin transport & spintronic devices
"This book contains a comprehensive discussion of the most important topics of information-carrier transport, including some topics not previously presented, altogether, in a single book. The main purpose of this book is to develop an appreciation and a deep understanding for the conceptual foundations underlying the operation of emerging nanoelectronic devices"--
