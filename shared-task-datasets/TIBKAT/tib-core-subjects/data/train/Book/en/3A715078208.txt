Environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing
"In regard to gaining U.S. energy independence and a sustainable, reliable source of energy, the current push to develop renewable energy sources, including hydropower, wave and tide power, geothermal, bio-power, wind-derived power, solar power and fuel cell technology makes good sense. While there is considerable argument about which of these potential long-term energy sources is best to develop--has the most promise--there can be little doubt as to the need for innovation and the development of viable renewable energy sources"--
"Hydraulic fracturing is a well stimulation process used to maximize the extraction of hard-to-reach underground resources. While hydraulic fracturing allows access to previously unobtainable energy supplies, the technology can cause serious damage to environmental media. Public concerns have focused on the impacts of the process used during natural gas production from shale and coalbed methane formations. This book discusses the pros and cons of hydraulic fracturing in a balanced manner. It emphasizes the need for the mining of natural gas to provide future clean energy supplies but also stresses the need for close monitoring of the process, chemicals, and fate of waste products"--
