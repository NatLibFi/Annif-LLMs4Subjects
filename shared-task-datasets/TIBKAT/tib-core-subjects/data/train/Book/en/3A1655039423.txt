Methods in Nonlinear Integral Equations
Methods in Nonlinear Integral Equations presents several extremely fruitful methods for the analysis of systems and nonlinear integral equations. They include: fixed point methods (the Schauder and Leray-Schauder principles), variational methods (direct variational methods and mountain pass theorems), and iterative methods (the discrete continuation principle, upper and lower solutions techniques, Newton's method and the generalized quasilinearization method). Many important applications for several classes of integral equations and, in particular, for initial and boundary value problems, are presented to complement the theory. Special attention is paid to the existence and localization of solutions in bounded domains such as balls and order intervals. The presentation is essentially self-contained and leads the reader from classical concepts to current ideas and methods of nonlinear analysis.
