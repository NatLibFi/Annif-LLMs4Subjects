Sensor and data fusion : a tool for information assessment and decision making
This book illustrates the benefits of sensor fusion by considering the characteristics of infrared, microwave, and millimeter-wave sensors, including the influence of the atmosphere on their performance. Topics include applications of multiple-sensor systems; target, background, and atmospheric signature-generation phenomena and modeling; and methods of combining multiple-sensor data in target identity and tracking data fusion architectures. The information in this edition has been substantially expanded and updated to incorporate recent approaches to sensor and data fusion and application examples
