Religious education and Christian theologies : some European perspectives
Developments in theology and developments in religious education in different countries encourage a renewed dialogue between the two areas. In this book special emphasis is given to the role of Christian theologies in relation to religious education. In most countries of Europe religious education is part of the curriculum in public schools. Religious education is concerned with both education and religion and accepted as an academic subject in its own right. Its relationship with theology, religious studies and educational philosophy can be seen in contrasting ways due to different traditions and developments of the subject in Europe.
