Galaxies in Turmoil : The Active and Starburst Galaxies and the Black Holes That Drive Them
Active galaxies involve some of the most extreme conditions and some of the most intriguing phenomena found anywhere in the universe. Written for amateur astronomers, school and college science students and for those with a more general interest in science, Galaxies in Turmoil provides a readable, non-mathematical account of one of the hottest areas of astronomical research. Observing details are given for 160 active galaxies, all of which are within the reach of amateur astronomers using small to medium-sized telescopes. There are tips on observing galaxies and active galaxies using binoculars and small to medium telescopes, along with a guide to imaging galaxies with CCD cameras. Galaxies in Turmoil is equally suitable for practical amateur astronomers, or as a text for college courses including galaxies, active galaxies, quasars, deep-space objects and large-scale astronomy, up to the final year of an astrophysics, physics or science degree. Research students - and even established research astronomers - will also find this book invaluable as a quick reference to the properties of, and phenomena within, those types of active galaxies that may be outside their specialisms
Introduction -- What is a galaxy?- Galaxies in general -- The difference between 'ordinary' and active galaxies -- The panoply of active galaxies: (Quasars, QSOs, Radio galaxies, BL Lacs, Blazars, LINERS, ULIRGS, Seyfert galaxies, Starburst galaxies, N galaxies, etc.) -- What they are and what they do? (The images of many active galaxies are beautiful and spectacular, and the inclusion of a significant number of colour photographs is essential to the book.) -- Active galaxies across the spectrum (Activities and behaviours at radio, infrared, ultra-violet, x-ray and gamma ray wavelengths) -- Explosions and jets -- Multiple jets and why there is sometimes only one jet -- Faster than light -- Superluminal motions and how they occur -- The central black holes -- Evidence for their existence -- Nature and properties of super-massive BHs -- Jets and accretion disks -- Energy sources -- How BHs produce the features of active galaxies?- How the BHs form?- Could the Milky Way become an Active galaxy?- What would happen to life on Earth?- What will happen when the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy collide in 3,000 million years?- Observing active galaxies using small telescopes -- Observing data (positions, magnitudes etc.) for the brighter active galaxies -- Bibliography / web site list
