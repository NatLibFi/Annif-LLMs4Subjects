Carbon management in the built environment
"Three broad sectors of the economy are generally recognised as key to a low carbon future: energy, construction and transportation. Of these, carbon management in the built environment remains the least well-studied.This much-needed book brings together the latest developments in the field of climate change science, building design,  materials science, energy and policy in a form readily accessible to both students of the built environment and practitioners. Although several books exist in the broad area of carbon management, this is the first to bring together carbon management technology, technique and policy as they apply to the building sector.Clear and succinct sections on the overarching principles, policies, approaches and technologies are combined with case studies and more in-depth coverage of the most relevant topics. It explains how to produce a simple carbon footprint calculation, while also being an informative guide for those developing or implementing more advanced approaches. This easy to read book is the ideal primer for anyone needing to get to grips with carbon management in the built environment"--
