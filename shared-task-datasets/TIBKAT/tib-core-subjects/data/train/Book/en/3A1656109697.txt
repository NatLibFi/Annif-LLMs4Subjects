Reaction rate constant computations : theories and applications
The reaction rate constant plays an essential role a wide range of processes in biology, chemistry and physics. Calculating the reaction rate constant provides considerable understanding to a reaction and this book presents the latest thinking in modern rate computational theory. The editors have more than 30 yearsãaÙ™ experience in researching the theoretical computation of chemical reaction rate constants by global dynamics and transition state theories and have brought together a global pool of expertise discussing these in a variety of contexts and across all phases. This thorough treatment
