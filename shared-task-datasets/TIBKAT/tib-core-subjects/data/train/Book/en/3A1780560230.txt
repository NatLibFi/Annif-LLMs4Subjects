Unified field theory and Occam's razor : simple solutions to deep questions
"Unified Field Theory was an expression first used by Einstein in his attempt to unify general relativity with electromagnetism. Unified Field Theory and Occam's Razor attempts to provide real answers to foundational questions related to this unification and should be of high interest to innovative scientists. A diverse group of contributing authors approach an old problem with an open-mindedness that presents a new and fresh perspective. The following topics are discussed in detail in the hope of a fruitful dialogue with all who are interested in this subject: The composition of electrons, photons, and neutrinos. The relationship of quantum mechanics to general relativity. The four-component Dirac spinor and the meaning of imaginary numbers in this complex-valued field. The Dirac equation as a proper field equation. The Pauli exclusion principle and quantum entanglement. High-temperature superconductivity. This highly original book brings together theoretical researchers and experimentalists specialized in the areas of mathematics and epistemology, theoretical and experimental physics, engineering, and technology. For years they have worked independently on topics related to the foundations and unity of physics and have had numerous overlapping ideas in terms of using Clifford Algebra and spinors. Within the book, new technology applications are outlined and theoretical results are complemented by interpretations of experimental data"--
