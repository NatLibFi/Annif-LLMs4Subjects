Instructor's manual to accompany understanding fiber optics
The Instructor's Manual is a companion to the fifth edition of Understanding Fiber Optics for both instructors teaching a class and learners studying on their own or in a class. It explains the organization of the book and a strategy for using it to learn about fiber optics. It also answers questions that were asked in the book. In addition to giving the answers for multiple-choice quizzes, it elaborates on "questions to think about" and gives worked-out answers for problems, displaying the calculations so learners can follow the process of getting an answer. This supplements the book's goals of helping readers understand fiber optics and their applications. [Publisher of the Instructor Manual: LaserLight Press, Auburndale, Massachusetts]
