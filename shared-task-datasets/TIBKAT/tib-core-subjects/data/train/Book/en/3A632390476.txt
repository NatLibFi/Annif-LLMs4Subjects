Formal Methods: State of the Art and New Directions
Through fundamental contributions from leading researchers, this volume describes the use of formal modeling methods in the areas of requirements, design and validation. The self-contained chapters provide readers with rich background information and a diverse breadth of specialist material.
The last decade has witnessed a modest but sustained increase in researching and applying formal methods. A number of well cited success stories are now available and provide strong evidence that formal methods can be effective and deployed in industrial-scale applications. Through fundamental contributions from leading researchers, this book provides further evidence of the use of formal methods in the areas of requirements, design, modelling and implementation, verification and validation. The self-contained chapters are views from experts in these areas, providing readers with rich background information and a diverse breadth of specialist material. This authoritative collection of views provides a snapshot of the field and will be of considerable interest to researchers and professionals seeking a perspective on fundamental underpinnings of formal methods and current hot topics in the field. The following website www.fmsand.info is associated with the book.
