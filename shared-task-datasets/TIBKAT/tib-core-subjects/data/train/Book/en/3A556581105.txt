MEMS/NEMS : Handbook Techniques and Applications
As miniaturization, batch fabrication, and integrated electronics rapidly enable the development of a broad range of smart products, MEMs, MOEMS, and NEMS are creating enormous opportunities for commerce and functionality. This significant and uniquely comprehensive five-volume reference is a valuable source for research workers, practitioners, computer scientists, students, and technologists. The &quot;MEMS/NEMS HANDBOOK (Microelectromechanical Systems/Nanoelectromechanical Systems)&quot; covers all of the major topics within the subject including design methods, fabrication techniques, manuf
