Engineering tolerance in crop plants against abiotic stress
"Despite significant progress in increasing agricultural production, meeting the changing dietary preferences and increasing food demands of future populations remain significant challenges. Salinity, drought, water logging, high temperature and toxicity are those abiotic stresses that affect the crop yield and production. Tolerance for stress is a difficult operation that the plant needs to undergo in order to survive. Identification of proper techniques at proper time can made it easy for the scientists to increase the crop productivity and yield. In this book, we have discussed the stresses, their impact on crops and portrayed distinctive abiotic stress tolerant in response to different techniques that can improve the performance of the crops."--
