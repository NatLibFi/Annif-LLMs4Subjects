"As the core infrastructure supporting expanding Cloud-based services, large-scale data centers' (DCs) architectures have garnered great attention from both academia and industry. In particular, Data Center Networks (DCNs), playing the key role in computing and communications within DC, need to be efficiently designed in order to satisfy service requirements. DCN represents the infrastructure interconnecting physical resources (i.e., servers, switches, etc.) within the same DC, using high speed communication links, according to a specific topology"--
