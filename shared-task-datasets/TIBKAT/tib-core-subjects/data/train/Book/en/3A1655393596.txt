A Course in Homological Algebra
This classic book provides a broad introduction to homological algebra, including a comprehensive set of exercises. Since publication of the first edition homological algebra has found a large number of applications in many different fields. Today, it is a truly indispensable tool in fields ranging from finite and infinite group theory to representation theory, number theory, algebraic topology and sheaf theory. In this new edition, the authors have selected a number of different topics and describe some of the main applications and results to illustrate the range and depths of these developments. The background assumes little more than knowledge of the algebraic theories groups and of vector spaces over a field
