1. Fuzzy Hypergraphs -- 2. Hypergraphs in Intuitionistic Fuzzy Environment -- 3. Hypergraphs in Interval-Valued Fuzzy Environment -- 4. Hypergraphs in Bipolar Fuzzy Environment -- 5. Hypergraphs in m-Polar Fuzzy Environment -- 6. Hypergraphs in q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy Environment -- 7. Granular Computing Based on q-Rung Picture Fuzzy Hypergraphs -- 8. Hypergraphs in Single-Valued Neutrosophic Environment -- 9. Hypergraphs in Bipolar Neutrosophic Environment.
This book presents the fundamental and technical concepts of fuzzy hypergraphs and explains their extensions and applications. It discusses applied generalized mathematical models of hypergraphs, including complex, intuitionistic, bipolar, m-polar fuzzy, Pythagorean, complex Pythagorean, and q-rung orthopair hypergraphs, as well as single-valued neutrosophic, complex neutrosophic and bipolar neutrosophic hypergraphs. In addition, the book also sheds light on real-world applications of these hypergraphs, making it a valuable resource for students and researchers in the field of mathematics, as well as computer and social scientists.
