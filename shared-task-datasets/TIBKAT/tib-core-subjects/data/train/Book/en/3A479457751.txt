Springer handbook of experimental fluid mechanics : with ... 123 tables
This Handbook consolidates authoritative and state-of-the-art information from the large number of disciplines used in Experimental Fluid Mechanics into a readable desk reference book. It comprises four parts: Experiments in Fluid Mechanics, Measurement of Primary Quantities, Specific Experimental Approaches, and Analyses and Post-Processing of Data. It has been prepared for physicists and engineers in research and development in laboratories in universities, in industry and in government research institutions or national laboratories. Both experimental methodology and techniques are covered fundamentally and also for a wide range of application fields. A generous use of citations directs the reader to additional material on each subject.
