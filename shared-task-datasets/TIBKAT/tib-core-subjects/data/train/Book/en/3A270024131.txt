Access to chemistry
"Chemistry or the understanding of basic chemical concepts forms a vital part of many of today's access and foundation-level science courses in higher education. With the increase in numbers of students pursuing these courses in recent years, the need to acknowledge differing academic backgrounds has never been greater. Many may be entering via a vocational route and may not have A-level chemistry or its equivalent, or they may be mature students who need to refresh their chemistry to pursue an honours undergraduate course. Alternatively, the subject may simply have been 'difficult' or uninteresting in the past. Whatever the case, Access to Chemistry aims to fill the gap." "Key features include diagnostic tests to assess proficiency, worked examples throughout, hints for successful study, and clear layout in colour."--BOOK JACKET
