Novel thermal and non-thermal technologies for fluid foods
Food processing is the step of the food chain that principally affects a food's physical or biochemical properties, along with determining the safety and shelf life of the product. This book provides a comprehensive overview of innovations in non-thermal technologies specifically for fluid foods, recognized for their high bioavailability of macronutrients and micronutrients. Considerable resources and expertise has been devoted to the processing of safe and wholesome foods. Non-thermal technologies have been developed as an alternative to thermal processing, while still meeting required safety or shelf-life demands and minimising the effects on its nutritional and quality attributes
