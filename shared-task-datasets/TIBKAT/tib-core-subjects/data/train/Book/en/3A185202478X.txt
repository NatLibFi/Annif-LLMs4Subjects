Prototype of a biomimetic multi-spiked connecting scaffold : for a new generation of resurfacing endoprostheses
"This monograph explains prototype of the biomimetic Multi-Spiked Connecting Scaffold (MSC-Scaffold) fixing in the periarticular bone and the components of a new generation of entirely non-cemented resurfacing arthroplasty (RA) endoprostheses. It presents the design, rapid prototyping, and manufacturing of the prototype biomimetic MSC-Scaffold including bioengineering CAD design and modelling, methods and effects of the electro-erosion machining of the needle palisade and so forth. Features: Presents the prototype of a new generation resurfacing endoprosthesis of the hip joint. Explains prototype endoprosthesis as the first worldwide biomimetic design. Insights into the entire process of bioengineering design and research on this prototype endoprosthesis. Proposes novel way of fixation of the endoprosthesis components. Reviews structural and osteoconductive functionalisation of the interspike space of the prototype MSC-Scaffold. This book is aimed at professionals and graduate students in biomedical engineering, endoprosthesis engineering and surgery, and biomaterials"--
