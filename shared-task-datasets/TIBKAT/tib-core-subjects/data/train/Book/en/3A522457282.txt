Thermodynamics, solubility and environmental issues : [book origns in committee meetings of the International Association of Chemical Thermodynamics and in discussions with members of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), subcommittee on Solubility]
Environmental problems are becoming an important aspect of our lives as industries grow apace with populations throughout the world. This title highlights some of the problems and shows how chemistry can help to reduce these. The unifying theme is solubility - the most basic and important of thermodynamic properties
