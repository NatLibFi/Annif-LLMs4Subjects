Barcode - Instant city
The long, narrow buildings of the Barcode Project grandly overlook a former dock and industrial area in central Oslo. Consisting of a row of new multi-purpose high-rise buildings - due to be completed in 2014 - it has been designed by leading Norwegian and internatinal architects. This book explores the Barcode principle, which through its segmented construction contributes to openness, light penetration, and transparency in an otherwise built-up area, and celebrates a building that, even before its completiion, has already become an international sensation
