High resolution site surveys
"High Resolution Site Surveys brings together the full range of seismic and hydrographic site survey techniques, to provide a unified approach to marine high resolution surveying for the first time since the 1970s." "Detailed descriptions are given of high resolution digital seismic survey methods with special reference to 'Bright Spot' analysis and the detection of shallow drilling hazards, particularly shallow gas. Hydrographic 'analogue' search and survey tools are evaluated. These include echosounders, sidescan sonars, swathe bathymetry, autonomous underwater vehicles, pingers, boomers and multi-electrode sparkers." "A chapter is devoted to non-seismic site survey techniques, coring, sea-bed sampling, current metering, gravity and Magnetometer surveys, and a discussion of remotely operated vehicles. Differential GPS positioning and its use across the entire range of marine seismic survey work is covered in a separate chapter. A final chapter deals with Health and Safety considerations for site surveys and indeed for all forms of seismic survey work." "Well-illustrated, with numerous practical examples showing the application of theory in everyday situations, High Resolution Site Surveys is an indispensable guide for the student and practitioner alike."--Jacket
