Fundamental mechanics of fluids
"Fully updated and expanded to reflect the staggering advances in modern mathematics, this fourth edition boasts 40 new homework problems (nearly 150 in total); new appendix material summarizing vectors, tensors, complex variables, and governing equations in common coordinate systems; and a new chapter on similarity solutions, group invariance solutions, separation of variables solutions, and some Fourier series representations. Illustrating basic equations and strategies to analyze fluid dynamics, mechanisms, and behavior, this new edition also contains reworked line drawings, revised problems, and extended end-of-chapter questions for clarification and expansion of key concepts"--
