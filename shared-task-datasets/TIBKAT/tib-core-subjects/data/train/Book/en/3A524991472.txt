Fire properties of polymer composite materials
This book is the first to deal with the important topic of the fire behaviour of fibre reinforced polymer composite materials. Composites are used in almost every conceivable application, although the high flammability and poor fire resistance of these materials remains a critical issue. The book covers all of the key issues on the behaviour of composites in a fire, including thermal degradation mechanisms, thermal softening, fire damage mechanics, and deterioration of mechanical properties. Also covered are fire protection materials for composites, fire properties of nanocomposites, fire safety regulations and standards, fire test methods, and health hazards from burning composites. This book will be of great interest to professionals in the composites industry, fire safety engineers, researchers in the fire properties of materials, and the users of composites in the aerospace, marine, civil infrastructure and automotive industries.
