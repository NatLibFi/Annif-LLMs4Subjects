Predictive simulation of semiconductor processing : status and challenges
Predictive simulation of semiconductor processingenables researchers and developersto extend the scaling range of semiconductor devices beyond the parameter range of empirical research. It requires a thorough understanding of the basic mechanisms employed in device fabrication, such as diffusion, ion implantation, epitaxy, defect formation and annealing, and contamination. This book presents an in-depth discussion of our current understanding of key processes and identifies areas that require further work in order to achieve the goal of a comprehensive, predictive process simulation tool.
