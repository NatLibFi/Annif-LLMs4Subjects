WebAssembly in action : with examples using C++ and Emscripten
Write high-performance browser-based applications without relying just on JavaScript!  By compiling to the WebAssembly binary format, your C, C++, or Rust code runs at near-native speed in the browser.  WebAssembly delivers greater speed, opportunities to reuse existing code, and access to newer and faster libraries.  Plus, you can easily interact with JavaScript when you need to.  "WebAssembly in action" teaches you how to write and run high-performance browser-based applications using C++ and other language supported by WebAssembly.  In it, you'll learn to create native WebAssembly modules, interact with JavaScript components, and maximize performance with web workers and pthreads.  And you'll love how the clearly organized sections make it a breeze to find the important details about every function, feature, and technique.--
