Technology of polymer packaging
Food, pharmaceutical, cosmetics, home-care materials, and many more essential products for modern life: all require appropriate packaging, and polymers very often provide the optimal solution. Based on the author's popular course on polymer packaging at the University of Applied Sciences, Stuttgart, Technology of Polymer Packaging provides an essential, user-friendly introduction to the field of polymer packaging suitable for students, people in industry, and particularly all those who deal with packaging but have a background other than that of a polymer technologist or packaging specialist.  Dr.-Ing. Arabinda Ghosh has been Professor of Polymer Packaging at the University of Applied Sciences, Stuttgart, since 1991. He previously undertook research at the Fraunhofer Institute for Food- and Packaging Technology, Munich, and was Manager for Packaging System Development, Dixie Union, Kempten.
