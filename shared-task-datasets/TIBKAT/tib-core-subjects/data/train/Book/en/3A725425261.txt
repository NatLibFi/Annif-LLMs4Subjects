Gauge theories in particle physics : a practical introduction / Ian J. R. Aitchison; Anthony J. G. Hey ; Vol. 1: From relativistic quantum mechanics to QED
"The first volume of this updated fourth edition includes self-contained presentations of electromagnetism as a gauge theory as well as relativistic quantum mechanics. It provides a unique elementary introduction to quantum field theory, establishing the essentials of the formal and conceptual framework upon which the subsequent development of the three gauge theories is based. The text also describes tree-level calculations of physical processes in QED and introduces ideas of renormalization in the context of one-loop radiative corrections for QED"--
