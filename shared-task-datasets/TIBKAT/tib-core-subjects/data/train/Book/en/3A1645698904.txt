Physics of Automatic Target Recognition
This book examines the roles of sensors, physics-based attributes, classification methods, and performance evaluation in automatic target recognition. It details target classification from small mine-like objects to large tactical vehicles. Also explored in the book are invariants of sensor and transmission transformations, which are crucial in the development of low latency and computationally manageable automatic target recognition systems.
