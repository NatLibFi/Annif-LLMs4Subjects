Comprehensive analytical chemistry ; volume 104: Metabolomics in health and disease biology
Metabolomics is the scientific study of biochemical process in a living system under health and disease conditions. It is a relatively new omics science having potential applications in medicine. The molecules present in biological system hold the secrets to our well-being, and the metabolomics explores the role of these molecules in various health and disease conditions. The topics presented and discussed in this book consisting of mysteries of metabolism under various health and disease biology conditions. This book serves as a guide for a wide range of audience from masters to postgraduate students, PhDs, postdoctoral and PI and more experienced researchers seeking to understand health and disease metabolism of complex biological systems from the systems biology approach. The book covers the basics and fundamentals of analytical technologies and their wider application to studies on health and disease metabolism ranging from circadian biology, neuro to metabolic disorders such as diabetes and hall mark of cancer--Preface
