Time frequency signal analysis and processing : a comprehensive reference
Time-frequency concepts -- Heuristic formulation of time-frequency distributions -- Theory of quadratic TFDs -- Time-frequency signal and system analysis -- Design of time-frequency distributions -- Implementation and realization of TFDs -- Measures, performance assessment and enhancement -- Multi-sensor and time-space processing -- Random processes and noise analysis -- Instantaneous frequency estimation and localization -- Time-frequency synthesis and filtering -- Detection, classification and estimation -- Time-frequency methods in communications -- Time-frequency methods in radar, sonar & acoustics -- Time-frequency diagnosis and monitoring -- Other applications
Time Frequency Signal Analysis and Processing covers fundamental concepts, principles and techniques, treatment of specialised and advanced topics, methods and applications, including results of recent research. This book deals with the modern methodologies, key techniques and concepts that form the core of new technologies used in IT, multimedia, telecommunications as well as most fields of engineering, science and technology. It focuses on advanced techniques and methods that allow a refined extraction and processing of information, allowing efficient and effective decision making that would not be possible with classical techniques. The Author, fellow of IEEE for Pioneering contributions to time-frequency analysis and signal processing education, is an expert in the field, having written over 300 papers on the subject over a period pf 25 years. This is a REAL book, not a mere collection of specialised papers, making it essential reading for researchers and practitioners in the field of signal processing. *The most comprehensive text and reference book published on the subject, all the most up to date research on this subject in one place *Key computer procedures and code are provided to assist the reader with practical implementations and applications *This book brings together the main knowledge of time-frequency signal analysis and processing, (TFSAP), from theory and applications, in a user-friendly reference suitable for both experts and beginners
