Gain an understanding of the inspection of large synchronous machines, generators, condensers, and motors! This text describes each component of the machine, operational functions, typical design features, and tell-tale signs that indicate each mode of failure. Compact with photos, graphs, commonly-used inspection forms, along with extensive references for each topic, INSPECTION OF LARGE SYNCHRONOUS MACHINES is an excellent tool for operators, inspectors, and student engineers.
