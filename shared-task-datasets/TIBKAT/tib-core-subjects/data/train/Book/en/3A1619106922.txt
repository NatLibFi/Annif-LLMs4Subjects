An atlas of recycled landscapes
The book examines remediated sites, reclaimed quarries, former landfills, terrains vagues, and unused spaces that have been recognized in the last twenty years as potential venues for the development of new social, economic, and environmental assets. It provides a 'map' of the state of the art internationally and describes what has been achieved to date, opening a window onto possible scenarios for the future.--
