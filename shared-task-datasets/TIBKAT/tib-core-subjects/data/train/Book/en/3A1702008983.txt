Brassica napus : cultivation and uses
Canola (Brassica napus L.): Cultivation and Uses / Mohammad R. Moradi-Telavat -- Haploidy in Rapeseed (Brassica napus L.): A Critical Review / Mehran E.

"This compilation begins by exploring canola (oilseed rape or rapeseed), the most important oilseed crop in temperate and cold regions and the second most important oilseed crop in the world after soybean. The authors review androgenesis (anther/microspore culture) and its efficiency in Brassica napus. One of the most reproducible approaches for doubled haploid production is isolated microspore culture in rapeseed. Brassica has a high capability of microspore embryogenesis, so it can be a good candidate for basic and advanced researches. Following this, the use of Brassica napus and microorganisms in the bioremediation of contaminated soils is reviewed, as well as the role of Brassica napus in heavy metal phytoremediation and its relation to contaminants"--
