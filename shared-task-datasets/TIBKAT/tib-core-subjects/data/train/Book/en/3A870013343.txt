Essentials of glycobiology
"Defined in the broadest sense, Glycobiology is the study of the structure, biosynthesis, biology, and evolution of saccharides (sugar chains or glycans) that are widely distributed in nature in all living life forms. Glycobiology is now one of the more rapidly growing fields in the natural sciences, with broad relevance to many areas of basic research, biomedicine, and biotechnology. The field includes the chemistry of carbohydrates, the enzymology of glycan formation and degradation, the recognition of glycans by specific proteins, roles of glycans in complex biological systems, and their analysis or manipulation by various techniques. The third edition of this primary textbook in the field continues in the prior tradition, seeking to provide basic overview of Glycobiology, directed towards the advanced undergraduate or the beginning graduate-level student of molecular and cellular biology and biomedicine.
