Herman Hertzberger
Herman Hertzberger is one of the most important and critically influential figures in international architecture of the last 50 years. He has consistently championed a fundamentally humanist modern architecture, rooted in its place and history, while simultaneously opening up new possibilities for dwelling. Today Hertzberger is rightly regarded as the world's foremost designer of schools, a building type he has almost singlehandedly redefined. His innovative and fundamentally humane workplaces constitute some of the most compelling contemporary reinterpretations of this type of building. In this monograph, author and architect Robert McCarter examines Hertzberger's most important architectural works through analysis of the design process and guiding ideas, particularly as these reflect Hertzberger's engagement with the Modernist tradition, architectural history, urban space and the way we experience it.
