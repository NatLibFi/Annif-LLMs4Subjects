Structural Analysis of Point Defects in Solids : An Introduction to Multiple Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
Strutural Analysis of Point Defects in Solids introduces the principles and techniques of modern electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy essentialfor applications to the determination of microscopic defect structures. Investigations of the microscopic and electronic structure, and also correlations with the magnetic propertiesof solids, require various multiple magnetic resonance methods, such as ENDOR and optically detected EPR or ENDOR. This book discusses experimental, technological and theoretical aspects of these techniques comprehensively, from a practical viewpoint, with many illustrative examples taken from semiconductors and other solids. The nonspecialist is informed about the potential of the different methods, while the researcher faced with the task of determining defect structures isprovided with the necessary tools, together with much information on computer-aided methods of data analysis and the principles of modern spectrometer design
