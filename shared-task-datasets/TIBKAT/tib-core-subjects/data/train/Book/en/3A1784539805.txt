Electromagnetic Compatibility : Principles and Applications
This textbook highlights principles and applications of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). After introducing the basic concepts, research progress, standardizations and limitations of EMC, the book puts emphasis on presenting the generation mechanisms and suppression principles of conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI) noise, radiated EMI noise, and electromagnetic susceptibility (EMS) problems such as static electricity, electric fast transient (EFT) and surge. With case studies and solved examples, the book provides effective solutions to actual engineering problems. Students and researchers will be able to use the book as practical reference for EMC-related measurements and problem-solving.
