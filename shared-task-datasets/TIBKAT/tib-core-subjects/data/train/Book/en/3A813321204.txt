Handbook of Mathematical Functions : with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables
Despite the increasing use of computers, the basic need for mathematical tables continues. Tables serve a vital role in preliminary surveys of problems before programming for machine operation, and they are indispensable to thousands of engineers and scientists without access to machines. Because of automatic computers, however, and because of recent scientific advances, a greater variety of functions and a higher accuracy of tabulation than have been available until now are required.In 1954, a conference on mathematical tables, sponsored by M.I.T. and the National Science Foundation, met to
