Survival analysis : proportional and non-proportional hazards regression
This book provides an extensive coverage of the methodology of survival analysis, ranging from introductory level material to deeper more advanced topics. The framework is that of proportional and non-proportional hazards models; a structure that is broad enough to enable the recovery of a large number of established results as well as to open the way to many new developments. The emphasis is on concepts and guiding principles, logical and graphical. Formal proofs of theorems, propositions and lemmas are gathered together at the end of each chapter separate from the main presentation. The intended audience includes academic statisticians, biostatisticians, epidemiologists and also researchers in these fields whose focus may be more on the applications than on the theory. The text could provide the basis for a two semester course on survival analysis and, with this goal in mind, each chapter includes a section with a range of exercises as a teaching aid for instructors. .
