Polymer nanocomposites based on silver nanoparticles : synthesis, characterization and applications
This book focuses on polymer/silver nanocomposites as the main component in bioengineering systems. It describes in detail the synthesis and characterization (morphological, thermal, mechanical & dynamic mechanical properties), as well as the different applications of these composites. A special chapter is dedicated to the toxicity aspects of silver nanoparticles.
