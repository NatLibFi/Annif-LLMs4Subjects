Organic photochemistry and photophysics
Featuring contributions from leading experts, Organic Photochemistry and Photophysics addresses organic photochemistry and photophysics applied to thioketones, metalloporphyrins, proton transfer reactions, azo compounds, electron transfer reactions, and DNA modification. This book is ideal as a supplementary text to graduate courses in photochemistry, photobiology, and photomedicine, and it serves the international photochemistry and photophysics community as a resource on photochemical reactions. With emphasis on current uses of light in both materials chemistry and medicinal chemistry, this book discusses topics that are useful for both researchers and newcomers in the field.
