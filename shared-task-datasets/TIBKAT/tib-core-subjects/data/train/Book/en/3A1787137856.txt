Outlook for building heating and cooling loads, and simulation tools -- Conventional building HVAC systems -- Geothermal energy resources -- Ground/soil types and thermo-physical properties -- Determination of ground/soil effective thermal conductivity -- Classifications of ground-source heat pump systems -- Geothermal heat pumps -- Refrigerant-to-air condensers -- Air-to-refrigerant evaporators -- Closed-loop (indirect, secondary fluid) ground-source heat pump systems -- Vertical closed-loop (indirect, secondary fluid) ground-source heat pump systems -- Heat transfer -- Horizontal closed-loop (indirect, secondary fluid) ground-source heat pumps systems -- Closed-loop direct expansion (mono-fluid) ground-source heat pump -- Closed-loop vertical thermo-syphon ground-source heat pump systems -- Open-loop groundwater heat pump systems -- Open-loop, dual and multiple-well groundwater heat pump systems -- Open-loop single-well (standing column) groundwater heat pump -- Surface water ground-source heat pumps systems -- Advantages and limitations of ground-source heat pump systems -- Future R&D requirements.
"This book focuses on fundamentals and design principles of vertical and horizontal indirect and direct expansion closed-loop, and ground- and surface water ground-source heat pump systems. It also details the thermodynamic aspects of mechanical and thermo-chemical compression cycles of geothermal heat pumps, as well as the energetic, economic and environmental aspects associated with the use of ground-source heat pump systems for heating and cooling residential and commercial/institutional buildings in moderate and cold climates"--
