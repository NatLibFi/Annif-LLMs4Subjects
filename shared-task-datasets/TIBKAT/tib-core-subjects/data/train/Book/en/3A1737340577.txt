Nachhaltiges bauen Privath√§user
This book presents a selection of eco-houses and sustainable homes built according to what is feasible today in terms of sustainable architecture that respects the environment. It shows us what ecological alternatives are available to standard building design and construction. Once considered architectural curiosities, these houses - built in a way that respects the environment - actually lay the foundations of tomorrow's regular construction and the building legacy that we bequeath to our children and grandchildren with which they feel at home and where enjoying a healthy and sustainable environment is the norm
