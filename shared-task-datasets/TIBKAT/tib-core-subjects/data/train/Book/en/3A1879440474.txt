Innovation networks in knowledge-based firms : developing ICT-based integrative competences
Innovation Networks in Knowledge-based Firms explores corporate strategic management in an information and communication technology (ICT) environment, and illustrates the significance of new business models based on 'boundary innovation' management through broadband networks as fixed and mobile wireless infrastructures. The author bridges theory and practice and provides international scope; he seeks to make transparent the mechanisms behind the processes that generate product and service innovation in ICT industries, such as search and advertising (Yahoo, Google), music distribution (Apple iPod) and gaming (Sony Playstation, Nintendo DS). He develops new business models based on 'boundary innovation' management and explains the innovation networks formed via three types of knowledge innovator - platform, process, and content. These knowledge innovators play an important role in merging different technologies (including ICT) and business models to develop new business value chains and new industries that span various industrial fields. Highlighting new theoretical and managerial insights and implications in the realm of ICT, this book will be invaluable to academics, students and practitioners with an interest in business, management, ICT and high-tech industries
