Frontiers in chemical sensors : novel principles and techniques
This third volume of Springer Series on Chemical Sensors and Biosensors aims to enable the researcher or technologist to become acquainted with the latest principles and techniques that keep on enlarging the applications in this fascinating field. It deals with the novel luminescence lifetime-based techniques for interrogation of sensor arrays in high-throughput screening, cataluminescence, chemical sensing with hollow waveguides, new ways in sensor design and fabrication by means of either combinatorial methods or engineered indicator/support couples. In addition, the volume focusses on frontiers in analytical biosensing, DNA optosensors and gold nanoparticle-based assays. Further chapters include pressure-sensitive luminescent paints, optical sensing of enantiomers and the use of digital colour analysis for ions and protein monitoring.
