Higher-order finite element methods
Higher-Order Finite Element Methods provides an exhaustive survey of intrinsic techniques and practical implementation of higher-order finite element schemes. It addresses automatic hp-adaptivity in one- and two-spatial dimensions, and includes up-to-date references to ongoing research related to automatic hp-adaptivity in 3D. The authors' discussion of suitable data structures and efficient linear solvers provides an excellent introduction to key, often neglected aspects of this class of methods. Avoiding heavy mathematical jargon where possible, the book is written in a clear and comprehensi
