Improving concrete and mortar using modified ash and slag cements
"One of the areas of resource saving and improving the environmental efficiency of construction is the use of concrete and mortar containing coal fly ash, blast furnace slag and other dispersed technogenic materials. The monograph presents the results of a study of high-tech concrete on composite Portland cement and slag Portland cement. The possibilities of significantly improving the properties of cements and concrete with the introduction of superplasticizers and hardening activators are shown. Experimental dependences that make it possible to predict the properties of concrete and mortars and to design mixtures with given properties are given. 1. The book for the first time shows the possibility of obtaining high-tech concrete with a high content of ash, slag and clinker kiln dust. 2. The possibility of a significant reduction in the content of the most energy-intensive component of cements - clinker and the possibility of activating low-clinker cements is shown 3. The calculated dependences for predicting the technical properties of concrete saturated with dispersed technogenic products are given. 4. The methods of calculating the composition of concrete with specified properties on low-clinker cements are presented. 5. Substantiates rational modifying and activating additives for cements and concretes with a high content of dispersed technogenic products"--
