Analysis of pavement structures
"Load and thermal stress analyses for both asphalt and concrete pavement structures are dealt in this book. Basic formulations for pavement analyses have been compiled and presented in a step-by-step manner - from a simple formulation to a more complex one, maintaining uniformity in symbol and sign conventions throughout the book. This book serves as a handy, quick reference on analysis of pavement structures for researchers, academicians, and practicing engineers"--
"Preface This book is about pavement analysis. A pavement is a multilayered structure, made of a number of layers placed one over the other. These layers can be made of asphaltic material, cement concrete, bound or unbound stone aggregates, etc. These materials show a complex mechanical response with the variation of stress, time, or temperature. Thus, understanding the performance of an in-service pavement structure subjected to vehicular loading and environmental variations is a difficult task. However, this is a simple book. This book presents a step-by-step formulation for analyses of load and thermal stresses of idealized pavement structures. Some of these idealizations involve assumptions of the material being linear, elastic, homogeneous and isotropic; the load being static; the thermal profile being linear and so on. Significant research has been done on analysis and design of pavements during the last half-a-century (some of the fundamental developments are however, more than hundred years old) and a large number of research publications are already available. However, there is a need for the basic formulations to be systematically compiled and put together in one place. Hence this book. It is believed that such a compilation will provide an exposure to the basic approaches used in pavement analyses and subsequently help the readers' formulate their own research or field problems more difficult than those dealt with in this book"--
