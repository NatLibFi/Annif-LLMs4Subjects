Described as THE classic text on magnetism, FERROMAGNETISM covers the basics of magnetics, as well as in-depth coverage of magnetic materials. IEEE Press has now brought this important cornerstone of magnetics research back into print. Recognized for its breadth of coverage, this book includes information on magnetic phenomenon and theories, magnetic materials, basic magnetization and domain theory, as well as many fundamental expressions, and useful technical data on many materials
