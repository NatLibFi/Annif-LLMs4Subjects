Quantitative Thin-Layer Chromatography : A Practical Survey
Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) is widely used particularly for pharmaceutical and food analysis. While there are a number of books on the qualitative identification of chemical substances by TLC, the unique focus here is on quantitative analysis. The authors describe all steps of the analytical procedure, beginning with the basics and equipment for quantitative TLC followed by sample pretreatment and sample application, development and staining, scanning, and finally statistical and chemometric data evaluation and validation. An important feature is the coverage of effect-directed biological detection methods. Chapters are organized in a modular fashion facilitating the easy location of information about individual procedural steps.
