The dynamics of regional development : the Philippines in East Asia
A decade and a half since the Philippines embarked on a major program of decentralization, the authors of this book have undertaken a detailed examination of all aspects of the nation's regional dynamics and policies. Their analysis extends to comparable experiences in East Asia, particularly China and Indonesia. The lessons of this book are relevant not only for an audience interested in the Philippines - a large developing nation with a population soon to exceed 100 million people - but also for many other developing countries now embarking on decentralization programs. The book therefore has broad international appeal. The contributors focus on three main issues: * Centre-region relations. While the decentralization program in the Philippines has been reasonably successful, they argue there is an urgent need for a clear, predictable, and stable regulatory environment that governs centre-region administrative and financial relations. * Infrastructure. This is arguably the most important policy tool in shaping regional development patterns, yet decision-makers are rarely able to develop these investments on the basis of a coherent and integrated policy framework. * The conflict in Mindanao. This deep and protracted conflict must be resolved for the benefit of the local and national population. This enlightening and topical book will appeal to postgraduate students of economic development, regional development/science, rural development, and Asian Studies. It will also attract the interest of researchers and practitioners in international development agencies, NGOs, and policymakers and legislators in developing countries
