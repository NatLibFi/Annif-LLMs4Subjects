Helmet-mounted displays : design issues for rotary-wing aircraft
The incorporation of new technology into aviation has had an enormous impact. Advances in microelectronics, stealth technology, engine design, and electronic sensors and displays have converted simple aircraft into formidable flying machines. In this book, recognized experts in aviation helmet-mounted displays summarize 25 years of knowledge and experience in HMD visual, acoustic, and biodynamic performance, and user issues such as sizing, fitting, and emergency egress
