Beginning Data Science in R : Data Analysis, Visualization, and Modelling for the Data Scientist
Discover best practices for data analysis and software development in R and start on the path to becoming a fully-fledged data scientist. This book teaches you techniques for both data manipulation and visualization and shows you the best way for developing new software packages for R. Data Science in R details how data science is a combination of statistics, computational science, and machine learning. Youâ€™ll see how to efficiently structure and mine data to extract useful patterns and build mathematical models. This requires computational methods and programming, and R is an ideal programming language for this. This book is based on a number of lecture notes for classes the author has taught on data science and statistical programming using the R programming language. Modern data analysis requires computational skills and usually a minimum of programming. You will: Perform data science and analytics using statistics and the R programming language Visualize and explore data, including working with large data sets found in big data Build an R package Test and check your code Practice version control Profile and optimize your code
