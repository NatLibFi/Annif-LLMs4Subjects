Cost, size, speed, weight, and precision are driving the miniaturization of mechanical systems. This book presents a detailed look at two micromachining technologies that have evolved from the integrated circuits industry: MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems) and MOEMS (micro systems with a strong optical component). It is useful as a professional reference, technology user's guide, and as a textbook
