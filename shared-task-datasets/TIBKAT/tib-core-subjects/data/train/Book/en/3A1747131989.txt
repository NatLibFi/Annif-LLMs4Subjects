Dynamical systems and nonlinear waves in plasmas
"This book provides clear ideas on dynamical systems and waves in plasmas. It also presents derivation of different nonlinear evolution equations describing nonlinear plasma waves (ion-acoustic, dust-acoustic, dust-ion-acoustic, electron-acoustic) through a perturbative approach. It demonstrates bifurcation behavior of nonlinear and supernonlinear waves characterized by trivial and nontrivial topologies of their phase portraits for the corresponding dynamical systems. Chaotic and hyperchaotic behaviors of various plasma waves are presented in presence or absence of external periodic force. It also provides real applications to NLSE and laser plasma interaction"--
