Fourier analysis on finite groups with applications in signal processing and system design
Discover applications of Fourier analysis on finite non-Abelian groups The majority of publications in spectral techniques consider Fourier transform on Abelian groups. However, non-Abelian groups provide notable advantages in efficient implementations of spectral methods. Fourier Analysis on Finite Groups with Applications in Signal Processing and System Design examines aspects of Fourier analysis on finite non-Abelian groups and discusses different methods used to determine compact representations for discrete functions providing for their efficient realizations and related applications.
