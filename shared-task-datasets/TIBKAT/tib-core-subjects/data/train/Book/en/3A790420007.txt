Designing Waveform-Processing Circuits (Analog Circuit Design Series : Volume 4)
Solid-state electronics has been a familiar technology for almost half a century, yet some circuit ideas, like the transresistance method of finding amplifier gain or identifying resonances above an amplifier's bandwidth that cause spurious oscillations, are so simple and intuitively appealing that it is a wonder they are not better understood in the industry. I was blessed to have encountered them in my earlier days at Tektronix but have not found them in engineering textbooks. My motivation in writing this book, which began in the late 1980s and saw its first publication in the form of a single volume published by Academic Press in 1990, has been to reduce the concepts of analog electronics as I know them to their simplest, most obvious form, which can be easily remembered and applied, even quantitatively, with minimal effort
