Artificial intelligence-aided materials design : AI-algorithms and case studies on alloys and metallurgical processes
"This book describes the application of artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) concepts to develop predictive models that can be used to design alloy materials. Readers new to AI/ML algorithms can use the book as a starting point and use the included MATLAB and Python implementation of AI/ML algorithms through included case studies. Experienced AI/ML researchers who want to try new algorithms can use this book and study the case studies for reference. This book is written for materials scientists and metallurgists interested in the application of AI, ML, and data science in the development of new materials"--
