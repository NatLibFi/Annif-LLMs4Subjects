Essentials of mechanical stress analysis
"Adequate for engineering analysis in practice, this text fills a gap. It illustrates mechanics concepts with practical examples applicable to industry. It presents general problem solving techniques in advanced stress analysis. It also contains topics in composite material stress analysis, plate analysis and finite element analysis. The book stands out from the other similar books in the field due to the fact these important topics of stress analysis, which normally are presented as individual books, are collected together in this book comprehensively.
