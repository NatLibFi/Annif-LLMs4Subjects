Novel polymeric materials for environmental applications
"Polymeric materials play an essential and ubiquitous role in many fields including structural and packaging materials, drug development, tissue engineering, wastewater treatment, pollutant removal, separation, water purification, smart agriculture, and even road and building construction. This book contains eleven comprehensive chapters covering topics from deriving polymers from natural resources or wastes to developing novel functional polymeric materials in the form of membranes, hydrogels, foams, nanocomposites for various environmental applications. This book also discusses the utilization of waste plastics and the challenges and progress made in recycling and reusing commercially viable polymers. Such information is valuable and accelerates technological progress. Each chapter further gives the current fabrication methodology, challenges, and future scope of these materials related to their environmental applications. Thus anyone working on polymer-based materials will benefit from the comprehensive knowledge presented in this book on novel polymeric materials and their various environmental applications"--
