Transplantation dermatology : 16 tables
Patients undergoing solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation frequently develop skin diseases that can be challenging to themselves and their doctors. In the first part of this volume, prevalent epidemiological, clinical and histological skin problems of solid organ recipients are discussed. Pre- and posttransplant management as well as follow-up programs are presented focusing on European and Swiss guidelines. A special chapter is dedicated to immunosuppressive drugs considering current standards, and new and upcoming medication. The second part starts with a summary of historical aspects of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and proceeds with a description of skin manifestations of graft-versus-host disease and their therapy. Covered are early, late and very late periods after transplantation with a focus on recent consensus classification and treatment aspects of chronic graft-versus-host disease. The publication ends with a comprehensive review and practical guidance on photoprotection in transplant recipients. This book covers all the important dermatological aspects that should be considered in diagnosis and treatment of recipients of solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplants. It is intended as a guide for dermatologists, nephrologists, hemato-oncologists and all specialists involved in the field of transplantation.
