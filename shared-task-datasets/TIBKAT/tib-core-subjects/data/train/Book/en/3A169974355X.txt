Drinking water : quality control, distribution systems and treatment
"Drinking Water: Quality Control, Distribution Systems and Treatment focuses on some of the technologies involved in water treatment processes, such as adsorption, co-precipitation, flocculation, and coagulation. The authors emphasize the newest easy processes, inadequacies, and prospects of drinking water treatment. In one study, a simple effective intervention for biochanin A in influent water using ZSM-5, a nano-porous crystalline zeolite, is described. In closing, a Sphingomonas paucimobilis strain isolated from an Indian drinking water system was evaluated for its ability to co-aggregate and form mixed biofilms with Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, and Escherichia coli O57:H7"--
