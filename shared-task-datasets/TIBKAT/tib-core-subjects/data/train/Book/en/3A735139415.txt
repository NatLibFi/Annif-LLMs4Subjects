Given ongoing concerns about global climate change and its impacts on cities, the need for sustainable planning has never been greater. This book explores concrete ways to achieve urban sustainability based on integrated planning, policy development, and decision-making. Urban Sustainability is the first book to provide an applied interdisciplinary perspective on the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead in this area. Bringing together researchers and practitioners to explore leading innovations on the ground, this volume combines the theoretical underpinnings of urban sustainability with current practices through highly readable narrative case studies. The contributors also provide fresh perspectives on how issues related to sustainable urban planning and development can be reconciled through collaborative partnerships and engagement processes
