The future of climate, science, and technology is not what it used to be. This book is an investigation of computational and data practices in climate impact research. Drawing on ethnographic and digital methodologies, it explores how simulation modelers calculate future climate risks in computer models, and how they make their scientific knowledge accessible to others. Addressing issues such as the rise of digital, distributed infrastructures, and public expectations for open science, Simon David Hirsbrunner unravels contemporary transformations that reshuffle temporalities and agencies within techno-scientific practice
