Molecular Catalysis of Rare-Earth Elements
There is an increasing need to find cost-effective and environmentally sound methods of converting natural resources into fuels, chemicals and energy; catalysts are pivotal to such processes. Catalysis highlights major developments in this area. Coverage of this Specialist Periodical Report includes all major areas of heterogeneous catalysis. In each volume, specific areas of current interest are reviewed. Examples of topics include experimental methods, acid/base catalysis, materials synthesis, environmental catalysis, and syngas conversion
