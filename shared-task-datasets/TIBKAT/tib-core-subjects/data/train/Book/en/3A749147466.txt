Atoms in Plasmas
Atoms in Plasmas is concerned with radiative-collisional phenomena in neutral and ionized gases. Central to the studies is a "perturbed atom" that is an atom under the influence of different perturbations in plasmas, namely by electrical and magnetic fields, fields of plasma oscillations, laser and Planck-radiation fields, collisions with excited particles, stochastic accelerations, etc. The treatment covers fundamental aspects of modern physics, such as atomic quantum mechanics and quantum optics, radiation and collisional processes in plasmas and gases, nonlinear laser spectroscopy, plasma diagnostics, etc
