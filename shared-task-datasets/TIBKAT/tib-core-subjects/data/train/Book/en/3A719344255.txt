Electrical design of overhead power transmission lines
"A complete guide to the design of overhead power transmission lines  Electrical Design of Overhead Power Transmission Lines outlines, in detail, all of the areas of knowledge that electrical and transmission-line engineers and designers need to effectively design and layout transmission lines. The book covers everything from matrix methods and symmetrical components to transient thermal rating. Real-world case studies and worked examples from IEEE standards are included in this practical guide. In-depth coverage: Matrix Methods in Network Analysis; Symmetrical Components; Transmission-line Parameters; Power in AC Transmission Lines; Electrical Modeling; Analysis of Power-Flow through Transmission Networks; Voltage and Power Control; Symmetrical Faults; Unsymmetrical Faults; Stability; AC-Corona Effects; Lightning Performance of Transmission Lines; Transmission Line Insulation and Coordination; Ampacity of Overhead Line Conductors"--
