Measuring shape
"Clear, accessible, and well-organized, this book provides a one-stop resource on the various techniques of 2- and 3D shape description and measurement. It presents consistent and coherent summaries of the various methods so that engineers, researchers, and others can compare methods, select the one appropriate for their specific task, and gain enough detailed information about them to implement and test them. It includes practical application such as relating fractal dimension of nuclear membranes in cells to disease, or relating harmonic analysis to weathering of sediments, or classifying the genetics of squash seeds by dimensionless ratios"--
