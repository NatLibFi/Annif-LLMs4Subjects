Quantum Ising Phases and Transitions in Transverse Ising Models
Investigations into the zero-temperature phases in various frustrated and random Ising models in a transverse or tunnelling field have caught attention very recently in the context of quantum magnetisation of glasses and other frustrated systems. This book gives a detailed discussion of the various theoretical techniques developed for the study of transverse Ising models and of the results of these studies with regular and random frustration, dilution, randomness, etc. Recent developments in the studies on their (quantum) relaxational dynamics, such as in quantum hysteresis, are also treated. The detailed presentation of original results and the reviews given here are expected to inspire further research in the exciting field of quantum many-body systems with randomness and frustration
