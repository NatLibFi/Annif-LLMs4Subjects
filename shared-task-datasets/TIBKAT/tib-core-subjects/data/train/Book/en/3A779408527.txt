Colour histories : science, art, and technology in the 17th and 18th centuries
Knowledge about colour – it's properties, methods of fabrication, meanings, and uses – has always been the purview of a wide range of individuals, from painters and architects to dyers, printers, pigment manufacturers, chemists. This volume discusses how different communities interacted with respect to knowledge and practices surrounding colour, thus contributing to a better understanding of an important current in cultural history.
