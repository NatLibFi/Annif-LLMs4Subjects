Ginzburg-Landau theory of condensates : thermodynamics, dynamics and formation of topological matter
"Ginzburg-Landau Theory is an important tool in condensed matter physics research, describing the ordered phases of condensed matter including the dynamics, elasticity and thermodynamics of the condensed configurations. In this systematic introduction to Ginzberg-Landau Theory, both common and topological excitations are considered on the same footing (including their thermodynamics and dynamical phenomena). The role of the topological versus energetic considerations is made clear. Required mathematics (symmetry, including lattice translation, topology and perturbative techniques are introduced as needed. The results are illustrated using arguably most fascinating class of such systems, high Tc superconductors subject to magnetic field. This book is an important reference for both researchers and graduate students working in condensed matter physics or can act as a textbook for those taking advanced courses on these topics"--
