Tensegrity systems
"Tensegrity Systems discusses analytical tools to design energy efficient and lightweight structures employing the concept of "tensegrity." This word is Buckminister Fuller's contraction of the words "Tensile" and "Integrity," which suggests that integrity or, as we would say, stability of the structure comes from tension. In a tensegrity structure the rigid bodies (the bars), might not have any contact, thus providing extraordinary freedom to control shape, by controlling only tendons. Tensegrity Systems covers both static and dynamic analysis of special tensegrity structural concepts, which are motivated by biological material architecture."--BOOK JACKET
