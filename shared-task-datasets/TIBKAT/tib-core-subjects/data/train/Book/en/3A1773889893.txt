The study of the chemistry of metal alkoxides, which began more than 100 years ago, is now experiencing a renaissance connected with the broad application of these compounds as molecular precursors in the synthesis of materials of modern technology based on simple and complex oxides. The solution of this problem is occupying a wide circle of inorganic chemists, technologists specializing in fine synthesis in nonaqueous media, and those working on the production of films and coatings. The application of metal alkoxides in the first step of sol-gel technology (based on hydrolysis of alk- ides with subsequent dehydration of the hydrated oxides formed) can benefit from this monograph covering the modern literature devoted to all the steps of this process. The information on chemistry of metal alkoxides has been reported in a number of reviews (devoted to the single groups of derivatives) and numerous original publications. The only other monograph — Metal Alkoxides by D. C. Bradley, R. C. Mehrotra and D. P. Gaur was published in 1978 (A- demic Press, London) and, unfortunately, does not reflect modern findings.
