Radio frequency integrated circuit design
This newly revised and expanded edition of the 2003 Artech House classic, Radio Frequency Integrated Circuit Design, serves as an up-to-date, practical reference for complete RFIC know-how. The second edition includes numerous updates, including greater coverage of CMOS PA design, RFIC design with on-chip components, and more worked examples with simulation results. By emphasizing working designs, this book practically transports you into the authors' own RFIC lab so you can fully understand the function of each design detailed in this book. Among the RFIC designs examined are RF integrated LC-based filters, VCO automatic amplitude control loops, and fully integrated transformer-based circuits, as well as image reject mixers and power amplifiers. If you are new to RFIC design, you can benefit from the introduction to basic theory so you can quickly come up to speed on how RFICs perform and work together in a communications device. A thorough examination of RFIC technology guides you in knowing when RFICs are the right choice for designing a communication device. This leading-edge resource is packed with over 1,000 equations and more than 435 illustrations that support key topics
