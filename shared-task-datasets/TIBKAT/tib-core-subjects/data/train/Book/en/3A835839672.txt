"Modeling is now an accepted part in the understanding, prediction and planning of environmental strategies. Perfect for undergraduate students and non-specialist readers, Modeling Coastal and Marine Processes (2nd Edition) offers an introduction into how coastal and marine models are constructed and used. The mathematics, statistics and numerical techniques used are explained in the first few chapters, making this book accessible to those without a high-level maths background. Later chapters cover modeling sea bed friction, tides, shallow sea dynamics, and ecosystem dynamics. Importantly, there is also a chapter on modeling the impact of climate change on coastal and near shore processes. New to this revised edition is a chapter on tides, tsunamis and the prediction of sea level, and additional material on the new application of the numerical techniques: flux corrected transport, finite volumes and adaptive grids to coastal and marine modeling"--Provided by publisher
