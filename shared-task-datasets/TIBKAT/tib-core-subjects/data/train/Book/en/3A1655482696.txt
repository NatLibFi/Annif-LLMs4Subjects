Variational Methods in Partially Ordered Spaces
Examples -- Functional Analysis over Cones -- Optimization in Partially Ordered Spaces -- Applications.
In mathematical modeling of processes one often encounters optimization problems involving more than one objective function, so that Multiobjective Optimization (or Vector Optimization) has received new impetus. The growing interest in multiobjective problems, both from the theoretical point of view and as it concerns applications to real problems, asks for a general scheme which embraces several existing developments and stimulates new ones. In this book the authors provide the newest results and applications of this quickly growing field. This book will be of interest to graduate students in mathematics, economics, and engineering, as well as researchers in pure and applied mathematics, economics, engineering, geography, and town planning. A sound knowledge of linear algebra and introductory real analysis should provide readers with sufficient background for this book.
