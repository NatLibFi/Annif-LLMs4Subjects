Large Eddy Simulation for Incompressible Flows : An Introduction
The book is unique in that it is the only one of its kind devoted entirely to the subject of (large-eddy simulation). It presents a comprehensive account of the available knowledge in this field, and also the first unified view of the various existing approaches. Large-eddy simulation is the only efficient technique for approaching high Reynolds numbers when simulating industrial, natural or experimental configurations. The author concentrates on incompressible fluids. The book gives a complete account of this young but very rich discipline. The topics are well chosen and both the mathematical ideas and the applicatons are presented with care. The book addresses researchers as well as graduate students and engineers
