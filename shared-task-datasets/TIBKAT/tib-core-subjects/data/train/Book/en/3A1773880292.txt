CMOS Current Amplifiers : Speed versus Nonlinearity
CMOS Current Amplifiers: Speed versus Nonlinearity is intended as a current-amplifier cookbook containing an extensive review of different current amplifier topologies realisable with modern CMOS integration technologies. The seldom-discussed issue of high-frequency distortion performance is derived for all reviewed amplifier topologies using as simple and intuitive mathematical methods as possible. The topologies discussed are also useful as building blocks for high-performance voltage-mode amplifiers. So the reader can apply the discussed techniques to both voltage- and current-mode analogue integrated circuit design. This book contains application examples with experimental results in three different fields: instrumentation amplifiers, continuous-time analogue filters and logarithmic amplifiers.
