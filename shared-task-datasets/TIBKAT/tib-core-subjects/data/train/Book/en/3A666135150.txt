Flavor, fragrance, and odor analysis
"Emphasizing SBSE techniques alongside advances in mass spectrometry, sample preparation, gas chromatography (GC)-olfactometry, and electronic-nose technology, this new edition discusses the significant advantage of these methods for flavor and odor studies in the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. Written from a practical, problem-solving perspective, it discusses the chemical structures of key flavor and fragrance compounds, contains numerous examples and chromatograms, and emphasizes novel solid-phase micro extraction procedures. It also presents important updates on GC-olfactometry as a tool for studying flavor synergy effects"--
"Sample preparation techniques for isolating and concentrating flavor and odor-active chemicals from foods prior to GC-MS analysis continue to evolve, providing lower detection limits while being more amenable to instrumental automation. Solventless extraction techniques like solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) have wide application appeal and are now significant problem-solving tools for flavor and odor chemists. While the first edition of Flavor, Fragrance and Odor Analysis emphasized SPME, a newer technique at the time, this edition focuses on the advantages of SBSE, including sequential SBSE and other sample manipulation techniques that increase the sensitivity and application potential of this surprisingly simple but amazingly powerful technique"--
