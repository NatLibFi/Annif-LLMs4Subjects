Functional metallosupramolecular materials
There is great interest in metallosupramolecular materials because of their use in magnetic, photonic and electronic materials. Functional Metallosupramolecular Materials focuses on the applications of these materials covering the chemistry underlying the synthesis of a variety of ligands to coordinate various metal ions and the generation of 2D and 3D materials based on these constructs.The book starts by looking at different metallosupramolecular systems including naturally occurring functional metallosupramolecular materials; DNA-based metallosupramolecular materials; metallopolymers; metallogels as well as functional materials based on MOFs. Subsequent chapters then systematically cover the different applications such as molecular computation, spin-crossover, light harvesting and as photocatalysts for the production of solar fuels.The book provides an overview of functional metallosupramolecular materials that will be of interest to graduate students, academics and industrial chemists interested in supramolecular chemistry, materials science and the materials applications
