Intelligent techniques for cyber-physical systems
"This book covers challenges, opportunities, and open research directions for cyber-physical systems (CPS). It focuses on the design and development of machine learning and metaheuristics-enabled methods as well as blockchain for various challenges like security, resource management, computation offloading, trust management, and others in edge, fog, and cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Everything (IoE) and smart cities. It also includes the design and analysis of deep learning-based models, sensing technologies, metaheuristics, and blockchain for complex real-life systems for CPS. The book is aimed at researchers and graduate students in computer science and engineering and electrical and electronics engineering"--
