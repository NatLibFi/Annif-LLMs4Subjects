Chapter 1: Internet of Things: A Primer -- Chapter 2: Performing an IoT Pentest -- Chapter 3: Analyzing Hardware -- Chapter 4: UART Communication -- Chapter 5: Exploitation Using I2C and SPI -- Chapter 6: JTAG Debugging and Exploitation -- Chapter 7: Firware Reverse Engineering and Exploitation -- Chapter 8: Exploiting Mobile, Web and Network for IoT -- Chapter 9: Software Defined Radio -- Chapter 10: Exploiting ZigBee and BLE
Take a practioner’s approach in analyzing the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the security issues facing an IoT architecture. You’ll review the architecture's central components, from hardware communication interfaces, such as UARTand SPI, to radio protocols, such as BLE or ZigBee. You'll also learn to assess a device physically by opening it, looking at the PCB, and identifying the chipsets and interfaces. You'll then use that information to gain entry to the device or to perform other actions, such as dumping encryption keys and firmware. As the IoT rises to one of the most popular tech trends, manufactures need to take necessary steps to secure devices and protect them from attackers. The IoT Hacker's Handbook breaks down the Internet of Things, exploits it, and reveals how these devices can be built securely
