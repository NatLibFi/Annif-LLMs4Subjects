Strategies to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Road Transport : Analytical Methods
Road transport accounts for approximately 80% of CO2 emissions emanating from transport, which corresponds to more than 20% of total emissions. This clearly has enormous implications for global climate change. What are the measures and strategies already taken by OECD countries to reduce or stabilise greenhouse gases from road transport? What frameworks exist to evaluate the impact and efficiency of these measures and strategies? And how effective are they?. With the continued growth forecast in car ownership and distance travelled, what are the expected trends in CO2 emissions and their conse
