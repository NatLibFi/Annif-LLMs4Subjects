In Designs for Living, Roger H. Seifter, Randy M. Correll, Grant F. Marani, and Gary L. Brewer, who lead the residential practice at Robert A.M. Stern Architects, present fifteen houses the firm has completed over the past ten years. From contemporary interpretations of the shingle style to robust Mediterranean designs, the houses are stylistically diverse reflecting RAMSA's deep knowledge of history and precedent. Each partner provides insight into the design process and his individual approach to working with clients. Houses are located in dramatic settings from Napa and Sonoma to the spectacular coastline of the Hamptons and New England. Whether overlooking the ocean or nestled into the mountainside, these remarkable houses reveal the architects' emphasis on the importance of context and their dedication to exploring the nature of place and environment. Each house invokes the vernacular architectural heritage particular to its region while gracefully reflecting its natural surroundings. Connecting contemporary lifestyles to traditional American aesthetics, these residences are exceptional both for their timelessness and their ability to evoke a conversation with the past--a dialogue the RAMSA partners believe lies at the heart of architecture--
