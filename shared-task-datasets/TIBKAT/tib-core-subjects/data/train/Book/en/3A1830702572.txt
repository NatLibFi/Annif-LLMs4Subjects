The worlds of Villard de Honnecourt : the portfolio, medieval technology, and gothic monuments
"This book charts the past, present, and future of studies on medieval technology, art, and craft practices. Inspired by Villard's enigmatic portfolio of artistic and engineering drawings, this collection explores the multiple facets of medieval building represented in this manuscript (Paris, Biblioth√®que nationale de France, MS Fr 19093).
