Machine vision has come of age as an established, respected field of research and application with a strong theoretical foundation. The term 'machine vision' has various definitions, depending on one's field, such as computer vision, image understanding, scene analysis, or robotics. In this Tutorial Text, machine vision specifically refers to the study and implementation of systems that allow machines to recognize objects from acquired image data and perform useful tasks from that recognition. This book is intended to help readers understand and construct machine vision systems that perform useful tasks, based on the current state of the art. It covers fundamentals drawn from image processing and computer graphics to the methods of applied machine vision techniques. The text is useful as a short course supplement, as a self-study guide, or as a primary or supplementary text in an advanced undergraduate or graduate course
