Signaling Pathways in Liver Diseases
Recent advances have carried hepatology to new frontiers. The increasing frequency with which steatotic and cirrhotic livers undergo surgery obliges liver surgeons and hepatologists to understand the molecular mechanisms at play in these situations. Comprehension of the signaling pathways participating in liver regeneration, hepatocellular apoptosis and ischemia/reperfusion injury is essential. This book serves as a source of information to facilitate the reading of the literature and the planning of trials. Translational medicine implies knowledge of the molecular targets of novel therapeutic strategies. It is our goal to stimulate more research that can lead to more exchanges between the laboratory, the clinical ward and the operating room.
