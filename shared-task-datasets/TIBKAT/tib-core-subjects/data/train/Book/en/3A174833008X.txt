Integrated microwave front-ends with avionics applications
This highly practical resource offers you an in-depth understanding of microwave front end integration and how it is applied in the avionics field. You find detailed guidance on circuit integration, including coverage of component miniaturization, hybrid and monolithic integrated circuits, and 3D design. The book addresses system integration with discussions on the combination of different avionic systems, single antenna design, top/bottom front end combination, and integration of passive and active antenna modules. This first-of-its-kind volume features unique material on novel structures of avionics front end, novel transmission lines, elements, and devices, as well as new strategies for microwave front-end design. Supported with nearly 200 illustrations and more than 160 equations, this book is a valuable professional reference and also serves well as a postgraduate textbook
