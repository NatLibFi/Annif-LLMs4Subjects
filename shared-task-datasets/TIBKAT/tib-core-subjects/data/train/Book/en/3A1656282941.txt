This book is concerned with the Riemann Zeta Function, its generalizations, and various applications to several scientific disciplines, including Analytic Number Theory, Harmonic Analysis, Complex Analysis and Probability Theory. Eminent experts in the field illustrate both old and new results towards the solution of long-standing problems and include key historical remarks. Offering a unified, self-contained treatment of broad and deep areas of research, this book will be an excellent tool for researchers and graduate students working in Mathematics, Mathematical Physics, Engineering and Cryptography
