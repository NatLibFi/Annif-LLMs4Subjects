Flash in the Pan
In this collection of mediations on what Baudelaire championed (and Michael Fried chastised) as presentness, Lavin investigates the convergence of notions such as liveness, the provisional and the obsolete in revealing qualities of the contemporary. Three sets of essays explore different forms of architectural time, particularly as they shape the differences between history, theory and criticism as genres of writing
Temporary: The temporary contemporary; Plasticity at work; What good is a bad object?; What colour is now?: Vanishing point
Occasional: Kissing architecture -- Super-disciplinarity and confounding mediums; The raw and the cooked; Keeping up with the architects; Architecture beside itself; ArchitectureIn Extremis
Contemporary: Pop goes the black box; Andy Architect, or a funny thing happened ont eh way to the disco; Poof; Supercharged; The turn-on
