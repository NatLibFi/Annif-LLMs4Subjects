UAV communications for 5G and beyond
"To advantageously plan and design for the explosive near-future increase in the number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their demanding applications, integration of UAVs into cellular communication systems has seen increasing interest. This book provides a timely and comprehensive overview of the recent research efforts and results of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-integrated cellular network communications. The aim of the book is to provide a comprehensive coverage of the potential applications, networking architectures, latest research findings and key enabling technologies, experimental measurement results, as well as up-to-date industry standardizations for UAV communications in cellular systems, including the existing LTE as well as the future 5G-and-beyond systems"--
