Linear algebraic monoids
Linear Algebraic Monoids presents an up-to-date account of the theory of linear algebraic monoids. The theory culminates in a coherent blend of algebraic groups, convex geometry, and semigroup theory. All of the key topics are discussed in detail, including classification, orbit structure, representations, universal constructions, and abstract analogues. An explicit cell decomposition is constructed for the wonderful compactification. A universal deformation is constructed for any semisimple group. This book will serve as a solid basis for further research. Open problems are discussed as they arise. Many useful excercises are included. A final chapter summarizes important connections with other areas of algebra and geometry
