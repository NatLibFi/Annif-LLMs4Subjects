Legumes in the Omic Era
"Legumes in the Omic Era provides a timely review of recent advances in legume genomics research and application. In this post-genomic era, enormous amounts of biological information is available that could be of huge potential use for crop improvement applications. This aspect of genomics assisted plant breeding is focused throughout the book for all the important grain legume crops. The role of functional genomics and the importance of bioinformatics tools in present day genomics and molecular breeding research is also discussed in detail. Use of molecular tools for nutritional fortification of grain legume is briefly presented. A chapter has also been contributed on fungal disease resistance to elucidate potential application of genomic tools in molecular breeding of grain legume species. The book contains fifteen chapters contributed by 50 scientists from different countries who are actively involved in analyzing and improving particular legume genomes. This book serves as a reference resource to legumes researchers for the use of genome information toward the improvement of major legume crops."--Back cover
