Advances in Time Series Methods and Applications : The A. Ian McLeod Festschrift
This volume reviews and summarizes some of A. I. McLeod's significant contributions to time series analysis. It also contains original contributions to the field and to related areas by participants of the festschrift held in June 2014 and friends of Dr. McLeod. Covering a diverse range of state-of-the-art topics, this volume well balances applied and theoretical research across fourteen contributions by experts in the field. It will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in time series, econometricians, and graduate students in time series or econometrics, as well as environmental statisticians, data scientists, statisticians interested in graphical models, and researchers in quantitative risk management.
