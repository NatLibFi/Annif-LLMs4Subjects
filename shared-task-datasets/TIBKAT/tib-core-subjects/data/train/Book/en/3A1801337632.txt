Thin film coatings : properties, deposition, and applications
"This book discusses the holistic subject of conventional and emerging thin film technologies without bias to a specific technology based on the existing literature. It covers properties and various methods of thin film deposition, including the most recent techniques and a direction for future developments. It also discusses cutting-edge applications of thin film coatings such self-healing and smart coatings, biomedical, hybrid, and scalable thin films. Finally, the concept of industry 4.0 in thin film coating technology is examined. This comprehensive reference will appeal to a wide audience of materials scientists and others studying and developing advanced thin film technologies"--
