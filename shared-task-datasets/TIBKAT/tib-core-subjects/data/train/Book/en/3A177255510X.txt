Medical applications of laser molecular imaging and machine learning
This book focuses on machine-learning medical applications based on molecular spectroscopy and molecular imaging data. Written with specialists in biomedical optics, laser spectroscopy, bioengineering, and medical engineering in mind, the chapters cover topics such as biomarker conception, molecular laser imaging, and artificial intelligence; laser-based molecular-data-acquisition technologies; feature selection and extraction methods; unsupervised and supervised approaches; and in vivo non-invasive diagnostics using laser molecular spectroscopy and imaging combined with machine learning. Sample datasets and Python modules are provided as supplemental materials for the most useful algorithms.
