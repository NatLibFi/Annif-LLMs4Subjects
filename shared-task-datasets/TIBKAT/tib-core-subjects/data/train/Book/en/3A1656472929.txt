Organ printing
This book introduces various 3D printing systems, biomaterials, and cells for organ printing. In view of the latest applications of several 3D printing systems, their advantages and disadvantages are also discussed. A basic understanding of the entire spectrum of organ printing provides pragmatic insight into the mechanisms, methods, and applications of this discipline. Organ printing is being applied in the tissue engineering field with the purpose of developing tissue/organ constructs for the regeneration of both hard (bone, cartilage, osteochondral) and soft tissues (heart). There are other potential application areas including tissue/organ models, disease/cancer models, and models for physiology and pathology, where in vitro 3D multicellular structures developed by organ printing are valuable.
