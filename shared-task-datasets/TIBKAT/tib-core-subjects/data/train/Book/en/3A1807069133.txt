Field guide to hyperspectral/multispectral image processing
Hyper/multispectral imagery in optical remote sensing utilizes wavelengths that range from the visible to the reflective shortwave infrared. Inverse processes using machine learning are applied to the spectral profiles recorded for target detection, material identification, and associated environmental applications, which is the main purpose of remote sensing. This Field Guide covers the fundamentals of remote sensing spectral imaging for image understanding; image processing for correction and quality improvement; and image analysis for information extraction at subpixel, pixel, superpixel, and image levels, including feature mining and feature reduction. Basic concepts and fundamental understanding are emphasized to prepare the reader for exploring advanced methods.
