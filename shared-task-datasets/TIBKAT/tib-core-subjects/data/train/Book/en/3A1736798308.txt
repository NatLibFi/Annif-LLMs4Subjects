Active spanwise lift control : a distributed parameter approach
"This book presents a novel approach to tackle the gust alleviation problem. Traditional approaches typically attempt to suppress the structural response at discrete points of the wing using only the conventional control surfaces (aileron, elevator, rudder), resulting in limited control authority, high-bandwidth actuator requirements, and necessity of gust field measurements ahead of the aircraft. In this book, the authors directly address the spanwise behavior of aerodynamic loads, as this is what should be primarily controlled"--
