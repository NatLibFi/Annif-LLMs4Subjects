High voltage and electrical insulation engineering
"Since the publication of the first edition of High Voltage and Electrical Engineering, development in measurement techniques has evolved newer methods for continuously monitoring the condition of electrical insulation on installations. The book begins with the description of fundamental terminology in the subject of high voltage engineering. It is followed by the classification of electric fields and the techniques of field estimation. Performance of gaseous, liquid and solid dielectrics under different field conditions is described in the subsequent chapters. Separate chapters on vacuum as insulation and lightning phenomenon are included."--
