Computer intelligence against pandemics : tools and methods to face new strains of COVID-19
This book introduces the most recent research and innovative developments regarding the new strains of COVID-19. While medical and natural sciences have been working instantly on deriving solutions and trying to protect humankind against such virus types, there is also a great focus on technological developments for improving the mechanism - momentum of science for effective and efficient solutions. At this point, computational intelligence is the most powerful tools for researchers to fight against COVID-19. Thanks to instant data-analyze and predictive techniques by computational intelligence, it is possible to get positive results and introduce revolutionary solutions against related medical diseases. By running capabilities - resources for rising the computational intelligence, technological fields like Artificial Intelligence (with Machine / Deep Learning), Data Mining, Applied Mathematics are essential components for processing data, recognizing patterns, modelling new techniques and improving the advantages of the computational intelligence more. Nowadays, there is a great interest in the application potentials of computational intelligence to be an effective approach for taking humankind more step away, after COVID-19 and before pandemics similar to the COVID-19 many appear
