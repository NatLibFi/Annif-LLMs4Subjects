Handbook of image-based security techniques
This book focuses on image based security techniques, namely visual cryptography, watermarking, and steganography. The first section explores basic to advanced concepts of visual cryptography (VC). The second section covers Digital Image Watermarking including watermarking algorithms, frameworks for modeling watermarking systems, and the evaluation of watermarking techniques. The final section analyzes Steganography, including the notion, terminology and building blocks of steganographic communication. The book includes many examples and applications, as well as implementation using MATLAB--
