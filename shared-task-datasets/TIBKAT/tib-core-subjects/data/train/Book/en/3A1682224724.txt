Sensors in water pollutants monitoring: role of material
This book discusses the sensitivity, selectivity, and response times of different sensor materials and their potential application in the design of portable sensor systems for monitoring water pollutants and remediation systems. Beginning with an overview on water pollutants and analytical methods for their detection, the book then moves on to describing the advances in sensor materials research, and the scope for their use in different types of sensors. The book lays emphasis on techniques such as colorimetric, fluorescence, electrochemical, and biological sensing of conventional and emerging pollutants. This book will serve as a handy guide for students, researchers, and professional engineers working in the field of sensor systems for monitoring water pollutants to address various challenges
