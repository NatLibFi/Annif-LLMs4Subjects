Biocalculus : calculus for the life sciences
The chief goal in Biocalculus: calculus for the life sciences is to show students how calculus relates to biology ... Although the focus is on the interface between mathematics and the life sciences, the logical structure of the book is motivated by the mathematical material. Students will come away with a sound knowledge of mathematics and an understanding of the importance of mathematical arguments. Equally important, they will also come away with a clear understanding of how these mathematical concepts and techniques are central in the life sciences.--
