The ESD handbook
"Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is the sudden and momentary electric current that flows when an excess of electric charge, stored on an electrically insulated object, finds a path to an object at a different electrical potential (such as the earth). In the electronics industry, a failure mechanism describes momentary unwanted currents that may cause damage to electronic equipment. This can clearly be very costly, and it is advantageous to find ways of preventing this discharge, or to limit its damage when it does occur. ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) is a common problem in the semiconductor environment. This book discusses ESD protection, filling a gap in the market as currently there is no ?ESD Handbook? for the semiconductor industry"--
