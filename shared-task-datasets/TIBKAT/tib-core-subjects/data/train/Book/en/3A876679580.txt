Reinforcement and Systemic Machine Learning for Decision MakingThere are always difficulties in making machines that learn from experience. Complete information is not always available--or it becomes available in bits and pieces over a period of time. With respect to systemic learning, there is a need to understand the impact of decisions and actions on a system over that period of time. This book takes a holistic approach to addressing that need and presents a new paradigm--creating new learning applications and, ultimately, more intelligent machines.The first book of its kind in this new and g
