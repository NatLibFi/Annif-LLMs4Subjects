Analysis at large : dedicated to the life and work of Jean Bourgain
Analysis at Large is dedicated to Jean Bourgain whose research has deeply influenced the mathematics discipline, particularly in analysis and its interconnections with other fields. In this volume, the contributions made by renowned experts present both research and surveys on a wide spectrum of subjects, each of which pay tribute to a true mathematical pioneer. Examples of topics discussed in this book include Bourgain’s discretized sum-product theorem, his work in nonlinear dispersive equations, the slicing problem by Bourgain, harmonious sets, the joint spectral radius, equidistribution of affine random walks, Cartan covers and doubling Bernstein type inequalities, a weighted Prékopa-Leindler inequality and sumsets with quasicubes, the fractal uncertainty principle for the Walsh-Fourier transform, the continuous formulation of shallow neural networks as Wasserstein-type gradient flows, logarithmic quantum dynamical bounds for arithmetically defined ergodic Schrödinger operators, polynomial equations in subgroups, trace sets of restricted continued fraction semigroups, exponential sums, twisted multiplicativity and moments, the ternary Goldbach problem, as well as the multiplicative group generated by two primes in Z/QZ. It is hoped that this volume will inspire further research in the areas of analysis treated in this book and also provide direction and guidance for upcoming developments in this essential subject of mathematics.
