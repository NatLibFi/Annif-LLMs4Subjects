Maurer-Cartan methods in deformation theory : the twisting procedure
Covering an exceptional range of topics, this text provides a unique overview of the Maurerâ€”Cartan methods in algebra, geometry, topology, and mathematical physics. It offers a new conceptual treatment of the twisting procedure, guiding the reader through various versions with the help of plentiful motivating examples for graduate students as well as researchers. Topics covered include a novel approach to the twisting procedure for operads leading to Kontsevich graph homology and a description of the twisting procedure for (homotopy) associative algebras or (homotopy) Lie algebras using the biggest deformation gauge group ever considered. The book concludes with concise surveys of recent applications in areas including higher category theory and deformation theory.
