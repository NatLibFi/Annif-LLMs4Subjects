Network information systems : a dynamical systems approach
Presents a unique treatment of network control systems. Drawing from fundamental principles of dynamical systems theory and dynamical thermodynamics, the authors develop a continuous-time, discrete-time, and hybrid dynamical system and control framework for linear and nonlinear large-scale network systems. The following are some of the book's unique features: The proposed framework extends the concepts of energy, entropy, and temperature to undirected and directed information networks. Continuous-time, discrete-time, and hybrid thermodynamic principles are used to design distributed control protocol algorithms for static and dynamic networked systems in the face of system uncertainty, exogenous disturbances, imperfect system network communication, and time delays
