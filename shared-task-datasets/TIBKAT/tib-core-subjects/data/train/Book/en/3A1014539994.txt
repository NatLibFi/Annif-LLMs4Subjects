Multispectral image fusion and colorization
Motivation -- Biological vision -- Operating conditions -- Image analysis -- Information fusion levels -- Image fusion methods -- Colorization methods -- Image fusion metrics -- Image fusion evaluation -- Fusion applications in biometrics -- Additional fusion applications
"This book provides a complete overview of the state of the art in color image fusion, the associated evaluation methods, and its range of applications. It presents a comprehensive overview of fusion metrics and a comparison of objective metrics and subjective evaluations. Part I addresses the historical background and basic concepts. Part II describes image fusion theory. Part III focuses on quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Part IV presents several fusion applications, including two primary multiscale fusion approaches - the image pyramid and wavelet transform - as they pertain to face matching, biomedical imaging, and night vision"--
