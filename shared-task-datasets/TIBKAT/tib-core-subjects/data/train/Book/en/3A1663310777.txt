Modern supercritical fluid chromatography : carbon dioxide containing mobile phases
"Provides a clear explanation of the physical and chemical properties of Supercritical Fluids, which gives the reader a better understanding of the basis for improved performance in SFC compared to HPLC and GC. Details the advantages of SFC as a green alternative to HPLC and GC for the analysis of both polar, water-soluble, and non-polar analytes. Details why SFC is a modern preparative chromatographic technique that is used to purify the components of mixtures for subsequent uses. Details both achiral and chiral SFC method development. Covers numerous detectors, with an emphasis on SFC-MS, SFC-UV, and SFC-ELSD (evaporative light scattering detection). Describes the application of SFC to numerous high-value application areas, such as pharmaceuticals, consumer products, foods, polymers, petroleum-related mixtures, and cannabis"--
