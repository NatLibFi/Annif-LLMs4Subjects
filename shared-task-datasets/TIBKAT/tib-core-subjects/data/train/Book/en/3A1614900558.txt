Design science research methods and patterns : innovating information and communication technology
Presenting innovative research methods, this second edition of a bestseller describes a simple and practical methodology for conducting cutting-edge design science research (DSR). It provides comprehensive guidance on how to conduct such research and supplies in-depth treatment of design science theory and the different types of theory that can be generated in design science research. Making novel use of the concept of patterns, it presents 84 research patterns for conducting effective DSR. It emphasizes design science theory throughout and is filled with practical examples of using patterns to conduct information and communication technology research (ICT). With a focus on reusing research activities to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of conducting design science research, the book relies on familiar patterns to provide the fundamentals of various research philosophies and techniques required to innovate ICT. It describes design science research in relation to other information systems research paradigms such as positivist and interpretivist research. New to this edition are relevant design science research patterns adapted from TRIZ, the widely regarded European engineering design and creativity method. This edition also provides greatly expanded treatment of theory building in design science research (DSR), a topic of rapidly growing interest in addition to a new chapter presenting a framework for theory development in DSR. The book provides an expanded examination of patterns in DSR presented using a new pattern classification mechanism to group patterns with like functionality. This book will be of value to those interested in learning to conduct design science research, particularly in the ICT disciplines the book focuses on.
