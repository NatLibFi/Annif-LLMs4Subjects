Measuring quality : performance measurement in libraries
The first edition of this handbook appeared in 1996 and dealt with academic libraries. It gained wide acceptance and was translated into five other languages.After ten years the new edition widens the perspective to public libraries and adds indicators for electronic services and cost-effectiveness. The handbook has been considerably enlarged, from 17 to 40 indicators. It gives practical help by showing examples of possible results for each indicator. The handbook is intended as practical instrument for the evaluation of library services. Although it aims specifically at academic and public libraries, most indicators will also apply to all other types of libraries.
