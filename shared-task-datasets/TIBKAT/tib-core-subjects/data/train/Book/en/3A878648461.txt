Power harvesting via smart materials
Ambient energy sources: mechanical, light and thermal -- Fundamentals of ferroelectric materials -- Piezoelectric energy harvesting -- Parametric identification and measurement techniques for piezoelectric energy harvester -- Theoretical background of mechanical energy conversion -- Techniques for enhancing piezoelectric energy harvesting efficiency -- Piezoelectric power harvesting devices -- Ferroelectric energy harvesting -- Processing of important piezoelectric  materials -- Future directions and outlook
"This monograph covers the fundamentals, fabrication, testing, and modeling of ambient energy harvesters based on three main streams of energy-harvesting mechanisms: piezoelectrics, ferroelectrics and pyroelectrics, and thermoelectrics. It addresses their commercial and biomedical applications, as well as the latest research results. Graduate students, scientists, engineers, researchers, and those new to the field will find this book a handy and crucial reference because it provides a comprehensive perspective on the basic concepts and recent developments in this rapidly expanding field"--
