Fostering computational thinking among underrepresented students in STEM : strategies for supporting racially equitable computing
The advent of computational thinking -- Designing learning environments that support developing computational algorithmic thinking capabilities -- Coding, game design, and computational thinking -- Using computer modeling and drones to develop computational thinking among predominantly black students -- Facilitating computational participation, place-based education, and culturally specific pedagogy with indigenous students -- Professional development that fosters computation thinking and high-quality teaching for students of color -- Program evaluation of broadening STEM participation for underrepresented students of color.
"This book broadly educates preservice teachers and scholars about current research on computational thinking (CT). More specifically, attention is given to computational algorithmic thinking (CAT), particularly among underrepresented K-12 student groups in STEM education. Computational algorithmic thinking (CAT) - a precursor to CT - is explored in this text as the ability to design, implement, and evaluate the application of algorithms to solve a variety of problems. Drawing on observations from research studies that focused on innovative STEM programs including underrepresented students in rural, suburban, and urban contexts, the authors reflect on project-based learning experiences, pedagogy, and evaluation that are conducive to developing advanced computational thinking, specifically among diverse student populations. This practical text includes vignettes and visual examples to illustrate how coding, computer modeling, robotics, and drones may be used to promote CT and CAT among students in diverse classrooms"--
