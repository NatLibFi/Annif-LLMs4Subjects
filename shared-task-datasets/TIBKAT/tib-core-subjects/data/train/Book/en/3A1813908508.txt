Hybrid polymeric nanocomposites from agricultural waste
"Hybrid Polymeric Nanocomposites from Agricultural Waste examines the use of agricultural byproducts for green production of new materials. It covers nanoparticles synthesis from agricultural wastes and nanocomposite development with a focus on polyethylene, polylactic acid, polymethylmethacrylate, and epoxy resins and considers possible biomedical and engineering applications. Showcases agricultural waste as polymer reinforcements to replace expensive synthetic fibres that discourage wide polymeric nanocomposite applications. Discusses green synthesis and characterization of hybrid nanocomposites from polylactic acid, polymethylmethacrylate, recycled/new polyethylene and epoxy resins. Contrasts hybrid nanocomposites properties with standard nanocomposites, using automotive case studies. The book is aimed at researchers, advanced students, and industrial professionals in materials, polymer, and mechanical engineering and related areas interested in the development and application of sustainable materials"--
