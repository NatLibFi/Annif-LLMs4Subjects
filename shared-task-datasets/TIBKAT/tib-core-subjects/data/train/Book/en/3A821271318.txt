Archaeology of domestic architecture and the human use of space
"This volume is the first text to focus specifically on the archaeology of domestic architecture. Covering major theoretical and methodological developments over recent decades in areas like social institutions, settlement types, gender, status, and power, this book addresses the developing understanding of where and how people in the past created and used domestic space. It will be a useful synthesis for scholars and an ideal text for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses in archaeology and architecture. The book: covers the relationship of architectural decisions of ancient peoples with our understanding of social and cultural institutions; includes cases from every continent and all time periods--from the Paleolithic of Europe to present-day African villages; is ideal for the growing number of courses on household archaeology, social archaeology, and historical and vernacular architecture"--
