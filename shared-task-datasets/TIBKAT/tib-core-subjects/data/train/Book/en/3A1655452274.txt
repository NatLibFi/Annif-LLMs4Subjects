Linear Functions and Matrix Theory
This textbook is a new introduction to linear algebra for students who have completed the first year of calculus. In the spirit of modern instruction, this elementary presentation of the important ideas in linear algebra emphasizes conceptual understanding, developing applied examples, and working with realistic numerical data before introducing formal mathematical definition and operations. This text emphasizes geometric, symbolic, and numeric presentations of the subject. The first two chapters cover linear phenomena in both numeric and geometric settings. The symbolic manipulation of vectors and matrices is then introduced as a tool for the study of specific problems. Many examples, student exercises, and group project ideas are included
