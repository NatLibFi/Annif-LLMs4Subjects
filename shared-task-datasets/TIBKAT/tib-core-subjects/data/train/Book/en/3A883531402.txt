Custom Raspberry Pi interfaces : design and build hardware interfaces for the Raspberry Pi
This book equips the reader with skills necessary to design and build custom hardware interfaces to be used by the Raspberry Pi. A thorough chapter on interfacing 5-volt systems from a 3.3-volt Raspberry Pi system equips the reader for additional peripheral options. Ready to go C++ programs involving I2C and SPI peripherals are supplies. Explores ADC, DAC, rotary encoders, and GPIO. Readers will discover low cost display and sensor options for embedded system projects. Master I2C and SPI communications from Raspbian Linux in C++. Perform ADC and DAC experiments on their Pis. Debounce hardware and software buttons/switches. Read rotary encoders for direction and step in C++. Implement flywheel rotary encoder effects for use in tuning GnuRadio. And hack GnuRadio software so it will respond to their custom hardware controls
