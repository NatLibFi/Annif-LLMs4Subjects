OFDM for underwater acoustic communications
"This book provides a blend of introductory material and advanced communication and signal processing techniques to underwater acoustic systems and network development. As one of the first to describe the processing techniques central to underwater OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing), it starts with the characteristics of underwater acoustic channels, stressing the difference from wireless radio channels. After an overview of the OFDM receiver, it develops various modules for the receiver design in systems with single or multiple transmitters ..."--
