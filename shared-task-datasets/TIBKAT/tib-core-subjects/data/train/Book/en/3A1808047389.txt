Environmental contaminants and neurological disorders
This volume discusses how environmental pollutants are involved in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, and covers specific mechanisms and risk factors, as well as the necessary strategies to reduce the adverse impacts of environmental pollutants on the human nervous system. With a collection of contributions from experts in environmental pollution, neurology and pharmaceutical chemistry, the book provides both an introduction to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration, including the types and different classes of neurological disorders, and studies demonstrating the clear link between environmental contaminants (e.g. pesticides, smoking, mycotoxins, persistent organic pollutants (POP's), polychlorinated biphenyls, phthalates, nanomaterials) and the development of neurological disorders in vulnerable populations. The book fills in a gap in research on the topic by also covering state-of-the-art treatment strategies and mitigation measures for each type of pollutant. The book will be of interest to environmental scientists, pharmacologists, toxicologists, biochemists, biotechnologists, and food and drug regulatory organizations
