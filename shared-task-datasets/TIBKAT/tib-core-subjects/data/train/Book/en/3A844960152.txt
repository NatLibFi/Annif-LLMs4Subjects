Thin films on silicon
"A thin film is a layer of material ranging from fractions of a nanometer (monolayer) to several micrometers in thickness. Silicon (Si) is one of the most important semiconductors today because it has a very low occurrence of defects. While it's the building block of most electronic devices, other semiconductors are becoming more important in the industry because of their superior properties. The search for organic semiconductors as well as hybrid materials which combine organic and inorganic materials is underway. Scientists are searching for the materials most capable of absorbing light over a wide range of solar wavelengths and with the lowest manufacturing cost. This book explores the recent advances and remaining challenges in thin-film silicon"--
