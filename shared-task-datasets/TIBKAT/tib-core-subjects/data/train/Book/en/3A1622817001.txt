Brutal London
Here is a new photographic look at the raw concrete and imposing mass of Brutalist architecture that is undeniably part of the fabric of London's landscape - both visual and social - and part of our urban history. Momentum is now growing to celebrate, reclaim and preserve buildings which were once written off or allowed to decay. This collection of unique and evocative photography by Simon Phipps casts the city in a new light. Arranged by inner London Borough, 'Brutal London' includes examples such as Trellick Tower, Brunswick Centre and many others
