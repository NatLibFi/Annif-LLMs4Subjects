Fractional quantum Hall effects : new developments
"The fractional quantum Hall effect has been one of the most active areas of research in quantum condensed matter physics for nearly four decades, serving as a paradigm for unexpected and exotic emergent behavior arising from interactions. This book, featuring a collection of articles written by experts and a Foreword by Klaus von Klitzing, the discoverer of quantum Hall effect and winner of 1985 Nobel Prize in physics, aims to provide a coherent account of the exciting new developments and the current status of the field"--
