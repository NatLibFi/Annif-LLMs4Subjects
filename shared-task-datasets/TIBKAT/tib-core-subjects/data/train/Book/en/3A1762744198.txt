Reimagining time : a light-speed tour of Einstein's theory of relativity
Most people assume that only a mathematical genius can understand Einstein's theory of special relativity. In fact, it boils down to a single rule: the universe has a speed limit, the speed of light.0 This accessible, imaginative book by an innovative science communicator and a highly regarded physicist provides a one-stop short course on Einstein's theory of special relativity. The authors consider the consequences of this puzzling feature of the universe and its broader implications for the nature of space, time, and matter. Understanding them doesn't require a deep background in mathematics and physics, as they demonstrate.0 Through a series of thought experiments that seamlessly blend original art with text, the book guides readers through Einstein's remarkably creative line of reasoning to expose truths about our universe: time is relative, lengths get shorter with motion, energy and mass are interchangeable, and the universe has a speed limit
