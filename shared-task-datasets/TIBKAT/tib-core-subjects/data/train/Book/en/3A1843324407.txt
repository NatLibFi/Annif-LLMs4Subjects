Applications of percolation theory
The first edition of this book was published in 1994. Since then considerable progress has been made in both theoretical developments of percolation theory, and in its applications. The 2nd edition of this book is a response to such developments. Not only have all of the chapters of the 1st edition been completely rewritten, reorganized, and updated all the way to 2022, but also 8 new chapters have been added that describe extensive new applications, including biological materials, networks and graphs, directed percolation, earthquakes, geochemical processes, and large-scale real world problems, from spread of technology to ad-hoc mobile networks
