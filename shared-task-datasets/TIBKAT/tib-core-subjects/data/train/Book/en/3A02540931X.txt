The urbanization of the Third World
Klappentext: Synthesizing the vast amount of recent research on Third World Urbanization, this anthology presents multiple approaches to the profound transition encompassing the Third World. The volume brings together the most authoritative statements from an international field of scholars representing a wide spectrum of disciplines: sociology, anthropology, demography, economics, geography, history, and political science. They examine key issues in urban growth, urban bias, rural-urban migration and the labor market, housing, survival strategies, integration and social control, and the politics played out in the urban arena.
