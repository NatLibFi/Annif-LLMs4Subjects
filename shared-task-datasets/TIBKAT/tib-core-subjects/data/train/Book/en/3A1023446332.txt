SMEs in a globalised world : survival and growth strategies on Europe's geographical periphery
pt. 1. Key drivers of a globally competitive SME sector in the EU -- pt. 2. MNEs, SMEs and industrial development
This insightful book shows how small and medium enterprises (SMEs) from some of the traditionally less dynamic peripheral economies of the "old" EU--namely Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain--have responded to the twin challenges of globalisation and industrial restructuring. Through a series of unique case studies the contributing authors discuss how these economies, and in particular the SME sector, can be transformed
