Dynamics of Fluids in Porous Media
This classic work by one of the world's foremost hydrologists presents a topic encountered in the many fields of science and engineering where flow through porous media plays a fundamental role. It is the standard work in the field, designed primarily for advanced undergraduate and graduate students of ground water hydrology, soil mechanics, soil physics, drainage and irrigation engineering, and petroleum and chemical engineering. It is highly recommended as well for scientists and engineers already working in these fields.Throughout this generously illustrated, richly detailed study, which i
