"China is surging in the tech race - and will continue to outperform the United States. The rising power has done exceptionally in Super Apps, bullet trains, 5G, electric vehicles, digital currency, smart cities, blockchain applications, and quantum communications in space, among others. Its payment platforms are increasingly adopted along the entire Silk Road. The genesis of this book was to discover an "Apollo Program" for the US to catch up in these areas, but we discovered a much deeper need for a social/mental health Apollo Program for millennials who are bogged down by a host of under-appreciated and intertwined issues which cause anxiety and alienation and lead to massive losses in workplace productivity. This book proposes two Apollo programs - one for tech and one for millennials - by a millennial. Strategies for cracking the highly competitive Chinese Super App ecommerce market are also revealed"--Publisher's website
