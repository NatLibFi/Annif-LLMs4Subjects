Thomas Sandell : sandellsandberg
Summary: Thomas Sandell is one of Sweden's internationally most widely noticed architects and designers. Blessed with a powerful, idiosyncratic sense of form, he has worked on most scales and in most genres. He combines the furniture designer who has created some of IKEA's major classics with the product designer who has fashioned exclusive watches and bags, the architect behind some of the most controversial Swedish projects of recent years, and the planner with social pathos who addresses the problems of underprivileged suburban communities
