Building/inside Studio Gang Architects
One of the foremost architects working today, Jeanne Gang is widely recognized for her innovative and independent practice. Studio Gang Architects confronts pressing contemporary issues and seeks to answer questions that exist locally but resound globally through architecture. The firm's work is exemplified by recent projects such as the Aqua Tower in Chicago, an 82-storey mixed-use high-rise, which critic Paul Goldberger described as, "Reclaiming the notion that thrilling and beautiful form can still emerge out of the realm of the practical". With the studio poised to contribute a new set of buildings to the global skyline, "Building: Inside Studio Gang Architects", examines its most current work, twelve built and unbuilt projects that address four major issues facing contemporary architecture: its relationship to nature, the development of dense urban areas, the integration of the ideas of community members, and architecture and performance. Featuring essays, interviews, sketches, and drawings - many previously unpublished - this beautifully illustrated book provides an insider's look at a cutting-edge architectural practice.--
