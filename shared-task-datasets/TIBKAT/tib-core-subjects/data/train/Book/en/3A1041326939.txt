Large-Scale and Distributed Optimization
This book presents tools and methods for large-scale and distributed optimization. Since many methods in "Big Data" fields rely on solving large-scale optimization problems, often in distributed fashion, this topic has over the last decade emerged to become very important. As well as specific coverage of this active research field, the book serves as a powerful source of information for practitioners as well as theoreticians. Large-Scale and Distributed Optimization is a unique combination of contributions from leading experts in the field, who were speakers at the LCCC Focus Period on Large-Scale and Distributed Optimization, held in Lund, 14th-16th June 2017. A source of information and innovative ideas for current and future research, this book will appeal to researchers, academics, and students who are interested in large-scale optimization
