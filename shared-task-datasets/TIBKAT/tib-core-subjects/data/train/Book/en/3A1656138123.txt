The ROV manual : a user guide for remotely operated vehicles
Many underwater operations that were once carried out by divers can now be carried out more efficiently and safely with ROVs. Their use has spread rapidly too as the technology has become more efficient and affordable, with application now commonly seen in marine research and surveying, nuclear, hydroelectric and petroleum infrastructure inspection, harbor security and military contexts, among others. The ROV Manual is one of very few dedicated resources covering the use of ROVs, written by well-known experts in the field to provide a complete training and reference tool. The new edition of this established ROV how-to manual is intended for those involved with small observation class ROVs used for surveying, inspection and research purposes. One of few titles to focus on observation class remotely operated vehicle (ROV) underwater deployment in real conditions for industrial, commercial, scientific and recreational tasksA complete user guide to ROV operation with basic information on underwater robotics and navigation equipment to obtain mission results quickly and efficientlyPacked with hard-won, insider's advice and complete with self-learning questions to aid understanding
