Identifying microbes by mass spectrometry proteomics
"This book presents an in-depth examination of the process of detecting and identifying microbes using mass spectrometry techniques and the possibility of using this technology in a field application. Through a side-by-side comparative discussion of the different mass spectrometry approaches, it demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. The book includes recent findings that show the detection of new viruses, new bacteria, fungi, and other microbes in complex environmental samples. It describes sample preparation methods and discusses the rationale and methods for the detection and identification of unknown, genetically modified, or synthetic microbes"--Provided by publisher
