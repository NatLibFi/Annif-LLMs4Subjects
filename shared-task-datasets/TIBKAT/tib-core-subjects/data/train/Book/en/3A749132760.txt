Classical Orthogonal Polynomials of a Discrete Variable
While classical orthogonal polynomials appear as solutions to hypergeometric differential equations, those of a discrete variable emerge as solutions of difference equations of hypergeometric type on lattices. The authors present a concise introduction to this theory, presenting at the same time methods of solving a large class of difference equations. They apply the theory to various problems in scientific computing, probability, queuing theory, coding and information compression. The book is an expanded and revised version of the first edition, published in Russian (Nauka 1985). Students and scientists will find a useful textbook in numerical analysis
