Heisenberg’s 1958 Weltformel and the Roots of Post-Empirical Physics
Introduction -- The origins of Heisenberg's program -- Heisenberg Triumphant -- Reception and Rejection -- Conclusions
This book presents the first detailed account of Werner Heisenberg’s failed attempt to find a theory of everything in the autumn of his career. It further investigates what we can learn from his failure in relation to the search for a final theory of physics, an endeavour that continues to define research in fundamental physics to this day. Thereby it provides the first historically informed contribution to the current debate on post-empirical physics and the state of particle physics
