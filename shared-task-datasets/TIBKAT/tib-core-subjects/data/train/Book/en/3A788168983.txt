Experience design : concepts and case studies
"Experience Design brings together leading international scholars to provide a cross-section view of current academic discourse and professional practice within this emerging interdisciplinary field. Contributors use real-life case studies drawn from a range of national and disciplinary contexts to explore the meaning of 'experience'; ways in which specific 'experiences' can be designed; which methodologies and practices are employed in this process, and how experience design interrelates with other academic and professional disciplines"--How can we design better experiences? Experience Design brings together leading international scholars to provide a cross-section of critical thinking and professional practice within this emerging field. Contributors writing from theoretical, empirical and applied design perspectives address the meaning of 'experience'; draw on case studies to explore ways in which specific 'experiences' can be designed; examine which methodologies and practices are employed in this process; and consider how experience design interrelates with other academic and professional disciplines.Chapters are grouped into thematic sections addressing positions, objectives and environments, and interactions and performances, with individual case studies addressing a wide range of experiences, including urban spaces, the hospital patient, museum visitors, mobile phone users, and music festivaland restaurant goers.
