Nondestructive techniques for the assessment and preservation of historic structures
New technologies play an increasingly important role in the analysis, monitoring, restoration, and preservation of historic structures. These technological systems continue to get more advanced and complex, for example: 3D digital construction and documentation programming, 3D imaging data (including laser scanning and photogrammetry), multispectral and thermographic imaging, geophysical data, etc. This book will present the latest nondestructive technologies used in the characterization, preservation, and structural health monitoring of historic buildings. It will include numerous case studies, as well as theoretical explanations about each of the methods and technologies used in each
