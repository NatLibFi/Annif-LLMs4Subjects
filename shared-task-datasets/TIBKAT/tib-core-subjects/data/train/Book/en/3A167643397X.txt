Ethical and responsible tourism : managing sustainability in local tourism destinations
"Ethical and Responsible Tourism explains the methods and practices used to manage the environmental impact of tourism on local communities and destinations. The three core themes of the book - destination management, environmental and social aspects of ethical sustainable development and business impacts - are discussed across both topic and case study chapters, alongside explanatory editorial analysis with all chapters clearly signposted and interlinked. The case studies address specific and practical examples from a global range of examples including sites in Australia, Central America, Europe Union countries, Japan, North and South America. Used as a core textbook, the linking of theory, in the topic chapters, and practice, gained through case studies, alongside further reading and editorial commentary, Ethical and Responsible Tourism provides a detailed and comprehensive learning experience. Specific case studies can be used as standalone examples as part of a case teaching approach, and the editorial and discussion elements are designed to be suitable for those simply seeking a concise overview, such as tourism professionals or potential investors in sustainable tourism projects. This book will be essential reading for students of tourism, environment and sustainability studies"--
