A complete guide to hybrid materials
"A Complete Guide to Hybrid Materials opens with a study wherein the casting method is used to incorporate hybrid materials based on layered zinc hydroxide salts and phenolic compounds into the polymer matrix of polyvinyl alcohol to form composite films. The authors review recent advances in the preparation and applications of inorganic nanoparticle molecularly imprinted polymers. Due to the specific binding sites, the result exhibits good selectivity, reproducibility, high binding capacity and fast kinetics for the rebinding of the analyte. The closing chapter focuses on the formation of nano clay, an exfoliated clay, and proper dispersion in a polymer matrix"--
