Polylactic acid-based nanocellulose and cellulose composites
"Polylactic Acid-Based Nanocellulose and Cellulose Composites offers a comprehensive account of methods for the synthesis, characterization, processing, and applications of these advanced materials. It fills a gap in the literature as the only available book on this topic. Describes procedures for the extraction of cellulose materials from different sources and characterization methods adopted in analyzing their properties. Covers properties, processing, and applications of PLA biocomposites made using the extracted cellulose, Discusses the effect of reinforcement of cellulose in the biopolymer matrix and enhancement of properties. Examines current status, challenges, and future outlook. The book serves as a reference for researchers, scientists, and advanced students in polymer science and engineering and materials science interested in cellulose polymer composites and their applications"--
