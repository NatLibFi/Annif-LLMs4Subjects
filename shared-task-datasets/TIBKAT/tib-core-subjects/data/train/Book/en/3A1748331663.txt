Detecting and classifying low probability of intercept radar
"This comprehensive book presents LPI radar design essentials, including ambiguity analysis of LPI waveforms, FMCW radar, and phase-shift and frequency-shift keying techniques. Moreover, you find details on new OTHR modulation schemes, noise radar, and spatial multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The book explores autonomous non-linear classification signal processing algorithms for identifying LPI modulations. It also demonstrates four intercept receiver signal processing techniques for LPI radar detection that helps you determine which time-frequency, bi-frequency technique best suits any LPI modulation of interest."--Publisher
