Operations strategy in action : a guide to the theory and practice of implementation
This fresh and enlightening book offers a rounded overview of operations strategy with a particular focus on implementation. The premise of the book is that developing an effective operations strategy without its subsequent implementation will render the strategising process a waste of time and resources. The authors explain the pros and cons of existing approaches to implementation, as well as offering a systematic framework for turning strategic intent into actions. The study will be of great interest to academics and will also give practitioners confidence in effectively formulating and efficiently implementing strategies that reflect the needs of the today's business
