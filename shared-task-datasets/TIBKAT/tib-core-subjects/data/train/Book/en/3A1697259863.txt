Nanobiotechnology for sustainable bioenergy and biofuel production
"This book entitled "Nanobiocatalysis for biofuel production"is primarily focused on the current nanobiotechnological approaches employed for biofuels production. This volume covers the following current theme pertaining to nanobiocatalysis for biofuels production such as advances in nanoscaffolds design (nanomaterials support) for immobilizing bioenergy producing enzymes (nanobiocatalyst system), recent trends in biomass processing (untreated/treated agriculture and food waste, grasses, algal etc) using advanced nanobiocatalysts for biofuels production, scale up study in bioenergy production using nanomaterials immobilized enzymes and biofuel harvesting using nanomaterials. Variousnanobiocatalysis topics addressed pertaining to biofuels production make this volume a highly useful resource for a broad readership including chemical engineers, microbiologists, biotechnologists, agricultural engineers, nanotechnologists, and policy makers"--
