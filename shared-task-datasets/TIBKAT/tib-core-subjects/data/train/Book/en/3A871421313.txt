The first edition of this text book focussed on providing practical hands-on experience in digital imaging techniques for graduate students and practitioners keeping to a minimum any detailed discussion on the underlying theory. In this new extended edition, the author builds on the strength of the original edition by expanding the coverage to include formulation of the major theoretical results that underlie the exercises as well as introducing numerous modern concepts and new techniques. Whether you are studying or already using digital imaging techniques, developing proficiency in the subject is not possible without mastering practical skills. Including more than 100 MATLAB{reg} exercises, this book delivers a complete applied course in digital imaging theory and practice
