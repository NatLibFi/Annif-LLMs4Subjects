102 Combinatorial Problems : From the Training of the USA IMO Team
"102 Combinatorial Problems" consists of carefully selected problems that have been used in the training and testing of the USA International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) team. Key features: * Provides in-depth enrichment in the important areas of combinatorics by reorganizing and enhancing problem-solving tactics and strategies * Topics include: combinatorial arguments and identities, generating functions, graph theory, recursive relations, sums and products, probability, number theory, polynomials, theory of equations, complex numbers in geometry, algorithmic proofs, combinatorial and advanced geometry, functional equations and classical inequalities The book is systematically organized, gradually building combinatorial skills and techniques and broadening the student's view of mathematics. Aside from its practical use in training teachers and students engaged in mathematical competitions, it is a source of enrichment that is bound to stimulate interest in a variety of mathematical areas that are tangential to combinatorics
