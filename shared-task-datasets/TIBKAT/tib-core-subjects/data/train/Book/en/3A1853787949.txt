Mousa to Mackintosh : the Scottishness of Scottish architecture
Architecture takes many forms. At one extreme, these forms may be seen as an international exchange, while at the other they can be viewed as distinctly national. In Mousa to Mackintosh, Frank Arneil Walker examines the recognisable and recurring features evident in Scotland's structures across the centuries. This chronological history presents a broad view of architecture in Scotland, from brochs and country houses to castles and New Towns. Walker considers the influences and connections between them to ask: what is the "Scottishness" of Scottish architecture?
