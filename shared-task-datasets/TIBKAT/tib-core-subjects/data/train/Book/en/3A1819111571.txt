This textbook introduces the concepts and tools that biomedical and chemical engineering students need to know in order to translate engineering problems into a numerical representation using scientific fundamentals. Modeling concepts focus on problems that are directly related to biomedical and chemical engineering. A variety of computational tools are presented, including MATLAB, Excel, Mathcad, and COMSOL, and a brief introduction to each tool is accompanied by multiple computer lab experiences. The numerical methods covered are basic linear algebra and basic statistics, and traditional methods like Newtonâ€™s method, Euler Integration, and trapezoidal integration. The book presents the reader with numerous examples and worked problems, and practice problems are included at the end of each chapter. Focuses on problems and methods unique to biomedical and chemical engineering; Presents modeling concepts drawn from chemical, mechanical, and materials engineering; Ancillary materials include lecture notes and slides and online videos that enable a flipped classroom or individual study.
