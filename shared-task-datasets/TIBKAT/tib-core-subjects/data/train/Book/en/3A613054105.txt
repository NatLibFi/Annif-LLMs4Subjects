Non-renewable resource issues : geoscientific and societal challenges
Nearly everything we make or build, and nearly all the energy we use, comes out of the Earth. Modern society is increasingly dependent on mineral and fossil energy sources. They are non-renewable, they differ in their availability, in the cost of production, and in their geographical distribution. Growing demand have begun to restrict the availability of these resources. The Earth is not running out of critical mineral resources - at least for the near future - but the ability to explore for, and produce, those resources is being restricted in many regions by competing land use, as well as political, and environmental issues. Extraction of natural resources requires a clear focus on sustainable development, involving economic, environmental, and social/cultural aspects. Although we do not know what the most important resources will be in 100 years from now, we can be quite certain that society will still need energy and a wide range of raw materials. These resources will include oil and gas, coal, uranium, thorium, geothermal, metallic minerals, specialty and industrial minerals, including cement, raw materials, rare-earth elements, water, both surface and groundwater. A global approach to these and related questions is called for - an approach that, with appropriate international collaboration, could be achieved within the triennium of the International Year. Some global mineral resource assessments, involving inter-governmental collaboration, have already been initiated. The International Year of Planet Earth will help focus attention on how the geosciences can generate prosperity locally and globally, as well as sustainability issues in both developed and developing countries
