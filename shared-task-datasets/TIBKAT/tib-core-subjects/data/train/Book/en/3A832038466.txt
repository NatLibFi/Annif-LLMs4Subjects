Global energy : issues, potentials, and policy implications
The major purpose of this book is to lay out the broad landscape of global energy issues and how they might develop in coming decades. While there are considerable uncertainties in respect of some of these issues, many of the defining characteristics of the landscape are clear, and the energy policies of all countries will need to be broadly consistent with these if they are to be feasible and achieve their objectives
