Semiconductor integrated optics for switching light
This book covers the technology of switching or modulating light in semiconductor optical waveguides. Currently a key function for optical communications systems is the conversion of data from an electrical signal to an optical signal for transmission in very low loss optical fibres and the converse process of optical to electrical conversion the O/E/O data conversion. It focuses on all-optical switching using second/third order optical nonlinearities in AIGaAs optical waveguides while covering a variety of device configurations including integrated nonlinear couplers and Mach-Zehnder interferometers.
