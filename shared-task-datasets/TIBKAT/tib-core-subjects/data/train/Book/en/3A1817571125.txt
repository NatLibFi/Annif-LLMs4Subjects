Symmetry Representations of Molecular Vibrations
This book presents a comprehensive theoretical basis of symmetry representations of molecular vibrations, matrix representation of symmetries, and the elements of group theory that are relevant to other symmetry elements/operations, crystallographic and molecular point groups. The book helps understand the reducible and irreducible representations of symmetry matrices and then derive the normal modes of vibration of different molecules by using suitable techniques independently. Targeted to graduate students and researchers, this book aims not only to derive the normal modes of vibration of any given molecule themselves but also compares and verifies them with the experimentally found modes by using IR and Raman-related techniques. For the first time in the crystallographic history, this book presents the group multiplication tables of all 32 point groups in both international and Schoenflies notations.
