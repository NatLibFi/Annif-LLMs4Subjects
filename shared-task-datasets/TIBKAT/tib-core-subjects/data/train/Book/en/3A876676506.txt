Radio frequency principles and applications : the generation, propagation, and reception of signals and noise
"Now, in a single convenient volume, you can have all the information you need on real-world applications of electromagnetic theory, including the prediction, analysis, and measurement of electromagnetic fields and their effects. RADIO FREQUENCY PRINCIPLES and APPLICATIONS will guide you from the basics of electromagnetic theory to the full range of new and vital applications. Author Albert A. Smith, Jr. provides a wealth of practical information in an accessible style, without using obtuse theory or requiring complex mathematical derivations. This exceptionally ""readable"" text ties together the various related topics in a logical development, and the material flows from the fundamentals of electromagnetic fields to areas of practical application. The numerous figures provide helpful illustrations, and the appendicies offer additional mathematical details. This book will be of particular use to engineers working in the many diverse fields relating to the application of electromagnetic concepts, including engineers involved in RF technology, EMC, radio wave propagation, antennas, radio frequency environments, wireless communications, microwaves, and space systems.
