Condensed-phase molecular spectroscopy and photophysics
"This book comprehensively covers radiation-matter interactions for molecules in condensed phases along with metallic and semiconductor nanostructures. Organized and appropriate for both researchers and advanced students, the text differs from others through its emphasis on the molecule-environment interactions that strongly influence spectra in condensed phases alongside including spectroscopy and photophysics of molecular aggregates and molecular solids and of metals and semiconductors, as well as more modern topics such as two-dimensional and single-molecule spectroscopy. In this new 2nd edition, the author adds basic rotational spectroscopy and statistical mechanics; sections on some Raman scattering, two-dimensional spectroscopies, and single-molecule spectroscopies; and a chapter on time-domain pictures of steady-state spectroscopies"--
