The presence of liquid crystal displays (LCDs) marks the advances in mobile phones and television development over the last few decades. Japanese companies were the first to commercialize passive-matrix TNLCDs and, later on, high-resolution activematrix LCDs. Prof. Shunsuke Kobayashi has made essential contributions to Japan's prominence in LCD development throughout this period. He is well-known not only for his own groundbreaking research, but also for the training of many prominent figures in the display industry, both in Japan and in other countries. This book brings together many prominent researchers in the field of liquid crystal science and technology, to share with us the key developments in LCD over the last few decades. It comprises of five categories - from basic physics and chemistry of liquid crystals, to detailed descriptions of alignment technologies, wide viewing angle technologies, LC optics, and display applications
