The cultures of computing
This is one of the first collections exploring the range of cultural practices associated with the design and use of computing. Against the background of the "information revolution", the volume shows how people come to computers as learners, artists, teachers, designers, gatekeepers, or scientists. The contributors cover a range of topics, from the military to gender in cyberspace, from education to multi-national corporate IT use.
