International review of national competitiveness : a detailed analysis of sources and rankings
This book provides rankings of national competitiveness alongside a series of sophisticated and specific guidelines for enhancing national competitiveness. Existing national competitiveness studies are often flawed since they are not based on rigorous models and appropriate methodologies. In this study, theoretical and methodological problems in existing studies are tackled and a series of tools for assessing national competitiveness is presented. The foundation underpinning the analysis is the MASI (Measure--Analyze--Simulate--Implement) approach, which is used to systematically address policy implications for enhancing national competitiveness. The data and analytical tools can also be utilized for other areas of study, including industry and firms, and intra-group rankings allow cross-country comparison among countries with similar characteristics. Specific guidelines for enhancing national competitiveness are also prescribed. This wide-ranging, comprehensive book will prove an essential reference tool for academics and researchers in the fields of international business and international economics. Both business and public-sector practitioners will also find this book to be a source of invaluable information on competition in investment locations and for setting benchmarks against leading country competitors.
