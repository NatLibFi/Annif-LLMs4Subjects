Nonlinear dynamics : a concise introduction interlaced with code
This concise and up-to-date textbook provides an accessible introduction to the core concepts of nonlinear dynamics as well as its existing and potential applications. The book is aimed at students and researchers in all the diverse fields in which nonlinear phenomena are important. Since most tasks in nonlinear dynamics cannot be treated analytically, skills in using numerical simulations are crucial for analyzing these phenomena. The text therefore addresses in detail appropriate computational methods as well as identifying the pitfalls of numerical simulations. It includes numerous executable code snippets referring to open source Julia software packages. Each chapter includes a selection of exercises with which students can test and deepen their skills.
