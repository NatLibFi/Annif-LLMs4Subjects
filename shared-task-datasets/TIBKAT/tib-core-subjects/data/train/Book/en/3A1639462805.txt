"Historically, philosophers have devoted a great deal of attention to the interrelations between computational concepts and both mathematical concepts and the concepts of intelligence and mind. There has been much less work, however, on the interrelations between computational concepts and those of the natural sciences. Our goal, in putting this edited volume together, was to begin to fill in this gap with a book dedicated to the connections between computation and physics, and to encourage further work in this area"--
