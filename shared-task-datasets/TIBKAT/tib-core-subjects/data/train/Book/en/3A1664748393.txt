Phase-field crystals : fast interface dynamics
The Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model incorporates microscopic structural details into a mesoscopic continuum theory. Methods for fast propagation of PFC interfaces are discussed in this book. They can handle a wide range of cooling rates, thermal gradients, supersaturations and supercoolings, including applications to the microstructural pattern formation occurring in intensive laser annealing and rapid quenching from the liquid state. The reader will find theoretical treatment in the first half, while the latter half discusses numerical models.--
