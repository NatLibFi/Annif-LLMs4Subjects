Systems bioinformatics : an engineering case-based approach
Powerful engineering tools can help solve today?s complex biological and biomedical research challenges? and this first-of-its-kind guide is paving the way . This trail-blazing work gives engineers a quantitative systems approach to bioinformatics research using computational tools drawn from technical disciplines. It presents biological processes in an engineering context to help engineers use their technical skills in solving novel biological problems and also to facilitate reverse engineering from biology in developing synthetic biological devices
