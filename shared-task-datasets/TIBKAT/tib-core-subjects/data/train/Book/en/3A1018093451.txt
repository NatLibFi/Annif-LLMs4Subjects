Site investigation using resistivity imaging
This book aims to summarize pertinent details of Resitivity Imaging in site investigation for geotechnical and geo-environmental applications. It aims to bridge the gap that currently exists between the geotechnical/geo-environmental and geophysical engineering community. The geotechnical and geo-environmental engineers will be able to interpret the geophysical data and utilize the information for their design. It will be a comprehensive handbook for the application of RI in geotechnical and geo-environmental site investigations--
