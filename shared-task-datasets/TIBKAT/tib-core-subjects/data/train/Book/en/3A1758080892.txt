Principles of cement and concrete composites
Chapter 1. Introduction to the Principles of Cement and Concrete Composites -- Chapter 2. Principles of Quantum-Scaled Cement -- Chapter 3. Principles of Low Carbon Cement -- Chapter 4. Principles of Fiber-reinforced Concrete -- Chapter 5. Principles of Reactive Powder Concrete -- Chapter 6. Principles of Tailor-made Recycled Aggregate Concrete.
This book presents an introduction, a discussion of the concept of the design and the concreteâ€™s development, and the properties and testing of the concrete in fresh and hardened stages. After an introduction to the principles of cement and concrete composites, the reader will find information on the principles of quantum-scaled cement, low-carbon cement, fiber-reinforced concrete, reactive powder concrete, and tailor-made recycled aggregate concrete.
