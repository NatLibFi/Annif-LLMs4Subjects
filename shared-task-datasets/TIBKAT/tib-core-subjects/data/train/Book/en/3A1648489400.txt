Vinegars of the World
The importance of vinegars goes far beyond their merely economic aspect: they are in fact the result of environmental resources and culture, of tradition and science. The origin of vinegar is lost in the dawn of human history, together with the beginning of agriculture and the discovery of alcoholic fermentation of fruits, cereals and vegetables. This book, written by experts and scientists working in the field and enriched by several images and tables, clearly describes some of the main types of vinegar produced in the world in their peculiar aspects. In particular, vinegar technology and microbiology are dealt with extensively. The nomenclature of the microorganisms involved has been updated according to the current taxonomy.
