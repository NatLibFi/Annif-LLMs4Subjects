Reciprocity, evolution, and decision games in network and data science
"Learn how to analyze and manage evolutionary and sequential user behaviors in modern networks, and how to optimize network performance by using indirect reciprocity, evolutionary games, and sequential decision-making. Understand the latest theory without the need to go through the details of traditional game theory. With practical management tools to regulate user behavior and simulations and experiments with real data sets, this is an ideal tool for graduate students and researchers working in networking, communications, and signal processing"--
