Microplastics : analytical challenges and environmental impacts
"This book introduces the growing problem of microplastics pollution in the soil and aquatic environment and its interaction with other chemical pollutants. Further, it provides a detailed review of existing analysis techniques for characterization, separation, and quantification of microplastics including their merits and demerits with possible suggestions. Additionally, the regulatory need and actions for improving the economic and quality of plastic recycling, curbing microplastic littering, and stakeholders, researchers, and recyclers challenges are reviewed comprehensively. Priorities are identified to bridge the knowledge gaps for appropriate management of existing challenges. Features: Provides a comprehensive description of the fate and environmental impact of microplastics, along with various characterization methods Overviews the interaction of microplastics with other toxic chemicals and further their transportation in environment Explains how microplastics enter in environment and its effect on biota and human health Analyses existing analytical techniques for characterization of microplastics Describes societal awareness related to use of plastic and discarding This book focusses on graduate students, researchers in environmental engineering, ecological engineering, chemical and biological engineering, plastics and material sciences/engineering, waste management. materials science"--
