The Chemistry of the Actinide and Transactinide Elements
&quot;The Chemistry of the Actinide and Transactinide Elements&quot; is a contemporary and definitive compilation of chemical properties of all of the actinide elements, especially of the technologically important elements uranium and plutonium, as well as the transactinide elements. In addition to the comprehensive treatment of the chemical properties of each element, ion, and compound from atomic number 89 (actinium) through to 109 (meitnerium), this multi-volume work has specialized and definitive chapters on electronic theory, optical and laser fluorescence spectroscopy, X-ray absorption s
