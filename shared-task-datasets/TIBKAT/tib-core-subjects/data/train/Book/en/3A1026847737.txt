Nanochemistry, Biotechnology, Nanomaterials, and Their Applications : Selected Proceedings of the 5th International Conference Nanotechnology and Nanomaterials (NANO2017), August 23-26, 2017, Chernivtsi, Ukraine
This book presents some of the latest achievements in nanotechnology and nanomaterials from leading researchers in Ukraine, Europe, and beyond. It features selected peer-reviewed contributions from participants in the 5th International Science and Practice Conference Nanotechnology and Nanomaterials (NANO2017) held in Chernivtsi, Ukraine on August 23-26, 2017. The International Conference was organized jointly by the Institute of Physics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Ivan Franko National University of Lviv (Ukraine), University of Tartu (Estonia), University of Turin (Italy), and Pierre and Marie Curie University (France). Internationally recognized experts from a wide range of universities and research institutions share their knowledge and key results on topics ranging from energy storage to biomedical applications. This book's companion volume also addresses nanooptics, nanoplasmonics, and interface studies
