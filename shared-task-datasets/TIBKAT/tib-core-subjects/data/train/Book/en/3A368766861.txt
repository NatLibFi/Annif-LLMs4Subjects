DVB : the family of international standards for digital video broadcasting
The Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB) is an industry- led consortium of over 300 broadcasters, manufacturers, network operators, software developers, regulatory bodies and others in over 40 countries committed to designing global standards for the delivery of digital television and data services. Ulrich Reimers is the chairman of its Technical Module and is therefore able to provide up-to-date insider information. This second edition of the book was revised and substantially extended by a new team of authors led by Professor Reimers. New chapters include Data Broadcasting, Solutions for Interactive Services, and the promising Multimedia Home Platform (MHP). Substantially revised are those on MPEG-2 systems and multiplexing, the standard for terrestrial transmission and its decoding technique, and the first chapter, the introduction to the DVB world.
