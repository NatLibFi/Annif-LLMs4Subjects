Silica optical fiber technology for devices and components : design, fabrication, and international standards
"This book deals with current issues in optical fiber design, fabrication and applications in optical devices and components. Unlike existing book which are focused on individual device technologies the proposed book will provide a comprehensive and concurrent discussion of optical fiber technology that can then be applied to individual fiber devices"--
"As the emphasis in optical fiber research expands from transmission media to functional fiber devices, various types of specialty optical fibers are being actively developed. Especially in dense wavelength multiplexing (DWDM) systems, novel functions such as fiber filters, fiber MUX/DEMUX, fiber amplifiers, among others, are constantly needed and supplied by specialty fibers. Until recently, optical fibers were treated as passive transmission media with very little attention given to these novel fiber technologies"--
