Aerothermodynamics and jet propulsion
"This textbook was developed from the course notes put together for the second-semester junior class, Aerothermodynamics and Propulsion, taught at Texas A&M University. This class is followed by two senior courses: Aerospace Propulsion, a jet engine design class, and Rocket Propulsion, a rocket engine design class. Although this textbook was not conceived for these design courses, it provides essential foundational knowledge for design. Fundamentally, the purpose of the book is to enhance the aerodynamics and thermodynamics background of students, and to enable them to apply this knowledge to understanding jet propulsion"--
