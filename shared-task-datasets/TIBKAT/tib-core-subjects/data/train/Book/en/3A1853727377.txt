Heavy metal toxicity and tolerance in plants : a biological, omics, and genetic engineering approach
"This book will provide a comprehensive overview of the physiological, biochemical and molecular basis of heavy metal tolerance and functional omics that will allow for a deeper understanding of using heavy metal tolerance for deliberate manipulation of plants to increase tolerance to heavy metal toxicity/deficiency, crop quality improvement as well as phytoremediation. This book will help researchers to develop strategies to enhance metal toxicity/deficiency tolerance as well as crop productivity under stressful conditions and to better utilize natural resources to ensure future food security and be a valuable reference for researchers working on developing plants tolerant to metal stress and effective strategies for reducing the risk of health hazards"--
