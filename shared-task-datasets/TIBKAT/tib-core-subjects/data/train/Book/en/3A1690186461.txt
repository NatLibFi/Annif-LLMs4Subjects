Marine composites : design and performance
Marine Composites: Design and Performance presents up-to-date information and recent research findings on the application and use of advanced fibre-reinforced composites in the marine environment. Following the success of their previously published title: Marine Applications of Advanced Fibre-reinforced Composites which was published in 2015; this exemplary new book provides comprehensive information on materials selection, characterization, and performance. There are also dedicated sections on sandwich structures, manufacture, advanced concepts, naval architecture and design considerations, and various applications. The book will be an essential reference resource for designers, materials engineers, manufactures, marine scientists, mechanical engineers, civil engineers, coastal engineers, boat manufacturers, offshore platform and marine renewable design engineers
