The crust-mantle and lithosphere-asthenosphere boundaries : insights from xenoliths, orogenic deep sections, and geophysical studies
"This volume encompasses contributions from a wide spectrum of earth science disciplines, including geophysics, geodynamics, geochemistry, and petrology, to provide an overview of the nature and evolution of the crust-mantle and lithosphere-asthenosphere boundaries in different tectonic settings"--
