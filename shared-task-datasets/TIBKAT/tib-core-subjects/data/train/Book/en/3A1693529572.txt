Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate statistics using R : quantitative tools for data analysis and data science
"This book provides a user-friendly and practical guide on R, with emphasis on covering a broader range of statistical methods than previous books on R. This is a "how to" book and will be of use to undergraduates and graduate students along with researchers and professionals who require a quick go-to source to help them perform essential statistical analyses and data management tasks in R. The book only assumes minimal prior knowledge of statistics, providing readers with the tools they need right now to help them understand and interpret their data analyses. This book covers univariate, bivariate, and multivariate statistical methods, as well as some nonparametric tests. It provides students with a hands-on easy-to-read manual on the wealth of applied statistics and essential R computing that they will need for their theses, dissertations, and research publications. A strength of this book is its scope of coverage of univariate through to multivariate procedures, while simultaneously serving as a friendly introduction to R software"--
