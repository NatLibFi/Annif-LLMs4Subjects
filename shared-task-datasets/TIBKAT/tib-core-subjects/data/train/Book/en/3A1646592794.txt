Introduction to Nanoscale Science and Technology
Nanoscale science and technology is a young, promising field that encompasses a wide range of disciplines including physics, chemistry, biology, electrical engineering, chemical engineering, and materials science. With rapid advances in areas such as molecular electronics, synthetic biomolecular motors, DNA-based self-assembly, and manipulation of individual atoms, nanotechnology has captured the attention and imagination of researchers and the general public. "Introduction to Nanoscale Science and Technology" provides a broad and thorough introduction that is aimed specifically at undergraduate seniors and early graduate students in all of the disciplines enumerated above.   It will also be of value to academic, industrial, and government researchers interested in a primer in the field. The book consists of twenty-three chapters arranged in seven sections. All chapters have been written by experts from each respective field. Exercises and general references are provided at the end of each chapter to encourage students to expand on the topics discussed in the book. A CD-ROM containing color copies of all figures accompanies the book, allowing rapid preparation of lecture materials by faculty.
