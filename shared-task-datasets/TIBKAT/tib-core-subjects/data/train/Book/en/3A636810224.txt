Handbook of sinc numerical methods
"This handbook is essential for solving numerical problems in mathematics, computer science, and engineering. The methods presented are similar to finite elements but more adept at solving analytic problems with singularities over irregularly shaped yet analytically described regions. The author makes sinc methods accessible to potential users by limiting details as to how or why these methods work. From calculus to partial differential and integral equations, the book can be used to approximate almost every type of operation. It includes more than 470 MATLABÊ¼ programs, along with a CD-ROM containing these programs for ease of use"--
