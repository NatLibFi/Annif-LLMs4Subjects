Digital and Analogue Instrumentation : testing and measurement
The attempt in this book is to provide a broad approach to "understanding complete instrument systems and appreciating their internal designs" embracing many digital circuit blocks coupled with the mixed signal circuitry in instrumentation systems. In this work a large amount of published material from US industry and academia has been used. In Chapter 1 a descriptive introduction of various parameters of instrumentation are provided. Chapter 2 discusses various technologies of instrumentation. Chapter 3 is an introduction of data converters Fluke Corporation of USA and their Wavetek Instruments Division. Much of the material in Chapters 4 is on Waveforms, Pulse Techniques and Multimeters. Chapter 8 is on Signal Sources and Arbitrary Waveform Generators. Chapter 15 is on calibration of instrument. Analog Devices, Inc., and IEEE for information were source for Chapter 13 on Digital Signal Processors. FiS Corporation, Japan is the information source for modern semiconductor sensors in Chapter 14. Chapter 5 elaborates oscilloscopes. Chapters 6 is on development in DSO technique, and Chapter 9 is on spectrum analysers. Chapter 7 deals with electronic counter. Logic analyser are discussed in Chapter 10. Chapter 11 includes instrument buses and VLSI testing. Transmission measurements are discussed in the Chapter 12
