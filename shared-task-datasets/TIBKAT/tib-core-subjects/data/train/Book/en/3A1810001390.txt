Global food safety : microbial interventions and molecular advancements
"Foodborne microbial outbreaks are a serious food safety and public health concern worldwide. One of the most challenging issues in food safety is the identification and characterization of foodborne microbial communities, which is a core objective of research by food scientists and food microbiologists. This book reviews the molecular advances in food science related to the safety and quality of food along with recent diagnostic tools for the detection of emerging pathogens based on the food commodities. It presents a wide selection of methods for the identification and characterization of foodborne infectious agents. The volume provides an overview of foodborne pathogens, diseases, and outbreaks and then proceeds to delve into techniques for characterizing foodborne pathogens using molecular approaches. It reviews state-of-the-art methods for detecting and tracing foodborne pathogens using next-generation sequencing and whole-genome sequencing for controlling foodborne illnesses as well as the application of microorganisms in food production for preventing foodborne illnesses. The volume ends with a chapter that provides an overview of management systems and analytical tools for public health protection from foodborne illnesses. Key features: Reviews the detection of foodborne pathogens using recently developed molecular technologies Provides deep insights into the fundamental and functional aspects of microbial interventions in food science Addresses current challenges for the management of food safety Includes updated studies on microbial safety for processed food items Discusses advanced management systems for foodborne pathogens This book will be an important reference source for food scientists and food safety supervisors from production to processing and from transport to retail. This book will also be vital source for teachers, students, and researchers for exploring recent developments for food safety by employing advanced microbial and molecular methods"--
