Spinning Particles - Semiclassics and Spectral Statistics
The book deals with semiclassical methods for systems with spin, in particular methods involving trace formulae and torus quantisation and their applications in the theory of quantum chaos, e.g. the characterisation of spectral correlations. The theoretical tools developed here not only have immediate applications in the theory of quantum chaos - which is the second focus of the book - but also in atomic and mesoscopic physics. Thus the intuitive understanding of semiclassical spin dynamics will also be helpful in emerging subjects like spintronics and quantum computation
