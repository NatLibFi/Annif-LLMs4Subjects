Automating with STEP 7 in STL and SCL : programmable controllers SIMATIC S7-300/400
SIMATIC is the worldwide established automation system for implementing industrial control systems for machines, manufacturing plants and industrial processes. Relevant open-loop and closed-loop control tasks are formulated in various programming languages with the programming software STEP 7. Now in its third edition, this book introduces Version 5.3 of the programming software STEP 7. It describes elements and applications of the text-oriented programming languages STL (statement list) and SCL (structured control language) for use with both SIMATIC S7-300 and SIMATIC S7-400. It is aimed at all users of SIMATIC S7 controllers. First-time users are introduced to the field of programmable controllers, while advanced users learn about specific applications of the SIMATIC S7 automation system. The accompanying disk contains all programming examples found in the book - and even a few extra examples - as archived block libraries . After retrieving the archives in STEP 7, the examples can be viewed, copied to projects and tested in STL and SCL
