Handbook of differential equations : Volume 3. stationary partial differential equations
This handbook is volume III in a series devoted to stationary partial differential quations. Similarly as volumes I and II, it is a collection of self contained state-of-the-art surveys written by well known experts in the field. The topics covered by this handbook include singular and higher order equations, problems near critically, problems with anisotropic nonlinearities, dam problem, T-convergence and Schauder-type estimates. These surveys will be useful for both beginners and experts and speed up the progress of corresponding (rapidly developing and fascinating) areas of mathematics. Key features: - Written by well-known experts in the field - Self-contained volume in series covering one of the most rapid developing topics in mathematics - Written by well-known experts in the field - Self-contained volume in series covering one of the most rapid developing topics in mathematics
