Strength and stiffness of engineering systems
"Strength and Stiffness of Engineering Systems is a modern version of classical strength of materials information adapted to meet the needs of developing technology with its emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches. Subjects such as plasticity, fracture, composite materials, energy approaches and mechanics of micro devices (MEMS) are integrated into a unified text. In this way, the slow build-up of traditional programs is replaced by a consolidated approach which includes the fundamentals needed for understanding and developing modern technology." "Strength and Stiffness of Engineering Systems is appropriate for both an introductory Strength of Materials course and as a continuing text for both advanced undergraduate and graduate courses. It can also be used as a resource for professional engineers interested in the development of new products."--BOOK JACKET
