Explosion vented equipment system protection guide
"The U.S. Chemical Safety Board reports 316 dust explosions over the last 30 years that caused 145 workers killed and 846 injured with extensive damage to facilities. Fines by OSHA have totaled more than $100,000,000. According to the independent 2019 (mid-year) combustible dust incident report from Dustex Research, Ltd, there were 80 dust related fires, 19 dust related explosions, 72 injuries and one fatality in the U.S. from January through July 2019. There are more than 130,000 establishments in the U.S., many with more than one facility, with many dust collection systems per facility. The new National Fire Protection Agency directive, NFPA 652, "Standard on the Fundamentals of Combustible Dust", requires all facilities to complete a DHA (Dust Hazard Analysis) by September 2020. Required is a systematic review to identify and evaluate potential dust fire, flash fire and explosion hazards in a process or facility where combustible or explosive material is handled or processed. The result of these analyses will disclose dust collection systems that present a risk of catastrophic failure that will require mitigation. Most facilities do not have a licensed structural engineer or stress analyst on staff that has the experience to perform the analysis to make the equipment safe. This book provides the information required to mitigate equipment, facilities and personnel at risk"--
