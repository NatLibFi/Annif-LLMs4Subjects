Electromagnetic fields of wireless communications : biological and health effects
"This book reflects contributions from experts in biological and health effects of radio frequency (RF), microwave electromagnetic fields (EMFs) and radiations (300 kHz-300 GHz). Diverse topics related to physics, biology, pathology, epidemiology, and plausible biophysical and biochemical mechanisms of microwave telecommunication EMFs, emitted by antennas, and devices are included. Discussions on the possible consequences of 5G MT EMFs based on available data and pertinent correlation between EMF exposure and viral diseases are also covered. It further illustrates individual and public health protection and setting of biologically and epidemiologically based exposure limits. Features: Covers biological and health effects including oxidative stress, DNA damage, reproductive effects of mobile phones/antennas (2G, 3G, 4G), cordless phones and Wi-Fi. Describes effects induced by real-life exposures by commercially available devices/antennas. Illustrates biophysical and biochemical mechanisms aiming to fill the gap between recorded experimental and epidemiological findings, and their explanations. Explore experimental and epidemiological facts, mechanisms of action, explanations, and protection tips. Transcends across physics, biological, chemical, health, epidemiological, and environmental aspects of topic. This book aims at Senior undergraduate/Graduate students in Biomedical Engineering, Bioengineering and Electromagnetics, Biophysics, Dosimetry, Electromagnetic Biology, Non-Ionizing Radiation Biophysics, and Microwave Communications"--
