This book summarizes naturally occurring and designed bio-inspired molecular building blocks assembled into nanoscale structures. It covers a fascinating array of biomimetic and bioinspired materials, including inorganic nanozymes, structures formed by DNA origami, a wide range of peptide and protein-based nanomaterials, as well as their applications in diagnostics and therapeutics. The book elucidates the mechanism of assembly of these materials and characterisation of their mechanical and physico-chemical properties which inspires readers not only to exploit the potential applications of nanomaterials, but also to understand their potential risks and benefits. It will be of interest to a broad audience of students and researchers spanning the disciplines of biology, chemistry, engineering, materials science, and physics
