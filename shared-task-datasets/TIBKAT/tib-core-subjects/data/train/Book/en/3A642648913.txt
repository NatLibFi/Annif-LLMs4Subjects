Carbon dioxide thermodynamic properties handbook : covering temperatures from -20° to 250° C and pressures up to 1000 bar
"The largest and most comprehensive collection of thermodynamic data on carbon dioxide ever produced, this volume is now the ONLY book of its kind in print.  With carbon dioxide sequestration gaining in popularity around the world in the scientific and engineering communities, having this data in an easy-to-access format is more useful and timely than ever.  With data that is accurate down to within a fraction of a degree, this handbook offers, in one volume, literally thousands of data points that any engineer or chemist would need when dealing with carbon dioxide.  Not available in other formats, these easy-to-read tables are at your fingertips and are accessed within seconds and does away with the need for constantly working with mathematical formulas.  Carbon dioxide is used in many fields, across many industries, including the oil and gas industry and food processing.  Even coffee is decaffeinated using carbon dioxide!  Though CO2 has many uses in industry, it is also one of the most offensive of the greenhouse gases, on which many scientists and engineers are working to eradicate in the future production of power and fuel"--
