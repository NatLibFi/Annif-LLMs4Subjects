Handbook of differential equations
"Through the previous three editions, Handbook of Differential Equations has proven an invaluable reference for anyone working within the field of mathematics, including academics, students, scientists, and professional engineers. The book is a compilation of methods for solving and approximating differential equations. These include the most widely applicable methods for solving and approximating differential equations, as well as numerous methods. Topics include methods for ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, stochastic differential equations, and systems of such equations. Included for nearly every method are: The types of equations to which the method is applicable The idea behind the method The procedure for carrying out the method At least one simple example of the method Any cautions that should be exercised Notes for more advanced users The fourth edition includes corrections, many supplied by readers, as well as many new methods and techniques. These new and corrected entries make necessary improvements in this edition"--
