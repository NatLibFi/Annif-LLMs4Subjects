Swarm intelligence and machine learning : applications in healthcare
"The purpose of this book is to give a broader view of swarm intelligence and machine learning techniques in the field of healthcare. Moreover, this book would help future research be done in the area of healthcare. It also explores the recent progress in several computing technologies and evaluates the performance based on today's betterment compared to previous development in the technology. This book also helps for diagnosis of various health care diseases in optimized way by applying machine learning techniques along with swarm intelligence techniques. This will improve the efficiency and also reduce the overhead for the detection of health diseases. This book starts with an overview of the swarm intelligence and machine learning techniques in healthcare field. It is also brief about the diagnosis of several diseases such as cancer disease, heart disease, brain tumor, skin cancer, etc. This book would also present the detailed survey and case studies for current trends in the field of healthcare"--
