Nonstandard Analysis in Practice
The purpose of this book is to provide an effective introduction to nonstandard methods. A short tutorial giving the necessary background, is followed by applications to various domains, independent from each other. These include complex dynamical systems, stochastic differential equations, smooth and algebraic curves, measure theory, the external calculus, with some applications to probability. The authors have been using Nonstandard Analysis for many years in their research. They all belong to the growing nonstandard school founded by G. Reeb, which is attracting international and interdisciplinary interest
