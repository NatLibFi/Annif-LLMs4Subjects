Microbiology of green fuels
"A key priority in today's society is the implementation of a sustainable bio-based economy. For such a goal, the production of renewable bioproducts such as biofuels to replace fossil-derived compounds is crucial. In this context, the utilization of microorganisms for the production of biofuels from renewable resources is advantageous in terms of environmental sustainability and it is expected to play an important role in bioeconomy in the near future. In this sense, green fuel synthesis from agro-industrial organic wastes by microorganisms will boost circular economy. The success of the biotechnological biofuel production process requires, however, conversion microorganism capable of both efficiently assimilating the major derived carbon sources and diverting their metabolites towards the specific fuel. This book aims to show recent advances in the production of green fuels by means of microorganisms. Promising processes and microorganisms involved in the biofuel production will be provided and discussed to give and in-depth overview of the state of the art with broad spectrum of microorganisms and biofuels. For the sustainability of green fuel technologies, the book will also address biosafety of different production technologies and, social and political interest in promoting green fuels. These facts make this book very valuable for biofuels companies and scientific community"--
