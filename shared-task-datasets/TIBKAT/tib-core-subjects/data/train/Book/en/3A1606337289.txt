Computational intelligence and pattern analysis in biological informatics
"Computational Intelligence (CI) is a successor of artificial intelligence combining elements of learning, adaptation, evolution and logic to create programs that are, in some sense, intelligent. CI exhibits an ability to learn or deal with new situations, such that the system is perceived to possess one or more attributes of reason. The different methodologies in CI work synergistically and provide, in one form or another, flexible information processing capabilities for handling a huge volume of real life data with noises, ambiguity, and missing values. Solving problems often involves search for useful regularities or patterns in large amounts of data. A typical characteristic of biological data is high dimensionality with low sample size. This poses grand challenges to traditional pattern analysis techniques, necessitating the development of sophisticated approaches--Provided by publisher
