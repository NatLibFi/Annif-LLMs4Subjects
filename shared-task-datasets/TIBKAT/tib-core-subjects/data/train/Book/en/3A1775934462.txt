Structural mechanics : analytical and numerical approaches for structural analysis
"This book covers both standard and advanced topics of structural mechanics. Subjects covered include geometric stability, displacement of structures, force and displacement method, and influence line. Advanced topics include finite element method for structural analysis, dynamics of structures, limit loading and structural stability. The book serves both as a classroom text book and as a permanent engineering reference. It is written in such a way that it can be followed by anyone with a basic knowledge of classical and material mechanics. As book authors come from both academia and industry, this book places a special focus on linking the gap between the theory and engineering practice"
