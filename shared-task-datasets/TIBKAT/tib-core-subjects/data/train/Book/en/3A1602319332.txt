Frank Havermans : Architectonische constructies
There is growing national and international interest in the work of Frank Havermans (b. Breda, 1967). He constructs complex spatial structures using simple means, without the intervention of an engineer or building contractor. His work stems from a combined fascination with architectonic space and architectural structure. Alongside this fascination, materiality and the production process play prominent roles in his work. His sphere of activity embraces the whole spectrum of architecture, from furniture and interior to installations, buildings and large-scale urbanism
