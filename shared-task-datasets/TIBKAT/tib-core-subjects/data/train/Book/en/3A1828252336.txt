The abundant promise of ultrasound in neurosurgery : a broad overview and thoughts on ethical paths to realizing its benefits
This book is written for clinicians and engineers looking to learn about the new and exciting uses of ultrasound. Because it focuses on applications of ultrasound specifically for neurosurgery, the book addresses some of the reasons the use of ultrasound in neurosurgery has been slow compared to other fields of medicine (for example, cardiology, orthopedics, etc.). While review papers and books on similar topics have been published, these are not fully comprehensive nor up to date on all of the potential applications of ultrasound in neurosurgery. Our hope is to provide researchers within the field a new title that will expand their understanding of the burgeoning field of ultrasound in neurosurgery.
