Interferometry in Speckle Light : Theory and Applications
This Proceedings comprises the written counterparts of 80 presentations - invited, contributed and poster - given during an international conference held in Lausanne, Switzerland, September 25 - 28, 2000. It includes, in well-balanced proportions and with equal emphasis on theoretical and applied developments, review works and original research done by leading scientists in the domains of speckle phenomena, speckle photography, holographic interferometry, speckle interferometry, interferometric signals and fringe patterns processing, and commonly related techniques. These domains form the subject of the six chapters of the book. The optical properties of speckle waves strongly influence most of the methods scrutinised and serve as an intrinsic link between the chapters
