Fermentation processes : emerging and conventional technologies
"Fermentation Processes: Emerging and Conventional Technologies will focus on enhancing fermentation processes under conventional and non conventional conditions. The application of emerging technologies (e.g. ultrasounds, high voltage electrical discharges, microwaves, etc) to increase the accessibility and bioavailability of the substrates by microorganisms during fermentation has been demonstrated through numerous research works. These technologies have the advantages over conventional ones (i.e. grinding) of consuming less energy, reducing the processing time, along with using less and "green" solvents. Increasing the accessibility of the substrates has, as a consequence, an improved availability for the microorganisms and therefore enhanced productivity. The application of these non-conventional (emerging) technologies could be at sublethal levels prior (inoculum) or during the fermentation process, also called microbial stimulation, which increases the assimilation of substrates, release of enzymes in the medium for substrate hydrolysis, and other benefits. All together, lead to promote the microbial growth, and enhance the fermentation process. In addition to the application of emerging technologies, enhancing fermentation at conventional conditions by changing the medium composition, processing parameters, etc. will be also discussed. The topics covered include: * The application of emerging technologies to enhance the substrate accessibility for fermentation processes. * The enhancement of fermentation processes (food and biotechnological applications) by microbial stimulation using emerging technologies. * Development of new fermented products assisted by innovative processing * Consumer perception and commercial perspectives * Scale-up and implementation of innovative fermentation processes."--
