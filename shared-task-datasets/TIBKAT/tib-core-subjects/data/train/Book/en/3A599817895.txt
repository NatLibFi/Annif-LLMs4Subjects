Handbook of synthetic photochemistry
"Unique in its focus on preparative impact rather than mechanistic details, this handbook provides an overview of photochemical reactions classed according to the structural feature that is built in the photochemical step, so as to facilitate use by synthetic chemists unfamiliar with this topic. An introductory section covers practical questions on how to run a photochemical reaction, while all classes of the most important photocatalytic reactions are also included. Perfect for organic synthetic chemists in academia and industry"--P. [4] of cover
