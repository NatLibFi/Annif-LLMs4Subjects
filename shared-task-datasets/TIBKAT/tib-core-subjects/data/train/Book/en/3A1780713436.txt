Equations and analytical tools in mathematical physics : a concise introduction
This book highlights a concise and readable introduction to typical treatments of partial differential equations in mathematical physics. Mathematical physics is regarded by many as a profound discipline. In conventional textbooks of mathematical physics, the known and the new pieces of knowledge often intertwine with each other. The book aims to ease readers' struggle by facilitating a smooth transition to new knowledge. To achieve so, the author designs knowledge maps before each chapter and provides comparative summaries in each chapter whenever appropriate. Through these unique ways, readers can clarify the underlying structures among different equations and extend one's vision to the big picture. The book also emphasizes applications of the knowledge by providing practical examples. The book is intended for all those interested in mathematical physics, enabling them to develop a solid command in using partial differential equations to solve physics and engineering problems in a not-so-painful learning experience.
