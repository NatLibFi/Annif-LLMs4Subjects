German history unbound : from 1750 to the present
"A polycentric German history that pointedly decenters the nation-state.  It includes communities of Germans far beyond its borders, and it emphasizes that for generations many who considered themselves to be German also felt themselves to be other things. Taking up a decidedly counter-hegemonic position, Glenn calls for a greater integration of mobilities, migration flows, and pluralities of belonging into our narratives of Germans' histories. He also argues for greater attention to the transcultural spaces many Germans helped to fashion and the various networks that tied them together."--
