Applications of small unmanned aircraft systems : best practices and case studies
"Advances in high spatial resolution mapping capabilities and the new rules established by the Federal Aviation Administration for the operation of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems have provided new opportunities to acquire aerial data at a lower cost and more safely versus other methods. Also, sUAS can access hazardous or inaccessible areas during disaster events and provide rapid response when needed. This is the first book that brings together the best practices of sUAS applied to a broad range of issues in high spatial resolution mapping projects. The case studies included in this book will help readers understand and develop sUAS based projects"--
