50 and more essential NMR experiments : a detailed guide
Retaining the excellent didactic style found in his previous bestselling works, Professor Berger has written this textbook for true beginners.  He highlights around 50 of the most important experiments and explains them step-by-step, backed by questions and answers for easier learning.  The result is the universal NMR cookbook: The descriptions are not instrument-specific and can be used on all NMR spectrometers, perfectly illustrating how to perform the experiments after only having studied the theory.  The whole book is in full color, which enhances the reading experience and makes the spectra and other figures easier to understand.   Stefan Berger studied at the University of TÃ¼bingen (Germany), where he also received his PhD degree with Prof. Anton Rieker. He was a postdoctoral fellow with Prof. J. D. Roberts at California Institute of Technology (USA). He completed his habilitation in NMR spectroscopy at the University of Marburg (Germany). Since 1997 he is Professor of Structural Analysis at the University of Leipzig, where his research interests focus on methodological development of NMR and its  application to bioorganic problems. Dr. Matthias Findeisen is a researcher at the University of Leipzig, where he works together with Prof. Berger. He has extensive experience in NMR spectroscopy, including problem solving as well as technical and methodological developments.
