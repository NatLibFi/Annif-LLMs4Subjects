The Routledge handbook of environmental movements
"This handbook provides readers with up-to-date knowledge on environmental movements, activism, and is a reference point for international work in the field. It offers an assessment of environmental movements in different regions of the world, macrostructural conditions and processes underlying their mobilization, the microstructural and social-psychological dimensions of environmental movements and activism, current trends as well as prospects for environmental movements and social change. The handbook is an essential guide and reference point not only for researchers but also for undergraduate and graduate teaching and for policymakers and activists"--
