Digital terrain analysis in soil science and geology
"This book is the first attempt to synthesize knowledge on theory, methods, and applications of digital terrain analysis in the context of multiscale problems of soil science and geology. The content of the book is based on long-standing, interdisciplinary research of the author. The book is addressed to geomorphometrists, soil scientists, geologists, geoscientists, geomorphologists, geographers, and GIS scientists (at scholar, lecturer, and postgraduate student levels, with mathematical skills). This book is also intended for the GIS professionals in industry and research laboratories focusing on geoscientific and soil research. The book is divided into three parts. Part I represents main concepts, principles, and methods of digital terrain modeling. Part II discusses various aspects of the use of digital terrain analysis in soil science. Part III looks at applications of digital terrain modeling in geology"--
