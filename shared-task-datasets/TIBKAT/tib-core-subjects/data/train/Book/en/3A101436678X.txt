This book undertakes a philosophical examination of a number of important quantitative research methods in the behavioral sciences, in order to overcome the shallow and uncritical understanding that is typically provided by textbooks. The methods are: exploratory data analysis, statistical significance testing, Bayesian confirmation theory and statistics, meta-analysis, and exploratory factor analysis. Further readings are provided to extend the readers' understanding.
