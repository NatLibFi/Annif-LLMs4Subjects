The handbook of environmental chemistry / series editors: Damià Barceló, Andrey G. Kostianoy ; volume 114: Emerging pollutants in sewage sludge and soils
"This book provides an authoritative overview of emerging pollutants in sewage sludge and soils. It traces the latest research and new trends on the characterization, removal and treatment of such pollutants in urban and industrial sewage sludge and soils. The book covers topics such as antibiotic resistance, fate and environmental impact of contaminants of emerging concern, environmental transmission of human pathogenic viruses and their effect on soil, and the repercussion of various emerging pollutants on biodiversity. It also offers a case study of the epidemiology-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and sludge. The book appeals not only to researchers and professionals working with emerging contaminants, but also to policy makers and a broader audience interested in learning more about the effects of these contaminants in human and environmental health."--
