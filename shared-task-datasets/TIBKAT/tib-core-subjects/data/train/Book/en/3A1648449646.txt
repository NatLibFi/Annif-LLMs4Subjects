Approximate Commutative Algebra is an emerging field of research which endeavours to bridge the gap between traditional exact Computational Commutative Algebra and approximate numerical computation. The last 50 years have seen enormous progress in the realm of exact Computational Commutative Algebra, and given the importance of polynomials in scientific modelling, it is very natural to want to extend these ideas to handle approximate, empirical data deriving from physical measurements of phenomena in the real world. In this volume nine contributions from established researchers describe various approaches to tackling a variety of problems arising in Approximate Commutative Algebra.
