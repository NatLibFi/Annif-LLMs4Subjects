Photogeomorphology and landscape change : photographic approaches in field-based landscape studies
The contributions in this supplement volume examine the application of photography as a straight-forward, but powerful tool to track landscape change by capturing cross-temporal and cross-scalar images. The papers in this special issue mainly portray remote, off-road destinations, where reconnaissance was carried out by various technological means or by fieldwork in diverse landscapes. Most of the articles address identifying landscape-scale change, and a few of them landform-specific processes. The introductory paper briefly summarizes the development of this subdiscipline, and provides an overview of potential advantages and disadvantages of repeat photographic (rephotographic) deployment within the discipline of geomorphology. The papers thereafter consider a variety of landscapes, ranging from remote glaciated to urban environments. Additionally, a variety of scales and vantage points have been incorporated in this research compared with more traditional studies that in the past have been predominantly focused on large areas and solely made use of aerial imagery. The focus in this special issue rests on terrestrial (digital) photography as an addition to more traditional and innovative (aerial) remote sensing efforts. Both natural and urban settings are represented, and both single photographic as well as rephotographic methodologies are included, as are images recorded by UAVs and automated digital cameras. This special issue comprises original research papers as well as review papers and case studies that have been processed since 2014, with an emphasis on quantitative empirical research. It addresses not only researchers working in the field of remote sensing, but is also of interest for all geomorphologists working in the fields of exploration and landform changes
