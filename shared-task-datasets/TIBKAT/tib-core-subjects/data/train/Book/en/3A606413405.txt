Promoting consumer education : trends, policies and good practices
Consumers today are challenged by growing amounts of information and wider choices of products, requiring them to develop skills and knowledge for making good choices in complex markets. This publication examines the approaches that governments use to promote consumer education in OECD and some non-OECD countries, highlighting the policies and measures that have been particularly effective. It also analyzes recent trends, the role of stakeholders, steps being taken to evaluate the effectiveness of current programs and the principal challenges.--Publisher's description
