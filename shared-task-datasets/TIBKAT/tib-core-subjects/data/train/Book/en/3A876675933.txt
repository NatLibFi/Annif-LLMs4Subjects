Mathematical foundations for electromagnetic theory
Linear analysis -- The Green's function method -- The spectral representation method -- Electromagnetic sources -- Electromagnetic boundary value problems
Co-published with Oxford University Press. This highly technical and thought-provoking book stresses the development of mathematical foundations for the application of the electromagnetic model to problems of research and technology. Features include in-depth coverage of linear spaces, Green's functions, spectral expansions, electromagnetic source representations, and electromagnetic boundary value problems. This book will be of interest graduate-level students in engineering, electromagnetics, physics, and applied mathematics as well as to research engineers, physicists, and scientists
