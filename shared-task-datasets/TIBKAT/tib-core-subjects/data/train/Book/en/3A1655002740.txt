Solving Problems in Scientific Computing Using Maple and MATLABÂ®
From the reviews of previous editions: ". An excellent reference on undergraduate mathematical computing." American Mathematical Monthly ".. manuals for such systems (Maple and MATLAB) tend to use trivial examples, making it difficult for new users of such systems to quickly apply their power to real problems. The authors have written a good book to address this need. .. the book is worth buying if you want guidance in applying Maple and MATLAB to problems in the workplace.." Computing Reviews ". The presentation is unique, and extremely interesting. I was thrilled to read this text, and to learn the powerful problem-solving skills presented by these authors. I recommend the text highly, as a learning experience, not only to engineering students, but also to anyone interested in computation." Mathematics of Computation For this fourth edition four new chapters have been added. Some of the chapters of the previous editions were revised using new possibilities offered by Maple and Matlab. In addition, some important and interesting web pages related to Maple and Matlab have been added in an appendix. Moreover, the editors have created a web page for the book (www.SolvingProblems.inf.ethz.ch), where all Maple and Matlab programs will be available
