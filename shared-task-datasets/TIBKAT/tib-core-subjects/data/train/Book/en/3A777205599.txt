Architecture and armed conflict : the politics of destruction
"Bringing together specialists from a range of relevant fields and drawing on a range of global case studies, this book provides the first synthetic body of research on the complex, multifaceted subject of architectural destruction in the context of conflict. Situated in a strong framework, the book addresses several key questions:How has the targeted destruction of buildings and landscapes been used as a deliberate technique of war, conquest, or armed liberation in recent conflicts? How have individuals, cultures, and states responded to the deliberate and collateral destruction of architecture? How have individuals, institutions, and states represented architectural destruction, and to what ends? What are the relationships between the destruction of architecture and the destruction of art, particularly iconoclasm? Does armed conflict engender further processes of architectural destruction that persist in post-conflict environments? What are the relationships between architectural destruction and processes of restoration, recreation or replacement? Considering multiple conflicts, multiple time periods, and multiple locations, this collection provides an essential primer for this crucial topic. "--
