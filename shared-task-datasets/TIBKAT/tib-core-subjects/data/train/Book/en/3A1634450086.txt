Walter Greiner memorial volume
"Walter Greiner (1935-2016) was a German physicist of the Goethe University, Frankfurt, well-known for his many contributions in scientific research and developments, in particular the field of nuclear physics. He was a well-respected science leader and a teacher who had supervised batches of young collaborators and students, many of whom are now leaders in both academics and industry worldwide. Greiner had a wide interest of science which covered atomic physics, heavy-ion physics, and nuclear astrophysics. Greiner co-founded GSI, the Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, and the multi-disciplinary research center, FIAS (Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies). Besides numerous professorship with universities worldwide, including the University of Maryland, Greiner received many prestigious prizes in honor of his outstanding contributions, among others are the Otto Hahn Prize and the Max Born Prize. This memorial volume is a special tribute by Greiner's former colleagues, students, and friends honoring his contributions and passion in science. The volume begins with a writing by Greiner about his early days in science. The subsequent articles, comprising personal and scientific reminiscences of Walter Greiner, serve as timely reviews on various topics of current interest"--
