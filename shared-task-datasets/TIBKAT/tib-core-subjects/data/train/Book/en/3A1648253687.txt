Weak Links : The Universal Key to the Stability of Networks and Complex Systems
How can our societies be stabilized in a crisis? Why can we enjoy and understand Shakespeare? Why are fruitflies uniform? How do omnivorous eating habits aid our survival? What makes the Mona Lisa’s smile beautiful? How do women keep our social structures intact? – Could there possibly be a single answer to all these questions? This book shows that the statement: 'weak links stabilize complex systems' provides the key to understanding each of these intriguing puzzles, and many others too.  The author (recipient of several distinguished science communication prizes) uses weak (low affinity, low probability) interactions as a thread to introduce a vast variety of networks from proteins to economics and ecosystems. Many people, from Nobel Laureates to high-school students have helped to make the book understandable to all interested readers. This unique book and the ideas it develops will have a significant impact on many, seemingly diverse, fields of study. A very personal, engaging, and unique book that will appeal to readers and get them thinking Steve Strogatz An adventurous, entertainingly eclectic and rich work both for experts and laymen László-Albert Barabási This masterpiece should serve as an example of how science can be discussed György Buzsáki Outstanding - I wish more books were written this way Daniel J.
