Calixarenes : An Introduction
This book gives a concise, comprehensive overview of the field with particular attention to the historical development of Calixarenes and will be of immediate value to researchers, graduates and professionals, Calixarenes belong to a family of macrocyclic compounds based on a hydrozyalkylation product of a phenol and an aldehyde, and are probably the world's most readily available synthetic molecular basket. The word calixarene is derived from calyx, Greek for chalice and arene in reference to the presence of aryl groups in the cyclic array. Calixarenes are appealing subjects for research since they can be functionalized in myriad ways to provide interesting and useful materials. As a result of their ease of synthesis they have attracted worldwide attention.
