Plant virology protocols : new approaches to detect viruses and host responses
Plant Virology Protocols: New Approaches to Detect Viruses and Host Responses addresses recent developments in genome analyses and cytological technologies being used today to learn more about plant virology. Opening with chapters covering techniques relevant to the detection of unknown viruses and disease diagnosis, this detailed volume continues with chapters on the utilization of meta-genome sequencing and global gene expression analyses for the search and identification of viruses, as well as the elucidation of host responses to viral infection, construction methods of infectious cDNAs, and methods relevant to plant virus control. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Authoritative and practical, Plant Virology Protocols: New Approaches to Detect Viruses and Host Responses will be an invaluable guide to researchers working in the field of plant sciences.--
