Elliptic PDEs on compact Ricci limit spaces and applications
Preliminaries -- Lp-convergence revisited -- Poisson's equations -- Rellich type compactness for tensor fields -- Differential forms
In this paper the author studies elliptic PDEs on compact Gromov-Hausdorff limit spaces of Riemannian manifolds with lower Ricci curvature bounds. In particular the author establishes continuities of geometric quantities, which include solutions of Poisson's equations, eigenvalues of Schr√∂dinger operators, generalized Yamabe constants and eigenvalues of the Hodge Laplacian, with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff topology. The author applies these to the study of second-order differential calculus on such limit spaces
