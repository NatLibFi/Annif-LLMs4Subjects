Data-driven guide to the analysis of X-ray photoelectron spectra using RxpsG
"This book provides a theoretical background to X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and a practical guide to the analysis of the XPS spectra using the RxpsG software, a powerful tool for XPS analysis. Although there are several publications and books illustrating the theory behind X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and the origin of the spectral feature, this book provides an additional practical introduction to the use of RxspG. It illustrates how to use the RxpsG software to perform specific key operations, with figures and examples which the reader can reproduce themselves. The book contains a list of theoretical sections explaining the appearance of the various spectral features (core-lines, Auger components, valence bands, loss features etc). They are accompanied by practical steps so readers can learn how to analyze specific spectral features using the various functions of the RxpsG software. This book is useful guide for researchers in physics, chemistry, and materials science who are looking to begin using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, in addition to experienced researchers who want to learn how to use RxpsG"--
