Numerical and Practical Exercises in Thermoluminescence
Thermoluminescence (TL) is a well-established technique widely used in dosimetric and dating applications. Although several excellent reference books exist which document both the theoretical and experimental aspects of TL, there is a general lack of books that deal with specific numerical and practical aspects of analyzing TL data. Many times the practical details of analyzing numerical TL glow curves and of applying theoretical models are difficult to find in the published literature. Numerical and Practical Exercises in Thermoluminescence provides a practical guide for both established rese
