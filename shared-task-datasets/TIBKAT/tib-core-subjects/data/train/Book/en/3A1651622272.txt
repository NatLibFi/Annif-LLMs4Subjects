The peculiarities of materials at the nanoscale demand an interdisciplinary approach which can be difficult for students and researchers who are trained predominantly in a single field. A chemist might not have experience at working with cell cultures or a physicist may have no idea how to make the gold colloid they need for calibrating an atomic force microscope. The interdisciplinary approach of the book will help you toâ‰¤quickly synthesize information from multiple perspectives. Nanoscience research is also characterized by rapid movement within disciplines. The amount of time it take
