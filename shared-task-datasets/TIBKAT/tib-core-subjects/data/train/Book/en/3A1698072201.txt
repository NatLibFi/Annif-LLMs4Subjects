Waste Management and the Circular Economy in Selected OECD Countries : Evidence from Environmental Performance Reviews
This report provides a cross-country review of waste, materials management and circular economy policies in selected OECD countries, drawing on OECDâ€™s Environmental Performance Reviews during the period 2010-17. It presents the main achievements in the countries reviewed, along with common trends and policy challenges, and provides insights into the effectiveness and efficiency of waste, materials management and circular economy policy frameworks. As the selected reviews were published over a seven-year period, information for some countries may be more recent than for others. Nevertheless, the policy recommendations emerging from the reviews may provide useful lessons for other OECD countries and partner economies.
