Fragrant introduction to terpenoid chemistry
This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, Terpenoids play an important part in all our lives, from Vitamin A and hormones to perfumes and pharmaceuticals. This book provides an introduction to terpenoid chemistry, concentrating on the lower terpenoids, but the basic principles taught are also the foundation for the chemistry of the higher terpenoids. Coverage includes: the biogenesis of terpenoids; some of the history of the field; the principles of structural determination; and the importance of stereochemistry and stereoselective synthesis. Carbocation chemistry is introduced, as are the principles of total and partial synthesis. Finally, industrial chemistry (both discovery chemistry and chemical process development) is discussed, using the volatile terpenoids of perfumery to illustrate basic concepts. Ideal as both an introduction to terpenoid chemistry and as a refresher course, A Fragrant Introduction to Terpenoid Chemistry, with its real-life problems and appreciation of the relevance of chemistry to everyday life, will prove invaluable to students, lecturers and industrialists alike
