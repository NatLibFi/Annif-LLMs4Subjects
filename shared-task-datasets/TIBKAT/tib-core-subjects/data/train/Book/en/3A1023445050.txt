Evaluation and performance measurement of research and development : techniques and perspectives for multi-level analysis
This book develops and illustrates a comprehensive, multi-level framework for the evaluation of industrial R&D activities and the measurement of their performances. The framework encompasses a set of hierarchical, interrelated levels at which R&D evaluation and performance measurement could be undertaken. This enlightening book focuses on the single industrial firm to study performance measurement of R&D functions, projects and individual researchers or engineers. It also addresses the R&D evaluation from the point of view of financial markets, with a focus on the relationships between R&D investments and the value of the traded firm
