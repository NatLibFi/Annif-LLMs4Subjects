Backscattering and RF sensing for future wireless communication
"We are at a stage at which evolution in the field of wireless communications not only requires futuristic technologies but a change of mindset of how the environment interacts with these technologies. The deployment of next-generation wireless networks, particularly in the millimetre wave frequency range, poses significant challenges. Whilst there have been numerous technologies proposed to improve the efficiency of a wireless communication system, the current state-of-the-art is not yet sufficiently mature to deploy commercial, large-scale networks. Backscattering of the wireless signal using intelligent planar structures has recently emerged as the most exciting technique to improve a wireless network's performance, through which the channel characteristics can be sensed. This can be utilized to reconfigure the channel resulting in better quality of service. This book provides in-depth coverage of the fundamental physics behind these intelligent planar structures, and assesses the enhancement of the performance of a communication network in challenging environments such as a densely populated urban area"--
