Crypto crowds : singularities and multiplicities on the blockchain
Ownership of cryptocurrencies and related assets has given rise to self-described “coin-communities.” Discussing the notions around social dynamics, this collection explores how crowd and community formations manifest empirically in cryptocurrency sociality online. It suggests that tensions between cryptocurrency adopters generate political, moral, and cosmological realities, which intensify crowding dynamics online. Pioneering in its approach to the increasing digitalization and datafication of everyday life, the volume encourages scholars to explore further how “decentralized” and “trustless” technologies take part in the construction of postmodern crowds.
