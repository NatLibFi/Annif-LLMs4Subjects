Low Order Cohomology and Applications
Continuous cohomology of Lie groups and Lie algebras -- Continuous tensor products, infinitely divisible and factorizable representations -- First order cohomology groups for certain semi-direct products -- First order cohomology for SL(2; R) and SL(2; C) -- Further results on semi-simple Lie groups -- "Genuine" infinitely divisible representations.
