Polymeric and Self Assembled Hydrogels : From Fundamental Understanding to Applications
The diverse range of applications has thrust hydrogels into the spotlight of scientific research. From biomedical applications in tissue engineering, drug delivery and wound healing, and consumer care products such as contact lenses to laboratory purification in chromatography and as electrophoresis gels, many researchers are looking at hydrogels for their materials solutions. This rapid expansion of the field has however created a gap between the current knowledge and understanding of hydrogel research and its future outlook. To overcome this, Polymeric and Self Assembled Hydrogels captures the entire landscape of hydrogels research providing a guidebook for academics, industrialists and postgraduates interested in the area. With contributions from the top authorities in the field, the book details the fundamental principles of both synthetic and natural polymeric networks and supramolecular hydrogels from either surfactants or peptides, along with examples of their major applications. This is the resource to give you everything you need to know about hydrogel research.
