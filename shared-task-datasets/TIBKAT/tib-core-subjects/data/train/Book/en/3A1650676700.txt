Morphology of Condensed Matter : Physics and Geometry of Spatially Complex Systems
The morphology of spatially stuctured materials is a rapidly growing field of research at the interface of statistical physics, applied mathematics and materials science. A wide spectrum of applications encompasses the flow through porous and composite materials as well as microemulsions and foams. Written as a set of lectures and tutorial reviews leading up to the forefront of research, this book will be both a compendium for the experienced researcher as well as a high level introductory text for postgraduate students and nonspecialist researchers working in related areas
