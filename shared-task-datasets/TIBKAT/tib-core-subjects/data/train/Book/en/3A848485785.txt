NMR Data interpretation explained : understanding 1D and 2D NMR spectra of organic compounds and natural products
NMR Data Interpretation Explained shows how to get from an NMR spectrum to a chemical structure through numerous examples and exercises. Each topic is introduced with one or more examples of NMR data accompanied by detailed explanations of the interpretation of that data. Examples are then followed by a number of exercises using detailed images of NMR data. These are followed up by solutions, again with detailed explanations of the step-by-step reasoning used to solve the exercises. -- Back cover
Through numerous examples, the principles of the relationship between chemical structure and the NMR spectrum are developed in a logical, step-by-step fashionIncludes examples and exercises based on real NMR data including full 600 MHz one- and two-dimensional datasets of sugars, peptides, steroids and natural productsIncludes detailed solutions and explanations in the text for the numerous examples and problems and also provides large, very detailed and annotated sets of NMR data for use in understanding the materialDescribes both simple aspects of solution-state NMR of small molecules as well as more complex topics not usually covered in NMR books such as complex splitting patterns, weak long-range couplings, spreadsheet analysis of strong coupling patterns and resonance structure analysis for prediction of chemical shiftsAdvanced topics include all of the common two-dimensional experiments (COSY, ROESY, NOESY, TOCSY, HSQC, HMBC) covered strictly from the point of view of data interpretation, along with tips for parameter settings
