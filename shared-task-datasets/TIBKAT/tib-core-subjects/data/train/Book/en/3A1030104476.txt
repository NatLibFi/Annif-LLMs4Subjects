Lithium-Ion Batteries: Basics and Applications
The handbook focuses on a complete outline of lithium-ion batteries. Just before starting with an exposition of the fundamentals of this system, the book gives a short explanation of the newest cell generation. The most important elements are described as negative / positive electrode materials, electrolytes, seals and separators. The battery disconnect unit and the battery management system are important parts of modern lithium-ion batteries.  An economical, faultless and efficient battery production is a must today and is represented with one chapter in the handbook. Cross-cutting issues like electrical, chemical, functional safety are further topics. Last but not least standards and transportation themes are the final chapters of the handbook.  The different topics of the handbook provide a good knowledge base not only for those working daily on electrochemical energy storage, but also to scientists, engineers and students concerned in modern battery systems
Part I Outline of energy storage systems -- Part II Lithium-Ion Batteries and their elements -- Part III Production of modern batteries -- Part IV Cross-cutting issues -- Part V Applications of Lithium-Ion Batteries and their demands
