Nanoindentation of natural materials : hierarchical and functionally graded microstructures
"The book will provide critical information regarding the basics of hierarchical and functionally graded structures and nanoindentation techniques along with detailed discussion with correlation micro/nano mechanical-structures. The readers will be able to identify the advantages of this method in purview of characterizing natural bio composites"--
