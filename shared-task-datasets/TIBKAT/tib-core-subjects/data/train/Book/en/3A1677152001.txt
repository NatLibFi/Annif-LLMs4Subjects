Visible light communications : theoretical and practical foundations
Visible Light Communication (VLC) is an emerging wireless data transmission technology. Light is used simultaneously for illumination as well as for communication and/or positioning purposes. If fully networked, dubbed Li-Fi, VLC systems complement Wi-Fi access points. VLC is an incident of optical wireless communications (OWC). OWC systems provide high data security, are license-free, and may substitute radio systems when these either fail or are not permitted. VLC technology enhances smart lighting infrastructure and Internet-of-Things (IoT) use cases. LED-based Car-to-X communication is an enabling platform towards autonomous driving. The textbook covers OWC applications, fundamentals of illumination engineering, channel modeling, optical intensity modulation schemes, VLC standardization efforts, the software-defined radio concept, selection criteria of photonic devices, fundamental circuit designs, and visible light positioning. The book is written for students in electrical and information engineering or adjacent areas, as well as for engineers, information scientists, and physicists in research and development.
