Understanding FACTS : concepts and technology of flexible AC transmission systems
"The Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) -- a new technology based on power electronics -- offers an opportunity to enhance controllability, stability, and power transfer capability of AC transmission systems. Pioneers in FACTS and leading world experts in power electronics applications Narain G. Hingorani and Laszlo Gyugyi have teamed together to bring you the definitive book on FACTS technology. Hingorani and Gyugyi present a practical approach to FACTS that will enable electrical engineers working in the power industry to understand the principles underlying this advanced system. UNDERSTANDING FACTS will also enhance expertise in equipment specifications and engineering design, offering an informed view of the future of power electronics in AC transmission systems. This comprehensive reference book provides an in-depth look at: * Power semiconductor devices * Voltage-sourced and current-sourced converters * Specific FACTS controllers including SVC, STATCOM, TCSC, SSSC, UPFC, IPFC plus voltage regulators, phase shifters, and special controllers with a detailed comparison of their performance attributes * Major FACTS applications used in the United States. UNDERSTANDING FACTS is an authoritative resource that is essential reading for electrical engineers who want to stay on the cusp of the power electronics revolution."
