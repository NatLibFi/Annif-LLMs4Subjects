Non-rocket space launch and flight
In recent years scientists have investigated a series of new methods for non-rocket space launch, which promise to revolutionize space launches and flight. Particularly in the current political climate new, cheaper, and more fuel efficient methods are being investigated. Such new methods include the gas tube method, cable accelerators, tether launch systems, space elevators, solar and magnetic sails, circle launcher space keepers and more. The author brings a vast amount of experience to the topic, having worked as a engineer, designer, project director and researcher at key institutes including NASA and the US Air Force. Explores all the new non-rocket space launch methods, and compares them with each other and traditional rockets. Investigates the unifying principles of the different systems and shows how to select the best design suited to the mission. Author brings together technical and theoretical expertise from both industry and academia
