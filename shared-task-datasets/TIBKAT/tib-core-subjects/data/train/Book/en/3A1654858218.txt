Nanoceramics in clinical use : from materials to applications
The field of nanoceramics for biomedical applications has experienced important advances in the last five years. These advances are mainly focused in the field of new nanostructured bioceramics able to mimic almost the same biomineralization processes. In addition, there has also been significant advances in nanoceramics as vehicles for targeted drug delivery and gene therapy. Building on the success of Biomimetic Nanoceramics in Clinical Use, this second edition has been revised and updated to reflect the recent developments in the field. Nanoceramics in Clinical Use includes additional material on bone mineralization processes, new synthesis strategies and applications of nanostructured bioceramics to manufacture 3D macroporous scaffolds and as nanovehicles for targeted drug delivery and gene therapies, to provide the reader with a complete overview of the topic, from fundamental principles to the latest advances. Written by World leading experts in bioceramics, this title will appeal to a broad audience, from academic researchers to those working within the commercial industry. Materials and chemical engineers, chemists, biologists, physicists and those working in medicine, im particular with medical implants, will appreciate the comprehensive coverage of this fast-developing area
