Applied scanning probe methods X : biomimetics and industrial applications
The volumes VIII, IX and X examine the physical and technical foundation for recent progress in applied scanning probe techniques. The first volume came out in January 2004, the second to fourth volumes in early 2006 and the fifth to seventh volumes in late 2006. The field is progressing so fast that there is a need for a set of volumes every 12 to 18 months to capture latest developments. These volumes constitute a timely comprehensive overview of SPM applications. After introducing scanning probe microscopy, including sensor technology and tip characterization, chapters on use in various ind
The volumes VIII, IX and X examine the physical and technical foundation for recent progress in applied scanning probe techniques. This is the first book to summarize the state-of-the-art of this technique. The field is progressing so fast that there is a need for a set of volumes every 12 to 18 months to capture latest developments. These volumes constitute a timely comprehensive overview of SPM applications.
