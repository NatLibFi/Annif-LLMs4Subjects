Analytic Inequalities and Their Applications in PDEs
Preface -- 1 Integral Inequalities -- 2 Differential and Difference Inequalities -- 3 Global Attractors for Evolutionary Differential Equations -- 4 Global Existence and Uniqueness for Evolutionary PDEs -- 5 Asymptotic Behavior for Evolutionary PDEs.-6 Blow-up of Solutions to Evolutionary PDEs -- 7 Appendix: Basic Inequalities
This book presents a number of analytic inequalities and their applications in partial differential equations. These include integral inequalities, differential inequalities and difference inequalities, which play a crucial role in establishing (uniform) bounds, global existence, large-time behavior, decay rates and blow-up of solutions to various classes of evolutionary differential equations. Summarizing results from a vast number of literature sources such as published papers, preprints and books, it categorizes inequalities in terms of their different properties
