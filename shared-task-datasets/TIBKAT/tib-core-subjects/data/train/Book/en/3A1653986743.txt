Transport Processes at Fluidic Interfaces
There are several physico-chemical processes that determine the behavior of multiphase fluid systems - e.g., the fluid dynamics in the different phases and the dynamics of the interface(s), mass transport between the fluids, adsorption effects at the interface, and transport of surfactants on the interface - and result in heterogeneous interface properties. In general, these processes are strongly coupled and local properties of the interface play a crucial role. A thorough understanding of the behavior of such complex flow problems must be based on physically sound mathematical models, which especially account for the local processes at the interface. This book presents recent findings on the rigorous derivation and mathematical analysis of such models and on the development of numerical methods for direct numerical simulations. Validation results are based on specifically designed experiments using high-resolution experimental techniques. A special feature of this book is its focus on an interdisciplinary research approach combining Applied Analysis, Numerical Mathematics, Interface Physics and Chemistry, as well as relevant research areas in the Engineering Sciences. The contributions originated from the joint interdisciplinary research projects in the DFG Priority Programme SPP 1506 “Transport Processes at Fluidic Interfaces.”
