RF and baseband techniques for software defined radio
Software defined radio is a hot technology, because it delivers the feature-rich services driving the telecommunications market. But without hardware, software cannot delivery anything, and this book examines both the practical aspects and underpinnings of the hardware enabling software defined radio. It gives designers and engineers actionable concepts and techniques for creating the next generation of communication systems. The book explains the performance limitations of specific hardware components and steers practitioners away from potential design pitfalls. This comprehensive reference provides an array of hardware alternatives that help guarantee design success and optimal performance. It looks at the cost factors of using particular pieces of hardware to ensure mat designers create communications devices that can compete successfully in the marketplace. Moreover the book includes a survey of hardware components that helps professionals identify future trends, so current designs are readily adaptable, to ever-changing technology and market demands
