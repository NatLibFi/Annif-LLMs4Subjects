Solution manual for partial differential equations for scientists & engineers
"Originally published by John Wiley and Sons in 1983, Partial Differential Equations for Scientists and Engineers was reprinted by Dover in 1993... Written for advanced undergraduates in mathematics as well as professionals working in the applied sciences, the widely used and extremely successful text shows how to formulate a partial differential equation from the physical problem...Topics include diffusion-type problems, hyperbolic-type problems, elliptic-type problems, and numerical and approximate methods. Dover's 1993 edition, which contains answers to selected problems, is now supplemented by this complete solutions manual"
