Physics of Classical Electromagnetism
The classical electromagnetism described by the Maxwell equations constitutes a fundamental law in contemporary physics. With the advent of sophisticated new materials, the principles are still active in various applied areas in today s advanced communication technologies. Referring to modern materials, this book is written with concise introductory arguments for the physics of electromagnetism, covering basic topics including the nature of space-time-dependent radiations in modern applications. However, noted that the classical concept fails generally at optical frequencies, the limit is a significant obstacle for further technical developments. Following basic discussions of electromagnetism in a modernized approach, this book provides readers with an overview of current problems in high-frequency physics.Although written primarily for students of physics and engineering at undergraduate levels, this book should serve as a useful reference for graduate students and researchers as well. The subject matter in this book is all fundamental, although given examples may appear a little too specific.
