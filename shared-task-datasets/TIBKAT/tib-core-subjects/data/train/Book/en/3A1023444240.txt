Regulating transport in Europe
This book concerns the regulation of transport within a European context, covering air, inland waterways, rail, road passenger and freight, urban public transport, and short sea shipping. All these sectors have experienced substantial changes over the past two decades, in terms of ownership, competition and liberalization, and the book explores the main transformations and their impacts. The authors address these issues, with a specific focus on the effects of the organization and regulation of transport systems on their performance. They also provide timely policy recommendations, including possible European future policy initiatives. This comprehensive book will appeal to academics and practitioners in Europe in the fields of regulation, legal studies, transport economics and planning, and also political science. Undergraduate, graduate and doctoral students in Europe with core-modules linked to issues on regulation, transport, economics, European politics, European affairs and network industries will also find that this is an essential resource.
