Intelligent hydrogels in diagnostics and therapeutics
"This book explores the potential of hydrogels as a multi-utility system and their benefits (biocompatibility, degradability, and supporting scaffolds) for a wide range of applications in diagnostics and therapeutics. It also discusses the future prospects and challenges in transition of hydrogels. A wide variety of smart hydrogels (conducting, stimuli-responsive, and others) with possible biomedical applications have been elaborated. The book demonstrates the effectiveness of hydrogels in diagnostics of diseases in various in-vivo and in-vitro environments and highlights the designing with engineering/functionalization of hydrogels for everyday drug dosage as an efficient drug carrier, scaffold and sensing application"--
