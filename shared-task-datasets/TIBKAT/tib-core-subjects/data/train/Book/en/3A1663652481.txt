Understanding building stones and stone buildings
"This book covers the wide spectrum of subjects relating to obtaining and using building stones. The life of a building stone is explained from its origin in the quarry, through its exposure to the elements when used for a building, to its eventual deterioration. The structure of stone buildings is then discussed, with explanations of the mechanics of pillars, lighthouses and walls, arches, bridges, buttresses and roof vaults, plus castles and cathedrals. The book is illustrated with more than 450 diagrams and colour photographs of both the various stones and the associated stone buildings"--
