Handbook of industry studies and economic geography
'Economic geography and industrial economics have traditionally been two distinct fields of scholarship separated by entirely disparate literatures, methodologies and research agendas. No more. With publication of this path-breaking collection of meticulously crafted studies, the editors have forged economic geography and industrial economics into a coherent and compelling singular field of scholarship. Neither economic geography nor industrial economics can subsequently be considered in isolation but will need to be analyzed in the integrated framework introduced in this book.' (David B. Audretsch, Indiana University, Bloomington, US). -- This unique Handbook examines the impacts on, and responses to, economic geography explicitly from the perspective of the behaviour, mechanics, systems and experiences of different firms in various types of industries. The industry studies approach allows the authors to explain why the economic geography of these different industries exhibits such particular and diverse characteristics. The sectors and industries covered include: traditional heavy industry and engineering, creative and cultural industries, knowledge sectors, natural resource-based and environmental sectors, knowledge, networks and communications issues. The Handbook of Industry Studies and Economic Geography will strongly appeal to students, scholars and researchers interested in all aspects of industrial location and economic geography.
