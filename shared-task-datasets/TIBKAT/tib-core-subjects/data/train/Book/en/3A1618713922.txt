Finite element modeling and simulation with ANSYS Workbench
"Finite Element Modeling and Simulation with ANSYS Workbench combines finite element theory with real-world practice. Providing an introduction to finite element modeling and analysis for those with no prior experience, and written by authors with a combined experience of 30 years teaching the subject, this text presents FEM formulations integrated with relevant hands-on applications using ANSYS Workbench for finite element analysis (FEA). Incorporating the basic theories of FEA and the use of ANSYS Workbench in the modeling and simulation of engineering problems, the book also establishes the FEM method as a powerful numerical tool in engineering design and analysis."--
