"Modern web applications need to be efficient to develop, lightning fast, and unfailingly reliable.  Phoenix, a web framework for the Elixir programming language, delivers on all counts.  Elegant and intuitive, Phoenix radically simplifies the dev process.  Built for concurrency, Phoenix channels make short work of developing real-time applications.  And as for reliability, Phoenix apps run on the battle-tested Erlang VM, so they're rock solid!  "Phoenix in action" is an example-based book that teaches you to build production-quality web apps.  You'll handle business logic, database interactions, and app designs as you progressively create an online auction site.  As you go, you'll build everything from the core components to the real-time user interactions where Phoenix really shines."--
