Habitat : vernacular architecture for a changing planet
"Climate change is the biggest challenge facing our planet. There has never been a more important time to understand how to make the best use of local natural resources and to create buildings that do not rely on stripping the environment or transporting materials across the globe. Habitat gathers contributions from the world's leading experts on vernacular architecture to examine how local buildings have stood the test of time, and to show how they can offer lessons for the future. Given our ecosystem's increasing frailty, the architecture and building trade's new role in a post-digital era, and the desparate need to record fading cultural traditions, the relevance of Habitat is greater than ever."--Page 4 of cover
