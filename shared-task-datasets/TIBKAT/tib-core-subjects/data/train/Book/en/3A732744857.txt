Managing and mining sensor data
Advances in hardware technology have lead to an ability to collect data with the use of a variety of sensor technologies. In particular sensor notes have become cheaper and more efficient, and have even been integrated into day-to-day devices of use, such as mobile phones. This has lead to a much larger scale of applicability and mining of sensor data sets. The human-centric aspect of sensor data has created tremendous opportunities in integrating social aspects of sensor data collection into the mining process. Managing and Mining Sensor Data is a contributed volume by prominent leaders in this field, targeting advanced-level students in computer science as a secondary text book or reference. Practitioners and researchers working in this field will also find this book useful.--
