Quantum Cryptography : From Key Distribution to Conference Key Agreement
Elements of Quantum Information Theory -- Introducing Quantum Key Distribution -- Quantum Conference Key Agreement -- Quantum Key Distribution with Imperfect Devices -- Beyond Point-to-point Quantum Key Distribution -- Device-independent Cryptography.
Rising concerns about the security of our data have made quantum cryptography a very active research field in recent years. Quantum cryptographic protocols promise everlasting security by exploiting distinctive quantum properties of nature. The most extensively implemented protocol is quantum key distribution (QKD), which enables secure communication between two users. The aim of this book is to introduce the reader to state-of-the-art QKD and illustrate its recent multi-user generalization: quantum conference key agreement. With its pedagogical approach that doesnâ€™t disdain going into details, the book enables the reader to join in cutting-edge research on quantum cryptography.
