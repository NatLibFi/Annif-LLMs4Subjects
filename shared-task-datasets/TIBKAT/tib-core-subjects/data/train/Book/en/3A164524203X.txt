Solar-Type Activity in Main-Sequence Stars
"In the monograph by R.E.Gershberg "The solar-type activity amongst the main sequence stars" results of study of the solar-type activity, that is inherent in majority of low- and middle-mass main sequence stars, its manifestations both during flares and in quiet state within the whole range of electromagnetic spectrum are systematized and summarized. Comprehensive analysis of the variety of stellar activity manifestations leads to identification of these phenomena with macroscopic non-linear processes in magnetized plasma. The conception is that matter is selforganized on different spatial and temporal scales. A star as a whole is a dissipative system of the largest scale where global magnetic fields are selforganized due to stellar rotation and convection. In smaller scale structures dissipative systems arise which lead to stellar flares and other events related to local magnetic fields."
