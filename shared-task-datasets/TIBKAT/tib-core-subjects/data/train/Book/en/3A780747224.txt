The Semantic Web explained : the technology and mathematics behind Web 3.0
"The Semantic Web is a new area of research and development in the field of computer science that aims to make it easier for computers to process the huge amount of information on the Web, and indeed other large databases, by enabling them not only to read, but also to understand the information. Based on successful courses taught by the authors, and liberally sprinkled with examples and exercises, this comprehensive textbook describes not only the theoretical issues underlying the Semantic Web, but also algorithms, optimisation ideas and implementation details. The book will therefore be valuable to practitioners as well as students, indeed to anyone who is interested in Internet technology, knowledge engineering or description logics. Supplementary materials available online include the source code of program examples and solutions to selected exercises"--
