Proteases in Gastrointestinal Tissues
This book is unique for its comprehensive presentation of protease function in the stomach, colon, pancreas and liver under both physiological conditions and major diseases manifesting in these four organs. The individual chapters have been written by leaders in the field who outline in great detail the role of proteases in the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of disease. Animal models and experimental data are discussed in the context of patient-derived data.
This book is unique for its comprehensive presentation of protease function in stomach, colon, pancreas and liver under both physiological conditions and major diseases manifesting in these four organs. The individual chapters have been written by leaders in the field who paid much attention to outline in great detail the role of proteases in the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of disease. Available animal models (of disease, transgenic, or knock-out) are extensively referred to and experimental data obtained thereby are discussed in the context of patient-derived data. Newcomers to the field and interested non-specialists will take advantage of the extensive introduction to individual proteases, protease families, and the diseases. Understanding is greatly facilitated by the clear and condensed presentation of summarised data in tables and graphs. This book is a valuable source for both clinicians and basic and clinical researchers interested in protease function and/or diseases in gastrointestinal tissues.
