Temporal and spatio-temporal data mining
"This book presents probable solutions when discovering the spatial sequence patterns by incorporating the information into the sequence of patterns, and introduces new classes of spatial sequence patterns, called flow and generalized spatio-temporal patterns, addressing different scenarios in spatio-temporal data by modeling them as graphs, providing a comprehensive synopsis on two successful partition-based algorithms designed by the authors"--Provided by publisher
