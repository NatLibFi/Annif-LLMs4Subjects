Atlas of fantastic infrastructures : an intimate look at media architecture
Fantastic infrastructures' deals with media architecture and digital infrastructure. In concrete terms, with the relationship between different dimensions as well as the materiality of buildings and the intangibility of data. Since technical and functional studies have not yet yielded any concrete findings, the author speculatively pursues four issues: 1. An affair with phantoms: who do we want to meet in digital space, what kind of communication / interaction can potentially result? 2. Para-wishes: where can we live out our surreal wishes and what strategies do they pursue? 3. A catalog of a variety of spaces: what kind of data, information, things, spaces, and places are available in the world and how do our actions serve to combine them? 4. Garden presents: how can an idea become reality, in which ways do thoughts become physical reality?
