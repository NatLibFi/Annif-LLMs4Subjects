Optics experiments and demonstrations for student laboratories
This book provides a comprehensive guide to a wide range of optical experiments. Topics covered include classical geometrical and physical optics, polarization, scattering and diffraction, imaging, interference, wave propagation, optical properties of materials, atmospheric and relativistic optics. There are a few selected suggestions on lasers and quantum optics. The book is an essential practical guide for optics students and their mentors at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The experiments described are based on the author's experience during many years of laboratory teaching in several universities and colleges and the emphasis is on setups which use equipment that is commonly available in student labs, with minimal dependence on special samples or instruments. A basic background in physics and optics is assumed, but commonly encountered problems and mistakes are discussed. There are several appendices describing specialized points which are difficult to locate in the literature, and advice is provided about computer simulations which accompany some of the experiments. Part of IOP Series in Emerging Technologies in Optics and Photonics.
