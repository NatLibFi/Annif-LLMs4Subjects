Low frequency waves and turbulence in magnetized laboratory plasmas and in the ionosphere
Low Frequency Waves and Turbulence in Magnetized Laboratory Plasmas and in the Ionosphere was developed from courses taught by the author at the universities of Oslo and Tromso in Norway. Suitable for undergraduates, graduate students and researchers, the first part of the book is devoted to discussing some relevant plasma instabilities and the free energy that drives them. In the second part, the more advanced topics of nonlinear models and the interactions of many modes are discussed. Theoretical tools available for turbulence modelling are also outlined. The book summarizes a number of studies of low-frequency plasma waves, drift waves in particular, from laboratory and space experiments.
