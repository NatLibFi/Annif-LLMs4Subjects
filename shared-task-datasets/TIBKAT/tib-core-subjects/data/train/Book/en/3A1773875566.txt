Bioenergy from Sustainable Forestry : Guiding Principles and Practice
Bioenergy from Sustainable Forestry synthesizes information needed to design or implement sustainable forest management systems for production of biomass for energy in conjunction with other forest products. It is organized around the criteria for sustainable forest management: productivity, environment, social issues, economics, and legal and institutional framework. More than 25 international experts from 10 countries have brought together available ecological, physical, operational, social and economic information and identified gaps in knowledge related to biomass production and harvesting systems. This is the first time that such comprehensive information has been brought together under one cover, using an integrated, holistic approach. Guiding principles and state of the art knowledge are emphasized. The book will enable forest resource managers and planners to evaluate the ability of specific forest regions to sustainably meet bioenergy production demands.
Rationale for Forest Energy Production -- Fuel Resources from the Forest -- Production of Forest Energy -- Cost of Wood Energy -- Environmental Sustainability of Forest Energy Production -- Social Implications of Forest Energy Production -- Policy and Institutional Factors Affecting Forest Energy -- Framework for Conventional Forestry Systems for Sustainable Production of Bioenergy.
