Problem Book in Quantum Field Theory
The Problem Book in Quantum Field Theory contains about 200 problems with solutions or hints that help students to improve their understanding and develop skills necessary for pursuing the subject. It deals with the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations, classical field theory, canonical quantization of scalar, Dirac and electromagnetic fields, the processes in the lowest order of perturbation theory, renormalization and regularization. The solutions are presented in a systematic and complete manner. The material covered and the level of exposition make the book appropriate for graduate and undergraduate students in physics, as well as for teachers and researchers.
