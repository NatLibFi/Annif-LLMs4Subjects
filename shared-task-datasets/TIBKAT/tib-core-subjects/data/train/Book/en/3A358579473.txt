River processes : an introduction to fluvial dynamics
Deals with flow and sediment dynamics in alluvial channels. This book places emphasis on water flows, fluvial sediment, processes of erosion and sediment transport, bedforms that result from flow-bed sediment interactions in sand and gravel, flow and sedimentary processes in curved, braided and confluent channels, as well as aquatic habits.River Processes deals primarily with flow and sediment dynamics in alluvial channels. It emphasises water flows (basic principles and characterisation), fluvial sediment, processes of erosion and sediment transport, bedforms that result from flow-bed sediment interactions in sand and gravel, flow and sedimentary processes in curved, braided and confluent channels, as well as aquatic habits. River Processes provides a comprehensive synthesis of current knowledge about physical processes in alluvial channels, with an emphasis on the recent work on flow-bed-sediment transport interactions. It is intended primarily for undergraduate students interested in fluvial studies as part of physical geography, earth sciences, environmental sciences and ecology courses. The textbook is fully illustrated throughout with line drawings and photographs.
