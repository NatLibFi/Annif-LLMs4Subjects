Principles of Space Anthropology : Establishing a Science of Human Space Settlement
An Introduction to Space Anthropology -- Individual Hominin Biology Beyond Earth -- Population Genetics of Human Space Settlement -- Cultural Adaptations in Human Space Settlement -- Humanity and the Migration Experience Beyond Earth -- Adaptive Lessons from Ancient Technologies and Cultures -- Human Adaption and Permanent Space Settlement -- Appendix 1 -- Appendix 2
This book shows how anthropology can provide an innovative perspective on the human movement into space. It examines adaptation to space on timescales of generations, rather than merely months or years, and uses evolutionary adaptation as a guiding theme. Employing the lessons of evolutionary adaptation, Principles of Extraterrestrial Anthropology recommends evolutionarily-sound strategies of space settlement, covering genetics at the organismal and population levels. The author organizes the concept of cultural adaptation to environments beyond Earth according to observed patterns in human adaptation on Earth. He uses original artwork and tables to help convey complex information in a form accessible to undergraduate and graduate students. Though primarily written to engage students interested in space settlement and exploration, who will eventually build a full anthropology of space settlement, Principles of Extraterrestrial Anthropology is engaging to anthropologists across sub-disciplines, as well as scholars interested in the human dimensions of space exploration and settlement. Just as the term exobiology was invented only a few decades ago to shape the field of space life studies, exoanthropology is outlined to assist in the perpetuation of Earth life through human space settlement
