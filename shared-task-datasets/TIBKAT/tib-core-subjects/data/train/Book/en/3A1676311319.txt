Current Trends in Mathematical Analysis and Its Interdisciplinary Applications
This book explores several important aspects of recent developments in the interdisciplinary applications of mathematical analysis (MA), and highlights how MA is now being employed in many areas of scientific research. Each of the 23 carefully reviewed chapters was written by experienced expert(s) in respective field, and will enrich readers’ understanding of the respective research problems, providing them with sufficient background to understand the theories, methods and applications discussed. The book’s main goal is to highlight the latest trends and advances, equipping interested readers to pursue further research of their own. Given its scope, the book will especially benefit graduate and PhD students, researchers in the applied sciences, educators, and engineers with an interest in recent developments in the interdisciplinary applications of mathematical analysis
