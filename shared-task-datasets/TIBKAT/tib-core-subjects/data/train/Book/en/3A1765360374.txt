Solid state chemistry and its applications
"Solid state chemistry is a field of inorganic chemistry which addresses the synthesis, structure and properties of materials in the solid phase. Solid state chemistry lies at the heart of many significant scientific advances from recent decades including the discovery of high temperate superconductors, new forms of carbon (C60, graphene), development of rechargeable lithium batteries, and countless other developments in the synthesis, structure determination, property measurements and applications of inorganic materials. Going forward, solid state chemistry will be crucial for the discovery and development of new functional materials in areas such as energy storage, energy conversion, catalysis, solid-state lighting and superconductivity"--
