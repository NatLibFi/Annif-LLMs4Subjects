Phased array antennas with optimized element patterns
This authoritative resource provides you with a detailed description of ideal array element characteristics that help you estimate the quality of development of real-world phased array antennas. You find several approaches to optimum phased array design, allowing you to provide specified array gain in a specific region of scan, using a minimum number of expensive, controlled devices. Moreover, this practical book presents important numerical methods that you can use to model and optimize phased array structure to obtain the best array characteristics that the chosen structure can provide. From arrays with beam-forming networks, arrays of coupled dual-mode waveguides, and arrays with reactively loaded radiators, to waveguide arrays with protruding dielectric elements, and arrays with strip, disk, and wire structures, this comprehensive reference explains a wide range of essential topics to help you with work in this challenging area. The book is supported with over 165 illustrations and more than 566 equations
