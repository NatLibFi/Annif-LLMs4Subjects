Staatliche Ballettschule Berlin
The architectural idea for the State Ballet School Berlin reflects the distinctive feature of the school: the constant fluctuation of students between the creative world of dance and the traditional operation of an all-day school. A curvate multilevel hall, between the four-storey school and the ballet rooms that lie opposite each other, runs through the new building. This hall provides a link between the different areas of the ensemble and connects them via a bridge on the second floor. Large openings, like display windows in the fa√ßade, create transparency and afford views out to the outdoor space for the dancers, as well as allowing passers-by to look into the ballet rooms and the dance lessons
