Electric machines : modeling, condition monitoring, and fault diagnosis
"Preface The development of the electric motor is one of the greatest achievements of the modern energy conversion industry. Countless electric motors are being used in our daily lives for critical service applications such as transportation, medical treatment, military operation, communication, etc. However, due to the fundamental limitations of material life time, deterioration, contamination, manufacturing defects, or damages in operations, an electrical motor will eventually go into failure mode. An unexpected failure might lead to the loss of valuable human life or a costly standstill in industry, which needs to be prevented by precisely detecting or continuously monitoring the working condition of a motor. This book was written to provide a full review of diagnosis technologies and an application guide for graduate and senior undergraduate students in power electronics discipline who want to research, develop, and implement a fault diagnosis & condition monitoring scheme for better safety and improved reliability in electric motor operation. Furthermore, electrical and mechanical engineers in industry are also encouraged to take portions of materials in this book as a reference to understand the fundamentals of fault cause and effect and to fulfill successful implementation"--
