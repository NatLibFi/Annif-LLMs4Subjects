C*-Algebras and W*-Algebras
From the reviews: "This book is an excellent and comprehensive survey of the theory of von Neumann algebras. It includes all the fundamental results of the subject, and is a valuable reference for both the beginner and the expert." (Math. Reviews) "In theory, this book can be read by a well-trained third-year graduate student - but the reader had better have a great deal of mathematical sophistication. The specialist in this and allied areas will find the wealth of recent results and new approaches throughout the text especially rewarding." (American Scientist) "The title of this book at once suggests comparison with the two volumes of Dixmier and the fact that one can seriously make this comparison indicates that it is a far more substantial work that others on this subject which have recently appeared"(BLMSoc)
