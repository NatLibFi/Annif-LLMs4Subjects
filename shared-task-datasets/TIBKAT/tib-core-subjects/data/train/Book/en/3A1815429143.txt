Cybersecurity in intelligent networking systems
"Data-driven network intelligence is an important revolution of the intelligent networking systems. Many well-established and cutting-edge edge network communications, artificial intelligence (AI), and cyber security technologies are applied into edge network to achieve a ?smart? and efficient data communication. In recent years, intelligent networking system has attracted more and more attention from industry, research, and academia. There is a need for a comprehensive book to investigate and summarize the recent advances in AI, cyber security, and edge network communications. This book will serve the purpose to investigate technologies, applications and issues in data-driven cyber infrastructure. Data-driven Network Intelligence for Cyber Security describes data-driven network intelligence for anomaly detection and information privacy. It covers a proposed novel data-driven network intelligence system, and further presents the edge computing empowered network intelligence."--
