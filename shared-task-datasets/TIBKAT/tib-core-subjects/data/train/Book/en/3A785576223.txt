Preservation and shelf life extension : UV applications for fluid foods
Fundamentals of UV light emission, transmission, and absorption -- UV light microbial effects -- UV light sources -- UV systems for fluid products -- Control parameters in UV processing -- Establishment of preservation process using UV light -- Novel preservation applications of UV light -- Energy evaluation in UV flow systems -- Regulatory aspects of UV technology commercialization -- UV safety
"Preservation and Shelf Life Extension focuses on the basic principles of ultraviolet light technology as applied in low-UV transmittance treatments of food fluids and solid foods. It describes the features of UV light absorption in food fluids and available commercial systems, and provides case studies for UV treatment of fresh juices, dairy products, wines, and beer. The book also includes information on various continuous and pulsed UV sources and processing systems, as well as examples of specific treatments for fruits, vegetables, meat and poultry products."--Publisher's website
