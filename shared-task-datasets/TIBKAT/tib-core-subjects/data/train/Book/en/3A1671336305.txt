"The American Urban Reader, Second Edition, brings together the most exciting and cutting-edge work on the history of urban forms and ways of life in the evolution of the United States, from pre-colonial Native American Indian cities, colonial European settlements, and western expansion to rapidly expanding metropolitan regions, the growth of suburbs, and post-industrial cities. Each chapter is arranged chronologically and thematically around scholarly essays from historians, social scientists, and journalists, that are supplemented by relevant primary documents which offer more nuanced perspectives and convey the diversity and interdisciplinary nature of the study of the urban condition.

Lisa Krissoff Boehm and Steven H.
