The Routledge companion to architectural drawings and models : from translating to archiving, collecting and displaying
"Architectural drawings and models are instruments of imagination, communication, and historical continuity. The role of drawings and models, their ownership, placement, and authorship in a ubiquitous digital age deserves careful consideration. Expanding on the well-established discussion of the translation from drawings to buildings, this book fills a lacuna in current scholarly publications, questioning the significance of the lives of drawings and models after construction. Including emerging, well-known and world-renowned scholars in the fields of architectural history and theory and curatorial practices, the 35 contributions define recent research in four key areas: Drawing Sites/Sites of Knowledge Construction: Drawing, Office, Construction Site; The Afterlife of Drawings and Models: Archiving, Collecting, Displaying and Exhibiting; Tools of Making: Architectural Representations and their Apparatus Over Time; The Ethical Responsibilities of Collecting and Archiving: Authorship, Ownership, Copyrights, and Rights to Copy. The research covers a wide range of geographies and delves into the practices of such architects as Sir John Soane, Superstudio, Viollet-le-Duc, Frank Lloyd Wright, Wajiro Kon, Germ√°n Samper Gnecco, A+PS, Mies van der Rohe and Renzo Piano"--
