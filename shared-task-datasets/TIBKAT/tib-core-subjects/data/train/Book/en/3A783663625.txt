Mathematics as a laboratory tool : dynamics, delays and noise
This introductory textbook is based on the premise that the foundation of good science is good data. The educational challenge addressed by this introductory textbook is how to present a sampling of the wide range of mathematical tools available for laboratory research to well-motivated students with a mathematical background limited to an introductory course in calculus.--
"Based on the authors' experience teaching biology students, this book introduces a wide range of mathematical techniques in a lively and engaging style. Examples drawn from the authors' experimental and neurological studies provide a rich source of material for computer laboratories that solidify the concepts. The book will be an invaluable resource for biology students and scientists interested in practical applications of mathematics to analyze mechanisms of complex biological rhythms."--
