Modeling and optimization in space engineering : new concepts and approaches
This volume consists of 14 contributed chapters written by leading experts, offering in-depth discussions of the mathematical modeling and algorithmic aspects for tackling a range of space engineering applications. This book will be of interest to researchers and practitioners working in the field of space engineering. Since it offers an in-depth exposition of the mathematical modelling, algorithmic and numerical solution aspects of the topics covered, the book will also be useful to aerospace engineering graduates and post-graduate students who wish to expand their knowledge by studying real-world applications and challenges that they will encounter in their profession. Readers will obtain a broad overview of some of the most challenging space engineering operational scenarios of today and tomorrow: this will be useful for managers in the aerospace field, as well as in other industrial sectors. The contributed chapters are mainly focused on space engineering practice. Researchers and practitioners in mathematical systems modelling, operations research, optimization, and optimal control will also benefit from the case studies presented in this book. The model development and optimization approaches discussed can be extended towards other application areas that are not directly related to space engineering. Therefore, the book can be a useful reference to assist in the development of new modelling and optimization applications.
