Thermochemical processing of biomass : conversion into fuels, chemicals and power
"This book is a comprehensive examination of the large number of possible pathways for converting biomass into fuels and power through thermochemical processes. The book brings together a widely scattered body of information into a single volume that allows comparison of the various thermochemical pathways. The thermochemical processes considered include combustion, gasification, fast pyrolysis, hydrothermal treating, and catalytic conversion of sugars. The book also includes chapters on the upgrading of syngas and bio-oil to liquid transportation fuels, and the economics of the various processes for producing fuels and power"--
