Wireless internet of things : principles and practice
"Built on the back of the book 'Telecommunications Engineering: Principles and Practice', this book covers fundamental principles and protocols of wireless communications, both terrestrial and satellite, which are the enablers of the wireless Internet of Things (IoT). In a consolidated manner the book treats both traditional and new technologies and architectures which make the wireless IoT a reality. Many of the algorithms and protocols adopted in LTE/LTE-A and 5G New Radio are also discussed. Aimed to make IP-based wireless communications easily accessible to students, this book contains numerous worked examples, case studies and review questions at the end of each section. Readers of the book can thus easily check their understanding of the topics progressively. To render the book more hands-on, CelPlanner and MATLAB software packages are used to explain some of the concepts. Parts of this book are taught in undergraduate curriculum, while the rest is taught in graduate courses"--
