Duct acoustics : fundamentals and applications to mufflers and silencers
"Using a hands-on approach, this self-contained toolkit covers topics ranging from the foundations of duct acoustics to the acoustic design of these devices, through practical modelling, optimization and measurement techniques. Discover in-depth analyses of one- and three-dimensional models of sound generation, propagation and radiation, as techniques for assembling acoustic models of duct systems from simpler components are described. Identify weaknesses of mathematical models in use and improve them by measurement when needed. Cope with challenges in acoustic design, with in-depth understanding of the underlying physics, by using the tools described. An essential reference for engineers and researchers who work on the acoustics of fluid machinery ductworks"--
