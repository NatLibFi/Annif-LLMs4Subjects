SeaCities : aquatic urbanism
This book highlights the research outcome of Cities Research Institute's SeaCities group at Griffith University and a panel with the same title which took place at the World Expo in Dubai 2021/22 supported by the UN. It reflects on topics which are relevant for a future aquatic urbanism like the evolution of a taxonomy for aquatic urbanism, island and ecological wetland development, the planning aspects of seascapes, as well as drivers for floating communities and aquacultural urbanism. The book broadens the perspective of the previous book "SeaCities: Urban Tactics for Sea-Level Rise" published in 2021 from a terrestrial towards an amphibious and aquatic understanding of future city development.
