Michael Graves : buildings and projects 1995 - 2003
Michael Graves has been at the forefront of architecture and design since he founded his practice in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1964. Cited by Paul Goldberger, architecture critic for the New Yorker, as "the most truly original voice American architecture has produced in some time," Graves has received many prestigious awards, including the 1999 National Medal of Arts and the 2001 Gold Medal from the American Institute of Architects. Graves has secured international acclaim and celebrity status for his modern interpretations of traditional and classical architecture and remains one of the profession's most celebrated figures. Presented in this monograph are over 100 of Graves' built and unbuilt projects of the past eight years, generously illustrated with photographs, plans, and the architect's colored sketches
