Steric and stereoelectronic effects in organic chemistry
In this second edition, the author has thoroughly updated each chapter and expanded the content with addition of three new chapters. This book comments on several key aspects of stereochemical control of organic reactions in measured detail to allow the reader easily grasp these concepts. In addition, emphasis is given to key information and important aspects of steric and stereoelectronic effects and their control on conformational profile and reactivity features. This book is not only an indispensable resource for advanced undergraduate and graduate students studying the stereochemical aspects of organic reactions, but also a good reference book for all organic chemists in both industry and academia.
