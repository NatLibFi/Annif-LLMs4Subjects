Spin--Orbit Coupling Effects in Two-Dimensional Electron and Hole Systems
Spin-orbit coupling makes the spin degree of freedom respond to its orbital environment. In solids this yields such intriguing phenomena as a spin splitting of electron states in inversion-asymmetric systems even at zero magnetic field and a Zeeman splitting that is significantly enhanced in magnitude over that for free electrons. This book describes spin-orbit coupling effects in quasi-two-dimensional electron and hole systems. The first part provides a general introduction to the electronic structure of quasi-two-dimensional systems with a particular focus on group-theoretical methods. The main part of the monograph is devoted to spin-orbit coupling phenomena at zero and nonzero magnetic fields. Throughout the book, the main focus is on a thorough discussion of the physical ideas and a detailed interpretation of the results. Accurate numerical calculations are complemented by simple and transparent analytical models that capture the important physics
