Data envelopment analysis with R
Introduction to Data Envelopment Analysis and Fuzzy Sets -- Introductions and Definitions of R -- Basic DEA Models with R Codes -- Advanced DEA Models with R Codes -- Fuzzy Data Envelopment Analysis Models with R Codes.
This book introduces readers to the use of R codes for optimization problems. First, it provides the necessary background to understand data envelopment analysis (DEA), with a special emphasis on fuzzy DEA. It then describes DEA models, including fuzzy DEA models, and shows how to use them to solve optimization problems with R. Further, it discusses the main advantages of R in optimization problems, and provides R codes based on real-world data sets throughout. Offering a comprehensive review of DEA and fuzzy DEA models and the corresponding R codes, this practice-oriented reference guide is intended for masters and Ph.D. students in various disciplines, as well as practitioners and researchers
