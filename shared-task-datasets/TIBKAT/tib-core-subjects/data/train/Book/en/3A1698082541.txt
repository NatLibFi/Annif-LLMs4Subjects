Lectures on quantum mechanics : a primer for mathematicians
"This is a large book with an abundance of topics. I think it well to present something of a guided tour for the prospective reader. Before that, though, allow a bit of advice from an old hand at learning mathematics and physics. The strict training of many students of mathematics imprints a certain psychological pressure on their practice of learning a new topic. Since the rallying cry of pure mathematics, especially in the foundational courses at the advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate levels, is rigorous argument|nothing accepted without airtight proof argued from axioms or theorems|the student often enters the second year of graduate work with a psychological need to learn any new technical subject linearly, accepting nothing until its proof is understood"--
