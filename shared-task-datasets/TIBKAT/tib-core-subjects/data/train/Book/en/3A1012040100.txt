Fractional quantum mechanics
"Fractional quantum mechanics is a recently developed natural generalization of quantum mechanics. This book summarizes fundamentals and applications of fractional quantum mechanics. The book presents the fractional Schrödinger equation, which is a manifestation of fractional quantum mechanics. A new theoretical tool -- fractional path integral -- the path integral over Lévy flights, has been presented. The fractional path integral method enhances the well-known Feynman path integral framework. The book covers related topics on time fractional quantum mechanics, fractional classical mechanics and the [alpha]-stable Lévy random process. The book is helpful as a monograph and a handbook for theorists, pure and applied mathematicians, solid-state physicists and chemists working with the Schrödinger equation, the path integral technique and applications of fractional calculus in different research areas"--
