Solving enterprise applications performance puzzles : queuing models to the rescue
"Poorly performing enterprise applications are the weakest links in corporation's management chains causing delays and disruptions of critical business functions. This groundbreaking book frames enterprise application performance engineering not as an art but as applied science built on model-based methodological foundation. The book introduces queuing models of enterprise application that visualize, demystify, explain, and solve system performance issues. Analysis of the models discovers and clarifies not obvious connections and correlations among workloads, hardware architecture, and software parameters"--
