Handbook of CO₂ in Power Systems
Introduction -- I. Operation System Optimization -- II. Portfolio Operation Optimization -- III. Carbon Capture and Sequestration modeling -- IV. Market mechanisms modeling -- V. System Expansion Optimization -- VI. Carbon funds modeling -- VII. CO2 price forecasting -- VIII. CO2 and other emissions -- IX. CO2 regulation modeling. .
The Handbook of CO₂in Power Systems' objective is to include the state-of-the-art developments that occurred in power systems taking CO₂emission into account. The book includes power systems operation modeling with CO₂emissions considerations, CO₂market mechanism modeling, CO₂regulation policy modeling, carbon price forecasting, and carbon capture modeling. For each of the subjects, at least one article authored by a world specialist on the specific domain is included.
