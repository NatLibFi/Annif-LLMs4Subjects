Desert landscapes of the world with Google Earth
This book presents an introduction to desert landscapesâ€”primarily landforms that are natural and man-made. It is based around the presentation of a series of beautiful and informative annotated Google Earth images. These are accompanied by text that describes the feature(s) concerned, their location, and their origin. There are also, in some cases, ground images taken by the author.
