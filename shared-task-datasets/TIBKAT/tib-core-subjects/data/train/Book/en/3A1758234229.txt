Nonlinear analysis and global optimization
This contributed volume discusses aspects of nonlinear analysis in which optimization plays an important role, as well as topics which are applied to the study of optimization problems. Topics include set-valued analysis, mixed concave-convex sub-superlinear Schroedinger equation, Schroedinger equations in nonlinear optics, exponentially convex functions, optimal lot size under the occurrence of imperfect quality items, generalized equilibrium problems, artificial topologies on a relativistic spacetime, equilibrium points in the restricted three-body problem, optimization models for networks of organ transplants, network curvature measures, error analysis through energy minimization and stability problems, Ekeland variational principles in 2-local Branciari metric spaces, frictional dynamic problems, norm estimates for composite operators, operator factorization and solution of second-order nonlinear difference equations, degenerate Kirchhoff-type inclusion problems, and more.
