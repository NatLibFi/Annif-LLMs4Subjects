Zeolites in catalysis : properties and applications
Covering the breadth of zeolite chemistry and catalysis, this book provides the reader with a complete introduction to field, covering synthesis, structure, characterisation and applications.Beginning with the history of natural and synthetic zeolites, the reader will learn how zeolite structures are formed, synthetic routes, and experimental and theoretical structure determination techniques. Their industrial applications are covered in-depth, from their use in the petrochemical industry, through to fine chemicals and more specialised clinical applications. Novel zeolite materials are covered, including hierarchical zeolites and two-dimensional zeolites, showcasing modern developments in the field. This book is ideal for newcomers who need to get up to speed with zeolite chemistry, and also experienced researchers who will find this a modern, up-to-date guide
