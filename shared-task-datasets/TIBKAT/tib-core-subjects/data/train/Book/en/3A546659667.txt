Color Theory and Modeling for Computer Graphics, Visualization, and Multimedia Applications
Color Theory and Modeling for Computer Graphics, Visualization, and Multimedia Applications deals with color vision and visual computing. This book provides an overview of the human visual system with an emphasis on color vision and perception. The book then goes on to discuss how human color vision and perception are applied in several applications using computer-generated displays, such as computer graphics and information and data visualization. Color Theory and Modeling for Computer Graphics, Visualization, and Multimedia Applications is suitable as a secondary text for a graduate-level course on computer graphics, computer imaging, or multimedia computing and as a reference for researchers and practitioners developing computer graphics and multimedia applications
