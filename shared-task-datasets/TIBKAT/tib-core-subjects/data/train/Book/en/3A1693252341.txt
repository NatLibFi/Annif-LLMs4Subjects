Designing for biodiversity : a technical guide for new and existing buildings
Through written guidance and architectural drawings, this book advises on how to incorporate the provision for biodiversity within developments
The built environment has the potential to have a major impact on biodiversity, not least with the increasingly demanding requirements to design more energy efficient and airtight buildings, leaving less space for species to inhabit. The construction industry has an important role to play in ensuring that buildings are designed and refurbished in a way in which biodiversity can be enhanced. Through written guidance and architectural drawings, this book advises on how to incorporate provision for biodiversity within developments. With sections on different building-reliant species, general principles for design, ready-made products that be incorporated into designs, and legislation, policy and regulations, this book is an invaluable resource for all architects, ecologists and anyone involved in designing or briefing for biodiversity in buildings
