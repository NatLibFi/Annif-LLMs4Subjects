Progressive thermochemical biorefining technologies
"Considering the deleterious impacts of fossil fuels on the environmental and natural ecosystems, it has become imperative to make a paradigm shift towards renewable fuels, chemicals and materials. The exhaustive everyday usage of fossil fuels and processed petrochemical products are the leading cause for the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, global warming, climate changes, acid rain, ozone layer depletion, pollution of air, water and soil as well as accumulation of non-biodegradable materials in the soil and oceans. On the contrary, biofuels, biochemicals and biomaterials derived from renewable wastes such as non-edible plant biomass (e.g., agricultural and forestry biomass), energy crops, microalgae, municipal solid waste, sewage sludge and other biogenic residues seem to be carbon neutral. Therefore, the global interest in biorefining technologies, especially thermochemical and biological conversion processes are gaining momentum in academic and industrial perspectives. The book offers all-inclusive coverage of the most crucial topics as follows: State-of-the-art information on the production and utilization of biofuels through thermochemical biorefining technologies Conversion of waste biomass through pyrolysis, liquefaction, torrefaction, carbonization, gasification, reforming and other clean technologies Waste-to-energy/chemical generation Fuel upgrading technologies Techno-economic analysis and life-cycle assessment of biorefining processes Persistently fabricated to be instantly applicable, this volume serves as a reference book for undergraduate and graduate students, scientific investigators and research scholars working in the areas relating to energy and fuels"--
