Wireless power transfer technologies for electric vehicles
This book introduces the most state-of-the-art wireless power transfer technologies for electric vehicles from the fundamental theories to practical designs and applications, especially on the circuit analysis methods, resonant compensation networks, magnetic couplers, and related power electronics converters. Moreover, some other necessary design considerations, such as communication systems, detection of foreign and living objects, EMI issues, and battery charging strategies, are also introduced to provide sufficient insights into the industrial applications. Finally, some future points are mentioned in brief. Different from other works, all the WPT technologies in this book are applied in real EV applications, whose effectiveness and reliability have been already tested and verified. From this book, readers who are interested in the area of wireless power transfer can have a broad view of modern WPT technologies. Readers who have no experience in the WPT area can learn the basic concept, analysis methods, and design principles of the WPT system for EV charging. Even for the readers who are occupied in this area, this book also provides rich knowledge on engineering applications and future trends of EV wireless charging. .
