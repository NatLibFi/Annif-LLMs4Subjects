This book examines the experience of neighbourhood planners, analysing what communities have achieved, how they have done so and what went well or badly.
'This book is essential reading for the "citizen planner" because it reflects on the experiences of others to demonstrate how neighbourhood planning can meaningfully harness the social capital of communities, as well as the challenges involved.' Chris Bowden, Navigus Planning  Neighbourhood Planning (NP), introduced by the Localism Act of 2011, is the right for communities to decide the future of the places where they live and work. This book examines the experience of neighbourhood planners, analysing what communities have achieved, how they have done so and what went well or badly.
