Systems biology of cell signaling : recurring themes and quantitative models
"All living cells continually detect and respond to external signals. This is true of prokaryotes, whether they are living alone or in biofilms, and it is even more manifestly true in multicellular eukaryotes, where communication between cells and coordination of the cells' behavior enables the organism to function as a unified whole. In large multicellular organisms like us humans, cells receive signals from their immediate neighbors through short-range signals like neurotransmitters and cell-surface molecules. They receive signals from more distant neighbors via longer-range diffusible molecules like morphogens, and from still-more distant neighbors by means of hormones that flow through the circulatory system. And they receive signals from the outside world via sense organs. Cells also monitor their own internal status, and there is a great deal of overlap between the cellular components involved in cell-cell communication and internal monitoring"--
