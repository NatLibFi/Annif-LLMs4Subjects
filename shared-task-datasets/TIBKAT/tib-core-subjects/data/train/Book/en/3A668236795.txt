Maritime logistics : a complete guide to effective shipping and port management
Current globalisation and borderless operations in manufacturing and services industries are creating a greater demand for international transport and logistics. Maritime (shipping and ports) is one of the key components in this business pattern. It is now estimated that approximately 90 per cent of global trading freights are moved by maritime mode. As this trade increases it is becoming ever more important to have a clear understanding of the way in which freight is transported by sea and the role of ports in this exchange. Maritime Logistics examines the latest development, knowledge and practices taking place in logistics and supply chain within the port and shipping industry. Written by a team of international authors, who provide a truly global perspective on this increasingly key area of logistics, the book covers everything that students of logistics, as well as those working within the industry should know and understand including: shipping lines, container tankers, dry bulk, and port-centric logistics.
