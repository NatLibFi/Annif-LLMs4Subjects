From Newton to Einstein : ask the physicist about mechanics and relativity
Since 2006 the author has run a web site, www.AskThePhysicist.com, where he answers questions about physics. The site is not intended for answering highly technical questions; rather the purpose is to answer, with as little mathematics and formalism as possible, questions from intelligent and curious laypersons. This book is about classical mechanics. Usually 'classical' calls to mind Newtonian mechanics and that is indeed where modern physics started. The bulk of the book is devoted to sections which will contain mainly categorized groups of Q&As from the web site, sort of a Best of Ask the Physicist.
