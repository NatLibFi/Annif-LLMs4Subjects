Nanostructured materials : selected synthesis methods, properties, and applications
Nanostructured Materials: Selected Synthesis Methods, Properties and Applications presents several important recent advances in synthesis methods for nanostructured materials and processing of nano-objects into macroscopic samples, such as nanocrystalline ceramics. This book will not cover the whole spectrum of possible synthesis techniques, which would be limitless, but it presents especially interesting highlights in the domains of research of the editors. Subjects that are covered include the following: *"chimie douce" approaches for preparation of a large variety of nanostructured materials, including metals, alloys, semiconductors and oxides; *hydrothermal synthesis with water as solvent and reaction medium can be specifically adapted to nanostructured materials; *"electrospraying" as a powerful new route for the preparation of nanoparticles, especially of oxides for electroceramics; *nanoparticles processed into nanostructured ceramics, by using dynamic compaction techniques; *applications of nanostructured materials. This book complements the previous volume in this series (P. Knauth, J. Schoonman, eds., Nanocrystalline Metals and Oxides: Selected Properties and Applications, Kluwer, Boston, 2002)
