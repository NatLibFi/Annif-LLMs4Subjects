Safe and Sustainable Transport: A Matter of Quality Assurance
The idea of organising a seminar came from a presentation by a Swedish representative of the "Vision Zero" programme. The basic idea of "Vision Zero" is that no person should be killed or seriously and permanently impaired in a road traffic accident. At the invitation of the Czech authorities, the seminar was held in March 2002 in Prague. Many governmental and non-governmental organisations responsible for road safety policies and work participated in the event.
