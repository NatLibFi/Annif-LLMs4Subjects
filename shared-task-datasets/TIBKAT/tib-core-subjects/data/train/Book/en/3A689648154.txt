Smart grid communications and networking
"The smart grid will transform the way power is delivered, consumed and accounted for. Adding intelligence through the newly networked grid will increase reliability and power quality, improve responsiveness, increase efficiency and provide a platform for new applications. This one-stop reference covers the state-of-the-art theory, key strategies, protocols, applications, deployment aspects and experimental studies of communication and networking technologies for the smart grid. Through the book's 20 chapters, a team of expert authors cover topics ranging from architectures and models through to integration of plug-in hybrid vehicles and security. Essential information is provided for researchers to make progress in the field and to allow power systems engineers to optimize communication systems for the smart grid"--
