The Sedimentology of Chalk
The Sedimentology of Chalk describes processes that caused the rhythmic, vertical variation in grain size, structures and authigenic mineral concentrations. Special attention is given to Late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary, subtropical, shallow marine, fine-grained, detrital bioclastic carbonates of northwest Europe. Numerical models are presented that enable the simulation of the genesis of flint nodule layers, hard grounds and complex wavy bedded sequences, such as the K/T boundary sequence of Stevns Klint (Denmark). The book is of interest to sedimentary geologists working on depositional and diagenetic features in carbonates
