Object-oriented construction handbook : developing application-oriented software with the tools & materials approach
Object-oriented programming (OOP) has been the leading paradigm for developing software applications for at least 20 years. Many different methodologies, approaches, and techniques have been created for OOP, such as UML, Unified Process, design patterns, and eXtreme Programming. Yet, the actual process of building good software, particularly large, interactive, and long-lived software, is still emerging. Software engineers familiar with the current crop of methodologies are left wondering, how does all of this fit together for designing and building software in real projects? This handbook from one of the world's leading software architects and his team of software engineers presents guidelines on how to develop high-quality software in an application-oriented way. It answers questions such as: * How do we analyze an application domain utilizing the knowledge and experience of the users? * What is the proper software architecture for large, distributed interactive systems that can utilize UML and design patterns? * Where and how should we utilize the techniques and methods of the Unified Process and eXtreme Programming? This book brings together the best of research, development, and day-to-day project work. "The strength of the book is that it focuses on the transition from design to implementation in addition to its overall vision about software development." -Bent Bruun Kristensen, University of Southern Denmark, Odense
