ESR Spectroscopy in Membrane Biophysics
Starting from a comprehensive quantum mechanical description, this book introduces the optical (IR, Raman, UV/Vis, CD, fluorescence and laser spectroscopy) and magnetic resonance (1D and 2D-NMR, ESR) techniques. The book offers a timely review of the increasing interest in using spin-label ESR as an alternative structural technique for NMR or X-ray diffraction. Future aspects are treated as well, but only as an illustration of the progress of ESR in this field.
Introduces the optical and magnetic resonance techniques. This book reviews the interest in using spin-label ESR as an alternative structural technique for NMR or X-ray diffraction. It is aimed at training an audience to learn ESR spectroscopy to determine membrane protein structures, conformational dynamics and protein-lipid interaction
