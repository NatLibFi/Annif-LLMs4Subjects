Weyl Transforms
This book is an outgrowth of courses given by me for graduate students at York University in the past ten years. The actual writing of the book in this form was carried out at York University, Peking University, the Academia Sinica in Beijing, the University of California at Irvine, Osaka University, and the University of Delaware. The idea of writing this book was ?rst conceived in the summer of 1989, and the protracted period of gestation was due to my daily duties as a professor at York University. I would like to thank Professor K. C. Chang, of Peking University; Professor Shujie Li, of the Academia Sinica in Beijing; Professor Martin Schechter, of the University of California at Irvine; Professor Michihiro Nagase, of Osaka University; and Professor M. Z. Nashed, of the University of Delaware, for providing me with stimulating environments for the exchange of ideas and the actual writing of the book. We study in this book the properties of pseudo-differential operators arising in quantum mechanics, ?rst envisaged in [33] by Hermann Weyl, as bounded linear 2 n operators on L (R ). Thus, it is natural to call the operators treated in this book Weyl transforms.
