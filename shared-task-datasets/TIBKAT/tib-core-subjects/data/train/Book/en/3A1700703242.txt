Distributed energy management of electrical power systems
"The ever-growing demand, rising penetration level of renewable generation, and increasing complexity of electric power systems, pose new challenges to control, operation, management and optimization of power grids. Conventional centralized control structure requires a complex communication network with two-way communication links and a powerful central controller to process large amount of data, which reduces overall system reliability and increases its sensitivity to failures, thus it may not be able to operate under the increased number of distributed renewable generation units. Distributed control strategy enables easier scalability, simpler communication network, and faster distributed data processing, which can facilitate highly efficient information sharing and decision making"--
