Field guide to crystal growth
Crystal structures and crystal systems -- Crystal growth phenomena -- Crystallizer design -- Growth of triglycine sulfate crystals in space -- Liquid growth: liquid-solid phase transformation -- Crystal growth from vapor phase
"Crystal growth is the art and science of growing crystals to facilitate high-technology applications in lasers, semiconducting devices, computers, magnetic and optical devices, optical processors, and pharmaceuticals, among others. This Field Guide examines the basic phenomena and techniques of growing bulk single crystals from solution, melt, and vapors. Some techniques for growth in the microgravity environment of space are also addressed. Other topics include how to choose the right crystallization method (concentration gradient or thermal gradient) based on the physical and chemical properties of the system, and the best solvents, agents, and temperatures to produce high-quality crystals"--
