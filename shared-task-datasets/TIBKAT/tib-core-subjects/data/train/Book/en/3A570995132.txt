NMR in biological systems : from molecules to humans
During teaching NMR to students and researchers, we felt the need for a text-book which can cover modern trends in the application of NMR to biological systems. This book caters to the needs of: (i) graduate students who mostly learn such techniques from senior post-docs in the laboratory; (ii) those who are not experts in NMR but wish to understand if a particular problem in animal, plant, medical and pharmaceutical sciences can be answered by NMR; and (iii) those who are experts in chemistry and biochemistry and wish to know how NMR can provide them information on structural or functional aspect of proteins, nucleic acids, cells and tissues, human and plant organs and other biological materials. This book builds a means of knowledge transfer between the beginners and the experts in NMR as applied to all aspects of life sciences.
