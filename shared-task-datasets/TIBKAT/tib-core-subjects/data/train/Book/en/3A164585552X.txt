Computational Geometry is an area that provides solutions to geometric problems which arise in applications including Geographic Information Systems, Robotics and Computer Graphics. This Handbook provides an overview of key concepts and results in Computational Geometry. It may serve as a reference and study guide to the field. Not only the most advanced methods or solutions are described, but also many alternate ways of looking at problems and how to solve them
