Technology management : activities and tools
"The Technology Management (TM) discipline has a history of more than 50 years. It is inherently interdisciplinary and multifunctional, and when managed correctly it can deliver a decisive competitive advantage.  Technology Management focuses on the micro-level analysis of TM as a dynamic capability. This fully updated second edition systematically addresses the major tools and techniques needed for a business to successfully conduct their TM activities. There is no single best way to manage technology in a company and there is no mechanistic route to success, but this accessible handbook provides a wealth of international examples, up-to-date case studies and activities designed to increase the dynamic capability of an organisation.  Technology Management is the perfect companion for undergraduate and postgraduate students on a variety of Business, Management and Engineering degree courses. "--
