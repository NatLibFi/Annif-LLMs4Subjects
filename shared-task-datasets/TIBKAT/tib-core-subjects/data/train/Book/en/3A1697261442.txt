Non-traditional and advanced machining technologies
"This volume covers the technologies, machine tools, and operations of non-traditional machining processes, and assisted machining technologies. Two separate chapters of this volume deal with the machining techniques of difficult-to-cut materials, such as stainless, super alloys, ceramics, and composites. Design for machining, accuracy and surface integrity of machined parts, environment-friendly machine tools and operations, and hexapods are also presented. The topics covered throughout this volume reflect the rapid and significant advances that have occurred in various areas in machining technologies and are organized and described in such a manner to draw the interest of the reader. The treatments are aimed at motiving and challenging the reader to explore viable solutions to a variety of questions regarding product design and optimum selection of machining operations for a given task"--
