Photoelectron Spectroscopy : Principles and Applications
Photoelectron Spectroscopy presents an up-to-date introduction to the field by comprehensively treating the electronic structures of atoms, molecules, solids, and surfaces. Brief descriptions are given of inverse photoemission, spin-polarized photoemission and photoelectron diffraction. Experimental aspects are considered throughout the book and the results are carefully interpreted in terms of the theory. A wealth of measured data is presented in tabular form for easy use by experimentalists. This new edition has been substantially updated and extended
