Stochastic Models for Laser Propagation in Atmospheric Turbulence
This monograph considers stochastic models for laser propagation in atmospheric turbulence in a Hilbert space context. The laser beam intensity is formulated as the solution to a random Schroedinger equation. This model is considered as an abstract bilinear system with a multiplicative white noise input. This monograph applied the Hilbert space valued white noise theory to the laser distortion problem and relates it to the Wiener process formulation. This monograph will be of interest to researchers working in stochastic differential equations, as well as engineers and physicists working in atmoshperic optics. The monograph is intended for readers who have taken a graduate course in functional analysis and probability
