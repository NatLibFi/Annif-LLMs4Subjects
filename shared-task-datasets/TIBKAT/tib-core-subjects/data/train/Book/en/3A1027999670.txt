Photosynthetic protein-based photovoltaics
"Photosynthetic protein complexes have an overall quantum yield close to 100%. Photovoltaic devices using protein complexes can provide an economical alternative to existing solar cells. This book explains how to build and improve the efficiency of protein solar energy conversion devices based on the present understanding of the photosynthetic proteins"--
