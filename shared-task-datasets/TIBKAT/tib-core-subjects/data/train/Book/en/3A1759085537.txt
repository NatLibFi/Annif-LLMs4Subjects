Handbook of the Tutte polynomial and related topics
"The Tutte Polynomial touches on nearly every area of combinatorics as well as many other fields, including statistical mechanics, coding theory, and DNA sequencing. It is one of the most studied graph polynomials. Handbook of the Tutte Polynomial and Related Topics is the first handbook published on the Tutte Polynomial. It consists of thirty-four chapters, written by experts in the field, that collectively offer a concise overview of the polynomial's many properties and applications. Features: Written in an accessible style for non-experts yet extensive enough for experts; Serves as a comprehensive and accessible introduction to the theory of graph polynomials for researchers in mathematics, physics, and computer science;  Provides an extensive reference volume for the evaluations, theorems, and properties of the Tutte polynomial and related graph, matroid, and knot invariants; Offers broad coverage, touching on the wide range of applications of the Tutte polynomial and its various specializations"--
