Bulk amorphous alloys : preparation and fundamental characteristics
Interest in bulk amorphous alloys has increased rapidly throughout the world and these materials have now gained a position of great importance in basic science and engineering materials technology. Bulk amorphous alloys based upon the Zr-Al-Ni-Cu, Zr-(Ti,Nb)-Al-Ni-Cu and Zr-Ti-Ni-Cu-Be systems have already achieved wide commercial success as components of various tehnical accessories ranging from sporting goods to optical instruments.Here is a state-of-the art review on this new group of materials, covering all areas of interest, ranging from the synthesis of these special alloys and their fundamental properties, to their engineering characteristics and applications. This work will therefore be of equal interest to those who wish to become fully acquainted with the subject, and to those who are already actively engaged in the field. 1.
