Analytic Number Theory
The Idea of Analytic Number Theory -- The Partition Function -- The Erd?s-Fuchs Theorem -- Sequences without Arithmetic Progressions -- The Waring Problem -- A “Natural” Proof of the Nonvanishing of L-Series -- Simple Analytic Proof of the Prime Number Theorem.
Analytic Number Theory presents some of the central topics in number theory in a simple and concise fashion. It covers an amazing amount of material, despite the leisurely pace and emphasis on readability. The author's heartfelt enthusiasm enables readers to see what is magical about the subject. Topics included are: The Partition Function; The Erdös-Fuchs Theorem; Sequences without Arithmetic Professions; The Waring Problem; A "Natural" Proof of the Non-vanishing of L-Series, and a Simple Analytic Proof of the Prime Number Theorem - all presented in a surprisingly elegant and efficient manner with clever examples and interesting problems in each chapter. This text is suitable for a graduate course in analytic number theory.
