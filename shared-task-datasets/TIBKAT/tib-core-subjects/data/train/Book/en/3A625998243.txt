Tertiary Education for the Knowledge Society : Volume 1 and Volume 2
This book provides a thorough international investigation of tertiary education policy across its many facets – governance, funding, quality assurance, equity, research and innovation, academic career, links to the labour market and internationalisation. It presents an analysis of the trends and developments in tertiary education; a synthesis of research-based evidence on the impact of tertiary-education policies; innovative and successful policies and practices that countries have implemented; and tertiary-education policy options. The report draws on the results of a major OECD review of tertiary education policy – the OECD Thematic Review of Tertiary Education -- conducted over the 2004-08 period in collaboration with 24 countries around the world. “The new ‘bible’ of Post-secondary education.” -Paul Cappon, President of the Canadian Council on Learning “An exceptionally useful and interesting review.” -Tom Boland, Chief Executive, Higher Education Authority of Ireland “The reference text for the future debate on tertiary education.” -José Joaquín Brunner, Professor and Director, Centre for Comparative Education Policies, University of Diego Portales, Chile
