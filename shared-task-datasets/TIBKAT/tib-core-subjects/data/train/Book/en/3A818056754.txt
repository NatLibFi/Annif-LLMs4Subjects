"With its 80 years of experience in bringing together architecture and engineering Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) remains groundbreaking to this day, particularly in construction of gigantic skyscrapers, the so-called "supertalls". The fourth volume of the DETAIL engineering series presents the approaches, the roots and the theoretical background of the SOM Structural Group. One central question is how far architecture can go - in terms of height. Typical structural concepts and individual details from numerous projects across the world serve to illustrate processes of solution finding. The results illustrate the firm's core values: simplicity, clarity, hierarchy, efficiency, economy and advancement. A number of iconic SOM buildings such as the John Hancock Center and the Sears Tower help to position the example projects - ranging from James Turrell's Skyspace to Burj Khalifa - within the context of SOM's complete work. The innovative structural solutions presented here indicate how SOM enables the creation of "next generation" buildings".-Back cover
