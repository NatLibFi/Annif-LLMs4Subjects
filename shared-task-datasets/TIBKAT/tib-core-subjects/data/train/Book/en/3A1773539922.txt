This second edition volume is a companion volume to the previous edition and looks at new findings on novel bioactive chemicals and cognate targets, as well as the use of synthetic small molecules and a variety of tools to understand these processes. Chapters in this book cover topics such as screening plants for novel bioactive chemicals including lipid signaling and photo receptors; small molecule screens to include peptide ligands to generate new variations; using new chemicals to affect and dissect hormone signaling; and the application of easier microscale methods to simplify target identification and validation. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Cutting-edge and practical, Plant Chemical Genomics: Methods and Protocols, Second Edition is a valuable resource that provides a foundation of techniques for novice and expert researchers in the plant chemical biology community.
