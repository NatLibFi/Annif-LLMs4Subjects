Contact, adhesion and rupture of elastic solids
This book is based on the analogy between contact mechanics and fracture mechanics as proposed by the author about twenty years ago. It starts with a chapter devoted to the surface energy and tension of solids and surface thermodynamics, which is followed by a chapter on elastic recall. The methods of Muskhelichvili and Hankel transforms for the resolution of plane and axisymmetric problems are studied. Then the essential conepts of fracture mechanics are presented with emphasis on the thermodynamic aspect of the problem. The reader will find complete analytical results and detailed calculations for cracks submitted to pressure distributions and the Dugdale model, as well as a chapter on contact mechanics. The contact and adherence of rough solids is also studied. This book is intended for advanced students and researchers working in the fields of fracture mechanics or adhesion
