Handbook of research on comparative human resource management
The Handbook of Research on Comparative Human Resource Management provides a theoretical, practical and regional analysis of comparative HRM. This book, edited by two specialists on comparative HRM and written by leading experts on each topic and from each region, explores the range of different approaches to conceptualising HRM, and highlights HRM policy and practice that occur in the various regions of the world. As such, the volume provides a challenge to the typical assumption that there are consistent problems in managing human resources around the globe that call for standardised solutions. Instead, the contributors emphasise the importance of institutional and cultural factors that make HRM a most context-sensitive management task. -- Offering a comprehensive view for readers with different interests, this insightful Handbook will prove to be an essential resource for academics, researchers and postgraduate students in international business, business administration, HRM, socio-economics and cross-cultural management. Practitioners interested in the cultural aspects of HRM will also find this Handbook invaluable. -- ‘As the world becomes “flatter” and more interconnected, questions arise about the future of HRM. Which HRM systems are beginning or will begin to converge globally? Which systems will likely remain constrained by institutions or national culture and why? This book brings together the leading academic authorities and provides the essential starting point to answering these pressing questions.’ (Patrick Wright, Cornell University, US).
