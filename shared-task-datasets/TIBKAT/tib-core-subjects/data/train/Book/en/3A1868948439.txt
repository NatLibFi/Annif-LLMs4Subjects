Embracing natural design : inspired living
"Through beautifully photographed residences, which have an exquisite layering of classic and modern furnishings, Stephanie Kienle Gonzalez discusses how to bring sustainable elements into your living space. She employs organic forms, stone and wood pieces, and natural weaves with texture, such as seagrass, caning, bamboo, and rattan. For her urban dwelling she adds tropical greenery and flowers to enliven the interiors, and her eco-friendly family lodge, immersed in the bush wilderness, is surrounded by lush plantings. International designers and artists who have inspired her are also profiled--from sustainable architect Elora Hardy to designers India Hicks, Nate Berkus, and Kenneth Cobonpue. Full of design and entertaining ideas, Embracing Natural Design is for those who are interested in achieving an environmentally conscious lifestyle."
