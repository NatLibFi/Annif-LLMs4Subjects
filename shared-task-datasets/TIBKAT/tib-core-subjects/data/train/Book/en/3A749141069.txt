Realization Probabilities : The Dynamics of Queuing Systems
The theory of the operation of many modern man-made discrete event systems such as manufacturing systems, computer and communications networks largely belongs in the domain of queuing theory and operations research. However, some recent research indicates that the evolution of these man-made systems demonstrates dynamic features that are similar to those of natural physical systems. This monograph presents a multidisciplinary approach to the study of discrete event systems, and is complementary to textbooks in queuing and control systems theories
