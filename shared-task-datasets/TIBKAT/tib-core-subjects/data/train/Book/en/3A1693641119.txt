Thermodynamics problem solving in physical chemistry : study guide and map
"This innovative and unique workbook and "map" guides physical chemistry students through the decisions to be made to assess a problem situation, create appropriate solutions, and gain confidence through practice solving physical chemistry problems. The workbook includes six major sections with 20 - 30 solved problems in each section that span from easy, single objective questions to difficult, multistep analysis problems. Each section of the workbook has "key points" that highlight major features of the topic to remind students of what they need to apply to solve problems in the topic area. Consequently, the workbook and map can act as a "test" review for the students"--
