Recent Developments in Biomolecular NMR
NMR spectroscopy is widely used in biomolecular science particularly for structure determination of proteins, nucleic acids and carbohydrates. Much of the innovation within NMR spectroscopy has been within the field of protein NMR spectroscopy, an important technique in structural biology. Filling a gap in the literature, this book will draw together experts in the field to discuss the real advances in NMR methods that have occurred or have an impact on the biomolecular field in the last few years. The coverage will include recent developments in using NMR for determination of protein structur
