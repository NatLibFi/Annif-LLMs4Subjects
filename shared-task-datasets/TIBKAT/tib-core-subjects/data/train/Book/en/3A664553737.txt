The Boundary Theory of Phase Diagrams and Its Application : Rules for Phase Diagram Construction with Phase Regions and Their Boundaries
The Boundary Theory of Phase Diagrams and Its Application -- Rules for Phase Diagram Construction with Phase Regions and Their Boundaries presents a novel theory of phase diagrams. Thoroughly revised on the basis of the Chinese edition and rigorously reviewed, this book inspects the general feature and structure of phase diagrams, and reveals that there exist actually two categories of boundaries. This innovative boundary theory has solved many difficulties in understanding phase diagrams, and also finds its application in constructing multi-component phase diagrams or in calculating high-pressure phase diagrams. Researchers and engineers as well as graduate students in the areas of chemistry, metallurgy and materials science will benefit from this book. Prof. Muyu Zhao was the recipient of the 1998 Prize for Progress in Science and Technology (for his work on the boundary theory of phase diagrams) awarded by the National Commission of Education, China, and many other prizes.
