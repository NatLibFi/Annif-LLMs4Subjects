Pressure oscillations in biomedical diagnostics and therapy
"The intent of this book is to inform the reader about therapeutic and diagnostic methods, primarily focusing on the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems that utilize acoustics (mechanical wave motion). Basic background in relevant acoustic theory and specific technical information associated with medical applications are provided. Low frequency acoustics (pressure oscillation) and some aspects of ultrasound (radiation force) are reviewed. The book aims to link pressure oscillation (PO) and biomedical diagnostics/therapy for scholars/practitioners. The initial chapter covers wave theory and its usefulness in imaging, diagnostics, and therapy. The remainder is broken into two parts: imaging and diagnostics, and lung therapy. Each part translates the wave thread through discussion/application of vibrations, oscillations, and/or pressure. Wave theory is presented as a relevant and unique model that, if understood/harnessed, will improve treatments for patients suffering from diseases of the arteries/lungs. The areas of application covered in this text are far-reaching in society. Arterial disease, sleep apnoea, asthma, and respiratory distress syndrome are diagnoses with continuous interest and desire to improve quality of life, as well as life expectancy, for patients. A better understanding of wave application in these areas potentially improves treatment at the practitioner level and opens doors to further investigate these diseases from a researcher's perspective"--
