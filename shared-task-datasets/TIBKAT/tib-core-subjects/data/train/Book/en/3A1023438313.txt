Handbook of critical issues in finance
This vital Handbook is an authoritative volume presenting key issues in finance that have been widely discussed in the financial markets but have been neglected in textbooks and the usual compilations of conventional academic wisdom. A wide range of topics including the recent economic crisis, capital controls, the Franc Zone, quantitative easing and securitization, as well as the key controversies associated with them, are explored and explained in depth by well-known authorities in finance and economics. Designed to complement and expand upon standard textbooks as well as the specialist critical literature on particular topics in finance, this informative Handbook will prove invaluable to academics, researchers and students focusing on economics, finance and heterodox economics
