Life with Hubble : an insider's view of the world's most famous telescope
The Hubble Space Telescope is one of the most important scientific and engineering endeavors of our time. It has given humankind the first truly clear view of the heavens and has revolutionized almost every area of modern astronomy. The author this text, David Leckrone, worked as a project scientist on Hubble for 33 years. From 1992-2009 he was the Senior Project Scientist for Hubble at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. In that role he had an insider's view of the trials and triumphs of the Hubble mission, including its extraordinary scientific discoveries and the personal journeys of the astronomers who made them, the adventure of five successful shuttle-based servicing missions, and the quiet heroism of the many scientists, engineers and managers who rose to the occasion when Hubble was in trouble. This book is loosely a personal memoir but can more accurately be called a "Hubble family memoir" for which Leckrone serves as narrator.
