Data wrangling with JavaScript
Why not handle your data analysis in JavaScript?  Modern libraries and data handling techniques mean you can collect, clean, process, store, visualize, and present web application data while enjoying the efficiency of a single-language pipeline and data-centric web applications that stay in JavaScript end to end.  "Data wrangling with JavaScript" promotes JavaScript to the center of the data analysis stage!  With this hands-on guide, you'll create a JavaScript-based data processing pipeline, handle common and exotic data, and master practical troubleshooting strategies.  You'll also build interactive visualizations and deploy your apps to production.  Each valuable chapter provides a new component for your reusable data wrangling toolkit
