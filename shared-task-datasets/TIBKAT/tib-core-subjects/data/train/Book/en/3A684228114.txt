Children without permanent parents : research, practice, and policy
"This monograph reviews the research, practice, and policy literatures pertaining to children without permanent parents, most of whom spend their early months or years in institutions.  Institutionalized children are typically more than a standard deviation below noninstitutionalized children in general physical and behavioral/cognitive development. Although they display marked catch-up growth after transitioning to adoptive or foster families, some deficiencies persist."--Abstract
