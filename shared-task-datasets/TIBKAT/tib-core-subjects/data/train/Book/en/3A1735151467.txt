Nonconservative stability problems of modern physics
This updated revision gives a complete and topical overview on Nonconservative Stability which is essential for many areas of science and technology ranging from particles trapping in optical tweezers and dynamics of subcellular structures to dissipative and radiative instabilities in fluid mechanics, astrophysics and celestial mechanics. The author presents relevant mathematical concepts as well as rigorous stability results and numerous classical and contemporary examples from non-conservative mechanics and non-Hermitian physics. New coverage of ponderomotive magnetism, experimental detection of Ziegler’s destabilization phenomenon and theory of double-diffusive instabilities in magnetohydrodynamics
