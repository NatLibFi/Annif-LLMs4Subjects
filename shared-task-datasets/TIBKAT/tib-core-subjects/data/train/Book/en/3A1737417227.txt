Sustainability of biomass through bio-based chemistry
"The process of photosynthesis is a potential source of energy and bioproducts. Renewable sources of polymeric materials offer an answer to maintaining sustainable development of economically and ecologically attractive technology. The innovations in the development of materials from biopolymers, preservation of fossil-based raw materials, complete biological degradability, reduction in the volume of garbage and compostability in the natural cycle, climate protection through reduction of carbon dioxide released, and the application possibilities of agricultural resources for the production of bio/green materials, are some of the reasons why such materials are attracting the public interest"--
