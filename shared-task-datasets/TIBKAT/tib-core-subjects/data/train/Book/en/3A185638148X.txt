Polynomial sequences : basic methods, special classes, and computational applications
Polynomials are useful tools, are simply defined, easy to calculate, and integrate and can be pieced together to form spline functions. Classes of polynomials are used in many fields of science. There is a trove of material available on existing polynomials, specific classes and applications, but it is not presented coherently. This volume solves this issue by introducing a systematic study of sequences of polynomials and related applications; Presents the latest developments in polynomial sequences; Provides a simple and systematic treatment, that will appeal to readers; Can be used as a tool for reseachers or in advanced graduate courses.
