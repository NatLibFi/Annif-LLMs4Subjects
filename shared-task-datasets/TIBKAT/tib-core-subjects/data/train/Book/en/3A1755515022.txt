Artificial intelligence applications in electrical transmission and distribution systems protection
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) can successfully help in solving real-world problems in power transmission and distribution systems as AI-based schemes are fast, adaptive, and robust and are applicable without any knowledge of the system parameters. This book considers the application of AI methods for the protection of different types and topologies of transmission and distribution lines. It explains the latest pattern-recognition- based methods as applicable to detection, classification, and location of a fault in the transmission and distribution lines, and to manage smart power systems including all the pertinent aspects. Features: Provides essential insight on uses of different AI techniques for pattern recognition, classification, prediction, and estimation, exclusive to power system protection issues. Presents introduction to enhanced electricity system analysis using decision-making tools. Covers AI Applications in different protective relaying functions.  Discusses Issues and challenges in the protection of transmission and distribution systems. Includes dedicated chapter on case studies, and applications. This book is aimed at Graduate students, Researchers and Professionals in Electrical Power System Protection, Stability, and Smart Grids"--
