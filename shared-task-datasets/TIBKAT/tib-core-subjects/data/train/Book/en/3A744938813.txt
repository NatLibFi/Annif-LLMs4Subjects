Basic Semiconductor Physics
This book presents a detailed description of the basic physics of semiconductors. All the important equations describing the properties of these materials are derived without the help of other textbooks. The reader is assumed to have only a basic command of mathematics and some elementary semiconductor physics. The text covers a wide range of important semiconductor phenomena, from the simple to the advanced. Examples include recent progress in semiconductor quantum structures such as two-dimensional electron-gas systems, ballistic transport, the quantum Hall effect, the Landauer formula, the Coulomb blockade and the single-electron transistor
