Dynamics of materials : experiments, models and applications
"This book comprehensively addresses its topic in three sections. The first discusses different perspectives on the volumetric law, including its macro-thermodynamic basis, solid physics basis and the related dynamic experimental study. The second covers the distortional law, including the rate-dependent macro-distortional law reflecting strain-rate effect, its micro-mechanism based on dislocation dynamics, and the dynamic experimental research based on the stress wave theory. In the final part, dynamic failure in relation to dynamic damage evolution is discussed, including the unloading failure of a crack-free body, dynamics of cracks under high strain-rate, dynamic fragmentation due to dynamic growth of multi-cracks, and the dynamic evolution of meso-damage as well as macro-damage. Dynamics of Materials provides a theoretical basis of material dynamics for researchers and postgraduate students in engineering and materials science, while also offering models and examples of applications of these theories which are of great value to R&D departments in industry"--
