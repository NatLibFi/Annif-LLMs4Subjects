Design of low-power coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures
"Presenting new approaches to reconfigurable architectures for embedded systems, this book discusses the design and implementation of coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures (CGRAs). It provides novel techniques for designing CGRA-based systems. Focusing on low-power reconfiguration techniques, the text highlights the tradeoffs between performance and power in CGRAs and details integrated low-power design approaches. The authors outline the history and emerging research of CGRAs. They also cover dynamic context management and compression for low-power CGRAs as well as hierarchical reconfigurable computing arrays"--
