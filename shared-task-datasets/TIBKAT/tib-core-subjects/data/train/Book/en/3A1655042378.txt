Geometry : A High School Course
A geometry course based on this book was taught success­ fully by Gene Murrow for several years. We are much indebted to Springer-Verlag for publishing Geometry, so that others can try our approach. The publishers and we thought it would be appropriate to issue the book first in a preliml. nary edition, on which we would welcome comments, especially from students and teachers of the high school geometry course. Such comments can bear on any aspect of Geometry, ranging from the choice of topics, the ordering of the topics, and other global considerations, to possible computational errors and misprints. We shall welcome criticisms and suggestions. Serge Lang Gene Murrow Contents Theorems Proved in Geometry xi xvii Introduction CHAPTER 1 -Distance and Angles 51. Lines 1 52. Distance 12 53.
