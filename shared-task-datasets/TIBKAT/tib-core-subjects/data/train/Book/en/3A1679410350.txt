Wayfinding, consumption, and air terminal design
"This book investigates how international air terminals organize passenger movement and generate spending. It offers a new understanding of how their architecture and artworks operate visually to guide people through the space and affect their behaviour. Menno Hubregtse's research draws upon numerous airport visits and interviews with architects and planners as well as documents and articles that address these terminals' development, construction, and renovations. The book establishes the main concerns of architects with respect to wayfinding strategies and analyzes how air terminal architecture, artworks, and interior design contribute to the airport's operations. The book will be of interest to art historians, architectural historians, practising architects, urban planners, airport specialists, and geographers"--
