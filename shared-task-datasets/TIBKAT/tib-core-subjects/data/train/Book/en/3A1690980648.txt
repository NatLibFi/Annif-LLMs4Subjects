Hencky bar-chain/net for structural analysis
"As an emerging discrete structural model, the Hencky bar-chain/net model (HBM) has shown its advantages over other numerical methods in some problems. Owing to the discrete properties of HBM, it is also a suitable model for nano-scale structures which are currently a very hot research topic in mechanics. This book introduces the concepts and previous research of the Hencky bar-chain/net model, before demonstrating how beams, columns, arches, rectangular plates and circular plates could be successfully modelled by HBM. HBM comprises rigid bars connected by frictionless hinges with elastic rotational springs (and a system of torsional springs in the cells for plates). In the treatment of the above-mentioned structures, HBM is found to be mathematically equivalent to the first order central finite difference method (FDM). So HBM may be regarded as the physical structural model behind the FDM. This book is a compilation of the authors' research on the development of the Hencky bar-chain/net model, and is organized according to the development and application of HBM for beams, columns, frames, arches and rings, and plates. Exercises are provided at the end of each chapter to aid comprehension and guide learning. It is a useful reference for students, researchers, academics and practitioners in the field of structural analysis"--
