The Routledge handbook on cities of the Global South
"Massive demographic and economic changes over the last three decades mean that cities that have typically been highly profiled within urban studies are no longer reflective of the hubs of urbanization, or contemporary global urban problems. This Handbook offers a shift in orientation bringing into conversation a wide array of cities across the Global South, exploring the ordinary city, the mega city and the peripheral city, with discussion of cities that have not previously been the object of scholarly reflection. The Handbook assesses what a geographical corrective in representation, process and voice might mean for urban analysis and theory. Profiling an emergent and diverse body of work on cities from physical, social and economic perspectives, it draws on conflicting and divergent debates to open up discussion on the precise meaning of the city in, or of, the Global South. The notion that the definition of the global South is fluid and increasingly contested is embraced within this Handbook, both geographically and conceptually. This Southern (re)framing of urban analysis challenges the intellectual status quo and makes way for new modes of illuminating the drivers of urban change that are typically associated with Southern urban realties"--
