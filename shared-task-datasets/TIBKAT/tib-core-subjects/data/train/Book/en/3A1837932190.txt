For courses in Control Theory. Progressively develop students' problem-solving skills through an integrated design and analysis approach to real-world engineering problems Modern Control Systems presents the structure of feedback control theory and provides a sequence of exciting discoveries as students proceed through the text and problems. Written to be equally useful for all engineering disciplines, this text is organized around the concepts of control systems theory in the context of frequency and time domains. It provides coverage of both classical and modern methods of control engineering to give students a strong foundation in basic principles that they can utilize to explore advanced topics in later chapters. Emphasis is placed on real-world complex control systems and practical design applications as well as evolving design strategies like green engineering and human-centered design. Problem solving is strongly emphasized, with an abundance of problems of increasing complexity that help students learn to apply theory to computer-aided design and analysis concepts using MATLABÂ® and LabVIEW MathScript. The 14th Edition incorporates over 20% new or updated problems, with a total of over 980 end-of-chapter exercises, problems, advanced problems, design problems, and computer problems.
