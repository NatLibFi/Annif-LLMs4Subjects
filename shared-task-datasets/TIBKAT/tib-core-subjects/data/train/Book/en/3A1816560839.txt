Engineering geophysics
"Engineering Geophysics connects onshore geotechnical engineering challenges to the geophysical methods which may be applied to solve them. Unknown geological conditions are a risk in construction projects, geophysical information can help to identify those risks. The book answers questions on how, why and when the individual and combined methods provide the results requested. Flowcharts guide the reader to geophysical methods that can be applied for various engineering challenges, and the solutions are illustrated with practical case histories. The book is intended mainly for geotechnical engineers and geologists, but also for geophysicists or managers in need of an overview or brush up on geophysical methods and their practical applications. In addition, it can be used in both geotechnical and geological educational institutions as a manual for courses for non-geophysicists"--
