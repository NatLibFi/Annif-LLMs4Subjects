Analytic Inequalities : Recent Advances
Grüss- and Čebyšev-type inequalities -- Multidimensional Grüss-Čebyšev and -Trapezoid-type inequalities -- Ostrowski-type inequalities -- Multidimensional Ostrowski-type inequalities -- Inequalities via convex functions.
For more than a century, the study of various types of inequalities has been the focus of great attention by many researchers, interested both in the theory and its applications. In particular, there exists a very rich literature related to the well known Cebysev, Gruss, Trapezoid, Ostrowski, Hadamard and Jensen type inequalities. The present monograph is an attempt to organize recent progress related to the above inequalities, which we hope will widen the scope of their applications. The field to be covered is extremely wide and it is impossible to treat all of these here. The material included in the monograph is recent and hard to find in other books. It is accessible to any reader with a reasonable background in real analysis and an acquaintance with its related areas. All results are presented in an elementary way and the book could also serve as a textbook for an advanced graduate course. The book deserves a warm welcome to those who wish to learn the subject and it will also be most valuable as a source of reference in the field. It will be invaluable reading for mathematicians and engineers and also for graduate students, scientists and scholars wishing to keep abreast of this important area of research.
