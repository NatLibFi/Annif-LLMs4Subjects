The analysis and design of linear circuits
"Electrical circuits are foundational to our society and having the skills to analyze and design them are fundamental engineering tools. A linear circuit is an electronic circuit which obeys the superposition principle. It is called a linear circuit because the output voltage and current of such a circuit are linear functions of its input voltage and current"--
