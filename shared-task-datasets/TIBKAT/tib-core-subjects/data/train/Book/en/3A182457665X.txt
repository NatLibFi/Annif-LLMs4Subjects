Mathematical methods in dynamical systems
"The art of applying mathematics to real world dynamical problems such as structural dynamics, fluid dynamics, wave dynamics, robot dynamics, etc., can be extremely challenging. Mathematical Methods in Dynamical Systems offers problem solving techniques and includes different analytical, semi-analytical, numerical and machine intelligence methods for finding exact and/or approximate solutions of governing equations arising in dynamical systems. It provides a singular source of computationally efficient methods to investigate these systems, and includes coverage of various industrial applications in a simple yet comprehensive way"--
