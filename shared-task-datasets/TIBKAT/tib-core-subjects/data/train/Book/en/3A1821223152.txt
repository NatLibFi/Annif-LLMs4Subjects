Machine learning : theory and practice
"Machine Learning: Theory and Practice provides an introduction to the most popular methods in machine learning. The book covers regression including regularization, tree-based methods including Random Forests and Boosted Trees, Artificial Neural Networks including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), reinforcement learning, and unsupervised learning focused on clustering. Topics are introduced in a conceptual manner along with necessary mathematical details. The explanations are lucid, illustrated with figures and examples. For each machine learning method discussed, the book presents appropriate libraries in the R programming language along with programming examples"--
