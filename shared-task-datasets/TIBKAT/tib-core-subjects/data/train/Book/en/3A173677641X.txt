Generalized synchronization and generalized consensus of system arrays
"What is synchronization? This book will show how the concept of closeness of states or frequencies between two dynamical systems has evolved from synchronization to consensus. Part 1 introduces the concepts and mathematical descriptions of Generalized Synchronization (GS) while Part 2 covers Generalized Consensus (GC). It is suitable for researchers and practitioners undertaking the studies of synchronization and consensus of multi-agent systems, graduate students and senior undergraduate students with the backgrounds in calculus, linear algebra and ordinary differential equations, equipped with computer programming skills, in mathematics, physics, engineering and even social sciences"--
