Conducting polymers-based energy storage materials
"Conducting polymers are organic polymers which contain conjugation along the polymer backbone that conduct electricity. Conducting polymers are promising materials for energy storage applications because of their fast charge-discharge kinetics, high charge density, fast redox reaction, low-cost, ease of synthesis, tunable morphology, high power capability and excellent intrinsic conductivity compared with inorganic-based materials. Conducting Polymers-Based Energy Storage Materials surveys recent advances in conducting polymers and their composites addressing the execution of these materials as electrodes in electrochemical power sources"--
