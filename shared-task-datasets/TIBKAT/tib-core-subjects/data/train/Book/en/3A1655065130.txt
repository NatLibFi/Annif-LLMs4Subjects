Geometry of the Plane Cremona Maps
Preliminaries -- Plane Cremona maps -- Clebsch's theorems and jacobian -- Composition -- Characteristic matrices -- Total principal and special homaloidal curves -- Inverse Cremona map -- Noether's factorization theorem.
This book provides a self-contained exposition of the theory of plane Cremona maps, reviewing the classical theory. The book updates, correctly proves and generalises a number of classical results by allowing any configuration of singularities for the base points of the plane Cremona maps. It also presents some material which has only appeared in research papers and includes new, previously unpublished results. This book will be useful as a reference text for any researcher who is interested in the topic of plane birational maps.
