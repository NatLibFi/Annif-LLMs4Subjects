"The title examines, informs and advances the governance of sustainability transitions through urban living labs (ULL). ULL are increasing across the globe as a means by which actors are testing innovations in buildings, transport and energy systems. The book draws together researchers within a systematic comparative framework for evaluating the design, practices and processes of ULL to enable the analysis of their potential and limits. It provides new insights into the governance of urban sustainability and seeks to improve the design and implementation of ULL in order to realise their potential"--
