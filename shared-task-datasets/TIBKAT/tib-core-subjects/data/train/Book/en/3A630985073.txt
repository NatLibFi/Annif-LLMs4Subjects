Spectral distributions in nuclei and statistical spectroscopy
"This volume contains two components ... a survey of the subject of Statistical Spectroscopy, particularly as the subject applies to atomic nuclei. Second is a collection of 46 papers published between 1966 and 2006 on the subject covered in the survey. Many of these papers, but not all, were written by J. Bruce French and his many collaborators"--Foreword, p. vii
