Proteomic and metabolomic approaches to biomarker discovery
Various techniques are used in the biomarker discovery process, including techniques used in proteomics, the study of the proteins that make up an organism, and  and metabolomics, the study of chemical fingerprints created from cellular processes.  Proteomic and Metabolomic Approaches to Biomarker Discovery is the only publication that covers techniques from both proteomics and metabolomics and includes all steps involved in biomarker discovery, from study design to study execution.      A comprehensive resource for biochemists, biologists, analytical chemists, bioanalyti
