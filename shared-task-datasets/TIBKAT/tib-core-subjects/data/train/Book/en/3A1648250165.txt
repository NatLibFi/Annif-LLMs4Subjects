Single Semiconductor Quantum Dots
This book reviews recent advances in the field of semiconductor quantum dots via contributions from prominent researchers in the scientific community. Special focus is given to optical, quantum optical, and spin properties of single quantum dots.
This book reviews recent advances in the exciting and rapidly growing field of semiconductor quantum dots via contributions from some of the most prominent researchers in the scientific community. Special focus is given to optical, quantum optical, and spin properties of single quantum dots due to their potential applications in devices operating with single electron spins and/or single photons. This includes single and coupled quantum dots in external fields, cavity-quantum electrodynamics, and single and entangled photon pair generation. Single Semiconductor Quantum Dots also addresses growth techniques to allow for a positioned nucleation of dots as well as applications of quantum dots in quantum information technologies.
