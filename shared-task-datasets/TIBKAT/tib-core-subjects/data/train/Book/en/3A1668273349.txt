The architecture of natural cooling
Origins and opportunities -- Principles and strategies -- Climate applicability mapping -- Integrated design -- Testing the strategy -- Performance analysis -- Component design.
"Overheating in buildings is commonplace. This book describes how we can keep cool without conventional air-conditioning: improving comfort and productivity while reducing energy costs and carbon emissions. It provides architects, engineers and policy makers with a 'how-to' guide to the application of natural cooling in new and existing buildings. It demonstrates, through reference to numerous examples, that natural cooling is viable in most climates around the world. The book includes: Guidance on the principles & strategies that can be adopted. Discussion of how designers integrate natural cooling in their buildings. Explanation of simplified tools for performance assessment. A review of components and controls. A detailed evaluation of building case studies from the USA, Europe, India and China. This book is not just for the technical specialist, as it also provides a general grounding in environmental design. Importantly, it demonstrates that understanding our environment, rather than fighting it, will help us to live sustainably in our rapidly warming world"--
