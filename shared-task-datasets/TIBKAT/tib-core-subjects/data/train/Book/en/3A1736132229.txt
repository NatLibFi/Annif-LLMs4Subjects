Hydrocarbons, oils and lipids: diversity, origin, chemistry and fate
This book describes the structural features and properties of important types of hydrocarbons and lipids and gives an overview of their analytical characterization in biological and environmental matrices. It covers the occurrence, biosynthesis and biological functions of these compound types in diverse organisms including bacteria and archaea, algae, higher plants and arthropods. It examines their distribution in the geosphere and fundamental processes controlling the fate of fossil organic matter. Finally, it addresses important aspects of their environmental chemistry and transfer processes between different compartments of bio- and geosphere. Hydrocarbons and lipids comprise extremely diverse organic compounds that play fundamental roles in biosphere and geosphere. They represent important functional components in all living organisms and constitute a major fraction of fossil organic matter in sedimentary systems. All chapters are written by renowned experts in the respective fields.
Part I: Structures and Properties of Hydrocarbons and Lipids -- Part II: Hydrocarbons and Lipids in the Biosphere -- Part III: Hydrocabons and Lipids in the Geosphere -- Part IV: Hydrocarbons and Lipids in the Environment.-.
