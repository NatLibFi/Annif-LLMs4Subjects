Foundations of oscillator circuit design
Oscillators are an important component in today's RF and microwave systems, and practitioners in the field need to know how to design oscillators for stability and top performance. Offering engineers broader coverage than other oscillator design books on the market, this comprehensive resource considers the complete frequency range, from low-frequency audio oscillators to more complex oscillators found at the RF and microwave frequencies. Packed with over 1,200 equations, the book gives professionals a thorough understanding of the principles and practice of oscillator circuit design and emphasizes the use of time-saving CAD (computer aided design) simulation techniques. From the theory and characteristics of oscillators, to the design of a wide variety of oscillators (including tuned-circuit, crystal, negative-resistance, and relaxation oscillators), this unique book is a one-stop reference practitioners can turn to again and again when working on their challenging projects in this field
