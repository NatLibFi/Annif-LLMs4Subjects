Nonlinear Dynamics : Integrability, Chaos and Patterns
Integrability, chaos and patterns are three of the most important concepts in nonlinear dynamics. These are covered in this book from fundamentals to recent developments. The book presents a self-contained treatment of the subject to suit the needs of students, teachers and researchers in physics, mathematics, engineering and applied sciences who wish to gain a broad knowledge of nonlinear dynamics. It describes fundamental concepts, theoretical procedures, experimental and numerical techniques and technological applications of nonlinear dynamics. Numerous examples and problems are included to facilitate the understanding of the concepts and procedures described. In addition to 16 chapters of main material, the book contains 10 appendices which present in-depth mathematical formulations involved in the analysis of various nonlinear systems
