Getting MEAN with Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node
Juggling languages mid-application can radically slow down a full-stack web project.  The MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node) uses JavaScript end to end, maximizing developer productivity and minimizing context switching.  And you'll love the results!  MEAN apps are fast, powerful, and beautiful.  "Getting MEAN, second edition" teaches you how to develop full-stack web applications using the MEAN stack.  Practical from the very beginning, the book helps you create a static site in Express and Node.  Expanding on that solid foundation, you'll integrate a MongoDB database, build an API, and add an authentication system.  Along the way, you'll get countless pro tips for building dynamic and responsive data-driven web applications!
