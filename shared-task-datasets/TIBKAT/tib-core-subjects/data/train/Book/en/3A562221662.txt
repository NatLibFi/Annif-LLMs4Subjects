Environmental technology in the oil industry
This significantly updated second edition of a classic work on the subject identifies the issues and constraints for each stage in the production of petroleum products - what they are, who is imposing them and why, their technical and financial implications. It then looks in detail at the technological solutions which have been found or are being developed. It also places these developments in their legal and commercial context.
