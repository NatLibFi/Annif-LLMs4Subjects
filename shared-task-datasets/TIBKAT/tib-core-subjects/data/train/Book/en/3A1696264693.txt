Injection molds for beginners
This applications-oriented book describes the construction of an injection mould from the ground up. Included are explanations of the individual types of tools, components, and technical terms; design procedures; techniques, tips, and tricks in the construction of an injection mould; and pros and cons of various solutions. Based on a plastic part ("bowl with lid") specially developed for this book, easily understandable text and many illustrative pictures and drawings provide the necessary knowledge for practical implementation. Step by step, the plastic part is modified and enhanced. The technologies and designs that are additionally needed for an injection mould are described by engineering drawings. Maintenance and repair, and essential manufacturing techniques are also discussed. Now if full color, this second edition builds on the success of the first, with updates and small corrections throughout, as well as an new expanded section covering the process chain.
