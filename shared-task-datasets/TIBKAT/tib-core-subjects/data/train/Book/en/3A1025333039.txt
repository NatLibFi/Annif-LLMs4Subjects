Composite structures : effects of defects
"About the topic/technology Given the current and projected growth of composite material use, there is surprisingly limited information available for readers to understand how to handle defects in manufacturing that are likely to be encountered. The use of composite material is projected to continue its growth in several areas. In the automotive industry it is driven by the efforts to reduce vehicle weight to achieve better fuel efficiency and to improve safety. Similar efforts to reduce weight will continue the growth of composites in the aerospace field to provide structural parts with similar strength as metallic parts but with significantly reduced weight. Future aircraft in commercial and military fields will likely continue to use large amounts of carbon-fiber based components. Wind energy sector increasing the size of wind turbine blades is driving the demand for high performance composites due to their improved stiffness and tensile strength.
