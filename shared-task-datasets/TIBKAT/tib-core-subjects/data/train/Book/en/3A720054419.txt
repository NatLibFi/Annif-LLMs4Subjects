Topics in critical point theory
"Critical point theory has become a very powerful tool for solving many problems. The theory has enjoyed significant development over the last several years. The impetus for this development is the fact that many new problems could not be solved by the older theory. In this book we present more recent developments in the subject that do not seem to be covered elsewhere, including some results of the authors dealing with nonstandard linking geometries and sandwich pairs"--
"This book introduces the reader to powerful methods of critical point theory and details successful contemporary approaches to many problems, some of which had proved resistant to attack by older methods. Topics covered include Morse theory, critical groups, the minimax principle, various notions of linking, jumping nonlinearities and the Fučík spectrum in an abstract setting, sandwich pairs and the cohomological index. Applications to semilinear elliptic boundary value problems, p-Laplacian problems and anisotropic systems are given. Written for graduate students and research scientists, the book includes numerous examples and presents more recent developments in the subject to bring the reader up to date with the latest research"--
