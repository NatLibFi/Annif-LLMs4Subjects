Composites in biomedical applications
"The book comprehensively reviews recent developments in composites and their use in biomedical applications to encourage further advances in the field of composite research and discusses advanced techniques for the development of composites and biopolymer-based composites. The book highlights a new research theme in polymer-based composite materials and covers a broad range of research fields. It covers fatigue behavior, conceptual design in ergonomics design application, tissue regeneration or replacement, and skeletal bone repair of polymer composites. It also discusses the latest developments in synthesis, preparation, characterization, material evaluation, and future challenges"--
