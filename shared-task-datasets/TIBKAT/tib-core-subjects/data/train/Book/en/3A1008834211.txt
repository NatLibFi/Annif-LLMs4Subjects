Frequency-domain analysis with DFTs
"This monograph addresses the fundamental concepts of frequency spectrum analysis using discrete Fourier transforms. Topics range from the discretization of measured physical phenomenon to the interpretation of periodogram spectral content in terms of the Fourier basis sinusoids. The chapters also discuss peculiarities that arise due to discretization, such as leakage and aliasing, and why de-trending and windows mitigate such effects. Included examples explain the details of implementation and interpretation, with source code listings in MATLAB for a number of frequency spectrum-analysis tools"--
