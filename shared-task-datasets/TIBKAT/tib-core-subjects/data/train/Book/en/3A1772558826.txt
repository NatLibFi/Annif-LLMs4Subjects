Optical lithography : here is why
This book is written for new and experienced engineers, technology managers, and senior technicians who want to enrich their understanding of the image formation physics of a lithographic system. Readers will gain knowledge of the basic equations and constants that drive optical lithography, learn the basics of exposure systems and image formation, and come away with a full understanding of system components, processing, and optimization. Readers will also get an overview of the outlook of optical lithography and means to enhance semiconductor manufacturing. This second edition blends the authorâ€™s unique experience in research, teaching, and world-class high-volume manufacturing to add brand new material on proximity printing, as well as updated and expanded material on exposure systems, image formation, E-D methodology, hardware components, processing and optimization, and EUV and immersion lithographies.
