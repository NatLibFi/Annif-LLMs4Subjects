State-Space Models of Lumped and Distributed Systems
From the preface: "The book is written for scientists, practicing engineers and students interested in the analysis of system dynamics. Experience has shown that the volume is of special value to analysts and designers of control systems in many disciplines of engineering. The first two chapters can be of great use as a textbook for subjects from the field of dynamics and control systems in university undergraduate courses, while the third chapter is intended for more detailed graduate study. Having this in mind, every section of the book ends in many solved numerical examples. This can be of great use in the continuing education and home-study of all those who are concerned with this fast-developing field
