Introduction to aerospace engineering : basic principles of flight
"Aerodynamics is the study of forces and the resulting motion of objects through the air. This word is coined with the two Greek words; aerios, concerning the air, and dynamis, meaning force. Judging from the story of Daedalus and Icarus, humans have been interested in aerodynamics and flying for thousands of years, although flying in a heavier-than-air machine has been possible only in the last century. Aerodynamics affects the motion of high-speed flying machines, such as aircraft and rockets, and low-speed machines, like cars, trains and so on. Therefore, aerodynamics may be described as a branch of dynamics concerned with studying the motion of air, particularly when it interacts with a solid object. Aerodynamics is a subfield of fluid dynamics and gas dynamics. Aerodynamics is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, with the difference being that gas dynamics applies to all gases."--
