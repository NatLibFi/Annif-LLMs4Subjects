Spatial planning in Germany : structures and concepts ; elaborated within the INTERREG II C BSR project "The baltic manual: sharing expertise in spatial planning" with partners in Sweden and Poland
As Europe grows ever closer together, the aim of the present volume is to improve familiarity with, and understanding of, the German planning system both within Europe and beyond. This introductory text is based on the German component of the ARL's "Handbooks of Planning Terminology", a series of bi- and trilingual planning handbooks produced by the ARL in close co-operation with a host of partner organisations both in Germany and abroad. Beginning with introductory chapters on the constitutional structure and governance of the Federal Republic of Germany, this volume also includes a glossary of key planning terms in use in Germany, with concise explanatory notes.
