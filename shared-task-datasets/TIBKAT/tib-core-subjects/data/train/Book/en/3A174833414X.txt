QoS in integrated 3G networks
If you want guidance in estimating response times across a network and identifying which part of a 3G network is responsible for any reported QoS (quality of service) problems, this innovative book is a must read for you. It serves as a hands-on, working guide to the way different parts of an integrated 3G mobile network affect quality. The book helps you gain a better understanding of the trade-off between quality of service and the usable capacity of the network, the best applications to use for multimedia applications, and how to handle quality problems
