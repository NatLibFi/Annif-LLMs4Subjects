Coop Himmelb(l)au : Central Los Angeles Area High School #9 for the Visual and Performing Arts, HS#9 ; ["power for art"]
Coop Himmelblau is not a color but an idea, of creating architecture with fantasy, as bouyant and variable as clouds (1968). --"For us, it was very important to make a statement. First, we had the chance to contribute to the rising imagae of downtown. Second was the content. This is a high school for the arts. I think it's the one and only school that brings together the content and the architecture in this way."-Wolf D. Prix --Book Jacket
