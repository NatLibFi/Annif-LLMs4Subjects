Computational mathematics with SageMath
SageMath, or Sage for short, is an open-source mathematical software system based on the Python language and developed by an international community comprising hundreds of teachers and researchers, whose aim is to provide an alternative to the commercial products Magma, Maple, Mathematica, and MATLABÂª. To achieve this, Sage relies on many open-source programs, including GAP, Maxima, PARI, and various scientific libraries for Python, to which thousands of new functions have been added. Sage is freely available and is supported by all modern operating systems. Sage provides a wonderful scientific and graphical calculator for high school students, and it efficiently supports undergraduates in their computations in analysis, linear algebra, calculus, etc. For graduate students, researchers, and engineers in various mathematical specialties, Sage provides the most recent algorithms and tools, which is why several universities around the world already use Sage at the undergraduate level. Computational Mathematics with SageMath, written by researchers and by teachers at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels, focuses on the underlying mathematics necessary to use Sage efficiently and is illustrated with concrete examples. Part I is accessible to high school and undergraduate students and Parts II, III, and IV are suitable for graduate students, teachers, and researchers.
