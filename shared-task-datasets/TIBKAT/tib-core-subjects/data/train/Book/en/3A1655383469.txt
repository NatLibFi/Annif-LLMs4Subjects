Some tapas of computer algebra
This book arose from a series of courses on computer algebra which were given at Eindhoven Technical University. Its chapters present a variety of topics in computer algebra at an accessible (upper undergraduate/graduate) level with a view towards recent developments. For those wanting to acquaint themselves somewhat further with the material, the book also contains seven 'projects', which could serve as practical sessions related to one or more chapters. The contributions focus on topics like Gr√∂bner bases, real algebraic geometry, Lie algebras, factorisation of polynomials, integer programming, permutation groups, differential equations, coding theory, automatic theorem proving, and polyhedral geometry. This book is a must-read for everybody interested in computer algebra
