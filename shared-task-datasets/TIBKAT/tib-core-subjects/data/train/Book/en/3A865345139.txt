Synthesis and modeling of greenhouse gas emissions and carbon storage in agricultural and forest systems to guide mitigation and adaptation
"This ground-breaking look at modeling greenhouse gas emissions considers crop, livestock, and forestry productions systems ... The chapters in this volume demonstrate that both simple methods and complex models have strengths and limitations depending on stakeholder interest, scale of application, and other factors. Future improvement can be facilitated by organizing model input and testing data into web-accessible databases and by making model algorithms more available and transparent."--Back cover
