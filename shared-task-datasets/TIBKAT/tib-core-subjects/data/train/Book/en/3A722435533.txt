Continuous time dynamical systems : state estimation and optimal control with orthogonal functions
"This book presents the developments in problems of state estimation and optimal control of continuous-time dynamical systems using orthogonal functions since 1975. It deals with both full and reduced-order state estimation and problems of linear time-invariant systems. It also addresses optimal control problems of varieties of continuous-time systems such as linear and nonlinear systems, time-invariant and time-varying systems, as well as delay-free and time-delay systems. Content focuses on development of recursive algorithms for studying state estimation and optimal control problems"--
