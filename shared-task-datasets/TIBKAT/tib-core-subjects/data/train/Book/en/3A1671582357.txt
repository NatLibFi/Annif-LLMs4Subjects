Concrete recycling : research and practice
"The concrete industry consumes thirty billion tons of aggregate annually, almost all from non-renewable natural sources. Demolition produces a growing amount of materials which are legally usable and readily available. If not used locally they must be transported and landfilled. Also, demolition generally takes place close to new construction sites: recycling promotes shorter transportation distances, a must for improving the overall environmental footprint of the construction world. This book encompasses all aspects of this current trend: - How recycled aggregates are obtained and their properties. - Improving their quality through phase selection or separation. - Incorporating concrete from demolition into the cement production process and the properties of the product obtained. - What are the properties of concrete incorporating recycled concrete aggregates at various replacement levels, throughout the lifecycle of the material, from the fresh state to the long-term, including durability and fire. - How recycled concrete can be optimised for various uses. - How this new structural material can be managed in reinforced concrete construction. - Solid experience from a series of experimental sites, and drawing on the Recyb√©ton project, which lasted more than 5 years and gathered about 50 partners (from both academia and industry). - Specific issues in recycled concrete quality control. - National practices in the most advanced countries, and the main national and European standards. - Achieving a sustainable process"--
