Programming basics : getting started with Java, C#, and Python
Programming Basics offers the fundamentals of what it's like to function in today's world from the perspective of a programmer. The approach is highly practical with numerous small code listings for C#, Java, and Python included. The reigning programming paradigm of object-oriented programming (OOP) is a part of all of these languages – and its basics are explained in this book as well. Knowing the basics of coding is beneficial for those working close to, but not quite as one of the programmers in a team of software developers. Many people working in the audiovisual fields in the gaming/media industry would benefit from learning more of the programmers' points of view. The same applies to software testers and even company executives, who might have an education in business instead of computer science.
