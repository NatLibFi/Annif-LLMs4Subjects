Shaping space : exploring polyhedra in nature, art, and the geometrical imagination
Molecules, galaxies, art galleries, sculptures, viruses, crystals, architecture, and more: Shaping Space--Exploring Polyhedra in Nature, Art, and the Geometrical Imagination is an exuberant survey of polyhedra and at the same time a hands-on, mind-boggling introduction to one of the oldest and most fascinating branches of mathematics. Some of the world's leading geometers present a treasury of ideas, history, and culture to make the beauty of polyhedra accessible to students, teachers, polyhedra hobbyists, and professionals such as architects and designers, painters and sculptors, biologists and chemists, crystallographers, physicists and earth scientists, engineers and model builders, mathematicians and computer scientists. The creative chapters by more than 25 authors explore almost every imaginable side of polyhedra.  From the beauty of natural forms to the monumental constructions made by man, there is something to fascinate every reader. The book is dedicated to the memory of the legendary geometer H. S. M. Coxeter and the multifaceted design scientist Arthur L. Loeb.Contributing Authors: P. Ash, T. F. Banchoff, J. Baracs, E. Bolker, C. Chieh, R. Connelly, H.S.M. Coxeter, H. Crapo, E. Demaine, M.
