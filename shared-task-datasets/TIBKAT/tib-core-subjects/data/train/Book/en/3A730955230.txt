Advanced dynamic-system simulation : model replication and Monte Carlo studies
"This book introduces Dynamic-system Simulation with a main emphasis on OPEN DESIRE and DESIRE software. The book includes eight comprehensive chapters amounting to approximately 250 pages, as well as includes three appendices housing information on Radial-basis-function, Fuzzy-basis-function Networks, and CLEARN Algorithm. In addition, a CD will be packaged with each book, containing complete binary OPEN DESIRE modeling/simulation program packages for personal-computer LINUX and MS Windows, DESIRE examples, source code and a comprehensive, indexed reference manual. The second edition offers a complete update of all material, boasting two completely new chapters on fast simulation of neural networks"--
