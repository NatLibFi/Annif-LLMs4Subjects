Handbook of speckle interferometry
Fundamentals of interference -- Speckle interference and displacement -- Electronic speckle pattern interferometers -- Illumination and displacement detection -- Transient displacement analysis -- Phase detection -- Overview of applications.
"The material presented in this handbook is an introduction to help non-specialists in speckle techniques understand the basic principles of speckle interferometry. The book is mainly oriented to the use of speckle patterns with direct phase-measuring methods that produce an instantaneous phase. The major electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) techniques are presented using a simplified mathematical notation that includes rigid body displacements and the standard body displacements to estimate object pose changes with six degrees of freedom. Additionally, the adoption of temporal phase unwrapping instead of spatial unwrapping is promoted. This handbook also includes a summary of recent industrial applications with an update on the current research work in the ESPI field"--
