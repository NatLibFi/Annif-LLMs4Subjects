Recent Trends in Nonlinear Analysis : Festschrift Dedicated to Alfonso Vignoli on the Occasion of His Sixtieth Birthday
The book contains a collection of 21 original research papers which report on recent developments in various fields of nonlinear analysis. The collection covers a large variety of topics ranging from abstract fields such as algebraic topology, functional analysis, operator theory, spectral theory, analysis on manifolds, partial differential equations, boundary value problems, geometry of Banach spaces, measure theory, variational calculus, and integral equations, to more application-oriented fields like control theory, numerical analysis, mathematical physics, mathematical economy, and financial mathematics. The book is addressed to all specialists interested in nonlinear functional analysis and its applications, but also to postgraduate students who want to get in touch with this important field of modern analysis. It is dedicated to Alfonso Vignoli who has essentially contributed to the field, on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday
