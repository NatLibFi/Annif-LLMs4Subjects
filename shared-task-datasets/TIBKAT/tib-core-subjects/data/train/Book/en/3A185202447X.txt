Wheat science : nutritional and anti-nutritional properties, processing, storage, bioactivity, and product development
"Wheat Science: Nutritional and Anti-Nutritional Properties, Processing, Storage, Bioactivity, and Product Development addresses the topics associated with the advances in understanding the wheat biochemical, nutritional and rheological quality. Improving crop varieties by either conventional breeding or transgenic methods to obtain nutritionally enhanced crops has the advantage of making a one-time investment in research and development to have sustainable products. This book provides a holistic understanding and covers recent developments of wheat science under one umbrella. Emphasis is placed on current trends and advances in nutritional and antinutritional properties, processing, storage, bioactivity and product development. Additionally, efforts have been made to compile the available information on the application of different ingredients of wheat in the industry and pharma sectors"--
