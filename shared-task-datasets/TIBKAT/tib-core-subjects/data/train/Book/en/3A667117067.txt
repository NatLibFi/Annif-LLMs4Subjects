Aircraft dynamics : from modeling to simulation
"Napolitano's Aircraft Dynamics is designed to help readers extrapolate from low level formulas, equations, and details to high level comprehensive views of the main concepts. the text also helps readers with fundamental skills of learning the "basic modeling" of the aircraft aerodynamics and dynamics. The main objective is to organize the topics in "modular blocks" each of them leading to the understanding of the inner mechanisms of the aircraft aerodynamics and dynamics, eventually leading to the development of simple flight simulations schemes"--
