Cover; Half-title; Title; Copyright; Contents; Preface; Acknowledgments; PART ONE INTRODUCTION TO COASTAL PROCESSES; PART TWO HYDRODYNAMICS OF THE COASTAL ZONE; PART THREE COASTAL RESPONSE; PART FOUR SHORELINE MODIFICATION AND ANALYSIS; Author Index; Subject Index.
This text is organized in four parts: (1) an overview of coastal engineering, using case studies to illustrate problems; (2) hydrodynamics of the coastal zone, reviewing storm surges, water waves, and low frequency motions within the nearshore and surf zone; (3) coastal responses including equilibrium beach profiles and sediment transport; (4) applications such as erosion mitigation and shoreline management
