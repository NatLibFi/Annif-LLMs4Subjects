Furtherance of academic excellence : documentation of new library buildings in Cambridge
This book has its origins in a paper entitled "Recent developments in Cambridge college libraries", presented by Alison Wilson, Librarian of New Hall, Cambridge, at the LIBER Architecture Group Conference, "Changing Needs, Changing Libraries", which took place in Utrecht in March 2006. At the conference, Professor Elmar Mittler, Chairman of the LIBER Architecture Group, was so struck by the scale and quality of library building that had been undertaken in Cambridge over the last couple of decades that he decided to commission this volume in the series of GÃ¶ttinger Bibliotheksschriften to document that development.
