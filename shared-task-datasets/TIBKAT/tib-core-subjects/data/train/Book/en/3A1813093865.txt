Problems and solutions on quantum mechanics
"This volume is a comprehensive compilation of carefully selected questions at the PhD qualifying exam level, including many actual questions from Columbia University, University of Chicago, MIT, State University of New York at Buffalo, Princeton University, University of Wisconsin and the University of California at Berkeley over a twenty-year period. Topics covered in this book include the basic principles of quantum phenomena, particles in potentials, motion in electromagnetic fields, perturbation theory and scattering theory, among many others. This latest edition has been updated with more problems and solutions and the original problems have also been modernized, excluding outdated questions and emphasizing those that rely on calculations. The problems range from fundamental to advanced in a wide range of topics on quantum mechanics, easily enhancing the student's knowledge through workable exercises. Simple-to-solve problems play a useful role as a first check of the student's level of knowledge whereas difficult problems will challenge the student's capacity on finding the solutions"--
