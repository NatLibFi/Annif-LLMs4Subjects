Low voltage electron microscopy : principles and applications
"Part of the Wiley-Royal Microscopical Society Series, this book discusses the rapidly developing cutting-edge field of low-voltage microscopy, a field that has only recently emerged due to the rapid developments in the electron optics design and image processing.  It serves as a guide for current and new microscopists and materials scientists who are active in the field of nanotechnology, and presents applications in nanotechnology and research of surface-related phenomena, allowing researches to observe materials as never before"--
"The book describes the recent advances in the area of low-voltage electron microscopy, covering topics in TEM, SEM, STEM"--
