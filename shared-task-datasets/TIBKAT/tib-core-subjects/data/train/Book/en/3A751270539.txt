Digital image processing : concepts, algorithms, and scientific applications
Written by a non-computer scientist for non-computer scientists this book isintended as a practical guide taking the reader from basic concepts to up-to-date research topics in digital image processing. The presentation builds on principles and mathematical tools widely used in the natural sciences so that the reader gets an easy access to the material presented. The book discusses the following topics: image acquisition and digitization; linear and non-linear filter operation for the detection of edges, local orientation and texture; fast algorithms on pyramidal and multigrid data structures; morphological operations to detect the shape of objects; segmentation and classification. Further chapters deal with thereconstruction of three-dimensional objects from projections and the analysis of stereo images and image sequences with differential, correlation, and filter algorithms. Many examples - some of them in color - from a variety of areas show how even complicated tasks can be solved using inexpensive image processing systems on the basis of a personal computer
