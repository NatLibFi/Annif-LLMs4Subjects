Digital design : a systems approach
"This introductory textbook provides students with a system-level perspective and the tools they need to understand, analyze and design digital systems. Going beyond the design of simple combinational and sequential modules, it shows how such modules are used to build complete systems, reflecting real-world digital design. All the essential topics are covered, including design and analysis of combinational and sequential modules, as well as system timing and synchronization. It also teaches how to write Verilog HDL in a productive and maintainable style that enables CAD tools to do much of the tedious work. A complete introduction to digital design is given through clear explanations, extensive examples and online Verilog files. The teaching package is completed with lecture slides, labs and a solutions manual for instructors. Assuming no previous digital knowledge, this textbook is ideal for undergraduate digital design courses that will prepare students for modern digital practice"--
"This book is intended to teach an undergraduate student to understand and design digital systems. It teaches the skills needed for current industrial digital system design using a hardware description language (Verilog) and modern CAD tools. Particular attention is paid to systemlevel issues including factoring and partitioning digital systems, interface design, and interface timing. Topics needed for a deep understanding of digital circuits, such as timing analysis, metastability, and synchronization, are also covered. Of course, we cover the manual design of combinational and sequential logic circuits. However, we do not dwell on these topics because there is far more to digital system design than designing such simple modules"--
