Preface -- 1 Global Existence of Spherically Symmetric Solutions for Nonlinear Compressible Non-autonomous Navier-Stokes Equations -- 2 Global Existence and Exponential Stability for a Real Viscous Heat-conducting Flow with Shear Viscosity -- 3 Regularity and Exponential Stability of the p th Power Newtonian Fluid in One Space Dimension -- 4 Global Existence and Exponential Stability for the p th Power Viscous Reactive Gas -- 5 On the 1D Viscous Reactive and Radiative Gas with the One-order Arrhenius Kinetics -- Bibliography -- Index.
This book presents recent results on nonlinear parabolic-hyperbolic coupled systems such as the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, and liquid crystal system. It summarizes recently published research by the authors and their collaborators, but also includes new and unpublished material. All models under consideration are built on compressible equations and liquid crystal systems. This type of partial differential equations arises not only in many fields of mathematics, but also in other branches of science such as physics, fluid dynamics and material science.
