High speed rail and China's new economic Geography : impact assessment from the regional science perspective
High Speed Rail and China's New Economic Geography presents an analytical approach to assessing the socioeconomic impact of high speed rail in China, with an emphasis on capturing the spatial spillover effects of rail infrastructure development on China's economic geography in terms of land use, housing market, tourism, regional disparity, modal competition, the economy and environment. The assessment involves a multilevel spatial analysis approach at both the national and the regional level. The methods include partial equilibrium analysis characterized by a spatial econometric modeling and the state-of-the-art computable general equilibrium modeling. It provides a basis for policy decision-making and operational considerations. Academic scholars and students who are specialized in regional economics, urban planning, public policy, and transportation will find this book useful. Practitioners and policy-makers will also find this book valuable as the empirical findings provide implications for future transportation planning and development
