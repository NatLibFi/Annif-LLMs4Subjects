Fed-batch cultures : principles and applications of semi-batch bioreactors
"Many, if not most, industrially important fermentation and bioreactor operations are carried out in fed-batch mode, producing a wide variety of products. In spite of this, there is no single book that deals with fed-batch operations. This is the first book that puts together all the necessary background material regarding the "what, why, and how" of optimal and sub-optimal fed-batch operations. Numerous examples are provided to illustrate the application of optimal fed-batch cultures. This unique book, by world experts with decades of research and industrial experience, is a must for researchers and industrial practitioners of fed-batch processes (modeling, control, and optimization) in biotechnology, fermentation, food, pharmaceuticals, and waste treatment industries."--
