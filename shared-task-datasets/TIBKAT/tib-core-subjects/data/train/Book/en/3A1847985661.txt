Architectonics and parametric thinking : computational modeling for beginning design
"This book is an approachable guide for students and professionals to learn parametric modeling through the lens of architectonics, allowing readers to pair fundamental ideas about architecture with parametric thinking. The book begins by clearly positioning the potentials of parametric design through a series of chapters written by leaders in their respective industries. This helps to situate the vast potential of parametric softwares, allowing the reader to understand the full range of what is made possible by working computationally. Following this theoretical introduction, the book presents a manual that walks readers through the step-by-step construction of parametric modeling scripts built through an architectonic lens using clear, compelling diagrams. Each of these diagrams provides textual accompaniment that describes how each new portion of the script is transforming the algorithm as a whole, as well as diagrams that show the physical transformation that is taking place as a result of the script's evolution. Parametric modeling is radically transforming the design disciplines and will become the primary way designer's generate new products moving forward. Written and expertly designed for architecture students and professionals, this book provides an interactive approach to teaching the basics of parametric thinking in relation to architecture and design"--
