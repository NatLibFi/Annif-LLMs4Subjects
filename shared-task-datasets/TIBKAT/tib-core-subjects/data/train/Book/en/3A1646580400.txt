Electronic Quantum Transport in Mesoscopic Semiconductor Structures
This book treats three topics of electronic quantum transport in mesoscopic semiconductor structures: the conductance in strongly interacting and disordered two-dimensional systems and the metal insulator transition, electron transport through quantum dots and quantum rings in the Coulomb-blockade regime, and scanning probe experiments on semiconductor nanostructures at cryogenic temperatures. In addition it gives a brief historical account of electron transport from Ohm's law through transport in semiconductor nanostructures, and a review of cryogenic scanning probe techniques applied to semiconductor nanostructures. Both graduate students and researchers in the field of mesoscopic semiconductors or in semiconductor nanostructures will find this book useful.
