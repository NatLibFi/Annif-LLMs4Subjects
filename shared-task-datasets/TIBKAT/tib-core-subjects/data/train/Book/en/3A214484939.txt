The principles of navigation
From the preface: The object of this book is to contribute to the exchange of ideas between the navigator and the scientist and engineer in two ways. First, by painting a broad picture of navigation as a whole so that each problem may be seen against a wider background. Secondly, by attempting to suggest a common language appropriate to a study of navigation.
