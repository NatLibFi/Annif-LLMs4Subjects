Chemistry from first principles
Chemistry from First Principles' examines the appearance of matter in its most primitive form. It features the empirical rules of chemical affinity that regulate the synthesis and properties of molecular matter, analyzes the compatibility of the theories of chemistry with the quantum and relativity theories of physics, formulates a consistent theory based on clear physical pictures and manageable mathematics to account for chemical concepts such as the structure and stability of atoms and molecules. This text also explains the self-similarity between space-time, nuclear structure, covalent assembly, biological growth, planetary systems, and galactic conformation.
