Statistics applied with Excel : data analysis is (not) an art
This book shows you how to analyze data sets systematically and to use Excel 2019 to extract information from data almost effortlessly. Both are (not) an art! The statistical methods are presented and discussed using a single data set. This makes it clear how the methods build on each other and gradually more and more information can be extracted from the data. The Excel functions used are explained in detail - the procedure can therefore be easily transferred to other data sets. Various didactic elements facilitate orientation and working with the book: At the checkpoints, the most important aspects from each chapter are briefly summarized. In the freak knowledge section, more advanced aspects are addressed to whet the appetite for more. All examples are calculated with hand and Excel. Numerous applications and solutions as well as further data sets are available on the author's internet platform.
