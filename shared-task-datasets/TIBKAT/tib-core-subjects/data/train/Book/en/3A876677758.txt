Advances in multiuser detection
A Timely Exploration of Multiuser Detection in Wireless Networks During the past decade, the design and development of current and emerging wireless systems have motivated many important advances in multiuser detection. This book fills an important need by providing a comprehensive overview of crucial recent developments that have occurred in this active research area. Each chapter is contributed by noted experts and is meant to serve as a self-contained treatment of the topic. Coverage includes: . Linear and decision feedback methods. Iterative multiuser detection and decoding. Multiuser detection in the presence of channel impairments. Performance analysis with random signatures and channels. Joint detection methods for MIMO channels. Interference avoidance methods at the transmitter. Transmitter precoding methods for the MIMO downlink This book is an ideal entry point for exploring ongoing research in multiuser detection and for learning about the field's existing unsolved problems and issues. It is a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and graduate students who are involved in the area of digital communications
