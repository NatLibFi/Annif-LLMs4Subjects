Secure development for mobile apps : how to design and code secure mobile applications with PHP and JavaScript
"Preface: Amazingly, I grew up in the country and we never locked the doors to our house, or our cars. In school, no one broke into someone else's car or locker. If you put something down, you could pretty much rely on it being there when you got back. Family entered without knocking, and non-family never tried. This is no longer the case. Now, even though my house and car are locked, the virtual windows to my life, as well as a basement door I didn't even know existed, are open and under attack thanks to the internet. Now the situation is reversed. Family needs to knock several times before using the secret handshake thingy, and strangers enter anonymously and unannounced into my whatever. Security is something I wish I could do without. The business of building cool things as fast as possible without regard to consequence of theft is far more interesting. Out of necessity, security became a priority. What follows is some of what I've learned along the way. If any of these bits and bytes end up helping to protect you, then I win. I hope you enjoy the book. "--
