Digital signal processing : principles and applications
"Combining clear explanations of elementary principles, advanced topics, and applications, with step-by-step mathematical derivations, this textbook provides a comprehensive yet accessible introduction to digital signal processing. All the key topics are covered, including discrete-time Fourier transform, z-transform, discrete Fourier transform, and A/D conversion, as well as more advanced topics such as FIR and IIR filtering algorithms, multi-rate systems, the discrete cosine transform, and spectral signal processing. Over 600 full-color illustrations, 200 fully worked examples, hundreds of end-of-chapter homework problems, and detailed computational examples of DSP algorithms implemented in Matlab and C aid understanding and help put knowledge into practice. A wealth of supplementary material accompanies the book online, including interactive programs for instructors, a full set of solutions, and Matlab laboratory exercises, making this the ideal text for senior undergraduate and graduate courses on digital signal processing"--
