Radioactive contamination of the Tokyo metropolitan area : five years after the Fukushima nuclear accident
Chapter 1. Outline of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident -- Chapter 2. Advection and diffusion of radioactive materials released in the FDNPP accident into the central area of Japan -- Chapter 3. Spatiotemporal distribution of radionuclides in soil in the Tokyo metropolitan area -- Chapter 4. Characteristics of the distributions of 131I and radioactive cesium in the soil of the Tokyo metropolitan area after the FDNPP accident -- Chapter 5. Role of the wastewater treatment system in the behavior of radioactive cesium precipitated in the urban area of Tokyo -- Chapter 6. The importance of Tokyo Bay as a reservoir for radioactive materials precipitated in the Tokyo metropolitan area -- Chapter 7. The behavior of radioactive cesium precipitated in forests -- Chapter 8. Radioactive contamination of fishes in aquatic ecosystems -- Chapter 9. Topics.
This book presents the 5-year monitoring of radioactive contamination in the Tokyo metropolitan area due to the Fukushima accident, covering radiation monitoring of soil, litter, river, water, seawater, aquatic sediments, fish and shellfish, and plants in urban areas. Based on spatial and temporal data, it evaluates the environmental radiation contamination of the Tokyo metropolitan following the first nuclear accident affecting an urban area since Chernobyl. Since little is known about the contamination in Kiev city, this data is particularly valuable, offering insights into the dynamics of radioactive contamination in metropolitan areas, which are of interest in relation to the behavior of radionuclides resulting not only from nuclear accidents but also from nuclear terrorism? As such, this book will be appeal to nuclear and radiation experts, environmental administration professionals and specialists in environmental protection groups, as well as student and academics in the related fields.
