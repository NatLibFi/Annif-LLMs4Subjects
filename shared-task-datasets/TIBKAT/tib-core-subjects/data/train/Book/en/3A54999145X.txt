Frank Lloyd Wright : mid-century modern
The mid-twentieth century was one of the most productive and inventive periods in Wright's career, producing such masterworks as the Guggenheim Museum, Price Tower, Fallingwater, the Usonian houses, and the Loveness House, as well as a vast array of innovative furniture and object design. With a variety of shapes and forms-ranging from honeycombs to spirals-this period is an important contribution to mid-century modernism. Mentoring such talents as Richard Neutra and Rudolph Schindler among others, Wright was one of the most influential proponents of the simplicity, democratic designs, and organic forms that characterize Mid-Century Modern.
