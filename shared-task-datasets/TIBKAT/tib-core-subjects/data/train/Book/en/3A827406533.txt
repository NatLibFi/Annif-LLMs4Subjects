The far horizons of time : time and mind in the universe
The book raises and resolves specific questions in the physics of time, such as how and why someone can be simultaneous with events that are in fact days apart. It examines further abiding issues in the physics of time, and suggests that such phenomena can only exist because they ultimately obey applicable mathematics. This leads to a new vision of what time is, seen as a side effect from a deeper reality.
