Environmental engineering : principles and practice
"The content is accessible to sophomore engineering students with content appropriate for upper classmen and working engineers.  In addition to the traditional focal topics in environmental engineering:  Air  Wastewater  Water and  Solid Waste, information is included on current reactionary issues such as:  Sustainability,  Risk  Global Air Quality and  Public Health   A focus on practical solutions and problem solving backed by relevant theory is maintained throughout. Many students beginning their engineering studies struggle to critically read textbooks and have difficulty when muddling through example problems.  The focus here is to provide practical example problems that help students comprehend challenging theory and facilitate its real-world application.  Example problems provide a detailed and structured approach to finding a solution; examples will be provided using SI and US units. Several chapters will contain introductory material appropriate for sophomores as well as more advanced material that might only be appropriate for upper level engineering students"--
Written for advanced undergraduate and first-semester graduate courses in the subject. The text provides a clear and concise understanding of the major topic areas facing environmental professionals. For each topic, the theoretical principles are introduced, followed by numerous examples illustrating the process design approach.
