The Laplace Distribution and Generalizations : A Revisit with Applications to Communications, Economics, Engineering, and Finance
This monograph focuses on the importance of the Laplace distribution and describes the inferential and modeling advantages that this distribution, together with its generalizations and modifications, offers. After presenting an historical introduction to the subject, the authors collect and present in a systematic way the univariate Laplace distribution, knowledge of which until now has been scattered in the vast statistical, engineering, and mathematical literature. The exposition systematically unfolds with many examples, tables, illustrations, and exercises. A comprehensive index and extensive bibliography also make this book an ideal text for a senior undergraduate and graduate seminar on statistical distributions, or for a short half-term academic course in statistics, applied probability, and finance
