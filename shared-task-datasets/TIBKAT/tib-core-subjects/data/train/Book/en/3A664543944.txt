Hyers-Ulam-Rassias Stability of Functional Equations in Nonlinear Analysis
No books dealing with a comprehensive illustration of the fast developing field of nonlinear analysis had been published for the mathematicians interested in this field for more than a half century until D. H. Hyers, G. Isac and Th. M. Rassias published their book, 'Stability of Functional Equations in Several Variables'.  This book will complement the books of Hyers, Isac and Rassias and of Czerwik (Functional Equations and Inequalities in Several Variables) by presenting mainly the results applying to the Hyers-Ulam-Rassias stability. Many mathematicians have extensively investigated the subjects on the Hyers-Ulam-Rassias stability. This book covers and offers almost all classical results on the Hyers-Ulam-Rassias stability in an integrated and self-contained fashion.  Soon-Mo Jung is a highly respected mathematician who was born in 1957 in Seocheon, South Korea. He received his BS in Atomic Nuclear Engineering at the Seoul National University and  received his BS, MS, and PhDs in Mathematics at the University of Stuttgart. Dr. Jung has published approximately 150 research papers in the areas of functional equations, classical analysis, analytical geometry, measure theory, fractals, number theory, and algebra, and has published 5 books. This  present volume will be his first book published with Springer. However, Soon-Mo has contributed papers to several edited volumes and journals such as 'Nonlinear Analysis and Variational Problems' (SOIA 35), Acta Mathematica Sinica, Bulletin of the Brazilian Math Society, Proceedings Mathematical Sciences, and Journal of Central South University of Technology.
