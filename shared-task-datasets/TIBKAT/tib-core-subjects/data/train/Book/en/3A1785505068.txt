Fundamentals of signal processing in generalized metric spaces : algorithms and applications
"Exploring the interrelations between generalized metric spaces, lattice-ordered groups, and order statistics, the book contains a new algebraic approach to Signal Processing Theory. It describes mathematical concepts and results important in the development, analysis, and optimization of signal processing algorithms intended for various applications. The book offers a solution of large-scale Signal Processing Theory problems of increasing both signal processing efficiency under prior uncertainty conditions and signal processing rate that is provided by multiplication-free signal processing algorithms based on lattice-ordered group operations"--
