Advances in missile guidance, control, and estimation
"This volume considers the modern tactical missile, which has become a highly integrated package made up of many electronic, mechanical, electromechanical and pyrotechnic sub-systems. In addition to hardware, it also covers the guidance algorithm and workings of the missile autopilot. It demonstrates how all of the elements are integrated to function together in high-performance mode while maintaining cost effectiveness. This text offers unique coverage of the three major missile control components: guidance, control, and estimation. It includes contributed chapters from leading experts from six nations. Nonlinear control techniques and implementation issues are covered in detail"--
