Physical layer security in wireless communications
"Physical layer security has recently become an emerging technique to complement and significantly improve the communication security of wireless networks. Comparing to the cryptographic approaches, physical layer security is a fundamentally different paradigm, where secrecy is achieved by exploiting the physical layer properties of the communication system, such as thermal noise, interference, and the time-varying nature of fading channels. Written by pioneering researchers, this book provides a systematic overview of the foundations and recent developments of this promising security technology"--
