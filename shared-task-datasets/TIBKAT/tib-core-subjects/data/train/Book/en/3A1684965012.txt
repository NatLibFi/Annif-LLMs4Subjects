Heavy Ion Reactions at Low Energies
This book is based on Valery Zagrebaev's original papers and lecture materials on nuclear physics with heavy ions, which he prepared and extended through many years for the students of nuclear physics specialties. Th–µ book outlines the main experimental facts on nuclear reactions involving heavy ions at low energies. It focuses on discussions of nuclear physics processes that are a subject of active, modern research and it gives illustrative explanations of these phenomena in the framework of up-to-date theoretical concepts. This textbook is intended for students in physics who have completed a standard course of quantum mechanics and have basic ideas of nuclear physics processes. It is designed as a kind of lifeboat that, at the end of the course, will allow students to navigate the modern scientific literature and to understand the goals and objectives of current, on-going research
Introduction -- Nuclear interactions and classes of nuclear reaction -- Elastic scattering of nucleons and heavy ions -- Quasi-elastic scattering of heavy ions and few-nucleon transfer reactions -- Deep-inelastic scattering of nuclei -- Fusion of atomic nuclei
