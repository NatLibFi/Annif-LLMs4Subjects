X-Ray Optics : High-Energy-Resolution Applications
The generation of radiation with well-defined frequency and wavelength, and the ability to precisely determine these quantities, are of fundamental importance in physics and other natural sciences. Monochromatic radiation enables both very accurate structure determinations and studies of the dynamics of living and non-living matter. It is crucial for the realization of standards of time and length, for the determination of fundamental constants, and for many other aspects of basic research. Bragg backscattering from perfect crystals is a tool for creating, manipulating, and analyzing x-rays with highest spectral purity. It has the unique feature of selecting x-rays with narrow spectral bandwidth. This book describes the theoretical foundations and principles of x-ray crystal optics with high spectral resolution. Various experimental studies and applications are presented and the author also addresses the development of instrumentation, such as high-resolution x-ray monochromators, analyzers, wavelength meters, resonators, and interferometers. The book will be a valuable source of information for all students and researchers working in the field of x-ray optics
