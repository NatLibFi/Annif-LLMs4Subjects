Lean management principles for information technology
"This book discusses information production processes, information technology (IT) systems, and change management through the lens of Lean principles; how to integrate Lean tools together with information production and IT systems to form an integrated, world-class learning environment; Lean tools and techniques like Lean management, Six Sigma, cycle time, value stream mapping, spaghetti charting, value-added vs. non-value-added activities, and bottlenecks; information technology (IT) tools and environments; and how to integrate Lean tools together with IT environments to form an integrated, world-class IT organization. This book is broken into three sections: Section I discusses the need for IT to become "Leaner", how we are data rich but information starved, and what lessons Lean teaches us about improving the information we work with. The section goes on to give an overview of change management and how it works. Section II delves into the details of how Lean can be utilized to eliminate waste in IT. It discusses the cultural acceptance tools that are required to build acceptance for Lean in IT, the technical tools that are available to generate the desired improvements, how these technical tools are used to identify non-value-added opportunities for improvement, the improvement process, and the operational details behind running a Lean event. This section also explores the process of developing meaningful information metrics. Section III recommends a methodology for assessing an organization's IT maturity. This section focuses on the next generation of Lean and its application to IT, and it ends by discussing how Lean can drive the success of IT environments of the future. The objective is to create world-class information processing organizations"--
