Post-processing techniques for metal-based additive manufacturing : towards precision fabrication
"This book shares insights on post-processing techniques adopted to achieve precision-grade surfaces of additive manufactured metals including material characterization techniques and the identified material properties. Post-processes are discussed from support structure removal and heat treatment to the material removal processes including hybrid manufacturing. Case studies on unique applications of additive manufactured metals as an exemplary of the considerations taken during post-processing design and selection, are discussed. This book aims at researchers, professionals and graduate students in advanced manufacturing, additive manufacturing, machining, and materials processing"
