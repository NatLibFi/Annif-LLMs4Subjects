Sociolinguistics and mobile communication
Raising important questions about the nature of language and the creativity of speakers, Ana Deumert examines the role of multimodality and intertextuality in creating meaning, as well as the realities and consequences of digital linguistic inequality. Taking a global perspective and drawing on original multilingual data and analyses from South Africa, this book presents a nuanced, ethnographically-informed understanding of mobile communication and sociolinguistics, exploring a wide range of digital applications. Key features: 1. explains and illustrates core concepts in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology; 2. applies sociolinguistic theories of language (from Humboldt and Sapir to post-structuralism) to new media; 3. focus on linguistic creativity and poetic language; 4. offers a global and multilingual perspective on digital communication practices; 5. includes original case studies of African data; and 6. explores digital inequality and its consequences for sociolinguistic research.--Back cover
