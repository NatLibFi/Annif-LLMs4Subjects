"Starting from the purchase of heavy equipment and following through to the end of its economic life, this manual explains how to efficiently maintain and operate different types of heavy equipment. Assigning heavy equipment to different projects and utilizing them in varied systems is a large part of construction operation; ensuring everything is monitored consistently and maintained accordingly is essential. This book aids engineers in facilitating straightforward, consistent reporting systems and cost-efficient equipment use. This is particularly of note to the construction industry. It enables engineers to save time and money on maintenance costs, and maximize the availability of the heavy equipment while providing comprehensive coverage of methods and procedures for heavy equipment management. The book also provides charts for practical use by engineers in the field, for example, mapping out a maintenance schedule and it includes chapters on maintenance and field operations organisation, including safety and security organisation.The book will be of interest to construction engineers, plant engineers, mechanical engineers, maintenance plant and field engineers"--
