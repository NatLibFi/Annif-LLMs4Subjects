Fragmentation processes : topics in atomic and molecular physics
"Revolutionary advances in experimental techniques and spectacular increases in computer power over recent years have enabled researchers to develop a much more profound understanding of the atomic few-body problem. One area of intense focus has been the study of fragmentation processes. Covering the latest research in the field, this edited text is the first to provide a focussed and systematic treatment of fragmentation processes, bringing together contributions from a range of leading experts. As well as tackling the more established electron-impact ionization processes, (e,2e), this book also guides the reader through topics such as molecular fragmentation, ion-atom collisions and multi-photon processes. Combining a broad range of topics with an equal mix of theoretical and experimental discussion, this is an invaluable text for graduate students and researchers in atomic collisions, laser physics and chemistry"--
