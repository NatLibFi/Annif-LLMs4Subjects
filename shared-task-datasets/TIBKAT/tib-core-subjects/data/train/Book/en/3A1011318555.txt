Photosynthesis : methods and protocols
This user-friendly book provides a range of classical and modern techniques for the study of photosynthesis in a manner accessible to a broad spectrum of researchers. Broken into four sections, it explores the measurement of physiological photosynthetic parameters, quantifying photosynthetic enzyme abundance and catalytic activity, visualizing cellular and sub-cellular phenotypes, and photosynthesis-inspired energy generation. Written for the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls.Authoritative and practical, Photosynthesis: Methods and Protocols aims to aid scientists working toward exciting developments in the understanding and application of photosynthesis
