Die grenzenlose Unternehmung : Information, Organisation und Management
"Ein in jeder Hinsicht anregendes und kompetentes Werk, das - im Lichte des Wandels zur Informationsgesellschaft - f체r Wissenschaft und Praxis neue Dimensionen der Unternehmensf체hrung aufzeigt." Heribert Meffert, Universit채t M체nster "The book has a heavier than usual economic bent, yet also considers the human cognitive aspects. The emphasis throughout is on the total concepts, with subsections at the end of each chapter describing the role of information and the implications for management. The content is well worth reading." Paul Gray, Claremont Graduate University "Information, Organization and Management is a comprehensive treatment of the primary theoretic, management, economic, and technological foundations for new organizational forms, relations and processes. It provides a wide range of underlying concepts and frameworks that help the reader understand the major forces driving organizational and marketplace change, rather than presenting these changes as simple outcomes of technological or management fads." Ronald Rice, Rutgers University "This book marks an epoch in education and fills a new-felt need. It has successfully applied Economic theories of the organization to explain conceptually different organization forms.This same argument can be applied to the most recent cooperation,alliance crossed the boundary between Keiretsu." Tetsu Miyagi, Komazawa Univ. Tokyo
