Some Unusual Topics in Quantum Mechanics
In this book, the author addresses selected topics in quantum mechanics that are not usually covered in books, but which are very helpful in developing a student's interest in, and a deeper understanding of the subject. The topics include two different ways of looking at quantum mechanics; three clarifying topics that students often find confusing; one classic theorem never proved in the classroom; and a discussion on whether there can be a non-linear quantum mechanics. The book can be used as supporting material for graduate-level core courses on quantum mechanics.
Position operators of non-relativistic quantum mechanics -- A bundle picture of quantum mechanics -- A beam of particles = a plane wave? -- Star-product formulation of quantum mechanics -- Can there be a non-linear quantum mechanics? -- Interaction = exchange of quanta -- Proof of Wigner's theorem.
