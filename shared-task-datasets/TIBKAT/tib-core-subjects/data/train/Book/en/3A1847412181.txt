Fundamentals of aerodynamics
The new edition of Fundamentals of Aerodynamics follows in the same tradition as the previous editions: it is for students-to be read, understood, and enjoyed. It is consciously written in a clear, informal, and direct style to talk to the reader and gain their interest in the challenging and yet beautiful discipline of aerodynamics.
