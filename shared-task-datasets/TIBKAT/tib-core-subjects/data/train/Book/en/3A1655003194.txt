Introduction to Maple
This is a fully revised edition of the best-selling Introduction to Maple. The book presents the modern computer algebra system Maple, teaching the reader not only what can be done by Maple, but also how and why it can be done. The book also provides the necessary background for those who want the most of Maple or want to extend its built-in knowledge. Emphasis is on understanding the Maple system more than on factual knowledge of built-in possibilities. To this end, the book contains both elementary and more sophisticated examples as well as many exercises. The typical reader should have a background in mathematics at the intermediate level. Andre Heck began developing and teaching Maple courses at the University of Nijmegen in 1987. In 1989 he was appointed managing director of the CAN Expertise Center in Amsterdam. CAN, Computer Algebra in the Netherlands, stimulates and coordinates the use of computer algebra in education and research. In 1996 the CAN Expertise Center was integrated into the Faculty of Science at the University of Amsterdam, into what became the AMSTEL Institute. The institute program focuses on the innovation of computer activities in mathematics and science education on all levels of education. The author is actively involved in the research and development aimed at the integrated computer learning environment Coach for mathematics and science education at secondary school level
