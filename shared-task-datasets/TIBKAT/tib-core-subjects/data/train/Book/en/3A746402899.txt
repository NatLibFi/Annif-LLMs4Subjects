Security management of next generation telecommunications networks and services
"This book considers the evolution of network deployed security mechanisms throughout NGN (Next Generation Networking) infrastructures"--
"This book will cover network management security issues and currently available security mechanisms by discussing how network architectures have evolved into the contemporary NGNs which support converged services (voice, video, TV, interactive information exchange, and classic data communications).  It will also analyze existing security standards and their applicability to securing network management.  This book will review 21st century security concepts of authentication, authorization, confidentiality, integrity, nonrepudiation, vulnerabilities, threats, risks, and effective approaches to encryption and associated credentials management/control.
