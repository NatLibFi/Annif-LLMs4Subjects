Regression analysis by example
This fifth edition has been expanded and thoroughly updated to reflect recent advances in the field. The emphasis continues to be on exploratory data analysis rather than statistical theory. The coverage offers in-depth treatment of regression diagnostics, transformation, multicollinearity, logistic regression, and robust regression. Methods of regression analysis are clearly demonstrated, and examples containing the types of irregularities commonly encountered in the real world are provided. Each example isolates one or two techniques and features detailed discussions of the techniques themselves, the required assumptions, and the evaluated success of each technique.
