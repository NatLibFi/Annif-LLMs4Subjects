Bio-nano filtration in industrial effluent treatment : advanced and innovative approaches
"The ever-increasing number of pollutants discharged into the environment drives the search for new treatment technologies or the modification of the existing ones. In this sense, innovation in bio nanofiltration systems seems very promising and therefore, a book on the current advances and innovations on his topic is highly appropriate. Bio nanofiltration is a relatively emerging new technology applied to the treatment of wastewater and other toxic compounds. In the last two decades, this technology has begun to emerge as an economically viable process to treat the great variety of recalcitrant pollutants discharged into the environment. Thus, the US biofiltration market is speculated to reach over $100 million by 2020. This book aims to present how innovation in bio nanofiltration can provide effective solutions to overcome the serious problem of water pollution worldwide. The removal of contaminants will be the result of the combined effects of biological oxidation, adsorption, and filtration processes. Features: Describes the microbial ecology of bio nanofiltration Describes the modelling of bio nanofiltration Describes designing of bio nanofillers"--
