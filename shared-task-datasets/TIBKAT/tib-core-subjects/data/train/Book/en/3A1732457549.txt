A practical guide to environmental biotechnology
This textbook provides practical guidelines on conducting experiments across the entire spectrum of environmental biotechnology. It opens with general information on laboratory safety, rules and regulations, as well as a description of various equipment commonly used in environmental laboratories. It then discusses in detail the major experiments in basic and advanced environmental studies, including the analysis of water and soil samples; the isolation, culture, and biochemical characterization of microbes; and plant tissue culture techniques and nutrient analyses. Each chapter features detailed method sections and easy-to-follow protocols, and offers guidance on calculations and formulas, as well as illustrative flow charts to assist with troubleshooting for each experiment. Given its scope, the book is an invaluable aid for laboratory researchers studying environmental biotechnology, and a rich source of information and advice for advanced undergraduates and graduates in the fields of environmental science and biotechnology.
