A course in mathematical analysis / D. J. H. Garling ; 2: Metric and topological spaces, functions of a vector variable
"This second volume goes on to consider metric and topological spaces. Topics such as completeness, compactness and connectedness are developed, with emphasis on their applications to analysis. This leads to the theory of functions of several variables: differentiation is developed in a co-ordinate free way, while integration (the Riemann integral) is established for functions defined on subsets of Euclidean space. Differential manifolds in Euclidean space are introduced in a final chapter, which includes an account of Lagrange multipliers and a detailed proof of the divergence theorem. "--
