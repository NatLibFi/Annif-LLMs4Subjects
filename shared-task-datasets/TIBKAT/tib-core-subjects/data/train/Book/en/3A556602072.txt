Bioinorganic electrochemistry
Inorganic Bioelectrochemistry provides a thorough overview of the state of the art in this crucial area of research. In addition, the book helps readers understand where the field is heading and what new developments are on the horizon. Eight chapters written by leading international experts cover crucial topics such as electron and proton transfer in metalloprotein systems, electrochemistry and electrocatalysis of redox enzymes, and electrochemistry of DNA-based molecules.
"Interfacial electrochemistry of redox metalloproteins and DNA-based molecules is presently moving towards new levels of structural and functional resolution. This is the result of powerful interdisciplinary efforts. Underlying fundamentals of biological electron and proton transfer is increasingly well understood although with outstanding unresolved issues. Comprehensive bioelectrochemical studies have mapped the working environments for bioelectrochemical electron transfer, supported by the availability of mutant proteins and other powerful biotechnology. Introduction of surface spectroscopy, the scanning probe microscopies, and other solid state and surface physics methodology has finally offered exciting new fundamental and technological openings in interfacial bioelectrochemistry of both redox proteins and DNA-based molecules. ""Inorganic Bioelectrochemistry"" provides a thorough and didactic overview of state-of-the-art bioelectrochemistry with prospects for forthcoming development. The book is organized in eight chapters written by leading international experts and covers crucial relevant topics such as electron and proton transfer in metalloprotein systems, electrochemistry and electrocatalysis of redox enzymes, and electrochemistry of DNA-based molecules."
