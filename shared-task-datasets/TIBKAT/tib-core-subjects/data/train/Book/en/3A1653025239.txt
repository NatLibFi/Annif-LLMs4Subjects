This monograph provides a complete and self-contained account of the theory, methods, and applications of constant-sign solutions of integral equations. In particular, the focus is on different systems of Volterra and Fredholm equations. The presentation is systematic and the material is broken down into several concise chapters. An introductory chapter covers the basic preliminaries. Throughout the book many examples are included to illustrate the theory. The book contains a wealth of results that are both deep and interesting. This unique book will be welcomed by mathematicians working on integral equations, spectral theory, and on applications of fixed point theory and boundary value problems. .
