"This book is devoted to the history of chaos theory, from celestial mechanics (three-body problem) to electronics and meteorology. Many illustrative examples of chaotic behaviors exist in various contexts found in nature (chemistry, astrophysics, biomedicine). This book includes the most popular systems from chaos theory (Lorenz, Rössler, van der Pol, Duffing, logistic map, Lozi map, Hénon map etc.) and introduces many other systems, some of them very rarely discussed in textbooks as well as in scientific papers. The contents are formulated with an original approach as compared to other books on chaos theory"--
