Rare-Earth Implanted MOS Devices for Silicon Photonics : Microstructural, Electrical and Optoelectronic Properties
The book concentrates on the microstructural, electric and optoelectronic properties of rare-earth implanted MOS structures and their use as light emitters in potential applications. It describes the structural formation processes in the gate oxide during fabrication and under operation, how this microstructure development will affect the electrical device performance and how both microstructure and electrical characteristics determine the optoelectronic features of the light emitters. However, most of the discussed physical processes as well as the described fabrication methods and device characterization techniques are of general interest and are beyond the scope of this type of light emitter. The book will be of value to engineers, physicists, and scientists dealing either with Si based photonics in particular or optoelectronic device fabrication and characterization in general.
