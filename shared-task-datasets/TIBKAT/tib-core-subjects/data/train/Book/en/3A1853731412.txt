Analysis and design of prestressed concrete
"Prestressing concrete technology is critical to understanding problems in existing civic structures including railway and highway bridges; to the rehabilitation of older structures; and to the design of new high-speed railway and long-span highway bridges. Analysis and Design of Prestressed Concrete delivers foundational concepts, and the latest research and design methods for the engineering of prestressed concrete, paying particular attention to crack resistance in the design of high-speed railway and long-span highway prestressed concrete bridges. The volume offers readers a comprehensive resource on prestressing technology and applications, as well as the advanced treatment of prestress losses and performance. Key aspects of this volume include analysis and design of prestressed concrete structures using a prestressing knowledge system, from initial stages to service; detailed loss calculation; time-dependent analysis on cross-sectional stresses; straightforward, simplified methods specified in codes; and in-depth calculation methods. Sixteen chapters combine standards and current research, theoretical analysis, and design methods into a practical resource on the analysis and design of prestressed concrete, as well as presenting novel calculation methods and theoretical models of practical use to engineers."--
