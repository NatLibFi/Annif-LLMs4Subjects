"Biomass is a key resource for meeting the energy and material demands of mankind in the future. As a result, businesses and technologies are developing around biomass processing and its applications.Transformation of Biomass: Theory to Practice explores the modern applications of biomass and bio-based residues for the generation of energy, heat and chemical products. The first chapter presents readers with a broad overview of biomass and its composition, conversion routes and products. The following chapters deal with specific technologies, including anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis and gasification, as well as hydrothermal and supercritical conversion. Each chapter details current practises, recent developments, business case models and comprehensive analysis of the problems associated with each approach, and how to optimize them.Topics covered include:  Anaerobic digestion  Reactor design  Pyrolysis  Catalysis in biomass transformation  Engines for combined heat and power  Influence of feedstocks on performance and products  Bio-hydrogen from biomass  Analysis of bio-oils  Numerical simulation and formal kinetic parameters evaluation  Business case development  This textbook will provide students, researchers and industry professionals with a practical and accessible guide to the essential skills required to advance in the field of bioenergy"--
