Computer vision : from surfaces to 3D objects
"The typical computational approach to object understanding derives shape information from the 2D outline of the objects. For complex object structures, however, such a planar approach cannot determine object shape; the structural edges have to be encoded in terms of their full 3D spatial configuration. <STRONG>Computer Vision: From Surfaces to 3D Objects</STRONG> is the first book to take a full approach to the challenging issue of veridical 3D object representation. It introduces mathematical and conceptual advances that offer an unprecedented framework for analyzing the complex scene structure of the world.<EM>An Unprecedented Framework for Complex Object Representation</EM><BR>Presenting the material from both computational and neural implementation perspectives, the book covers novel analytic techniques for all levels of the surface representation problem. The cutting-edge contributions in this work run the gamut from the basic issue of the ground plane for surface estimation through mid-level analyses of surface segmentation processes to complex Riemannian space methods for representing and evaluating surfaces.<EM>State-of-the-Art 3D Surface and Object Representation</EM><BR>This well-illustrated book takes a fresh look at the issue of 3D object representation. It provides a comprehensive survey of current approaches to the computational reconstruction of surface structure in the visual scene"--Provided by publisher
"Computer Vision: From Surfaces to 3D Objects is the first book to take a full approach to the challenging issue of vertical 3D object representation. It introduces mathematical and conceptual advances that offer an unprecedented framework for analyzing the complex scene structure of the world. Leading theorists cover full 3D scene reconstruction, instead of the simplistic 2D planar algorithms employed in the past. They explore cutting-edge research on computational algorithms for scene analysis and present an integrated, complementary treatment of neural, behavioral, mathematical, and computational approaches. The text includes numerous graphics of complex processes, with many in color"--Provided by publisher
