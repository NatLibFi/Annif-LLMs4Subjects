Network intrusion detection and prevention : concepts and techniques
Intrusion Detection and Prevention is a rapidly growing field that deals with detecting and responding to malicious network traffic and computer misuse. Intrusion detection is the process of identifying and (possibly) responding to malicious activities targeted at computing and network resources. Any hardware or software automation that monitors, detects or responds to events occurring in a network or on a host computer is considered relevant to the intrusion detection approach. Different intrusion detection systems provide varying functionalities and benefits. Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention: Concepts and Techniques provides detailed and concise information on different types of attacks, theoretical foundation of attack detection approaches, implementation, data collection, evaluation, and intrusion response. Additionally, it provides an overview of some of the commercially/publicly available intrusion detection and response systems--Cover
