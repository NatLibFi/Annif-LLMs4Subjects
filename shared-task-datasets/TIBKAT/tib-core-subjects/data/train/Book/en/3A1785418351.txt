Snow optics
This book is the first book of its kind, focusing exclusively on the optical properties of snow. As a complex and turbid medium, snow is approached as a strongly light-scattering (in the visible spectrum) medium with large, nonspherical ice grains. The book discusses both experimental and theoretical results, as well as the remote sensing of snow using ground-based, airborne and satellite optical instrumentation. The book will be of particular importance for researchers studying snow characteristics (the size of grains, snow pollution and albedo) using various remote-sensing techniques.
