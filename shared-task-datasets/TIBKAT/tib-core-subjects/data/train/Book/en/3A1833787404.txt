Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials in separation science
This book covers newly emerging two-dimensional nanomaterials which have been recently used for the purpose of water purification. It focuses on the synthesis methods of 2D materials and answers how scientists/engineers/nanotechnologist/environmentalists could use these materials for fabricating new separation membranes and most probably making commercially feasible technology. The chapters are written by a collection of international experts ensuring a broad view of each topic. The book will be of interest to experienced researchers as well as young scientists looking for an introduction into 2D materials-based cross-disciplinary research.
Introduction -- Emerging water pollutants and wastewater treatments -- Nano-porous graphene as free-standing membranes -- Three dimensional and Lamellar graphene oxide membranes for water purification -- Graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide as nanofillers in membrane separation -- Porous graphene membranes for solute separation via reverse osmosis and electrodialysis -- Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) in solutes separation -- Molybdenum disulfide and tungsten disulfide as novel two-dimensional nanomaterials in separation science -- Newly emerging metal-organic frameworks (MOF), MXenes, and zeolite nanosheets in solutes removal from water.
