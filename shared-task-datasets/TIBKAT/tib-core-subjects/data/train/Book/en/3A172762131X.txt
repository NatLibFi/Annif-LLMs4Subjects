Nonlinearity of Colloid Systems: Oxyhydrate Systems
The present monograph is the first systematic study of the non-linear characteristic of gel oxy-hydrate systems involving d- and f- elements. These are the oxyhydrates of rare-earth elements and oxides – hydroxides of d- elements (zirconium, niobium, titanium, etc.) The non-linearity of these gel systems introduces fundamental peculiarities into their structure and, consequently, their properties. The polymer-conformational diversity of energetically congenial gel fragments, which continu-ously transform under the effect of, for instance, system dissipation heat, is central to the au-thor’s hypothesis of the oscillatory–periodic occurrence (motion) of gel structures; even in the air-dry state. This theory permits the accurate description of many of the observed properties of gel oxyhydrate systems, and the prediction of new ones. Also analyzed is the effect of various fields (electromagnetic, magnetic and electrostatic) upon the polymer structures of oxyhydrates with the aim of, for instance, enhancing their sorption capacity and reproducibility.This book will be particularly interesting for scientists and for students majoring in chemistry, physics or engineering; as well as for anybody who may be interested in the physical and chemi-cal problems of non-equilibrium processes. This first systematic study of the non-linear characteristics of gel oxyhydrate systems involves d- and f- elements, which are rare-earth elements (such as zirconium, niobium, and titanium) and oxides. The non-linearity of these gel systems introduces fundamental peculiarities into their structure and therefore into their properties. Sucharev (South Ural State U., Russia) describes the genesis of gel oxyhydrate systems of these elements in the course of their formation, including the modeling of autowave processes in forming oxyhydrate gels of heavy metals, periodic phenomena of the organization of gel oxyhydrate systems, the dilatancy effect as a specific property of gel oxyhydrates, the Liesegang operator as a reflection of nonlinear properties of oxyhydrate gel systems, mesophase-like behaviors of gel systems, the chromatic effect of some oxyhydrate gels, experimental studies of optical properties of gels and the observed chromatic effect, the physico-chemical nature of polarization of living gels of heavy metal oxyhydrates, the influence of electric, magnetic and electromagnetic fields on the structuring processes of vitrium oxyhydrate, and quantum chemical studies of the structural models of zirconium oxyhydrate.
