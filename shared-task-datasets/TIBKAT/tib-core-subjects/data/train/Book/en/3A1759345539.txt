Scanning probe microscopy : the lab on a tip
Written by three leading experts in the field, this book describes and explains all essential aspects of scanning probe microscopy. Emphasis is placed on the experimental design and procedures required to optimize the performance of the various methods described. The book covers not only the physical principles behind this popular technique, but also tackles questions on instrument design, the basic features of the different imaging modes, and recurring artifacts. Novel applications and the latest research results are presented, and the book closes with a look at the future prospects of scanning probe microscopy, while also discussing related techniques in the field of nanoscience. This second edition includes essential scientific updates reflecting the latest research, as well as coverage of new breakthroughs in techniques such as submolecular imaging by atomic force microscopy (AFM), multifrequency AFM, high-speed imaging of biological matter, scanning x-ray microscopy, and tip-enhanced Raman scattering. The book serves as a general, hands-on guide for all types of classes that address scanning probe microscopy. It is ideally suited for graduate and advanced undergraduate students, either for self-study or as a textbook for a dedicated course on the topic. Furthermore, it is an essential component of any scanning probe microscopy laboratory course and a valuable resource for practicing researchers developing and using scanning probe techniques.
