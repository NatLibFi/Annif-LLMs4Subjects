Tile-Based Geospatial Information Systems : Principles and Practices
Tile-based online mapping systems have replaced traditional Web GIS systems, because of their improved speed and usability. The trend towards tile-base systems was started by Internet services companies, such as Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft. They have been followed by the traditional GIS community, government organizations and open source development communities, because tile based systems yield faster and work stronger with 3-D mapping tools. Tile-Based Geospatial Information Systems: Principles and Practice presents a detailed examination of the principles of tile-based systems. Topics include discussions of projections, coordinate systems, image processing, data basing and indexing requirements and web access. Attention is devoted to understanding and development of algorithms needed to make tile-based systems functional and efficient. In addition to the theoretical examination of the topic, this book includes detailed practical content helpful to those charged with implementation of tile-based systems. Case studies are provided in the last 2 chapters of this book. Tile-Based Geospatial Information Systems: Principles and Practice is designed for a professional audience composed of researchers, practitioners and government workers, focusing on geographic information systems and internet technologies and image processing techniques related to GIS. This book is also suitable for advanced-level students in computer science and geography as a secondary text or reference book.
