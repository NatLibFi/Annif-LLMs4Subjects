Derivatives and Integrals of Multivariable Functions
This work provides a systematic examination of derivatives and integrals of multivariable functions. The approach taken here is similar to that of the authorâ€™s previous text, "Continuous Functions of Vector Variables": specifically, elementary results from single-variable calculus are extended to functions in several-variable Euclidean space. Topics encompass differentiability, partial derivatives, directional derivatives and the gradient; curves, surfaces, and vector fields; the inverse and implicit function theorems; integrability and properties of integrals; and the theorems of Fubini, Stokes, and Gauss. Prerequisites include background in linear algebra, one-variable calculus, and some acquaintance with continuous functions and the topology of the real line. Written in a definition-theorem-proof format, the book is replete with historical comments, questions, and discussions about strategy, difficulties, and alternate paths. "Derivatives and Integrals of Multivariable Functions" is a rigorous introduction to multivariable calculus that will help students build a foundation for further explorations in analysis and differential geometry
