Microwave photonics : devices and applications
Microwave photonics is an important interdisciplinary field that, amongst a host of other benefits, enables engineers to implement new functions in microwave systems. With contributions from leading experts, Microwave Photonics: Devices and Applications explores this rapidly developing discipline. It bridges a gap between microwave and photonic engineering, providing an accessible interpretation of the current available research material and a detailed introduction to various aspects of the area. Opening with an overview to the subject, this book covers direct modulation, photonic oscillators
