Photovoltaic solar energy generation
This book provides a comprehensive description of photovoltaics (PV). The presentation is not at an advanced technical level and will be accessible to any interested academic person. Starting with the history of PV, the text outlines its relevance today and in the future. Then follows an introduction to the physical background of solar cells and the most important materials and technologies. Particular emphasis is placed on future developments and prospects from the viewpoint of a well-informed observer. The book goes beyond technology by also describing the path from the cell to the module to the system. It proceeds to the most important present and future applications, such as grid-connected and stand-alone systems. The composition and development of the markets and the role of PV in future energy systems will be considered. Finally, the discussion turns to the future energy supply structure, expected to move towards more distributed generation, and addresses synergies and possible competition from other carbon-free energy sources.
