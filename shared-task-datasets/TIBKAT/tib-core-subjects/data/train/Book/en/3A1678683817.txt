Using mathematica for quantum mechanics : a studentâ€™s manual
Wolfram language overview -- Quantum mechanics: states and operators -- spin and angular momentum -- Quantum motion in real space -- Combining spatial motion and spin
This book revisits many of the problems encountered in introductory quantum mechanics, focusing on computer implementations for finding and visualizing analytical and numerical solutions. It subsequently uses these implementations as building blocks to solve more complex problems, such as coherent laser-driven dynamics in the Rubidium hyperfine structure or the Rashba interaction of an electron moving in 2D. The simulations are highlighted using the programming language Mathematica. No prior knowledge of Mathematica is needed; alternatives, such as Matlab, Python, or Maple, can also be used
