Calculus
"Calculus is an area of advanced mathematics in which continuously changing values are studied. It is introduced at the school level and usually school students consider it as a set of tricks that they need to memorize. They study many other sub-areas of mathematics like algebra and real functions, but are unable to correlate calculus to these streams. This book is a good resource to understand the correlation. It is written to support students in this transition from school calculus to university analysis. Calculus is intended for students pursuing undergraduate studies in mathematics or in disciplines like physics and economics where formal mathematics plays a significant role. It provides a thorough introduction to calculus, with an emphasis on logical development arising out of geometric intuition. For students majoring in mathematics, this book can serve as a bridge to real analysis. For others, it can serve as a base from where they can venture into various applications. After mastering the material in the book, the student would be equipped for higher courses both in the pure (real analysis, complex analysis) and the applied (differential equations, numerical analysis) sides"--
