Bioarrays : from basics to diagnostics
This book provides an integrated collection of timely articles on the use of bioarray techniques in the fields of biotechnology and molecular medicine. It is the first book to comprehensively integrate molecular diagnostics and molecular pathology. This book serves as an indispensable reference for graduate students, post-docs, and professors as well as an explanatory analysis for executives and scientists in biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.
Bioarrays: From Basics to Diagnostics provides an integrated and comprehensive collection of timely articles on the use of bioarray techniques in the fields of biotechnology and molecular medicine. The entire volume is broken into four sections  Bioarray Technology Platforms, Biomarkers and Clinical Genomics, Biomarker Identification Using Clinical Proteomics and Glycomics, and Emerging Technologies in Diagnostics  that create one well-integrated work. Particular emphasis is placed on DNA, protein, and carbohydrate biochips. The volume also looks extensively at oligonucleotides, cDNA, proteins, antibodies, and carbohydrate arrays. Bioarrays: From Basics to Diagnostics will serve as an indispensable reference for graduate students, post-docs, and professors as well as an explanatory analysis for executives and scientists in biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.
