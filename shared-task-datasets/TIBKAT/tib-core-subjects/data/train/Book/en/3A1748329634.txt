Digital communication systems engineering with software-defined radio
This unique resource provides you with a practical approach to quickly learning the software-defined radio concepts you need to know for your work in the field. By prototyping and evaluating actual digital communication systems capable of performing over-the-air wireless data transmission and reception, this volume helps you attain a first-hand understanding of critical design trade-offs and issues. Moreover you gain a sense of the actual real-world operational behavior of these systems. With the purchase of the book, you gain access to several ready-made Simulink experiments at the publisher s website. This collection of laboratory experiments, along with several examples, enables you to successfully implement the designs discussed the book in a short period of time. These files can be executed using MATLAB version R2011b or later versions
