Large-scale system analysis under uncertainty : with electric power applications
"Discover a comprehensive set of tools and techniques for analyzing the impact of uncertainty on large-scale engineered systems. Providing accessible yet rigorous coverage, it showcases the theory through detailed case studies drawn from electric power application problems, including the impact of integration of renewable-based power generation in bulk power systems, the impact of corrupted measurement and communication devices in microgrid closed-loop controls, and the impact of components failures on the reliability of power supply systems. The case studies also serve as a guide on how to tackle similar problems that appear in other engineering application domains, including automotive and aerospace engineering. This is essential reading for academic researchers and graduate students in power systems engineering, and dynamic systems and control engineering"--
