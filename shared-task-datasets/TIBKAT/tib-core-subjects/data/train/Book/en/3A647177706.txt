"Fifty years after the publication of, The Death and Life of Great American Cities, Jane Jacobs is perhaps the most widely read urbanist ever. Her ideas contributed to the wholesale transformation of contemporary planning. This book reminds us of the full range and complexity of her work and offers thoughtful critiques on the consequences of her ideas for cities and planning today"--Back cover
