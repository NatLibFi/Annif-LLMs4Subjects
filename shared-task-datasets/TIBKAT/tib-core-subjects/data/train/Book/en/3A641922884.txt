The Future of architecture since 1889
"Offers a history that starts with the Paris Universal Exposition of 1889, and which gives a complete background by which we can understand the developments of the early twenty-first century. ... Worldwide in scope ... it clarifies the effects of events as diverse as world wars, movements in art and culture, and individual architects on the discipline."--Jacket
Truly far-ranging - both conceptually and geographically - The Future of Architecture Since 1889 is a history that will shape future thinking about this period for years to come. Jean-Louis Cohen gives an authoritative and compelling account of the twentieth century, tracing an arc from industrialization through computerization, and linking architecture to developments in art, technology, urbanism and critical theory. Encompassing both well-known masters and previously neglected but significant architects, this book also reflects Cohen's knowledge architecture across the globe, and in places such Eastern Europe and colonial Africa and South America that have rarely been included in histories of this period. This history is illustrated not only with buildings, projects and plans, but also with publications, portraits, paintings, diagrams, film stills, and exhibitions, showing the immense diversity of architectural thought and production throughout the twentieth century
