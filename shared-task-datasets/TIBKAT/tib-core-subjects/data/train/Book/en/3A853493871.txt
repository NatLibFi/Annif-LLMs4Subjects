Text processing with Ruby : extract value from the data that surrounds you
"Whatever you want to do with text, Ruby is up to the job. Most information in the world is in text format, and you need to make sense of the data hiding within. You want to do this efficiently, avoiding labor-intensive, manual work. Text Processing with Ruby takes a practical approach to working with text. First, Acquire: Explore Ruby's core and standard library, and extract text into your Ruby programs. Process delimited files and web pages, and write utilities. Second, Transform: Use regular expressions, write a parser, and use Natural Language Processing techniques. Finally, Load: Write the transformed text and data to standard output, files, and other processes. Serialize text into JSON, XML, and CVS, and use ERB to create more complex formats. You'll soon be able to tackle even the most enormous and entangled text with ease."--
