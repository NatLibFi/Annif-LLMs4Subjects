American homes : the landmark illustrated encyclopedia of domestic architecture
"American Homes is a 500-year history of all the places we call home. In this beautifully illustrated, classic reference, award-winning architect Lester Walker presents more than a hundred styles of homes and helps us understand the history of each, why it developed as it did, and the practical and historical reasons behind its shape, size, material, ornament, and plan."--
