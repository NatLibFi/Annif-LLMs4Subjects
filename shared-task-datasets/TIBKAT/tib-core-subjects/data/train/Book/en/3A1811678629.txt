Contactless system for measurement and evaluation of machined surfaces
This book presents a contactless system for the measurement and evaluation of selected characteristics of machined surfaces. It describes the design and construction of new equipment designed for contactless characterization of surface geometry working based on laser profilometry by triangulation principle. The book focuses on the quality assessment of surfaces produced by the technology of abrasive waterjet cutting (AWJ) and by laser. The author analyses the performed experiment of measurement of machined surfaces of samples of aluminum, stainless steel, and constructional steel using the contactless method with the LPM system and contact method using Mitutoyo SJ 400 surface roughness tester.
