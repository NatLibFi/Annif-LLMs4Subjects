Contaminated water : pollutants, effects and remediation technologies
"The use of pesticides is essential in the current agricultural context, helping to constantly increase productivity. Contaminated Water: Pollutants, Effects and Remediation Technologies aims to gather information about their interactions in the environment and possible consequences. The authors present sustainable perspectives and alternatives for water remediation, gathering information on various residues that can be used as adsorbents and their potential against organic and inorganic contaminants. Concise information on fundamentals effecting deposition parameters and a characterization of electrodeposition is provided. The authors emphasize the acute and chronic effects induced by untreated wastewater on the morphology, biochemistry and genetic profile of fish. In the concluding investigation, a perchloric acid pre-treated glassy carbon electrode was fabricated by electrochemical pre-treatment method using the cyclic voltammetric technique"--
