Living roofs
Penthouses and rooftop terraces let you reach for the stars and the only limit on what you can design in your exclusive oasis is your imagination. In densely populated areas, rooftop gardens inject a lovely note of green into the urban landscape. People grow their own vegetables or use grass and shrubs to frame an opulent lounge area or pool. This book explores the sophisticated interplay of indoor and outdoor living among the clouds and immerses you in the feeling of living in between heaven and earth. Peace and relaxation are the focus in this slice of paradise, a place where you can quite literally sit back and watch the world go by.
