Understanding Fluorescein Angiography
Fluorescein angiography is an indispensable tool in modern ophthalmology. It is founded on the evaluation of phenomena related to the behavior intravenously administered sodium fluorescein in the tissues of the ocular fundus. Commonly, texts on fluorescein angiography merely describe the typical pattern, quality, and quantity of the phenomena specific to a variety of vascular and other diseases of the retina and choroid. In contrast, the present book deals with the morphological prerequisites and structural changes on which the individual phenomena are based.  This knowledge provides the retina specialist, the general ophthalmologist, and the basic scientist alike with valuable information toward understanding the nature and mechanism of the underlying disorders. The book represents a unique mixture of textbook and atlas, always combining concise statements in English, German, and Spanish on one page with didactically conceived explanatory illustrations on the facing page.
