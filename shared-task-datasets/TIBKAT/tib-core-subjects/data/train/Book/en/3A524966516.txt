Magnesium technology : metallurgy, design data, applications
Magnesium, with a density of 1.74 g/cm, is the lightest structural metal. It is increasingly chosen for weight-critical applications such as in land-based transport systems. This book assembles contributions that cover research programs on alloys with the requisite property profiles, and the state of technological applications of magnesium
