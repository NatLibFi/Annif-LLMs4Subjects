Direct current fault protection : basic soncepts and technology advances
The lack of effective DC fault protection technology remains a major barrier for the DC paradigm shift. In addressing the key challenges, Direct Current Fault Protection: Basic Concepts and Technology Advances starts with an introduction to the advantages of DC power systems before moving on to an in-depth review of DC fault protection technologies, including mechanical circuit breaker (MCB), solid-state circuit breaker (SSCB), hybrid circuit breaker (HCB), converter based (breakerless) protection, and fault current limiter (FCL). Coverage includes a comprehensive comparison of various DC fault interruption technologies and their suitable applications, state-of-the-art DC fault protection concepts and advances in research, identification of fundamental challenges and future directions in the field, and commercialization aspects. This book will be a valuable reference for practicing engineers, researchers, and graduate students in the field of power electronics and DC power systems. Covers basic concepts and recent advances Offers insights on challenges and potential solutions Discusses relevance to adoption, operation, and efficiency of distributed renewable energy systems .
