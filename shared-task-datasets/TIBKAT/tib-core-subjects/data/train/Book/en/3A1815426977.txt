Convolutional neural networks for medical image processing applications
"With the development of technology, living standards rise and people's expectations increase. This situation makes itself felt strikingly especially in the medical field. The use of medical devices is rapidly increasing to protect human health. It is very important to quickly evaluate the images obtained from these medical imaging devices. For this purpose, artificial intelligence (AI) methods are used. While hand-crafted methods were preferred in the past, more advanced methods are preferred today. CNN architectures are one of the most effective AI methods today. This book contains applications for the use of CNN methods for medical applications. The content of the book, in which different CNN methods are applied to various medical image processing problems, is quite extensive. Readers will be able to comprehensively analyze the effects of CNN methods presented in the book on medical applications"--
