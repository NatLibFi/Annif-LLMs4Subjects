The cybersecurity body of knowledge : the ACM/IEEE/AIS/IFIP recommendations for a complete curriculum in cybersecurity
The Cybersecurity Body of Knowledge explains the content, purpose, and use of eight knowledge areas that define the boundaries of the discipline of cybersecurity. The discussion focuses on, and is driven by, the essential concepts of each knowledge area that collectively capture the cybersecurity body of knowledge to provide a complete picture of the field. This book is based on a brand-new and up to this point unique, global initiative, known as CSEC2017, which was created and endorsed by ACM, IEEE-CS, AIS SIGSEC, and IFIP WG 11.8. This has practical relevance to every educator in the discipline of cybersecurity. Because the specifics of this body of knowledge cannot be imparted in a single text, the authors provide the necessary comprehensive overview. In essence, this is the entry-level survey of the comprehensive field of cybersecurity. It will serve as the roadmap for individuals to later drill down into a specific area of interest. This presentation is also explicitly designed to aid faculty members, administrators, CISOs, policy makers, and stakeholders involved with cybersecurity workforce development initiatives. The book is oriented toward practical application of a computing-based foundation, crosscutting concepts, and essential knowledge and skills of the cybersecurity discipline to meet workforce demands.
