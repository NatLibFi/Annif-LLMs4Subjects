Generalizations of Thomae's Formula for Zn Curves
Previous publications on the generalization of the Thomae formulae to Zn curves have emphasized the theory's implications in mathematical physics and depended heavily on applied mathematical techniques. This book redevelops these previous results demonstrating how they can be derived directly from the basic properties of theta functions as functions on compact Riemann surfaces. 'Generalizations of Thomae's Formula for Zn Curves' includes several refocused proofs developed in a generalized context that is more accessible to researchers in related mathematical fields such as algebraic geometry, complex analysis, and number theory. This book is intended for mathematicians with an interest in complex analysis, algebraic geometry or number theory as well as physicists studying conformal field theory.
