Parametrized, deformed and general neural networks
In this book, we introduce the parametrized, deformed and general activation function of neural networks. The parametrized activation function kills much less neurons than the original one. The asymmetry of the brain is best expressed by deformed activation functions. Along with a great variety of activation functions, general activation functions are also engaged. Thus, in this book, all presented is original work by the author given at a very general level to cover a maximum number of different kinds of neural networks: giving ordinary, fractional, fuzzy and stochastic approximations. It presents here univariate, fractional and multivariate approximations. Iterated sequential multi-layer approximations are also studied. The functions under approximation and neural networks are Banach space valued
