New developments in adsorption/separation of small molecules by zeolites
This volume compiles and discusses the fundamental and multidisciplinary knowledge on adsorption and separation processes using zeolites as adsorbents. Over the last decade, a large amount of research has been carried out for the development of zeolites as adsorbents. However, there is still a growing interest to increase the understanding of such selective adsorbents. Therefore, synthesis strategies and new approaches for developing new selective zeolite adsorbents for gas separation are presented in the first chapter. In addition, a chapter focused on adsorption characterization techniques of microporous materials is included. This will be helpful for advanced readers, since the new IUPAC recommendations for microporous characterization are not still widely employed by the zeolite community. Experimental and theoretical aspects of economically and environmentally relevant separations, which have been successfully carried out with zeolites, are discussed in detail in subsequent chapters. Finally, industrial zeolite based adsorption and separation processes as well as current perspectives for new zeolite based separations, and improvements of current technologies are presented.
