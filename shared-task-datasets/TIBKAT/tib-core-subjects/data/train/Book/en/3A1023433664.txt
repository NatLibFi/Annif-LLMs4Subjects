Cross-border entrepreneurship and economic development in Europe's border regions
This topical study focuses on entrepreneurship and economic development in Europe’s border regions. It highlights the effects of EU enlargement in these regions – both within the EU and in neighbouring countries – paying particular attention to cross-border entrepreneurial activity. -- Cross-border cooperation involving entrepreneurs is attracting increasing attention in Europe as EU enlargement has increased the length of its borders with the former Soviet republics. The expert contributors highlight that border regions tend to be economically disadvantaged as a result of their peripherality, which means that cross-border cooperation for business purposes represents a potential development tool. This groundbreaking book contains an empirical evidence base drawn from regions in EU member states and the Newly Independent States, as well as providing a conceptual base for informed policy development.
