Jacobi Matrices and the Moment Problem
This monograph presents the solution of the classical moment problem, the construction of Jacobi matrices and corresponding polynomials. The cases of strongly,trigonometric, complex and real two-dimensional moment problems are discussed, and the Jacobi-type matrices corresponding to the trigonometric moment problem are shown. The Berezansky theory of the expansion in generalized eigenvectors for corresponding set of commuting operators plays the key role in the proof of results. The book is recommended for researchers in fields of functional analysis, operator theory, mathematical physics, and engineers who deal with problems of coupled pendulums.
