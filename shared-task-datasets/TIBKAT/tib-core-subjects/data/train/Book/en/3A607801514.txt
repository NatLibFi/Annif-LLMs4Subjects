Machining composite materials
"This book provides the fundamental background and coverage of recent advances in the machining of the major types of composite materials (polymers, metals and ceramics) encountered in modern manufacturing engineering. The three parts of the book therefore cover the machining of polymeric, metal and ceramic matrix composites." "The book can be used as a text for the final year of an undergraduate engineering course or for those studying machining/composites at the graduate level. It can also serve as a highly useful reference work for engineering, manufacturing and materials science researchers, manufacturing and mechanical engineers, and professionals in composites technology and related industries." --Book Jacket
