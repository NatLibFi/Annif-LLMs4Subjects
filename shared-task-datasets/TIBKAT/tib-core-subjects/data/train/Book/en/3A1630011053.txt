Built unbuilt
In this book, Julien De Smedt investigates the realms of architecture and its future possibilities. ?(Un)Built JDS(A)? is to be read from a professional perspective, as an exploration of innovation and new forms of design urbanity. It is a didactic yet personal approach to urbanity matters. Projects realised by Julien De Smedt Architects form the basis of the featured content, covering all aspects in the making of architecture, with all financial implications, etc. of operating in the real world accounted for. Even if some of the investigations seem out of scale or even utopian, they all stem from actual commissions and share a genuine desire to address individual needs and topics, such as how to create more basic, low tech urban living qualities and activate spaces giving them more air, making them greener and providing more light and views. The selected projects aim at enhancing the diverse aspects of the programme so that the resulting buildings each become more than a single entity driven by a single purpose.0
