Metal forming science and practice : a state-of-the-art volume in honour of Profesor J.A. Schey's 80th birthday
This publication has been written to honour the contribution to science and education made by the Distinguished Professor Emeritus Professor Schey on his eightieth birthday. The contributors to his book are among the countless researchers who have read, studied and learned from Professor Schey's work, which includes books, research monographs, invited papers, keynote papers, scientific journals and conferences. The topics include manufacturing, sheet and bulk metal forming and tribology, amongst others. The topics included in this book include: John Schey and value-added manufacturing; Surface finish and friction in cold-metal rolling; Direct observation of interface for tribology in metal forming; An examination of the coefficient of friction; Studies on micro plasto hydrodynamic lubrication in metal forming; Numerical simulation of sheet metal forming; Geometric and mechanics model of sheet forming; Modelling and optimisation of metal forming processes; The mathematical modelling of hot rolling steel; Identification of rheological and tribological parameters; Oxide behaviour in hot rolling; Friction, lubrication and surface response in wire drawing; and Modelling and control of temper rolling and skin pass rolling
