Atmospheric lidar fundamentals : laser light scattering from atoms and linear molecules
"Since the comprehensive textbook entitled Laser Remote Sensing: Fundamentals and Applications, written by R. M. Measures, was published byWiley-Interscience in 1984 [1.1], there have been tremendous advances both in laser technology - especially in the realm of spectral purity and high power - and in information/ digital technology. These advances in the past three-plus decades have transformed narrowband lidars from being demonstrations of remote sensing concepts to working instruments capable of probing the atmosphere on regular and quasi-continuous bases. Nevertheless, until 2005 there was no substantial textbook development about atmospheric lidars to keep up with these advances. At that time, two extensive collections of book chapters, written by experts and researchers specializing in different aspects and types of lidars, were published. They are Laser Remote Sensing, published by CRC Press with Takashi Fujii and Tetsuo Fukuchi [1.2] as editors, and Lidar: Range-Resolved Optical Remote Sensing of the Atmosphere, published by Springer with Claus Weitkamp [1.3] as the editor. These books brought up to date all important advances and practices in lidar research. The book chapters in these collections, though already more than a decade old at the time of this writing, contain sufficient information for beginners to learn and to initiate a chosen type of lidar for their remote sensing and research needs. When coupled with manufacturers' websites that now provide up-to-date information on the availability of lidar hardware, these resources represent sufficient information for state-of-the-art system development"--
