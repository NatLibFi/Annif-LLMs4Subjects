Optical thin films and coatings : from materials to applications
Optical coatings, including mirrors, anti-reflection coatings, beam splitters, and filters, are an integral part of most modern optical systems. Optical thin films and coatings provides an overview of thin film materials, the properties, design and manufacture of optical coatings and their use across a variety of application areas. Part one explores the design and manufacture of optical coatings. Part two highlights unconventional features of optical thin films including scattering properties of random structures in thin films, optical properties of thin film materials at short wavelengths, thermal properties and colour effects. Part three focusses on novel materials for optical thin films and coatings and includes chapters on organic optical coatings, surface multiplasmonics and optical thin films containing quantum dots. Finally, applications of optical coatings, including laser components, solar cells, displays and lighting, and architectural and automotive glass, are reviewed in part four. Optical thin films and coatings is a technical resource for researchers and engineers working with optical thin films and coatings, professionals in the security, automotive, space and other industries requiring an understanding of these topics, and academics interested in the field.
