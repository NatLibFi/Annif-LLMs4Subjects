Protective chemical agents in the amelioration of plant abiotic stress : biochemical and molecular perspectives
"This book will provide an in-depth view of the diverse chemical agents that have the potential to mitigate different forms of abiotic stress in plants. The information contained in this book will pave a long way in exploiting the novel chemical agents in crop improvement program through exogenous application in nutrient solution or foliar spraying as well as by chemical priming technology. This book will serve as an important repository for researchers, academicians and scientists to enhance and boost their knowledge for further research in understanding the role of novel chemicals and exploiting such chemical agents to tackle with the oxidative damages caused by environmental stresses. Such knowledge regarding the efficacy of different chemical agents can be disseminated to farmers which would benefit agriculture under stress conditions at the ground level"--
