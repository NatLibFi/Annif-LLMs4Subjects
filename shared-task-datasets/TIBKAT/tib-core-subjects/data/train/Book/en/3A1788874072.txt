The Physics of dew, breath figures and dropwise condensation
In this book, the author focuses on the physics behind dew, breaths figures, and dropwise condensation phenomena to introduce scientists, engineers and students to the many original processes involved in condensation. Consisting of 15 Chapters, 18 Appendices and over 500 references, the reader learns the needed theoretical backgrounds and formulae to understand the complexity of dropwise condensation. Heat and mass transfer, nucleation and growth on various substrates are considered (solid, liquid, plastic, undergoing phase change or micro-patterned substrates). The particular role of thermal or geometrical discontinuities where growth can be enhanced or reduced, dynamical aspects of self-diffusion, problems related to drop collection by gravity and the optics of dropwise condensation are all discussed. Although the content mainly deals with condensation from humid air, it can readily be generalized to condensation of any substance. The specificities of pure vapor condensation (e.g. steam) are also examined. Numerous images are provided within the text to illustrate the physics. This book is meant for those studying or researching dew and dropwise condensation, but also for individuals wishing to develop their knowledge on the subject. .
