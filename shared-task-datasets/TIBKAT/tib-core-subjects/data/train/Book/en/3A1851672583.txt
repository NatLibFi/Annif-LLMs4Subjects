Terahertz liquid photonics
"While terahertz wave generation from gas, solid and plasma with femtosecond laser excitation has been widely used, terahertz liquid photonics is a newly emerging topic in recent years. This book includes the most recent experimental results, theoretical analysis, and simulated calculations on terahertz emission and detection from liquid materials under ultrashort-pulse laser excitation, providing readers a comprehensive understanding of current developments in terahertz liquid photonics. By comparing with traditional sources, distinctive properties of terahertz wave generation from liquids are discussed in detail, which provides a new perspective in exploring laser-matter interactions"--
