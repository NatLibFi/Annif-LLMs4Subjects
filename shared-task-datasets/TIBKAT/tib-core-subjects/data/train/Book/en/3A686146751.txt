Reading economic geography
This reader introduces students to examples of the most important research contributions to economic geography in recent years. In its structure and content, it mirrors Blackwell's Companion to Economic Geography and it can be used either to complement that volume or as a stand-alone text. The reader opens with an editorial introduction, summarising the nature of contemporary economic geography, explaining the volume's structure, and discussing what it means to take a critical approach to geography. The readings themselves are grouped into five sections, each of which is also prefaced by an editorial commentary, placing them within a critical framework. Suggestions for further reading are included to enable students to investigate particular topics further. The editors are all highly respected international authorities on economic geography
