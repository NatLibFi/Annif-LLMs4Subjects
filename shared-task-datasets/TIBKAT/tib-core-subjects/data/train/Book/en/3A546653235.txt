Scanning microscopy for nanotechnology : techniques and applications
With the rapid development of nanotechnology, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) can be exploited not only for nanomaterials characterization, but also integrated with new technology for in-situ nanomaterials engineering and manipulation. Scanning Microscopy for Nanotechnology is comprised of both techniques and application chapters, and covers topics including nanomaterials imaging, X-ray microanalysis, high resolution SEM, low kV SEM, cryo-SEM, as well as new techniques including electron back scatter diffracation (EBSD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The fabrication techniques integrated with SEM, such as e-beam nanolithography, nanomanipulation, and focused ion beam nanofabrication, are major new dimensions for SEM application. Applications include the study of nanoparticles, nanowires and nanotubes, three dimensional nanostructures, quantum dots, magnetic nanomaterials, photonic structures, and bio-inspired nanomaterials. The book will appeal not only to a broad range of nanomaterials researchers, but to SEM development specialists as well.
This book presents scanning electron microscopy (SEM) fundamentals and applications for nanotechnology. It includes integrated fabrication techniques using the SEM, such as e-beam and FIB, and it covers in-situ nanomanipulation of materials. The book is written by international experts from the top nano-research groups that specialize in nanomaterials characterization. The book will appeal to nanomaterials researchers, and to SEM development specialists.
