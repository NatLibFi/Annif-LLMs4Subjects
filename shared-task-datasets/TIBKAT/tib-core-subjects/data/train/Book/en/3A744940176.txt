Waves Called Solitons : Concepts and Experiments
Written for an interdisciplinary readership of physicists, engineers, and chemists, this book is a practical guide to the fascinating world of solitons. These waves of large amplitude propagate over long distances without dispersing and therefore show one of the most striking aspects of nonlinearity. The author addresses students and practitioners, approaching the subject from the standpoint of applications in optics, hydrodynamics, as well as electrical and chemical engineering. The book also encourages the reader to perform his own experiments
