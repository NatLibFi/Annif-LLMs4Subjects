Proceedings of the National Workshop on Recent Advances in Condensed Matter and High Energy Physics : CMHEP-2021
This book presents peer-reviewed articles from the National Workshop on Recent Advances in Condensed Matter and High Energy Physics-2021 (CMHEP-2021). This workshop was held in the Department of Physics, Ewing Christian College (ECC), Prayagraj, in collaboration with National Academic of Sciences (NASI), Prayagraj, India, in 2021. The book highlights recent theoretical and experimental developments in condensed matter and high energy physics which include novel phases of matter, namely crystalline and non-crystalline phases, unconventional superconducting phases, magnetic phases and Quark–Gluon plasma phases along with searches of neutrino and dark matter. This book provides a good resource for beginners as well as advanced researchers in the field of condensed matter and high energy physics.
