Variable Structure and Lyapunov Control
This book covers a wide range of up-to-date sliding mode Variable Structure Control (VSC) and Lyapunov Control research and design techniques for the robust control of uncertain systems. In direct contrast to most adaptive controllers, these deterministic controllers employ fixed nonlinear feedback control functions, which operate effectively over a specified magnitude range of system parameter variations and disturbances. There are 18 chapters covering and discussing such topics as the theoretical and practical design of controllers for uncertain multivariable systems, novel algebraic approaches for sliding mode control, discrete-time control, and the stabilizing VSC of uncertain infinite-dimensional systems. The main areas of application include electric motor drives, robotics, flight control and space systems, as well as power electronics and chemical processes, some of which are described in the book
