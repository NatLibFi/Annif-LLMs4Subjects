High-entropy materials : theory, experiments and applications
This book discusses fundamental studies involving the history, modelling, simulation, experimental work, and applications on high-entropy materials. Topics include data-driven and machine-learning approaches, additive-manufacturing techniques, computational and analytical methods, such as density functional theory and multifractal analysis, mechanical behavior, high-throughput methods, and irradiation effects. The types of high-entropy materials consist of alloys, oxides, and ceramics. The book then concludes with a discussion on potential future applications of these novel materials. Includes both experimental and theoretical approaches for fundamental understanding of the behavior of high-entropy materials Discusses interesting and innovative approaches to studying various phenomena, such as machine learning, additive manufacturing, mechanical behavior, high-throughput techniques, and irradiation effects in high-entropy materials Facilitates the applications of high-entropy materials Provides an accessible reference for a broad audience of both academic, national laboratory, and industrial experts.
