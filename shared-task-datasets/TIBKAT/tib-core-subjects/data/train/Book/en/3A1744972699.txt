Reputation risk and globalisation : exploring the idea of a self-regulating corporation
Recently, multinational corporations have begun to reinvent themselves as socially responsible actors, largely in response to anti-corporate activist pressure. The author argues that a concern with corporate reputation is leading to an ideational shift in corporate behaviour - in essence, it is disciplining their behaviour. This innovative exploration of the idea of a self-regulating corporation in an era of globalisation first examines the link between corporate reputation, corporate behaviour and self-regulation, and then goes on to compare and contrast various studies of multinational corporations that have sought to self-regulate. Terry O'Callaghan includes a multifaceted critique of anti-corporate activists. This acknowledges both the dangers that multinational corporations pose to communities, and that anti-corporate activists are the first group to understand the potential risk of targeted campaigns to corporate reputations. He also illustrates his points using three case studies of companies that have attempted to self-regulate: Royal Dutch Shell, the Toyota Motor Corporation and Interface Inc. Undergraduate and postgraduate students of international business, management and business ethics will be interested in the essential topics covered in this book. Academics and practitioners alike will appreciate its accessible lessons about reputational capital and holding multinational corporations accountable
