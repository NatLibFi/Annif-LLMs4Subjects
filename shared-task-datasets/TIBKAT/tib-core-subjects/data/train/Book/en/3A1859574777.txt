Stad zonder hoogtevrees : de ontwikkeling van een Europese hoogbouwtypologie
"High-rise is in Rotterdam's DNA. As early as 1898, the city attracted attention with Het Witte Huis, which at 43 m was considered Europe's tallest office building at the time. Now, 125 years later, new insights and techniques have allowed the highest point of the Rotterdam skyline to run to more than 200 m. City without fear of heights takes stock of the past decades of high-rise construction and describes main lessons and learning points."--Publisher information
