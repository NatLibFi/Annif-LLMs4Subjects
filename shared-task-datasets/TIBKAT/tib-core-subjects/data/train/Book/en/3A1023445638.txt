Sustainable urban water environment : climate, pollution and adaptation
This multi-disciplinary book provides practical solutions for safeguarding the sustainability of the urban water environment. Firstly, the importance of the urban water environment is highlighted and the major problems urban water bodies face and strategies to safeguard the water environment are explored. Secondly, the diversity of pollutants entering the water environment through stormwater runoff are discussed and modelling approaches for factoring in climate change and future urban and transport scenarios are proposed. Thirdly, by linking the concepts of sustainable urban ecosystems and sustainable urban and transport development, capabilities of two urban sustainability assessment models are demonstrated. To achieve sustainability of the urban water environment and future viability of treatment strategies, a framework that supports their adaptation to future challenges is required. A conceptual framework which involves a decision making cycle integrating best management practices and best planning practices that can be adopted to ensure future adaptation is also presented. Taking a holistic approach and with practical applications for modelling and predictions, Sustainable Urban Water Environment will strongly appeal to postgraduate students, practitioners and researchers in environmental science, environmental policy and urban transport planning.
