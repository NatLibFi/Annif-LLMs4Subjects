Machinery and energy systems for the hydrogen economy
Machinery and Energy Systems for the Hydrogen Economy covers all major machinery and heat engine types, designs and requirements for the hydrogen economy, from production through storage, distribution and consumption. Topics such as hydrogen in pipeline transport, for energy storage, and as a power plant fuel are covered in detail.  Hydrogen machinery applications, their selection criteria, economics, safety aspects and operational limitations in different sectors of the hydrogen economy are also discussed. Although the book covers the hydrogen economy as a whole, its primary focus is on machinery and heat engine design and implementation within various production, transport, storage and usage applications.An invaluable resource for industry, academia and government, this book provides engineers, scientists and technical leaders with the knowledge they need to design and build the infrastructure of a hydrogen economy.- Updates the award-winning first edition in all aspects of sequence stratigraphy, from underlying theory to practical applications- Includes broad coverage of topics, including sequence stratigraphic methodology, nomenclature, and classification, the role of modeling in sequence stratigraphy, the difference between modeling and methodology, and the issue of scale and stratigraphic resolution- Presents the three-dimensional nature of stratigraphic architecture and the variability of stratigraphic sequences with the tectonic setting, depositional setting, and the climatic regime- Illustrated with numerous high-quality diagrams, outcrop photographs and subsurface borehole and seismic data
