Metal oxides and related solids for electrocatalytic water splitting
Metal Oxides and Related Solids for Electrocatalytic Water Splitting reviews the fundamentals and strategies needed to design and fabricate metal oxide-based electrocatalysts. After an introduction to the key properties of transition metal oxides, materials engineering methods to optimize the performance of metal-oxide based electrocatalysts are discussed. Strategies reviewed include defect engineering, interface engineering and doping engineering. Other sections cover important categories of metal-oxide (and related solids) based catalysts, including layered hydroxides, metal chalcogenides, metal phosphides, metal nitrides, metal borides, and more. Each chapter introduces important properties and material design strategies, including composite and morphology design. There is also an emphasis on cost-effective materials design and fabrication for optimized performance for electrocatalytic water splitting applications. Lastly, the book touches on recently developed in-situ characterization methods applied to observe and control the material synthesis process.--
