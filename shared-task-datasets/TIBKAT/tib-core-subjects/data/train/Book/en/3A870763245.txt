Group theory of chemical elements : structure and properties of elements and compounds
In this monograph, group-theoretical approaches are used to build a system of hadrons and qualitatively describe the properties of chemical compounds. This serves as a complement to numerically and approximately solve the many-electron Schr√∂dinger equation, in order to understand the behavior of chemical elements. Besides general theory, specific results are compared with experimentally measured chemical properties.
