NMR in glycoscience and glycotechnology
This volume focuses on solution and solid-state NMR of carbohydrates, glycoproteins, glyco-technologies, biomass and related topics. It is estimated that at least 80% of all proteins are glycoproteins. Because of the complexity, heterogeneity and flexibility of the sugar chains, the structural biology approaches for glycoconjugates have been generally avoided. NMR techniques although well established for structural analyses of proteins and nucleic acids, cannot be simply applied to this complex class of biomolecules. Nonetheless, recently developed NMR techniques for carbohydrates open the door to conformational studies of a variety of sugar chains of biological interest. NMR studies on glycans will have significant impact on the development of vaccines, adjuvants, therapeutics, biomarkers and on biomass regeneration. Timely and useful, it will appeal to researchers in the general field of structural biology, biochemistry and biophysics, molecular and cellular biology and material science
