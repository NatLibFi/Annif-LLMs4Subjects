Discharge in long air gaps : modelling and applications
Discharge in Long Air Gaps: Modelling and applications presents self-consistent predictive dynamic models of positive and negative discharges in long air gaps. Equivalent models are also derived to predict lightning parameters based on the similarities between long air gap discharges and lightning flashes. Macroscopic air gap discharge parameters are calculated to solve electrical, empirical and physical equations, and comparisons between computed and experimental results for various test configurations are presented and discussed. This book is intended to provide a fresh perspective by contributing an innovative approach to this research domain, and universities with programs in high-voltage engineering will find this volume to be a working example of how to introduce the basics of electric discharge phenomena.
