Strain-engineered MOSFETs
"This book brings together new developments in the area of spin-engineered MOSFETs using high-mobility substrates such as SIGe, strained-Si, germanium-on-insulator, and III-V semiconductors. The authors cover the materials aspects, principles, design, fabrication, and applications of advanced devices. They present a full TCAD methodology for strain-engineering in Si CMOS technology involving data flow from process simulation to systematic process variability simulation and generation of SPICE process compact models for manufacturing for yield optimization"--
