Rock mass classification : a practical approach in civil engineering
<IT>Rock Mass Classifications - A Practical Approach in Civil Engineering</IT> was written in response to the many unanswered questions regarding this subject. Questions such as - Is Classification reasonably reliable? Can it be successful in crisis management of geohazards? Can a single Classification system be general for all rock structures? Is Classification a scientific approach? Laborious field research was undertaken in the Himalayan mountains by a team of scientists from the Central Mining Research Institute (CMRI), University of Roorkee (UOR), Central Soil and Material Research Station (CSMRS), U.P. Irrigation Research Institute (UPIRI), and Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI) to answer these questions. The results obtained from the research work were systematically compiled to produce this book which bears particular relevance to civil, mining and petroleum engineers and geologists. <H3>Endorsements</H3> "It is a Handbook of Rock Engineering"--Zhao Jian, School of Civil & Structural Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore "I came across your new book - Rock Mass Classification, absolutely fantastic"--Subodh K.
