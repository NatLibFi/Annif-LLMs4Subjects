Cylinder components : Properties, applications, materials
As today's spark-ignition and diesel engines have to fulfil constantly increasing demands with regard to CO2 reduction, emissions, weight and lifetime, detailed knowledge of the components of an internal combustion engine is absolutely essential. Automotive engineers can no longer survive without such expertise, regardless of whether they are involved in design, development, testing or maintenance. This text book provides answers to questions relating to the design, production and machining of cylinder components in a comprehensive technical analysis.  The MAHLE Group is one of the top 30 automotive suppliers globally and is the world market leader for combustion engine components, systems and peripherals.
Due to the ever increasing requirements to be met by gasoline and diesel engines in terms of CO2 reduction, emission behavior, weight, and service life, a comprehensive understanding of combustion engine components is essential today. It is no longer possible for a professional in automotive engineering to manage without the corresponding know-how, whether that is in the field of design, development, testing, or maintenance. This technical book provides in-depth answers to questions about design, production, and machining of cylinder components.
