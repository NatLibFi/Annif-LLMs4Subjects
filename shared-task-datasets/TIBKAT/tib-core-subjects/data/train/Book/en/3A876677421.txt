Electromagnetic anechoic chambers : a fundamental design and specification guide
A practical one-volume guide to anechoic chamber designs for electromagnetic measurements The electromagnetic anechoic chamber has been with us since it was invented at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC, in the early 1950s. Just about every major aerospace company has large numbers of them located throughout the United States and the world. Now, because of the stringent electromagnetic interference requirements that must be considered in the development of all new electronic products, these facilities are appearing in the automotive, telecommunications, aerospace, computer, and other industries. This handbook provides the designer/procurer of electromagnetic chambers with a single source of practical information on the full range of anechoic chamber designs. It reviews the current state of the art in indoor electromagnetic testing facilities and their design and specifications. You'll find information on a large variety of anechoic chambers used for a broad range of electromagnetic measurements that are commonly conducted in indoor test facilities as well as details on: * Measurement theory to support the chamber design procedures provided in each of the specific chamber designs * Test facilities for the measurement of antennas, scattering (RCS), and electromagnetic compatibility * An extensive set of photographs, including a special color section highlighting some of the more interesting anechoic test facilities that have been built to solve various measurement problems * Design/procurement checklists
