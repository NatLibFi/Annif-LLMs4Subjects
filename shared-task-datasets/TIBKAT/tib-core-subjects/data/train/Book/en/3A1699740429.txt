Revealing change in cultural landscapes : material, spatial and ecological considerations
"This book explores different design approaches to revealing change within a landscape, and examines how landscape designers bring together the cultural context of a specific place with material, spatial and ecological considerations. Revealing change in Cultural Landscapes includes case studies such as Gilles Cl√©ment's Jardin du Tiers-Paysage in France, The Brick Pit in Sydney, Australia and Georges Descombes' Renaturalisation of the River Aire in Switzerland to uncover the insights of designers. In doing so, Catherine Heatherington considers the different ways designers approach the revealing of change and how this informs a discussion about people's perceptions and understanding of landscape. With over 100 images and contributions from Jacky Bowring, Dermot Foley and Krystallia Kamvasinou, this book would be beneficial for students of landscape and landscape architecture, particularly those with an interest in how landscapes change over time and how this is perceived by both designers and visitors"--
