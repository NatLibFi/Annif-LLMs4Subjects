Next generation intelligent networks
If you want an up-to-date, in-depth understanding of next generation intelligent networks (IN), this book is essential reading. It provides you with a comprehensive survey of current and emerging intelligent telecommunications networks, including underlying software, implementation, deployment and standards. It assesses the influence of mobile networks and IP technology on the directions that IN is taking now, and looks at the way middleware is reducing the dependence of service logic on the underlying network protocols. Moreover, it discusses the role of IN in tomorrow's network. Next Generation Intelligent Networks investigates how service creation is taking on board state-of-the-art distributed object-oriented programming techniques. The book focuses on emerging software architectures for programming and deploying value-added services, and proposes a vision of value-added services in the network of the future. Learn how new initiatives such as Soft switches, JAIN, Parlay, OSA, TINA and CAMEL help you to more effectively handle the new challenges brought on by the rapid growth of cellular mobile networks and the Internet
