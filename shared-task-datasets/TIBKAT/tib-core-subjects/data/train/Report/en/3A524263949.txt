Boomburbs : the rise of America's accidental cities
This title gives a glance at a list of America's fastest growing cities, which reveals quite a surprise: most are really overgrown suburbs. "Boomburbs," a term coined by the authors, are large suburbs of more than 100,000 residents that are not the biggest municipality in their metropolitan areas. In this fascinating look at the complicated and often contradictory world of boomburbs, Robert Lang and Jennifer LeFurgy address who lives in them, what drives their development, and how they are governed.
