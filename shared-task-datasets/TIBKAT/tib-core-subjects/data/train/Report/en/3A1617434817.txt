Implementing distributed systems with Java and CORBA : with ... 13 tables
The book addresses readers interested in the design and development of distributed software systems relying on the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA). CORBA is an industry standard that has considerably changed the way modern information systems are developed. It enables the platform-independent and programming-language-independent implementation of distributed object-oriented systems and also supports the migration of legacy systems into modern architectures. The book is intended in particular for students of computer science and management information systems in their graduate studies, as well as for practitioners and professional software developers who are looking for fast access to CORBA technology and want to profit from meaningful code examples. Three different ORBs, examples, and exercises with solutions are available for download
