HPI Future SOC Lab : proceedings 2011
Together with industrial partners Hasso-Plattner-Institut (HPI) is currently establishing a “HPI Future SOC Lab,” which will provide a complete infrastructure for research on on-demand systems. The lab utilizes the latest, multi/many-core hardware and its practical implementation and testing as well as further development. The necessary components for such a highly ambitious project are provided by renowned companies: Fujitsu and Hewlett Packard provide their latest 4 and 8-way servers with 1-2 TB RAM, SAP will make available its latest Business byDesign (ByD) system in its most complete version. EMC² provides high performance storage systems and VMware offers virtualization solutions. The lab will operate on the basis of real data from large enterprises. The HPI Future SOC Lab, which will be open for use by interested researchers also from other universities, will provide an opportunity to study real-life complex systems and follow new ideas all the way to their practical implementation and testing. This technical report presents results of research projects executed in 2011. Selected projects have presented their results on June 15th and October 26th 2011 at the Future SOC Lab Day events.
