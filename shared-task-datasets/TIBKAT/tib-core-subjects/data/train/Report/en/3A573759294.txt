Vibration dynamics and control
"Vibration Dynamics and Control summarizes the fundamentals of the mechanics of vibrations and provides the necessary theoretical background for the subject while also presenting real-life design applications. The material also includes problem sets for use by students and practicing design engineers." "With a unified approach, consistent use of symbols and terminology, and an emphasis on practical applications, Vibration Dynamics and Control is accessible to students in a range of mechanical, aeronautical, and mechatronic specialties. It is also suitable as a reference work for design engineers specializing in rotor dynamics, torsional vibration, modal analysis, nonlinear mechanics, and controlled systems."--BOOK JACKET
