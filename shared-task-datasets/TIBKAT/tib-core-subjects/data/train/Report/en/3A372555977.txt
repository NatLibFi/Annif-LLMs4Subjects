Acoustic control of turbulent jets
This monograph presents recent results of experimental research relating to control of aerodynamic and acoustic characteristics of subsonic and supersonic turbulent jets by acoustic excitation of different intensity and frequency. Coherent structures in subsonic turbulent jets and their sensibility to harmonic acoustic excitation are studied, as well as the generation and suppression of turbulence in subsonic jets under acoustic excitation. The book covers active and passive methods of controlling supersonic non-isobaric jet characteristics and, in particular, suppression of discrete components of aerodynamic jet noise. Numerical simulation methods of subsonic turbulent jets are analyzed. Examples of practical realization of the presented methods are given in application to jet noise reduction of turbojet engines and to auto-oscillation suppression in wind tunnels with open test section
