Contrails : observations, formation mechanisms, atmospheric impacts, uncertainties
Rez.: Aviation emissions represent one particular source sector that may contribute to climate change via contrail formation and increased cirrus cloudiness. However, these factors - aviation particulates and their impact on aerosols and clouds - are among those with the largest uncertainty. In terms of reducing these uncertainties, contrails and contrail-induced cirrus represent a scientific research priority area. This contribution reviews the current knowledge of contrail formation mechanisms, microphysical properties of contrails, potential atmospheric impacts, and major uncertainties, addressing observations and theory. This review has been written in cooperation with colleagues from the UK Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, the Hadly Centre for Climate Prediction, and the UK Meteorological Office.
