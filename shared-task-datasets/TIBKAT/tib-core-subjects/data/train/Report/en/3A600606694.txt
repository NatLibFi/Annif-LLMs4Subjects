Crystal growth of Si for solar cells
"This volume presents a comprehensive survey of the science and technology of crystal growth of Si for solar cells with emphasis on fundamental science. Starting from feedstock, crystal growth of bulk crystals (single crystal and multicrystals) and thin film crystals are discussed. Numerous illustrations promote a comprehension of crystal-growth physics. The fundamental knowledge on crystal growth mechanisms obtained through this book will contribute to future developments of novel crystal growth technologies for further improvement of conversion efficiency of Si-based solar cells."--pub. desc
