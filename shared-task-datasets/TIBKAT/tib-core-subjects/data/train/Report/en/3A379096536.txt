Fuzzy statistics
This monograph introduces elementary fuzzy statistics based on crisp (non-fuzzy) data. Inthe introductory chapters the book presents a very readable survey of fuzzy sets including fuzzy arithmetic and fuzzy functions. The book develops fuzzy estimation and demonstrates the construction of fuzzy estimators for various important and special cases of variance, mean and distribution functions. It is shown how to use fuzzy estimators in hypothesis testing and regression, whichleads to a comprehensive presentation of fuzzy hypothesis testing and fuzzy regression as well as fuzzy prediction.
