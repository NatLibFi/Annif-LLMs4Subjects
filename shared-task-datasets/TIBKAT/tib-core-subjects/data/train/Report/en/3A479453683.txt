The wealth of genomic and post-genomic data needs to be structured so that the understanding of complex cellular processes can be achieved by creating computational models able to describe and predict phenotypes at the cell or organism level in health and disease. This book provides a detailed presentation of systems biology studies that are paving the way towards the above-mentioned goal and discusses the most efficient experimental and computational strategies for this purpose. The potential benefits for bioindustry, in particular the discovery of new drugs and better management, are also presented
