Heimat, Handwerk und die Utopie des Alltäglichen
"Heimat" as a theme of architecture is a topos of the beginning of the twentieth century: reform movements turned against conditions and forms of industrialization as well as against the destruction of landscapes, village and city images. The time "around 1800" and rural building became examples of a new building in simple pre-industrial forms. The concepts of the home movement were followed in national socialism under a völkisch-ideologische Vorzeichen, regional building tradition is mediated in the sense of simplified patterns as exemplary. The volume offers contributions from 16 authors to the critiques "Criticism of Industrialization", "Landscape and Building Tradition", "Good Design for Technology" and "The Ideal of Preindustrial Aesthetics" as well as corresponding text excerpts from historical sources. --
