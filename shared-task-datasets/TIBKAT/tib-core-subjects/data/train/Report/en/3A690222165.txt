Web-based development in the lively kernel
The World Wide Web as an application platform becomes increasingly important. However, the development of Web applications is often more complex than for the desktop. Web-based development environments like Lively Webwerkstatt can mitigate this problem by making the development process more interactive and direct. By moving the development environment into the Web, applications can be developed collaboratively in a Wiki-like manner. This report documents the results of the project seminar on Web-based Development Environments 2010. In this seminar, participants extended the Web-based development environment Lively Webwerkstatt. They worked in small teams on current research topics from the field of Web-development and tool support for programmers and implemented their results in the Webwerkstatt environment.
