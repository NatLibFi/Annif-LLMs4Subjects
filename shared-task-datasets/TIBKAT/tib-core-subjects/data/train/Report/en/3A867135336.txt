Promoting sustainable building materials and the implications on the use of wood in buildings : a review of leading public policies in Europe and North America
This study provides an overview of the current policy and regulatory environment regarding sustainable construction materials in the building sector in Europe and, where applicable, offers a commentary on the effectiveness of such regimes in driving the adoption of wood products. The study's objective has been to conduct a broad survey across a range of policies, initiatives and programmes in order to document the current circumstances as a starting point for further discussions, technical meetings and policy debates with a view to enhance the use of wood in buildings through policy advice to member states.
