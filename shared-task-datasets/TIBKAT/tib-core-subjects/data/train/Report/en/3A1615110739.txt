Semiconductor lasers : stability, instability and chaos
This monograph describes recent fascinating progress being made in the field of chaos, stability and instability of semiconductor lasers. Applications and future prospects are discussed in detail. The book emphasises the various dynamics induced in semiconductor lasers by optical and electronic feedback, optical injection, and injection current modulation. Recent results of both theoretical and experimental investigations are presented. As applications of semiconductor laser chaos, control and noise, Semiconductor Lasers describes&nbsp;suppression and chaotic secure communications. For those who are interested in optics but not familiar with nonlinear systems, a brief introduction to chaos analysis is presented.
