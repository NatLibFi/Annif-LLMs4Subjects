Global behavior and asymptotic reduction of a chemical kinetics system with continua of equlibria
We consider a model chemical kinetics system describing the dynamics of species concentrations taking part in a consecutive-competitive reaction in a continuously stirred tank reactor. Corresponding dynamical system has a continua of equilibria. The solution of the system tends to a particular equilibrium depending on the initial conditions. Global behavior of the system and its reductions via invariant manifold theory and the boundary function methods are studied.
