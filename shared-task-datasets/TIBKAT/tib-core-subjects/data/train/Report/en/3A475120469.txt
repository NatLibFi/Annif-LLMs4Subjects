Mathematical events of the twentieth century
This book contains several contributions on the most outstanding events in the development of 20th century mathematics, representing a wide variety of specialities in which Russian and Soviet mathematicians played a considerable role. The articles are written in an informal style, from mathematical philosophy to the description of the development of ideas, personal memories and give a unique account of personal meetings with famous mathematicians of 20th century mathematics who exerted great influence in its development. This book will be of great interest to mathematicians, who will enjoy seeing their own specialties described with some historical perspective.
