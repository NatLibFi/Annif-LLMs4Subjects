Enzymes in industry : production and applications
*Weitere Angaben Verfasser: Wolfgang Aehle is a senior scientist for Protein Engineering at Genencor International, a Danisco Company. After finishing his Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry, he discovered the beauty and excitement of working with protein 3D-structures during his postdoc period on molecular modeling of Subtilisin at the GBF in Braunschweig (Germany). Aehle further pursued his career in industry as a protein engineer. He has focused his work on a significant number of industrial enzymes, which are subject of this book. His research interest is driven by the wish to understand the enzyme function in the various industrial applications, whose physical conditions are far from the original environment of the enzymes. The main goal of his work is to improve enzyme function in the industrial environment. His work is documented in numerous scientific publications and patent applications
