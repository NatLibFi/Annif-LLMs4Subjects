Fundamentals of basin and petroleum systems modeling
This text contains the first comprehensive presentation of methods and algorithms used in basin modeling. It provides geoscientists and geophysicists with an extensive in-depth view of the theory behind the models. Heat flow analysis, chemical kinetics of petroleum generation, pressure analysis, PVT modeling and several fluid flow models are discussed in detail. Advanced topics such as probabilistic methods for risk assessment or new approaches such as modeling of migration with invasion percolation are also included. Comprehensive lists of rock and fluid properties and parameters of geochemical kinetics make the book a unique reference in geological process modeling
