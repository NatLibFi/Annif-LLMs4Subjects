Metrology and properties of engineering surfaces
The book can in broad terms be split into two parts; the first deals with the metrology of engineering surfaces and covers the important issues relating to the measurement and characterization of surfaces in both two and three dimensions. This covers topics such as filtering, power spectral densities, autocorrelation functions and the use of Fractals in topography. A significant proportion is dedicated to the calibration of scanning probe microscopes using the latest techniques. The remainder of the book deals with the properties of engineering surfaces and covers a wide range of topics including hardness (measurement and relevance), surface damage and the machining of brittle surfaces, the characterization of automobile cylinder bores using different techniques including artificial neural networks and the design and use of polymer bearings in microelectromechanical devices.
