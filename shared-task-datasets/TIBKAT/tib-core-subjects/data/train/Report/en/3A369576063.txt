Stability and transition: theory and application : efficient numerical methods with computer programs ; with 14 tables and a CD-ROM
This book addresses transition from laminar to turbulent flows and considers solutions, mainly with the help of the linear stability theory and the ways in which it can be implemented accurately by numerical procedures. The main concern is transition of wall boundary layers, although one chapter is devoted to an approach based on the Navier-Stokes equations. The first three chapters summarize physical knowledge of the transition process, consider the stability equations and methods for predicting transition by linear stability theory, and describe efficient and accurate numerical methods for the solution of stability equations. Chapters 4 to 7 describe computer programs based on stability-theory approach to identify the location of transition in two- and three-dimensional incompressible and compressible flows, respectively, and Chapter 7 describes a computer program within the framework of parabolized stability equations. These programs are provided on a CD-ROM.
