Mechanics of elastic structures with inclined members : analysis of vibration, buckling and bending of X-braced frames and conical shells
This monograph presents the mechanics of vibration, buckling and bending of elastic structures with inclined members such as x-braced high rise frames and conical shells. More than giving detailed derivations of basic equations "Mechanics of Elastic Structures with Inclined Members" is mainly oriented on practical problem solving. The book can be used as a textbook for graduate students concentrating on structural mechanics or as a reference book for engineers and researchers in the fields of engineering mechanics, civil engineering, mechanical engineering and aerospace engineering.
