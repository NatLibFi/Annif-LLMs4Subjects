Dynamic positioning in ice : Schlussbericht des Vorhabens: Entwicklung, Herstellung und Test eines Systems zum dynamischen Positionieren im Eis ; FÃ¶rderkennzeichen: 03SX307 ; Verbundvorhaben im Rahmen von ERA-NET MARTEC-DYPIC
DYPIC (Dynamic Positioning in Ice) is a research and development project within the MARTEC ERA-NET project of the European Union. Its objective is to contribute to the closure of the gap between DP in open water being an industry standard, and DP in ice which has some extra challenges to tackle. Two phases of model testing in ice form the back bone of the project and are facilitated by HSVA (Hamburg Ship Model Basin, Germany).
