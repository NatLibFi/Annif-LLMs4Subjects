Beyond the Bubble : the new Japanese architecture
"Beyond the Bubble examines two contrasting, but equally extraordinary, phases in the recent history of Japanese architecture: the explosive 'Bubble' era of the 1980s and early 1990s, and the post-Bubble years leading up to the present day. The first period - often referred to as the 'new golden age of Japanese architecture' - witnessed a spectacular proliferation of unusual buildings and urban complexes in Japan's major cities, while the latter has seen work demonstrating a sense of modesty, restraint and environmental innovation." "Botond Bognar's fascinating study of this remarkable period is divided into two parts. The first section, an essay entitled 'The Bubble Years: The Epitome of Japanese Postmodernism' discusses and illustrates the elaborate architectural projects produced during the 1980s and 90s. More recent projects, mainly from the twenty-first century, are introduced in the second part - 'After the Bubble: New Realities, New Priorities' - as detailed individual studies, accompanied by a wide range of plans, drawings and photographs."--Jacket
