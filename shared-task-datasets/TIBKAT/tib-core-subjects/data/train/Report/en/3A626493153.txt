Electron beam curing of composites
"Electron beam curing technology for advanced composites has emerged as a credible and attractive alternative to thermal curing for most composite products. Technical advantages, such as aerospace structures, include curing at room temperature, using low-cost tooling, and the ability to fabricate large integrated structure including structures too large to fit inside autoclaves. Studies by aerospace companies have shown potential cost savings of 10-60% by using electron beam curing. In this book, both theoretical and practical aspects of electron beam curing of composites are presented, intending to build a bridge between the academic knowledge and the industrial applications."--Publisher
