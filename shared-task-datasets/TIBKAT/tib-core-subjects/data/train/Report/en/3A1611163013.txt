Concepts, techniques, and models of computer programming
This innovative text presents computer programming as a unified discipline in a way that is both practical and scientifically sound. It presents all major programming paradigms in a uniform framework that shows their deep relationships and how and where to use them together.
Each model has its own set of techniques and each is included on the basis of its usefulness in practice. The general models include declarative programming, declarative concurrency, message-passing concurrency, explicit state, object-oriented programming, shared-state concurrency and relational programming. Specialised models include graphical user interface programming, distributed programming and constraint programming. Each model is based on its kernel language - a simple core language that consists of a small number of programmer-significant elements. The kernel languages are introduced progressively, adding concepts one by one.
