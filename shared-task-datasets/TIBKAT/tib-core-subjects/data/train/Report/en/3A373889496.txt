Crystal structure determination : with 13 tables
This textbook gives a concise introduction to modern crystal structure determination, emphasizing both the crystallographic background and how to actually perform it. The theoretical sections give more importance to providing good understanding, supported by many illustrations, than to rigorously deriving the mathematics. The most important measuring techniques, including the use of modern area detectors, and the methods of data reduction, structure solution and refinement are discussed from a practical point of view. Many tips and insights help readers to recognize and avoid possible errors and traps, and to judge the quality of results. The second edition has been completely updated and extended, especially the chapter on structure interpretation. From the reviews of the first edition ? "Distinguished by its attention to the practicalities of working with real crystals?a lucid and relatively concise account of modern crystal structure solution ?valuable to anyone who has an interest in crystal structure refinement."
