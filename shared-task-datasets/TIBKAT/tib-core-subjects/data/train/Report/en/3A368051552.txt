Vortex electronics and SQUIDs
Understanding the nature of vortices in high-Tc superconductors is a crucial subject for research on superconductive electronics, especially for superconducting interference devices (SQUIDs),it is also a fundamental problem in condensed-matter physics. Recent technological progress in methods for both direct and indirect observation of vortices, e.g. scanning SQUID, terahertz imaging, and microwave excitation, has led to new insights into vortex physics, the dynamic behavior of vortices in junctions and related questions of noise. This book presents the current status of researchactivity and provides new information on the applications of SQUIDs, including magnetocardiography, immunoassays,and laser-SQUID microscopes, all of which are close to being commercially available.
