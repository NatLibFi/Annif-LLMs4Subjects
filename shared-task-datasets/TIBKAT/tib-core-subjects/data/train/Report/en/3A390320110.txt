Non-equilibrium thermodynamics and the production of entropy : life, earth, and beyond
The present volume studies the application of concepts from non-equilibrium thermodynamics to a variety of research topics. Emphasis is on the Maximum Entropy Production (MEP) principle and applications to Geoshere-Biospher couplings. Written by leading researchers form a wide range of background, the book proposed to give a first coherent account of an emerging field at the interface of thermodynamics, geophysics and life scienes TOC:Entropy Production by Earth System Processes.- Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics in an Energy-Rich Universe.- Stumbling Into the MEP Racket: An Historical Perspective.- Maximum Entropy Production and Non-Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics.- Using Ecology to Quantify Organization in Fluid Flows.- Cosmological and Biological Reproducibility: Limits on the Maximum Entropy Production Principle.- Entropy Production in Turbulent Mixing.- Entropy Production of Atmospheric Heat Transport.- Water Vapor and Entropy Production in the Earth`s Atmosphere.- Thermodynamics of the Ocean Circulation: A Global Perspective on the Ocean System and Living Systems.- Entropy and the Shaping of the Landscape by Water.- Entropy Production in the Planetary Context.- The Free-Energy Transduction and Entropy Production in Initial Photosynthetic Reactions.- Biotic Entropy Production and Global Atmsophere-Biosphere Interactions.- Coupled Evolution of Earth`s Atmosphere and Biosphere.- Temperature, Biogenesis and Biospheric Self-Organization.- Entropy and Gaia: Is There a Link Between MEP and Self-Regulation in the Climate Systm?.- Insights From Thermodynamics for the Analysis of Economic Processes
