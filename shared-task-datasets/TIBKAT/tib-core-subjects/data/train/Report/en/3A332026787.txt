This is not architecture : media constructions
"This is not architecture" assembles architectural writers of different kinds - historians, theorists, journalists, computer game designers, technologists, film-makers and architects - to discuss the characteristics, cultures, limitations and bias of the different kinds of media, and to build up an argument as to how this complex culture of representations is constructed.
