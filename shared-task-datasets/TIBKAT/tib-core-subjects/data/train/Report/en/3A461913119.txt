Nuclear condensed matter physics with synchrotron radiation : basic principles, methodology and applications
This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the growing field of nuclear solid state physics with synchrotron radiation, a technique that is finding a number of unique applications in fields such as magnetism, surface science, and lattice dynamics. Due to the remarkable brilliance of modern synchrotron radiation sources, the method is particularly suited for the studying thin films, nanoparticles and clusters. Its high isotopic specifity can be employed to measure magnetic or vibrational properties with very high spatial resolution. The book is written on a introductory level and is thus suited for newcomers to the field. Many examples are presented to illustrate the unique experimental possibilities. TOC:Introduction.- General Aspects of Nuclear Resonant Scattering.- Methods and Instrumentation.- Coherent Elastic Nuclear Resonant Scattering.- Inelastic Nuclear Resonant Scattering.- Advanced Scattering Techniques.- Outlook and Perspectives.- Concluding Remarks
