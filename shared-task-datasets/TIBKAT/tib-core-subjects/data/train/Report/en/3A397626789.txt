Essential NMR for scientists and engineers
The NMR Notebook is a set of lecture notes for scientists and engineers who want to refresh their knowledge on NMR. Equally, the Notebook&nbsp;gives&nbsp;lecturers an aid to provide a framework of basic knowhow covering all fields of NMR,&nbsp;i.e. NMR methodology and hardware, chemical analysis, 2D-spectroscopy, NMR imaging, flow NMR, and quality-control NMR. The material is presented in a Power-Point&nbsp;format, with pairs of sheets addressing particular topics. One sheet is text, stating the key information, the other a color illustration. Rigorous derivations are avoided in favor of intuitive arguments. The notebook is intended for beginning graduate students and doctoral students of Physics, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, and Material Science. The information has been organized and selected for&nbsp;a one-semester, two-hour course. At present there is no other teaching and learning text that addresses the different aspects of NMR in such a comprehensive fashion
