International pilot project for technology cooperation : final report ; a multi-national technical evaluation of performance of commercial off the shelf metal detectors in the context of humanitarian demining
"The results of an evaluation of the detection performance for 29 commercial off the shelf (COTS) metal detectors, against a range of low-metal-content anti-personnel mines and some simulant targets, are described in this report. This work was undertaken by organizations from four nations together with the European Commission, in the International Pilot Project for Technology Co-operation (IPPTC) in the Humanitarian Demining R&D environment. This report gives a summary of the methodologies and results. Detectors were assessed for performance in air; in a range of soils; and in realistic demining scenarios in Cambodia and Croatia. In addition, the human factors aspect relating to the use of each detector was assessed."--
