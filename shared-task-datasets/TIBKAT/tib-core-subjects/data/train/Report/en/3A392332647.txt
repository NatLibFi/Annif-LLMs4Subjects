Microarray technology and its applications
The genomics revolution would not have been possible without the 'parallelisation' offered by microarray technology. This technological - and commercial - success has&nbsp;since been&nbsp;emulated by other applications areas, with a tremendous amplification of innovation. This book describes the fundamentals and latest developments in microarray technology, as well as its future directions. It presents detailed overviews of the different techniques of fabricating microarrays, of the chemistries and preparative steps involved, of the different types of microarrays, and of the instrumentation and optical issues involved.
