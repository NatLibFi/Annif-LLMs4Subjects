Biogas from waste and renewable resources : an introduction
Designed as a practical introduction to biogas plant design and operation, the author covers both the biological and technical aspects of biogas generation. The full range of biogas substrates and processing modes is explained, from agricultural and industrial waste to marine algae and sediment. On-site use of biogas for conversion into electricity, fuel and heat is also discussed, as are safety and regulatory issues. Dozens of real-life examples of European biogas plants already in operation illustrate the contents, as do numerous schemes, diagrams and summary tables. For the new edition, the authors have included recent advances in the processing of biomass that allows a greater range of substrates to be used, biogas analytics and quality control required for feeding biogas into natural gas networks, and a completely new chapter on the microbiology of biogas-producing bacterial communities
