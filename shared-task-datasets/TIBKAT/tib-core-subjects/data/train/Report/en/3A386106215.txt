Solid state physics of finite systems : metal clusters, fullerenes, atomic wires ; with 31 tables
This book surveys the physics of the quantum, finite many-body systems that are the basis of nanostructures such as fullerenes and metal clusters. The ab-initio techniques for describing the single-particle motion (electrons) and the collective degrees of freedom (plasmons and phonons) and their interaction are discussed in detail and applied to the study of phenomena such as the electromagnetic response and superconductivity of these systems. Built around current research and drawing upon lectures given to advanced undergraduates, the book will interest students, young researchers and practitioners in the fields of solid-state and atomic physics and physical chemistry. TOC:Introduction.- Overview.- Electronic Structure.- Electronic Response to Time-Dependent Perturbations.- Applications to Carbon Structures.- The Harmonic Approximation and Phonons.- The Car-Parrinello Method.- Electron-Phonon Interaction.- Pairing in Atomic Aggregates
