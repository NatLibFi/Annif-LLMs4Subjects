Principles of radar and sonar signal processing
This work covers the latest technologies in conventional and adaptive signal processing theory, and covers techniques for detailed analysis of physical signatures of targets and clutter. Examples of signatures offer greater insight into classification problems. A discussion on low frequency systems, wideband radars, and STAP (space-time adaptive processing) provides practitioners with a better awareness of physical limits and future developments. Contents list: Radar and sonar; Optimum reception in white noise; Application to radar; Optimum reception in coloured noise; Adaptive processing; Target and background signatures; Signature adapted processing.
