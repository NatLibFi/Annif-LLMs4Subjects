Thin film materials technology : sputtering of compound materials
An invaluable resource for industrial science and engineering newcomers to sputter deposition technology in thin film production applications, this book is rich in coverage of both historical developments and the newest experimental and technological information about ceramic thin film, a key technology for nano- materials in high-speed information applications and large-area functional coating such as automotive or decorative painting of plastic parts. Key topics: ? Principles and examples of making thin-film materials and devices such as nanometer composite thin films, nanometer superlattice of compound ceramics, micro-sensors and actuators, micro-MEMS, mobile compact/flexible ferroelectric memory, flat display including plasma display and PLD, and thin film catalysis, solar battery, and large-area functional window glass coating for energy and environmental uses. ? Covers techniques in automotive parts coatings :non-peel plastics coatings with metal, alloy, and compound films. TOC:Thin Film Materials And Devices.- Thin Film Processes.- Sputtering Phenomena.- Sputtering Systems.- Deposition Of Compound Thin Films.- Structural Control Of Compound Thin Films.- Microfabrication By Sputtering.- Appendix.- Index
