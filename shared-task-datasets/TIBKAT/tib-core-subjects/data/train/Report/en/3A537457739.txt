Transparent electronics
"Transparent electronics is an emerging technology that employs wide band-gap semiconductors for the realization of invisible circuits. This monograph provides the first roadmap for transparent electronics, identifying where the field is, where it is going, and what needs to happen to move it forward. Although the central focus of this monograph involves transparent electronics, many of the materials, devices, circuits, and process-integration strategies discussed herein will be of great interest to researchers working in other emerging fields of optoelectronics and electronics involving printing, large areas, low cost, flexibility, wearability, and fashion and design." - Back cover
