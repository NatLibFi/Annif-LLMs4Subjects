Solitary waves in dispersive complex media : theory, simulation, applications
This book is devoted to one of the most interesting and rapidly developing areas of modern nonlinear physics and mathematics - the theoretical, analytical and advanced numerical study of the structure and dynamics of one-dimensional as well as two- and three-dimensional solitons and nonlinear waves described by Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP), nonlinear Schr√∂dinger (NLS) and derivative NLS (DNLS) classes of equations. Special attention is paid to generalizations (relevant to various complex physical media) of these equations, accounting for higher-order dispersion corrections, influence of dissipation, instabilities, and stochastic fluctuations of the wave fields. The book addresses researchers working in the theory and numerical simulations of dispersive complex media in such fields as hydrodynamics, plasma physics, and aerodynamics. It will also be useful as a reference work for graduate students in physics and mathematics.
