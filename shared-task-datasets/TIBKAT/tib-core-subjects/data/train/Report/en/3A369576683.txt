Engineering electromagnetics
The applications involving electromagnetism are so pervasive that it is difficult to estimate their contribution to modern life: generation and transmission of electric energy, electric motors and actuators, radio, television, magnetic information storage, and even the mundane little magnet used to hold papers to the refrigerator all use electromagnetic fields. This text not only provides students with a good theoretcial understanding of electromagnetic field equations but it also treats a large number of application. No topic is presented unless it is directly applicable to engineering design or unless it is needed for the understanding of another topic. Included in this new edition are more than 400 examples and exercises, exercising every topic in the book, 600 end-of-chapter problems, many of them applications or simplified applications. A new chapter introducing numerical methods into the electromagnetic curriculum discusses the finite element, finite difference and moment methods. The book is a comprehensive two-semester textbook. It is written in simple terms with all details of derivations included and all steps in solutions listed. It requires little beyond basic calculus and can be used for self study. The wealth of examples and alternative explanations makes it very approachable by students.
