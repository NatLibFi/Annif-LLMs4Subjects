An abstraction for version control systems
Version Control Systems (VCS) allow developers to manage changes to software artifacts. Developers interact with VCSs through a variety of client programs, such as graphical front-ends or command line tools. It is desirable to use the same version control client program against different VCSs. Unfortunately, no established abstraction over VCS concepts exists. Instead, VCS client programs implement ad-hoc solutions to support interaction with multiple VCSs. This thesis presents Pur, an abstraction over version control concepts that allows building rich client programs that can interact with multiple VCSs. We provide an implementation of this abstraction and validate it by implementing a client application.
