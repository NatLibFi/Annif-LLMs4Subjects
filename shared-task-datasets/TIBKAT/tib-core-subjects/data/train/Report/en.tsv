Bioinformatics : an introductory textbook ¤ Genetics and systems biology develop in a dialogue between laboratory and computer. The introduction to bioinformatics presents the most important tools together with the basic knowledge of the subject. At the center is the automated analysis of the genome using databases and evaluation software. A great enrichment are the historical and interdisciplinary excursions as well as the linking of biochemical and information-scientific connections up to artificial intelligence. A glossary and tutorial on the most important instruments allow students from life and information sciences to work independently on the material. This provides a true alternative to established textbooks (e.g. M.-T. Hütt: ID-G 11/16). Many suggestions are also offered to the interested layperson. A little more care in the annotations could have made the illustrations even more understandable. A occasionally noticeable influence of English specialist language on the German text is noticeable in word choice and formulations. (2-3)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4611085-9>

Devilishly Good Web Design : How to Lure Your Customers ¤ Your customers should love your website? Feel right at home there - and do what you want? In a furious mix of psychology, marketing, and design, Chris Nodder shows you how it's done. He speaks out what we all know: We have small weaknesses. We want to belong, get things for free, not have to exert ourselves too much, not have to say no, and many other things. Based on these small weaknesses, he gives you simple, implementable design patterns that you can use to make the use of your website particularly pleasant for your customers - or at least the activities you want your customers to do. The countless examples from all corners of the internet make the explanations even more tangible. It's up to you: Let yourself be tempted and switch to the dark side of power with your new knowledge, or use it for the benefit of humanity?

Speed of migrating bedforms on the sea floor : a review ¤ This report summarizes the results of a literature study on the migration rate of dunes on the sea floor. It shows that especially older studies without fixed markers on the sea floor suffer from positional inaccuracies and are of no significance for further theoretical calculations. In general, the migration speed decreases significantly with height. Sand dunes with more than 1 m height are largely fixed in place and migrate very slowly (less than 10 cm/day) for questions of sedimentation of small objects. For megaripples up to about 50 cm height, the assessment can be made that they normally migrate at a rate of up to 50 cm/day, but under certain circumstances they can also migrate much faster. Notably, there is a clear temporal and spatial variability in the speed of individual megaripples. This question is to be further investigated for models. (AUT)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129066-5>
Luxus der Leere : From the Difficult Withdrawal from the Growth World : [A Polemical Essay] ¤ Shrinking cities, desolate landscapes: The current urban debates are dominated by anxious tones. More than a million apartments are currently vacant in Eastern Germany and are to be largely demolished.

Tutorial Analysis 1 and Linear Algebra 1: Mathematics explained and commented by students for students ¤ Each section begins with the definitions of the most important terms, followed by a collection of relevant theorems with proofs. Subsequent explanations with occasional original examples clarify and illuminate the whole. In this way, the text guides the reader through the usual material of a 1st semester in the field of mathematics. After introducing general foundations, proof techniques, and structures, a presentation of analysis follows up to the core statements of differential and integral calculus. The last part on linear algebra begins with the concrete problem of equation systems and leads over the theory of vector spaces to matrices, determinants, and eigenvalues. The authors, familiar with the difficulties of first-semester students in this field, successfully strive for clarity. Occasional somewhat vague formulations, such as the introduction of the indefinite integral as a function, are pardonable. The very helpful book for beginners is largely also suitable for students in a SII performance course. (3 S)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001865-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035811-2>

Mathematics for Natural Scientists: Methods, Applications, Program Codes ¤ Compact mathematics book for students of natural sciences, except physics, which requires a more demanding mathematical instrumentarium. Examples of scientific applications ensure a link to practice. The exercise tasks are also partially oriented towards the application-oriented testing of the learned - occasionally with a pinch of entertainment mathematics, for example, when the shooting chance of a midfielder is to be calculated (solutions are available on a university website of the University of Munich). Numerous calculation examples are accompanied by program codes for the computer algebra system Maple or the free statistics program R (cf. A. Behr: "Introduction to Statistics with R", ID 31/05). The book with the same title by W. Pavel (BA 9/07) deals with analysis and linear algebra in more detail, omits probability calculation and statistics, which are each given a chapter in the present title.

Grundwissen Beneficial Organisms : Helpers in Modern Plant Protection ¤ In plant protection literature, pests and damage patterns are usually shown. Beneficial organisms are often not recognized as such. In this book, the most important beneficial organisms in the garden are depicted in color illustrations and drawings, their effect on pests and their application possibilities in the framework of biological and integrated plant protection measures are described. The range of illustrations extends from spiders and insects to amphibians, reptiles, birds, and insectivorous mammals. The slim volume is rather unobtrusive in its external appearance. In addition to and after the more attractive and significantly more comprehensive handbook "The Great Kosmos Book of Beneficial Organisms" (s. M. Fortmann, BA 8/00), it can still be recommended for libraries with corresponding demand. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042756-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045586-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041070-5>

Research-intensive Industries and Knowledge-intensive Services in International Comparison ¤ The present study examines the technological performance of Germany in international comparison. It shows that the German economy as a whole has a relatively strong specialization in research-intensive industries and knowledge-intensive services. However, Germany has some weaknesses in knowledge-intensive services, which are a key driver of value creation and employment growth in all countries. This is particularly true for labor productivity, which has declined between 1995 and 2015 and is significantly below the productivity of knowledge-intensive services in other countries. German foreign trade in research-intensive goods has significantly declined in the wake of the Corona pandemic. The decline in foreign trade is particularly due to trade in motor vehicles and accessories in high-tech, which was strongly affected by supply chain problems. The examination of foreign trade specialization in research-intensive goods shows a declining trend in the medium term, but the comparative advantages were still maintained almost stable during the Corona pandemic.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124236-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120509-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4803997-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026822-6>

Better coding ¤ The author deals with the creation of program code and gives advice in a humorous way, supported by many examples and anecdotes, on how effective and modern program code can be created. This topic is also treated by V. Vernon and U. Probst, among others, in a very objective form and for readers with significant prior knowledge. The chapter headings "Prevent the Apocalypse" or the word choice "Trash Software" already reveal the presentation style of the book. However, the book should be taken seriously. 12 chapters with code examples in Java and C also make it clear to the beginner programmer what is important for good effective program code, and that cooperation and experience exchange in the team are very important. Emphasis is placed on testing, OOP paradigms, design patterns, operational security, and the renewal of completely outdated software.

Primary School is Evolving ¤ The school reforms implemented in many federal states also affect primary schools, which are subject to two visible changes in the process. On the one hand, primary schools are becoming increasingly common as full-day schools, which is intended to reduce social disparities in the first school years. On the other hand, there is a flexibilization of the school start phase, which is intended to allow children individual learning times. However, it is not yet sufficiently known which processes are triggered within the schools by these measures and what effects result from the changes in the structures. While studies such as PISA and IGLU describe the state of the education system at a certain point in time, they are not able to describe the change processes.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022349-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115716-3>

Amazon : the book as prey ¤ Although the online retailer Amazon has not even existed for 20 years, it has already revolutionized the shopping habits of people. Customers appreciate its affordable and almost complete product range, independent product reviews from other buyers, and uncomplicated return options. And since the company usually promises delivery by the next working day, many prefer the convenient mouse click to the stressful shopping experience. However, the appearance of the beautiful new world of goods deceives. Behind the facade of Amazon's online shop, a world of precarious working conditions is hidden. The low price for comfortable online shopping is paid by those who are responsible for logistics and shipping of goods. A lot has been published about Amazon in recent times. The present paperback is a good, perhaps necessary supplement to B. Stone: "All Sellers" (ID-A 48/13), R. Brandt: "A Click" (ID-B 31/13), C. Knop: "Amazon knows you already" (ID-B 31/13). Leisegang is editor of the renowned "Blätter für deutsche und internationale Politik", his book appears in a small, left-wing publishing house. The author demands clearly: "Amazon must be stopped and limited in its scope", so that books and book trade can survive. Critically, he comments in small chapters on the precarious working conditions of employees, Amazon's data collection frenzy, the misuse of subsidies, and the exploitation of tax loopholes. Leisegang thoroughly documents his sources. A timeline, graphics, and tables round off the volume.

The Ancient World and the Sea ¤ The ancient culture was a coastal culture and has always been shaped by the struggle with the sea. Maritime trade enabled the spread of urban civilization. War at sea helped the Athenian democracy to break through. The conquest of the sea was a prerequisite for the emergence of the Roman Empire, enabled the unification of Greek-Roman civilization and the spread of Christianity. The search for fame and wealth finally motivated Mediterranean sailors to venture into the oceans and to consider a journey to India over 1000 years before Columbus. Raimund Schulz describes the driving forces that drove the Greeks and Romans again and again to the sea, and clears up numerous legends and prejudices like that of the alleged sea-hostility of the Romans. He describes the essential stages of the	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054184-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068754-5>
Shadows of Play - Technology Shapes Everyday Life ¤ The use of technology was until the widespread dissemination of information and communication technologies associated with the idea of a purposeful use of means. This has changed with the use of computer technology. More often, personal, social, aesthetic, and playful dimensions come to the forefront. The use of modern gadgets (smartphone, PC-tablet & Co.) with their versatile possibilities is of a playful nature and conceals so efforts and time expenditure.

Rathbone was also responsible for numerous predecessor versions (most recently Windows 8.1, ID-A 13/14; Windows 8, ID-A 4/13). The design and content preparation offer the familiar picture. The 21 chapters contain all the knowledge for the beginner or switcher. Apart from the bracketed installation questions, traditional topics (Desktop, window techniques) are treated equally, as well as the handling of apps and the use of social contacts. The topic of security falls rather briefly, on the other hand, multimedia (music, photos, films) receives sufficient attention. This also applies to the treatment of problems and error messages. Overall, a more text-oriented representation with some colored screenshots and hint pictograms. In addition to the aforementioned editions, it is well suited. I. Baumeister (ID-A 39/15) and I. Schels (ID-A 41/15) rely more on a visual mediation. (1) (LK/HB: Isigkeit) Introduction to the operating system for beginners and switchers.

For larger examples, the freely available statistical software R is used, with which the manual calculations can be traced and finally also larger data sets can be evaluated.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4705956-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078859-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137007-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056995-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4010449-7>
Smart Cities : German High Technology for The City of The Future ¤ The worldwide urbanization is a central challenge of the 21st century. Since 2007, for the first time, more people have lived in metropolitan areas than in rural regions, in 2030 it will be 60 percent. The more so are cities and agglomerations dependent on networked technologies. „Smart“ technologies offer answers in different fields of demand. Just Germany has good chances to establish itself as a leading provider of innovative overall solutions – if the framework conditions are created. The present statement was prepared in preparation for the first „Innovation dialogue between federal government, economy and science“ in September 2010. It represents, however, an independent publication of the German Academy of Science and Engineering. In it, recommendations for action are presented, how the demand for integrated solutions can open up new opportunities for value creation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059205-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000996-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164958-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4225796-7>

Transformations Management for Sustainable Water Management : Handbook for the Realization of New Infrastructure Solutions in the Field of Water and Sewage ; [Results of the Research Consortium netWORKS] ¤ The transformation - the change - of urban technical systems of water supply and sewage disposal is the subject of this volume. In the sense of an energy- and resource-efficient urban development, it is necessary to raise existing potential in energy and material resources. If this transformation is successful, the urban water infrastructure will be more decentralized and closely linked to the energy infrastructure (especially heat supply) in the future. It will consist of numerous modules, focus on the closure of material cycles, and be able to react more flexibly to changing environmental conditions. It will mainly affect the level of individual households or buildings, as well as the level of individual blocks, and have consequences for building technology and building equipment. The publication of the research consortium netWORKS is aimed at decision-makers from the fields of urban development, urban planning, and urban water management.

Computer Science Exam Trainer : 500 Questions and Answers for the Bachelor's Degree ¤ Exam trainers from the Spektrum publishing house have often been discussed (e.g. R. Busam: ID 14/08 - Analysis; C. Turtur: ID 8/08 and ID 23/03 - Mathematics). The present book addresses students of computer science at universities of applied sciences and universities who want to prepare for the bachelor's examination in particular. It is assumed that students have acquired basic knowledge in their studies. Facts that are important for the examination are worked out, which are experienced to be important. In the foreground are questions on applications, but also the basic understanding of important concepts is not neglected. The facts are conveyed in the question-answer style. The very detailed answers often bring short examples and references to further literature. The book is divided into 3 large sections: theoretical computer science, practical computer science, and technical computer science. Emphasis is placed on formal languages and automata theory, algorithms, and circuits/circuit works. Recommended especially for university libraries.

The Sketchnote Handbook : the illustrated guide to creating visual notes ¤ Sketchnotes, composed of the two words "sketch" (English: sketch) and "note" (English: note) are notes that consist of images, texts, and structures. In particular, when it comes to images, it's not about creating refined drawings, but rather sketch-like representations that resemble a draft. With sketchnotes, you can visualize matters, develop thoughts and concepts, and unlock themes. They can also be used in addition to protocol management during lectures and courses. Sketchnotes can be created conventionally with pen and paper, but also digitally using corresponding apps. In digital form, they are often communicated and shared via social media channels. American designer and "Sketchnote Guru" Mike Rohde describes what sketchnotes are, what they can be used for, and above all, how to create them. In addition, he presents various types, as well as skills and techniques for creating sketchnotes.

In this interdisciplinary field of engineering sciences, independent fields such as design engineering, technical dynamics, modeling, measurement, control, and regulation engineering, drive engineering, microprocessor engineering, and computer science come together. After an overview of the affected areas of this discipline, the interlocking of the areas in typical mechatronic products is presented using examples	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4238812-0>
Introduction to Mathematics and Computation Methods : for Students of Physics and other Mathematical and Natural Sciences ¤ The textbook, based on long-standing experience in university teaching, provides students of physics and related natural sciences with an application-oriented presentation of the canonical topics of introductory mathematics events treated in the first year of study. The work, equipped with numerous examples and explanatory illustrations, is consistently oriented towards the target group. In favor of a presentation that consistently orients itself to the application possibilities and scientific relevance, and deliberately originates from the perspective of a physicist, a stringent deductive and complete proof development of concepts, methods, and concepts is waived. The modular design allows for a punctual access to specific contents. The target group is also useful in conjunction with the more comprehensive and methodologically differently constructed work by H. Kerner (ID-G 13/06) and in addition to the work by Christian B. Lang (ID-G 2/06). With tasks and complete solutions.

Handbook for Technical Product Design: Material and Manufacturing; Decision-Making Foundations for Designers and Engineers ¤ At the interface between product development/design and engineering, communication and cooperation deficits sometimes occur, which can significantly negatively affect the efficiency and quality of development and innovation processes. The causes include, among other things, competence gaps regarding technical relationships on the part of design professions and creative service providers. Corresponding specialized literature, in which basic technical know-how is prepared and conveyed across disciplines on the basis of semantics and the potential of designers, is not yet available on the market. The present book aims to close this gap. In development processes, frequently used technical knowledge about materials and possible processing methods is presented in a clear and scientifically founded manner in the form of a comprehensive reference work, in a way that addresses and supports the way of thinking of designers/engineers and representatives of design professions. Through a corresponding form of presentation, it should be possible to inform oneself quickly and comprehensively about the most important technological framework conditions for a design. In this process, visual and intuitive reading aids have been introduced, and the knowledge components within the book have been linked to each other.

The Silent Satellites : Stories ¤ A locomotive driver who loves night shifts until a laughing man stands on the tracks. A guard who makes his rounds around the foreigner's residence and falls in love with the woman behind the fence. A food stand owner who stands at the high-rise window and looks at the shining satellites of the night. Confidently, boisterously, and dreamily secure, Clemens Meyer tells of lost battles and overwhelming desires. These are stories from our time, as torn apart as our lives, as dark as the world, as beautiful as the most beautiful hopes.

The Dynamics of Europe ¤ The European Union has so far expanded in concentric circles. Integration and expansion have mutually reinforced each other. This development is currently facing limits. Internal limits manifest themselves as problems of political will formation, external limits as increasing contradiction between integration and expansion of the EU. The theory of the dynamics of Europe is developed from the current crisis of EU expansion. This theory forms the framework to discuss central problems of the EU: EU development perspectives after the end of its expansions, the transition to the mode of gradual integration, the question of Turkey's accession, the redefinition of the EU's external relations and the further sphere of interest of Europe.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071013-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046558-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161919-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4247031-6>

Embedded Linux : with Raspberry Pi and Co. ¤ Under Embedded Linux one understands an almost invisible operating system on a Linux basis without a pronounced user interface, which regulates the monitoring, control, and data processing of technical devices. With this topic (also based on the Raspberry Pi) J. Quade has already dealt with it, who has dealt with the importance of Embedded Linux in the programming of real-time operating systems in "Modern Real-Time Systems ...". The author introduces in the present book the operation and the ongoing development of Embedded Linux. Readers with good knowledge in C are addressed, who want to get more out of existing Embedded Linux systems. Briefly, alternative uses based on other minicomputers are mentioned. The author begins briefly with the basics of installation and data exchange between host and embedded system and then comes to the construction of a kernel and the basics of driver development based on practice examples.

The City from the Modern Era to the 19th Century: Urban Designs in Europe and North America ¤ After his extremely successful history of the city in the 20th century, Vittorio Magnago Lampugnani has now essentially written the precursor to his magnum opus. From the development from the modern era to the 19th century, he highlights the most glorious, but certainly decisive moments and designs a sparkling kaleidoscope of Western urban architecture: From medieval city-states to the urbanistic inventions of the Renaissance and the perspective strategies of the Baroque to the massive modernizations, through which the bourgeoisie adopted the traditional city. Each chapter is dedicated to the architectural form of a European city and its special conditions in a specific era: Florence, Rome, Lisbon, London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, and Barcelona; in addition, there are North American colonial settlements, pioneer cities, and metropolises. More than 350 predominantly large-format and colored images, city plans, designs, drawings, architectural photographs, aerial photographs, provide an enormous visual pleasure and open a new view on the cities of Europe and North America Italian city-states -- Urban compositions of the Renaissance -- "With truly unbelievable costs and in accordance with the great spirit..." -- Power performances in French absolutism -- The urbanization of North America -- On the way to enlightenment -- Squares, circuses, crescents, improvements -- Embellishment, modernization, and repression -- Cities for ideal communities -- A capital for the high bourgeoisie -- Delayed metropolis Berlin -- The Vienna Ringstrasse -- Ieoogical and scientific urbanism.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056795-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056730-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056754-0>

Upgrade : new living space through extension and renovation ¤ Extension, renovation, demolition. Upgrade breathes new life into old houses, barns, or mountain huts. Upgrade explores how architects and designers skillfully transform our living spaces from small changes to complete renovation processes. Whether it's a converted attic floor, an old factory building that is converted into a modern office and cozy home for a family, or new wooden facades that stand in surprising contrast to old brick walls; Upgrade tells impressive projects and invites you to consider old building substance from a new perspective. A dilapidated barn, a run-down city house, a half-destroyed historical building facade - all this can be the foundation for extraordinary and inspiring architecture. This compendium shows how an old shed becomes a new children's room, how a garage becomes a guest house or an Alpine hut becomes a modern holiday home. And even with a smaller budget, you can create new and desirable things from old walls. The projects in this book demonstrate how existing buildings and materials can be completely reinvented with a little creativity and how modern can be connected with old. Architects report on the challenges that await homeowners and what unsuspected potential lies in old buildings. Before-and-after photos demonstrate the impressive transformations. Upgrade serves as inspiration for all who prefer to preserve rather than destroy	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156127-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4564812-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061577-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042840-0>

Wind Energy Installations and Spatial Planning Areas ¤ Wind energy has the greatest importance among all renewable energy sources in the context of the energy transition. For stable growth, a sufficient supply of plan lawfully secured areas must be available. The contribution focuses on the stock of spatial planning areas for wind power use in regional plans, the density of development and the installed capacity. The basis of the investigation are the spatial planning plan monitor maintained by the BBSR, which contains vector data of spatial planning areas in binding regional plans, as well as a wind turbine database built up by the BBSR with site-specific data. This makes it possible for the first time to perform a nationwide geo-statistical overlap of spatial planning areas and installation locations (Source: Publisher).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4079329-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034013-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049040-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128839-7>

Fascination Construction — Profession and Field of Activity in Change: Recommendations for the Education of Qualified Skilled Workers in Germany ¤ Project -- Introduction -- Seven theses on the education of construction engineers and the profession of construction engineers -- 3 recommendations. Innovation power and high-tech products make Germany one of the leading industrial nations. The development of new and improved products will also play a prominent role in the future, as product development and design contribute to prosperity, economic growth, and international competitiveness in Germany. Behind each new or customer-adapted product is a masterful achievement: technical challenges and needs must be recognized. Suitable technical solutions must be found, which are then further developed into a functioning and industrially producible product. No development project is like the other and with each new one, new territory is entered. These diverse, constantly changing but responsible tasks are often taken over by construction engineers in the mechanical engineering and electrical engineering industries. The education of construction engineers is thus faced with great challenges: it must meet the changing fields of activity and requirements with adapted training concepts, prepare for the handling of continuous development, and at the same time be attractive to potential construction engineer recruits. Based on seven theses, this acatech POSITION sketches the current university education of construction engineers and the profession of construction engineers. Based on this, acatech provides recommendations for improving the profession's image and for a modern, forward-looking university education and further education of construction engineers that meets the expectations of industry.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4069340-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005871-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165096-7>
The Life of Wishes : Novel ¤ What happens when a person, like in a fairy tale, suddenly has 3 wishes open? Jonas experiences this quite randomly at a mysterious encounter during lunch break on a bench in the park. He continues to live his usual life as an advertising copywriter and family father with infidelities, but strange coincidences are gradually piling up. The novel escalates from the description of everyday realism more and more into the surrealist until an imaginary - or imagined? - end of the world. One is reminded of novels like "The Other Side" by Alfred Kubin, as far as the conclusion is concerned, of American disaster movies. Glavinic (most recently "That's Me", BA10/07) proves to be an author who, as was read in the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, leads the reader "into the fantastic depths of everyday life".

HDTV : everything around high-definition television ¤ HDTV is the television of the future. In Japan, the USA, and Australia, it is already standard, while it is just starting in Europe. The trade has already HDTV suitable devices, but there are only a few broadcasters that broadcast in HDTV. These are the pay-TV broadcasters and a few private broadcasters. The public broadcasting like ARD and ZDF are still holding back. This is all explained in the book with technical details and the previous development. It is also explained what is needed for reception, what to look out for when buying, and how to connect the devices correctly. So the reader learns which new acquisitions are necessary for the switch to HDTV and helps to avoid false purchases. The book on the subject has already been published by W. Fleischer (BA 7/06). Anyone dealing with the problem will read both books. (1)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191818-6>
Lost in the Universe: Why Physics Has Gone Astray ¤ A. Unzicker, a PhD physicist and science journalist, also takes a hard look at the modern scientific establishment in this book. Following up on "From the Big Bang to the Big Bounce" (BA 6/10), which was crowned the "most explosive science book of the year" in 2010, he continues his criticism here. Again, it's about the foundations and basic assumptions of physics, space, time, and mass, as well as atoms, atomic structure on the one hand, and galaxies and the cosmos as a whole on the other. As an outsider, he is "appalled by how many speculations with meaningless calculations flood physics". He strongly advocates for more open research, also pointing out the problem of research funding, because as soon as projects are applied for and approved, it is practically excluded that "a fundamentally new idea is involved". Numerous quotes from the literature support his efforts to promote a more critical science. Finally, he advocates for broad access to all data and urges readers to question the results in open forums. Highly applicable!

The Heureka Principle: Discover the Scientist in You ¤ Science is not an abstract concept reserved for highly specialized experts. With conviction and passion, physicist Chad Orzel has written a plea for the scientist in each of us. He provides countless examples of the cycle of observation, abstraction, testing, dissemination, and correction that is applied - often unconsciously - whenever people face unknown challenges.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112497-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001307-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4332807-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045956-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041423-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041421-8>

Sounddesign : Sound, Perception, Emotion ¤ The author describes the emotional effect of sounds, tones, and music and explains the interactions that can occur through the combination of (moving-)image and sound. Review: With the term 'Sounddesign', the author refers to the use of auditory elements in media with the goal of generating specific emotions, e.g. in film dialogues, sounds, ambient sounds, and music, which all have a communicative content and allow emotions to arise. In order to be able to show and analyze the interactions, the physical fundamentals of sound perception are first described, then the meanings of different sounds and sound patterns are explained and made clear through the examination of individual film scenes. The explanations are detailed and well understandable, but also partly quite complex. The grayscale illustrations are used well dosed and always targeted. Good: The author frequently inserts small practical exercises into the text, through which a discussed phenomenon can be made audible in concrete terms. Target group of the title are media designers, sound technicians, musicians, and directors as well as students of corresponding fields of study. Conclusion: Good comprehensive representation of the emotional effect of sound and of the combination of sound and image	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140882-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7693207-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064317-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030933-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4823394-8>

Introduction to CATIA V5: Object-Oriented Design in Exercises and Examples ¤ The basic book for beginners to CATIA V5 appears already in the 5th edition (last displayed BA 1/04). It is aimed at students and engineers in practice and leads through clear examples and colorful illustrations thoroughly and practically into the subject. Independently of functions and procedures, the present 5th edition has been adapted to the currently used version R 19 in industry and expanded on the topic "Complex Assemblies"; all exercise examples can be found on the accompanying CD-ROM. The preface suggests that in the newer version options and possibilities have been expanded, but older versions can still be used. A shorter introduction is offered by S. Hartmann (BA 3/09, no new edition displayed yet), somewhat more specialized is R. List (ID-G 23/09). The standard work should be available in large libraries alongside the introduction by S. Hartmann. (2) (LK/SH: Preisler) Textbook and workbook for beginners to the program for 3-dimensional CAD applications. (LK/SH: Preisler)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4689799-9>
Mathematics ¤ Introductory university textbook for first-semester students of non-mathematical disciplines, which stands between the many school mathematics repetition courses and bridge courses (e.g. Peter Dörsam: "Mathematics at the beginning of studies", BA 2/06; W. Poguntke: "No fear of math", BA 1/05) and subject-specific textbooks like that of Manfred Precht: "Mathematics ... for non-mathematicians" (ID 43/06; related exercise collection: ID 38/06). The book takes into account all areas of mathematics that are relevant at this level, is held in an engaging style and is very clearly formulated. The individual chapters are also selectively readable when the language of mathematics is sufficiently mastered, so the work can also be used as a compendium. Also suitable for secondary school level II students. The very good equipment with colorful graphics, photos, color-coded mnemonics, examples and practical applications reminds more of schoolbooks than of university textbooks.

Mathematical Logic ¤ Publisher's text: This book provides an introduction to the various aspects of mathematical logic that every mathematician and computer scientist should know. After predicate calculus and its applications to the beginnings of artificial intelligence, set theory is presented axiomatically. In the third and fourth parts, the necessary basic concepts of computability theory and the hierarchy of definable subsets of natural numbers are introduced in order to finally prove the Gödel incompleteness theorems. Through its clear style and the included exercise problems, this book is a concise introduction to these foundations of the entire mathematics	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046974-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005581-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033447-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037951-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4021417-5>
Statistics for Dummies Problem Collection ¤ 999 problems from descriptive and inductive statistics, later with detailed solution descriptions, are intended to lead to the ability to apply independently and to understand conceptually, without requiring deeper theoretical knowledge. Review (ekz) The tasks lead from calculations of the standard measures of descriptive statistics to special estimation and test procedures of closing statistics. In the more comprehensive 2nd part, the solutions are described in detail; it serves not only for success control, but explains the relationships and terms again thoroughly. Deeper knowledge from probability theory is not required of the reader, even the standard formulas from combinatorics are explained. Some prior knowledge is certainly helpful and necessary, which can be found in earlier titles of this publishing series, for example D. Rumsey: "Statistics II for Dummies". Relevant software for handling larger data sets - which is rarely required here - is handled by F. Brosius: "SPSS 22 for Dummies"; also in this series). (2-3 pages)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056995-0>
Above the Fire, Below the Mountain : Novel ¤ Berlin, October 2012, a woman is missing. Theresa, born in East Germany, grew up with foster parents because her parents were imprisoned as oppositional figures. In the Seventies, she gains access to the secret archives of the GDR as a historian - frightening, unbelievable documents lie before her. Theresa is dismissed, and this remains so, because her knowledge is extremely dangerous after the turn of 1989. Reinhard Jirgl tells of an unknown German history: The great bureaucratic reorganization, which politics called the 'turn', has left intact what was believed to be past: networks, organizations, enmities.

How did they find their way? : securing North Frisian coastal navigation ; buoys, sailing instructions and nautical charts until the mid-19th century ; from coastal navigation to high-sea navigation ; private navigation schools in North Frisia and their teachers ¤ The script on North Frisian navigation is divided into two parts. In the first part, the author deals with the history of nautical aids for coastal navigation from the Rhine mouth to the Eider since earliest times; landmarks, sailing instructions, buoys, and finally cartographic material were included. In the second part, he describes the teaching at private North Frisian navigation schools, which existed from around 1630 to 1870 mainly on Föhr and Sylt and where astronomical and mathematical knowledge for high-sea navigation was conveyed. The first teachers were pastors, later experienced seafarers taught the young people. They are listed here chronologically with the determined life dates. Finally, illustrations of 14 captain's portraits from the North Frisian Museum Husum. (I. Hanewald)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059526-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033480-6>
Housing Market Forecast 2025 ¤ The housing markets in Germany have undergone significant changes in recent years: On the one hand, declining population numbers are evident in over-supplies and vacant housing, which are no longer limited to individual regions - not even to the new federal states. Thus, the majority of cities and districts in Germany will experience a declining population development by 2025, which will be reflected on the local housing markets despite further differentiation of the housing markets with increasing numbers of one-person households and in individual market segments still ongoing growth in living space, indirectly through over-supplies and changed demand.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066794-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138150-6>

Process Portals : Architecture for Networking with Customers and Suppliers ; with 60 Tables ¤ Portals have developed into the central user interface in companies. Process portals continue this integration idea by connecting internal and cross-company applications and thus granting their users a role-based access to process-relevant information. A prerequisite for this is an integration approach that goes beyond the mere embedding of HTML elements in a website and allows a process-oriented bundling of semantically aligned application components. The book shows which components an appropriate architecture and integration model includes, how various companies have implemented this model, and what benefits they have been able to realize.

The Statistics Laboratory: Introduction and User Manual ¤ The Statistics Laboratory is an interactive working environment with which statistical functions and display options can be easily and intuitively processed. As a Windows-based interface for the statistical programming environment R, it also allows for a significantly easier access to the extensive functionality of R. The manual for the Statistics Laboratory is divided into three parts. In the first, the laboratory and its functionality are described in detail. To illustrate the performance of tasks with the laboratory, some standard evaluations are presented in the second part. These cover the material of a basic course in statistics. Applications are not presented "naked", but the respective methodological background is also given. A chapter on the most important R functions rounds out the book.

Google Data Studio : Create Professional Reports and Dashboards ¤ Google Data Studio is a cloud-based analysis and reporting tool, with which complex data can be brought together, analyzed, presented, and shared in a simple way. The program was released in 2016 and is still relatively unknown. The user numbers and thus the target group are correspondingly (still) small. The book is so far the only monograph on the subject. After an introduction, the integration of various data sources is first described; this is followed by the preparation of the data through own dimensions and values and finally the planning and data visualization. In further chapters - the content architecture appears inhomogeneous from here on - aspects of administration, possibilities of publication, permissions, and two case studies follow. Overall, the topic is introduced in a clear and tutorial-like manner, where the language will not win a prize for elegance. Many illustrations, especially screenshots (partly poorly legible).

The Passionate Programmer : How Programmers Can Succeed in Their Careers ¤ Readers who enjoy writing programs may be inclined to turn their hobby into a career. What should one consider in this case? The author clearly shows that a profession should not only create the foundations for a secure life. A profession should also bring fulfillment and happiness, the feeling of being a valuable and respected person. Fulfillment and happiness rarely occur by chance. The author describes - occasionally from a typically American perspective - strategies for planning and realizing a truly successful career (and thus also a successful life) in software development. It is clearly repeated again and again: only intense, not goal-oriented, personal effort helps further. Emphasis is placed, among other things, on clever self-marketing and the desire to stay up to date. Good hints for implementing the developed strategies. Many short, but memorable guiding principles as milestones for the successful path. A book that can be very helpful in planning a professional career in general.(2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005964-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175854-7>
ABC of Heat Pump ¤ Due to rising energy prices and growing environmental awareness, the heat pump is experiencing a renaissance in Germany as a thrifty and carbon dioxide-reducing heating system.

In the first third of the book, the physical-technical and chemical fundamentals are explained in detail. Subsequently, the individual components and different types, planning bases, construction and operation, as well as further usage forms of heat pump systems are explained in detail. Finally, a brief comparison with other heating systems, a glossary of technical terms, further addresses. With numerous diagrams, calculations, formulas, and vivid color illustrations. Addressed to skilled craftsmen, architects, energy consultants, building planners, and potential homeowners with technical/scientific basic knowledge. Recommended after the initial information from M. Baumann (BA 8/07) and the handbook by K. Ochsner (BA 9/07), in addition to the expertise of I. Tiator (ID 4/08).

Environmental Impact Assessment for Regional Plans ¤ The Directive 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2001 on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, which entered into force on 21 July 2001 (OJ L 197/30) and is to be transposed into national law within three years, will have significant importance not least for spatial planning in the Federal Republic of Germany. The aim of Directive 2001/42/EC, as stated in Article 1, is to "ensure a high level of environmental protection in the light of the need to promote sustainable development and to contribute to the integration of environmental considerations into the preparation and adoption of plans and programmes, by ensuring that certain plans and programmes which are likely to have significant environmental effects are subject to environmental assessment in accordance with this Directive." The study deals with various aspects, such as the scope and procedure of environmental assessment, the scoping, the environmental report, the monitoring of environmental impacts and the implementation of the Directive into German spatial planning law. Recommendations are given for various areas.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125275-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049040-3>

Hydrogen & Fuel Cells: The Technology of Tomorrow! ¤ Geitmann wants to clarify the possibilities with the present book, which hydrogen can bring as a fuel of the future. He pays special attention to the use of liquid hydrogen in fuel cells, but also to its combustion in conventional engines. Challenging, but still understandable, newer research projects, for example, on the storage of hydrogen are described. Further chapters deal with the production of hydrogen, transportation, refueling process, as well as economic aspects. A comprehensive appendix with numerous literature references, tables, and the like rounds off the work. Comparable to M. Pehnt (BA 1/03), where this topic is still a bit more popular and less scientifically oriented. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121905-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008195-3>
Balance Sheet Analysis and Key Figures: Case-Oriented Balance Optimization ¤ Ob it is accounted for according to HGB, IFRS or US-GAAP: Much in the income statement and balance sheet is actually obvious, but not immediately recognizable. On an international level, the total cost method loses importance, but for the German middle class, the total cost method is clearly the better closing, as both for the controller and the tax consultant strengths and weaknesses and legal intervention possibilities in the balance sheet become quickly recognizable.

Electromobility in Municipalities - a Mood Picture: Results of the Difu City Survey 2014 ¤ Although the federal government's goal of seeing a million electric vehicles on Germany's roads in five years is still far from being achieved - 78 percent of the surveyed German municipalities are dealing with the topic of electromobility. This is a result of the Difu city survey 'Electromobility in Municipalities'. The municipalities differ both in terms of the type and scope of activities as well as their motives for dealing with this topic. For some municipalities, electromobility is part of environmentally friendly mobility, which is one of the core goals of a strategic city and transportation development for them. Others view the topic more from the perspective of economic promotion or promise themselves a gain in image and positive effects on their urban location through this.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019956-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1042006857>

Netzfeminism : Strategies of Female Image Politics ¤ Pink slips, baby blue-dyed armpits, sulky faces on selfies: what sounds like a male fantasy is a feminist statement by net artists. By doing so, they enter the battleground for the 'right' image of a woman, which is not only metaphorically up for debate in social media. Does a woman act emancipatorily by showing herself breastfeeding - or does she thereby reduce herself and other women to the role of the mother? Does a 'Girl Power' T-shirt confirm the role of the naive little girl - or does it question it? Media scholar Annekathrin Kohout has written a concise and pointed cultural and discourse history of female image politics, which takes all essential phenomena of female image politics from the emancipation movements of the early 20th century to the present-day netfeminist image struggle into view.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4222106-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4222126-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125057-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4571611-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308416-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006568-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113617-2>

Now I Learn SUSE Linux : the Starter-Kit to SUSE Linux 9.1 & KDE 3.2 - with SUSE Linux 9.1 Live-CD ; [Start without Prior Knowledge] ¤ Linux, the alternative operating system to the Windows world, still enjoys great popularity among a smaller part of computer users. Beginner's works are therefore always a good decision, especially if the author or author, as in the present case, succeeds in explaining this system in a comprehensible way. The author's competence has already been proven in the predecessor titles (lastly BA 7/02) and in the present edition, their explanations are based on the current SuSE distribution 9.1 and the graphical interface KDE 3.2. In comparison to the predecessor (version 7.3) there are indeed significant differences, so it is recommended to exchange. Conceptually, less has been changed. Interested parties will find no detailed introduction, but a presentation oriented to practical needs. After installation and KDE explanation, it is mainly about surfing the Internet with Linux, writing emails or creating text documents. Those who want more can supplement their knowledge with Frank Gehrke: "Linux" (BA 9/04) or Michael Kofler (lastly BA 2/04). (1)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4787302-4>

Project: DYNAS - Dynamics of Natural and Anthropogenic Sedimentation: Task: Sedimentation Processes in the Mecklenburg Bight; Final Report (Milestone 6) ¤ With the collaborative project, a contribution to a deeper understanding of the sedimentation processes in the Mecklenburg Bight is to be made. The work was carried out in multidisciplinary cooperation between sedimentologists, benthic biologists and microbiologists, sediment physicists and physical oceanographers. A key role is played by the use of a coupled 3D flow model, into which modules for sediment transport are to be integrated. Essential here is the parameterization of the models through experimental determination of critical velocities for different sediment types depending on lithofacies, physicochemical environment and microbiological or benthic biological processes. Field measurements are carried out in key areas off the coast of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The experimental investigation of a probe discharge of dredged material serves the study of the behavior of anthropogenically disturbed sediments and the comparison with natural deposits.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4054080-7>

Library Science in National Socialism: A Research Status Analysis ¤ This investigation deals with German library science in National Socialism. The central questions are: How did the book burnings in May 1933 come about, who was responsible and how did the actions unfold in detail? With which state regulations did the libraries have to struggle and how did the library staff react? How did the Association of German People's Librarians (VDV) and the Association of German Librarians (VDB) behave regarding the political guidelines? What importance did other library forms have, such as lending libraries, confessional libraries, or libraries in National Socialist concentration camps? Numerous authors have dealt with the various aspects of NS library policy in recent years or decades and have gained new insights. Now, an attempt will be made to depict and analyze the research status on the history of people's libraries and scientific libraries in the Third Reich based on specialist literature. The treatise not only provides a comprehensive overview of the most important publications on this topic. The reader also learns something about the historical framework conditions and can form a comprehensive picture of the effects of cultural policy, in particular library policy, from 1933 to 1945 due to the detailed and vivid depiction of the most important events.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006439-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167870-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013021-6>

Not to Crack : From Unsolved Enigma Codes to the Letters of the Zodiac Killer ¤ There are many books about the extensive field of cryptography, about encryptions and their counterpart, the art of deciphering, cracking codes and secret writings. Klaus Schmeh himself has already dealt with this topic... In his new book, it's less about the hardware of coding, but about its results, e.g. the radio messages of the Enigma machines. Some are still not deciphered. More interesting, however, are the preserved manuscripts that could not be deciphered, which may also remain so. These include the Voynich Manuscript and the Codex Rohonci, but also the writings of the Zodiac serial killer - A thrilling read not only for logical puzzle solvers, to whom the author also offers his own difficult-to-solve cryptograms.

Atlas of the Strange Houses and Their Inhabitants ¤ Suddenly there's a house: A gigantic castle made of white wood, built by a New York art speculator. A half-sphere of concrete, set up by a film director for himself and his lover on a cliff in Sardinia. A hut in Mexico, where an American ex-banker has retreated. Eccentric builders sometimes indulge in rather peculiar houses, which Niklas Maak has been tracking down all over the world. He has spoken with architects and inhabitants and learned a lot about the dreams, fears, and obsessions of the 20th and 21st centuries. Houses tell the most wonderful stories. Niklas Maak has written them down – not just for architecture enthusiasts. "A building atlas, as the title claims, this subjectively compiled house show is not. Also, not all stories are equally interesting. That one still wants to read the book is due to Maak's storytelling art and his infectious fascination with unusual biographies" (deutschlandradiokultur.de)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066772-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>
More than Sun, Wind and Water: Energy for a New Era ¤ The electrical engineer worked as a developer in the industry and advises a group of inventors in the field of renewable energies. His strength is the thoroughness with which he analyzes the possibilities and limitations of conventional energy forms as well. For example, the unexcited discussion of nuclear power, which he opposes critically after careful examination of all arguments (a different point of view was taken by Jeanne Runber: "The Energy Dilemma", BA 3/08, and articles in "Secure Energy", BA 3/07). Energy storage and technical innovations are also treated in the illustrated non-fiction book, which is written in a clear and understandable way and is also suitable for students of higher classes.

Angular : the comprehensive handbook ¤ The open-source JavaScript framework from Google is very well suited for the development of modern web applications. Since the 1st edition of the book, Angular has established itself on the web framework market. There was no preface available for comparison. After comparing the table of contents (via DNB-Opac) it seems that the structure has not changed. The 1st part of the book deals with the Angular core components, which are the basis for further developments. Further topics are presented using a continuous project example. In total, the scope has increased by 194 pages with 4 new chapters at the same price. The new chapters are "Material Design and Angular Material", "Outsourcing functionality to libraries and publishing via NPM", "Angular components as WebComponent provide" and "Render Angular applications on the server".

The Numerati : Data Sharks and Their Secret Activities ¤ What sounds like a Dan-Brown title, is a reportage about the work of data collectors, mostly mathematicians, who use sophisticated algorithms to evaluate the tracks we leave behind while surfing the internet. Of course, it's frightening how exactly profiles of our behavior can be created today, where the use for product advertising still seems harmless. Now, the illusion of the internet as a place of freedom has long since vanished, and so it's not surprising that all social actors want to use it for their purposes. As is customary in popular American non-fiction literature, new experts are introduced from chapter to chapter, which becomes tiresome and not really enlightening in the long run. The book will already find readers due to the sensational title. Comparable to the somewhat older title "The Surveillance Mafia" by Pär Ström. (BA 6/05).

Application of Nanoferrum for Groundwater Remediation: Nanoproduct Data Sheet ¤ For the remediation of environmental damage, the applicability of a range of nanomaterials is being investigated and tested. Initial experiences exist with the application of nanoferrum for the remediation of groundwater damage. The application of nanoferrum in situ is an innovative remediation procedure that is currently under development in Germany and has only been applied in individual cases so far, which is why the level of experience is still relatively low. The procedure has so far been applied mainly in cases of groundwater damage with chlorinated hydrocarbons. Under suitable conditions, it can distinguish itself through high effectiveness and a short remediation period.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135804-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027017-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020822-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057696-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4510696-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4333369-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4010015-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022369-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4551030-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038971-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014002-7>
Adaptive windows for duplicate detection ¤ Duplicate detection describes the finding of multiple data sets that represent the same real-world object. This task is not trivial, as (i) the data sets can differ slightly, requiring similarity measures for a pairwise comparison, and (ii) due to the data volume, a complete, pairwise comparison is not possible. To solve the second problem, various algorithms exist that partition the data volume and perform comparisons only within the partitions. One of these algorithms is the Sorted-Neighborhood Method (SNM), which sorts the data according to a key and then slides a window over the sorted data. Comparisons are only performed within this window. We describe various variations of the Sorted-Neighborhood Method, which are based on varying window sizes. These approaches are based on the intuition that areas with greater and lesser similarities exist within the sorted data sets, for which correspondingly larger and smaller window sizes are meaningful. We describe and evaluate various adaptation strategies, some of which have been proven to be more efficient than the original Sorted-Neighborhood Method (same result with fewer comparisons).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4191565-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011133-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4328500-4>
Smart City : Innovations for the Networked City - Business Models and Management ¤ The societal-political pressure of the energy transition combined with the promising possibilities of a networked, decentralized world within the framework of the 'Internet of Things' (IoT) accelerates the transformation of cities towards Smart Cities. While there are some lighthouse cities like Barcelona, Lyon, and Vienna that exploit the potential, most cities have a huge catch-up demand. The gap between leading Smart Cities and lagging cities is growing, the need for action is often recognized, but the ways are often unclear for decision-makers. What are the core elements of a Smart City? What steps from analysis to Sweet Spot to action concept are to be taken? Where is the potential greatest? Where should we start? How do other cities do it and what have they learned so far? What can be learned from Greenfield approaches of Chinese Smart Cities? Which methods and tools can cities apply? What are the business models for the involved companies? How can the different stakeholders be well integrated? This book provides answers to these questions as well as numerous examples. The book is based on several years of research in the field of Smart City on a national and international level. The authors also bring their extensive experience from practice projects from politics, administration, and economy in the implementation of Smart City projects.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1061057097> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7737985-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161817-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056730-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123065-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078604-3>
Economy of Sufficiency : essays on wealth in diversity, enjoyable limits and creating commons ¤ Another summit of change, known as Rio+20, has passed in summer 2012, nourishing the rumours of a green economy. Building up a green economy seems to be the all over recipe for different crises of capitalism, among them climate change and resource scarcity. Yet efficiency and consistency, as their main strategies, do not suffice to reach sustainable levels, as they cause rebound effects and keep stimulating economy growth. Obviously, there are limits to green growth, too. Can we conceive an economy, and respective economic institutions, that serve human needs and wealth without a built-in necessity to grow? What kind of political, mental, and individual changes does a sufficiency economy require? And what are perspectives and policies to actually start implementing it? Just before Rio +20 the symposium "Economy of Sufficiency", devoted to Wolfgang Sachs on the occasion of his 65th birthday in 2011, examined these questions in three dimensions. Accordingly this selection of contributions to the symposium follows the chapters "Wealth in diversity" (Ashok Khosla, Marianne Gronemeyer, Vandana Shiva), "Enjoyable limits" (Richard B. Norgaard, Tim Jackson) and "Creating commons" (Ezio Manzini, Silke Helfrich). The essays indicate the historical development of the ideas on a sufficiency economy. Wandering through discourses of sustainable development for several decades, the authors map the range of perspectives, practices as well as barriers and bridge them between cultures, agencies and schools.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7660153-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4402290-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4178391-8>

Among the 17 species found in the stone accumulations, Chironomida larvae, Potamopyrgus jenkinski, Gammarus tigrinus, and Cordylophora caspia were classified as frequent. Three weeks later, 14 sediment samples were taken from the mixed sediment of the Mühlenberger Loch in the tide-influenced area of the Elbe. 13 species were found, with only the Tubificids being frequent, with the species Potamothrix moldaviensis, Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, and L. claparedeanus dominating.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4295330-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224449-3>
Selman Selmanagić and the Bauhaus ¤ Selman Selmanagic (1905–1986) is one of the important representatives of Bauhaus ideas after 1933. As the head of the architecture department at the Berlin-Weißensee Art Academy, he was a highly influential professor and a shaping designer for the workshops in Dresden-Hellerau from 1950 onwards. He came to the Bauhaus for architectural studies, having previously been trained as a carpenter in Srebrenica. After being drafted in 1932, he traveled to Turkey and Palestine, and later worked in the office of Egon Eiermann. From 1945, he worked in the planning collective under Hans Scharoun on the plans for the reconstruction of Berlin. In 1950, his 'Youth Stadium of the World' was built on Chausseestraße. In the same year, he was appointed head of the architecture department at the Berlin-Weißensee Art Academy by Mart Stam, and as a popular and charismatic professor, he was able to exert a great influence on the training of architects in the GDR – through his working methods and course content, he affected generations of students, despite the GDR's departure from modern and industrialized building. The results of his long-term collaboration with the German Workshop from Dresden-Hellerau, as well as his interior designs for numerous schools and exhibition pavilions, are considered classics of modern design. The monograph on Selman Selmanagic, prepared by Aida Abadžic Hodžic on behalf of the Bosniak Institute in Sarajevo and published in Sarajevo in 2014, is now available in German translation and closes a research gap on the aftermath of the Bauhaus after 1933	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130303-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129921-8>

Black Book Cotton: What We Really Wear on Our Skin ¤ Sustainability does not come for free - not even when it comes to what we wear on our skin. Cotton, which is already ecologically questionable, is becoming more expensive and scarce. The era of cheap T-shirts is coming to an end - a fascinating outlook."-- Based on his long-standing experience in the textile industry, Engelhardt has in-depth knowledge of the global textile market. His focus is therefore not only on cotton, as the misleading title suggests, but also on other natural and synthetic textile fibers. He deals with the importance of the different fibers for the future development of the industry. He considers aspects such as sustainability and environmental impact, durability and suitability, e.g. for sports clothing or airbags, as well as the consequences of agricultural subsidies in industrialized countries for African small farmers, all backed by statistical data. While he predicts a decreasing importance of cotton, he sees a strong trend towards products made from cellulose fibers and polyester. This look at the developments in the textile industry is not comparable to the cultural and economic historical representation by W. Mönnighoff: "King Cotton" (BA 12/06) or the popular insight into the world economy by P. Rivoli: "The Travels of a T-Shirt" (BA 6/06).

Alternative Antriebe : so fahren wir in die Zukunft ¤ Large-format reference book with an overview of current and development-stage drive systems for passenger cars. (Michael Müller) How future mobility and individual traffic will shape up is not yet predictable. With rising oil prices and decreasing subsidies, there are different options, e.g. reducing consumption. For several years, vehicles with hybrid technology (combination of combustion and electric motor, e.g. the Prius) have been available. In development and small series, electric drives and in the near future, fuel cells are to serve as drives. The contributions, partly from articles in the trade magazine, inform vividly with many photos and images around 'drives'. Sometimes the articles appear unmanageable in the magazine style, e.g. when tables, images, technical data, drawings, and highlighted special information are combined on 2 pages. While fuel saving with current models is mentioned, alternatives such as voluntary renunciation of cars or public transportation are missing. In this compilation and theme, there is currently no comparable title (on newer drive types, lastly 'Hybrid', ID-G 38/07).

Grundkurs gutes Webdesign : everything you need to know about web design ¤ The first edition of the title dates back to 2013. Since then, the circumstances in web design have changed significantly. The design fundamentals in terms of perception psychology, usability, user experience are still the same, but the technical framework has changed dramatically. Mobile devices and thus responsive design have become a factor to be considered from a starting point for all design concepts. This development is only partially addressed in the new edition, because it acts evolutionarily, where a disruptive cut might have been better. Topics such as rapid prototyping or the conceptual fusion of design and front-end development are given too little space. Apart from that, the title is still worth it and offers a good overview: composition, typography, navigation, interaction, color, graphics, etc. The focus remains unchanged on design. Knowledge of technology (CSS, HTML) is assumed - at least basic.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1041632088>

Securing the Exit from Nuclear Power: Why Germany Needs Nuclear Competence for Decommissioning, Reactor Safety, Waste Disposal, and Radiation Protection ¤ Introduction -- How the safety of nuclear facilities can be ensured until their shutdown -- What needs to be done regarding waste and disposal -- Why radiation protection is an important concern at all times -- but especially during the decommissioning of power plants -- The role of research and teaching in training the next generation -- Outlook: Research from a global responsibility and the importance of communication from science -- . Bibliography. In response to the accident at the Japanese nuclear power plant Fukushima Daiichi, Germany will exit nuclear power within a decade as the first industrial nation in the world. However, with the decision to exit nuclear energy, Germany will not become nuclear-free overnight. Rather, it is necessary to ensure a safe operation of the nuclear power plants at the highest safety standards until the planned exit date in 2022. In addition, the decommissioning of the shut down nuclear power plants and the still unresolved waste disposal problem will occupy society for decades to come. The German Academy of Science and Engineering has taken the exit from nuclear energy use in Germany as an opportunity to bring together central aspects of the current state of nuclear energy. The result is the statement's conclusion: The exit from nuclear energy must not be synonymous with an exit from nuclear competence.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4226736-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4030318-4>

New Spaces of Technical Infrastructure Systems: Research Status and Perspectives on Spatial Aspects of the Transformation of Electricity and Water Supply in Germany ¤ 4207 The liberalization of markets and the privatization of state property and public services are among the most significant recent developments in the political economy of many countries. This development is particularly noteworthy in the field of infrastructure and supply services. In addition to the commercialization of previously public services, the ecological modernization of some infrastructure systems gives rise to a far-reaching transformation dynamics. This particularly affects the systems of energy and water supply as well as wastewater disposal, which organize a significant part of the material exchange between nature and society. It can be assumed that these developments will trigger significant spatial changes. The aim of the investigation is therefore to analyze various aspects of the spatial transformation of German energy and water supply. In this context, various scientific discussion threads are to be brought together, where necessary supplemented by important aspects and critically reflected against the background of the situation in Germany. The study aims primarily to structure a new spatial research field. The starting point of the investigation is the social scientific concept of large technical systems, which presents a comprehensive and systematic approach to the analysis of technical infrastructure systems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014224-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064811-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026944-9>

Market of the Future for Decentralized Water Treatment and Rainwater Management: Case Study Commissioned by the Federal Environment Agency within the Research Project "Innovative Environmental Policy in Key Areas of Action" (Project Identification Number 206 14 132/05) ¤ Strengthening semi- or decentralized concepts of water supply and wastewater disposal infrastructure is of particular importance in view of the impending climate change and expected demographic changes, as they can be better adapted to changing challenges than the prevailing central infrastructure. Important building blocks are the treatment and (re-) use of rainwater and greywater. On the one hand, rainwater management can reduce the burden on the environment through heavy rainfall and renew groundwater through decentralized infiltration. On the other hand, membrane technology plays a key role in the treatment of all types of raw and wastewater.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064698-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049003-8>

Overview of Cloud Storage Providers ¤ Through the increasingly strong flood of digital information, more and more applications are based on the use of cost-effective cloud storage services. The number of providers offering these services has increased significantly over the past few years. To find the right provider for an application, various criteria must be individually considered. In the present study, a selection of established basic storage service providers is presented and compared with each other. For the comparison, criteria are extracted that are applicable to each of the investigated providers and thus allow for a possibly objective assessment. These include, among other things, costs, law, security, performance, and provided interfaces. The presented criteria can be used to evaluate cloud storage providers with regard to a specific application case.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4600802-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7623494-0>

Current Development and Perspectives of Biogas Production from Bio Waste and Manure: Final Report ¤ Manure and bio waste are still causing relevant greenhouse gas emissions due to the necessary storage, treatment, and utilization. They are already being used in part in biogas plants to provide renewable energy. However, there are still development potentials for this use path. Mobilizing the material flows seems to be extremely complex and difficult. Therefore, the state of knowledge was depicted in this project report to identify existing obstacles and possibilities for mobilizing manure and bio waste for biogas production and to derive from this in practice realizable action proposals. In addition, a proposal for adapting the EEG funding was developed, which is intended to encourage the use of manure in biogas plants, but also points out that, in accordance with the polluter pays principle, measures in agriculture should be considered. Proposals for the increased use of bio waste in fermentation plants refer, for example, to the increased separate collection of biowaste, the promotion of bio waste fermentation plants within the EEG, and assistance for municipalities.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017625-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061643-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145600-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172777-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4451877-8>

Otho Orlando Kurz ¤ Despite his impressive name, the Munich architect Otho Orlando Kurz (1881-1933) is largely unknown today and stands in the shadow of other architects of his time. In particular, his residential buildings in the Munich cityscape are very present. His houses, however, elude a clear stylistic assignment, which in turn is precisely the architectural quality and diversity that characterize his work to this day. The residential buildings form the content focus of this first monograph on Otho Orlando Kurz. It presents the architectural and typological development from the urban residential house to the residential groups to the large residential buildings based on his most important projects and assigns them to the previously hardly documented total work of the architect. The book is completed by a work catalog that comprehensively documents the residential houses with numerous illustrations and plans and relates the buildings to each other	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038373-8>

ROboB: Research Consortium Project ROboB ReleaseOrder based on Blockchain : Final Report : Individual Report of the Institute for Logistics and Management at the Hamburg University of Technology ¤ First Blockchain project for the Port of Hamburg! Since August 2018, DAKOSY has been working together with the Hamburg University of Technology and numerous associated partners on the IHATEC research project ROboB - Release Order based on Blockchain. The release reference, which is exchanged between the parties involved in the import of seafreight, authorizes a transport company to pick up a container from the terminal. The enormous value of the goods transported in a container imposes high demands on access authorization and IT process security. Against this background, the release process is ideally suited to be depicted using blockchain technology: The blockchain promises a common data basis for all participants. It is verifiable through digital signatures, unchangeable through cryptography and consensus algorithms. Within the project, two alternative approaches are integrated into the existing import platform of the Port of Hamburg and tested for their practicality - also in comparison to the existing solution. In addition to demonstrating feasibility, the project aims to contribute to making processes in the seaport even more efficient. ROboB is a consortium project within the IHATEC funding program for innovative port technologies, which is funded by the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI). The project sponsor is TÜV Rheinland Consulting GmbH. In addition to DAKOSY Data Communication Systems AG, which has the lead, the Institute for Logistics and Management at the Hamburg University of Technology is also a consortium partner. As associated partners, prominent representatives of the involved industries (forwarding agent, carrier, and terminal operator) as well as some industry associations have been won, so that a practical and reliable coverage is guaranteed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1124028595> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148290-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4036210-3>
C++ for Dummies : [at a glance: mastering object-oriented programming ; all C++ commands explained with examples ; from classes, inheritance, and assignment operators ; the book for the new C++ 2009 standard] ¤ A perennial bestseller in the "Dummies" series is the introduction to the object-oriented language C++. The fifth edition takes over the concept and structure of the still useful previous edition (BA 4/05; older ones should be replaced).

Case Studies on Computer-Aided Conflict Analysis Using Virtual Battlespace 3 as an Example ¤ From the introduction: The initiative for this project originated about two years ago at the planning office of the Federal Armed Forces in Taufkirchen. Various software products are already in use there. The development of a new, specifically tailored software system for the needs of the office is very time-consuming and requires a lot of time. Therefore, one is willing to buy established products available on the market. One assumes that these products are reliable, as they are already used in various armed forces around the world. However, it is not known how these systems work	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164951-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4203217-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1046414801> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139030-1>
Urban Developments : Irritations, Perspectives, Strategies ¤ Since its beginnings, urban planning has been geared towards growth. This growth will no longer be there. Like the Federal Republic as a whole, cities will increasingly lose population. Vacant lots, building gaps, and larger vacant areas will penetrate deeply into the existing urban fabric.

Biogasmessprogramm II : 61 Biogas Plants in Comparison ; this work was prepared within the framework of the project "Federal Program for the Evaluation of New Biomass-Biogas Plants" (Funding Code: 22003405) ; the project was financed by the Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (BMELV) with funds from the Agency for Renewable Resources (FNR) ¤ In total, the results show that there are large differences between the plants in terms of function, performance, and operational safety as well as in terms of economic efficiency. It is clear that the remuneration through the EEG is not a guarantee for the profitability of the plant operation. The correct dimensioning of the plant in combination with an optimal selection of the fermentation substrates is together with a high load of the BHKW at the same time using the available heat the key to the economic success of biogas production. Not least, the qualification of the operator plays an important role (Source: Author).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006798-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066424-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006340-9>

Medicinal Residues in Recyclates of Phosphorus Recovery from Sewage Sludge: Final Report ¤ Currently, there are data gaps regarding medicinal residues in sewage sludge and the phosphorus recycling products (P-recyclates) produced from it. The project aimed to investigate phosphorus recovery and carbonization plants in Germany regarding the following medicinal substances: Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin, Clarithromycin, Carbamazepin, 17-α-Ethinylestradiol, Diclofenac, Cefuroxim, Sulfamethoxazol, 17-β-Estradiol, Metoprolol, and Bezafibrat. The study clearly shows that phosphorus recovery processes significantly reduce the medicinal residue load in P-recyclates compared to the starting materials such as sewage sludge.

No New Human Image : On the Language of Brain Research ¤ The current debate about brain research and its consequences for our human image, for legislation, jurisprudence, educational styles, and historical understanding is taking place in a language that is little reflected. From neurophysiological terms to popular philosophical discourse about cognition, free will, and self-awareness, from scientific theoretical discussion about experience, experiment, proof, and refutation to appeals to values in a worldview, the range of linguistic means extends. Polemical sharpness and superficiality of concepts are the complementary features of a mutual refutation and a mutual foreciting, which are to be met philosophically with language criticism. While the discussed questions are certainly not pure language problems. But without clarification of the linguistic circumstances, they are not to be clarified at all. This applies not only to public discourses about so-called body-mind or body-soul problems, but also to the claims and results of the specialized, in particular the neurosciences. They touch in a clarifying manner our traditional human image as well as our understanding of science.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016216-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7555119-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074722-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056449-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056475-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4443839-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123382-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171303-5>

Statistics : an Introduction for Social Scientists ¤ A conceptually careful introduction to the methods and procedures of statistics, as far as they are required in the social sciences, mostly oriented to concrete examples, with references to suitable software, without pursuing mathematical foundations. (Wolfgang Grölz) The text claims to be a textbook and a reference work. Almost without requiring relevant prerequisites and without pursuing mathematical backgrounds, but with great conceptual care, the reader should be conveyed the statistical knowledge and skills required for the social sciences. Some experience with software should be possessed or derived from the recommended literature. The calculations here use the systems SPSS and Stata. The clearly structured explanations are mostly oriented to concrete examples and lead from data structures to the descriptive statistics to the estimation and test procedures of inductive statistics based on samples. Results from probability theory are used without pursuing the theoretical backgrounds. The ability to apply critically in practice is the prevailing learning goal that the authors pursue.

Family Houses: Plenty of Space on a Small Plot ¤ Family houses should provide sufficient space for all residents, be compact and economically built, creatively use small plots, integrate the garden, and offer flexible floor plans for the future. The present collection of examples shows 30 custom-made architect houses from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, which meet these requirements at tight owner-builder budgets. Each house is presented on 4 - 6 pages with texts based on conversations between owners and architects. Quotes from residents prove the satisfaction with their house. With photos of furnished and inhabited interior spaces, exterior views, floor plans, and construction data (location, plot size, living area, construction method, construction costs, owner's share). Recommended collection of ideas for future builders, planners, architects. Particularly positive: the vividly described experiences of individual family members and the visually appealing design.

Metric Temporal Graph Logic over Typed Attributed Graphs ¤ Graph repair, restoring consistency of a graph, plays a prominent role in several areas of computer science and beyond: For example, in model-driven engineering, the abstract syntax of models is usually encoded using graphs. Flexible edit operations temporarily create inconsistent graphs not representing a valid model, thus requiring graph repair. Similarly, in graph databases—managing the storage and manipulation of graph data—updates may cause that a given database does not satisfy some integrity constraints, requiring also graph repair. We present a logic-based incremental approach to graph repair, generating a sound and complete (upon termination) overview of least-changing repairs. In our context, we formalize consistency by so-called graph conditions being equivalent to first-order logic on graphs. We present two kind of repair algorithms: State-based repair restores consistency independent of the graph update history, whereas deltabased (or incremental) repair takes this history explicitly into account. Technically, our algorithms rely on an existing model generation algorithm for graph conditions implemented in AutoGraph. Moreover, the delta-based approach uses the new concept of satisfaction (ST) trees for encoding if and how a graph satisfies a graph condition. We then demonstrate how to manipulate these STs incrementally with respect to a graph update. Various types of typed attributed graphs can be used to represent system states from a broad range of domains. For dynamic systems, established formalisms such as graph transformation can provide a formal model for defining state sequences. We consider the case where time can elapse between state changes, and introduce a logic called Metric Temporal Graph Logic (MTGL) to reason about such time-controlled graph sequences. With this logic, we express properties of the structure and attributes of states as well as the occurrence of states over time, which are connected by their internal structure, which has not been precisely formalized by any formal logic over graphs so far. First, based on time-controlled graph sequences as models for system evolution, we define MTGL by integrating the temporal operator up to a certain time limit into the established logic of (nested) graph conditions. Second, we sketch how a finite time-controlled diagram sequence can be represented as a single diagram containing all temporal changes (as a diagram with a history), how the satisfaction of MTGL conditions for such a diagram can be defined, and show that both representations satisfy the same MTGL conditions. Third, we show how MTGL conditions can be reduced to (nested) diagram conditions, and show by means of this reduction that both underlying logics are equally informative. Finally, we present an extension of the AutoGraph tool, with which the satisfaction of MTGL conditions for time-controlled diagram sequences can be checked by checking the satisfaction of the (nested) diagram conditions, which were obtained using the proposed reduction for the diagram with a history corresponding to the time-controlled diagram.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006650-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123065-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7623494-0>
Straw Heating: Planning - Implementation - Maintenance ¤ The use of renewable raw materials as fuel is gaining importance. Grain (corn, straw, whole plant) has a large energy potential, which has been used almost exclusively by Denmark within the EU for about 30 years. The author (energy technology expert) shows in the present guide briefly and clearly the possibilities of straw heating in rural areas in Germany. Introducing, he compares the raw material straw with conventional energy carriers natural gas / oil in terms of environmental balance, pollutant diagnosis, cost calculation and draws parallels to the newly discovered fuel wood. Mainly, combustion technology, plant technology, exhaust gas technology and environmentally hazardous substances as well as licensing procedures and possibilities of project funding are dealt with. Finally, a concrete planning example for a heating plant with grain straw, including differentiated cost calculations. With numerous tables, graphics and internet sources. Worth reading for interested farmers and energy technicians. Without comparison title. Unfortunately, high price of the specialist book.

Description and Analysis of Fuzzy Information: Statistical Methods for Fuzzy Data ¤ Data quality, accuracy, or inaccuracy of data and other information are fundamental aspects of measurements and observations that must be quantitatively described to avoid unrealistic results from analyses. In many practical applications, the provision of real numbers as existing data elements appears questionable. The use of fuzzy numbers allows the uncertainty to be included in the modeling and thus enables a more realistic description of data. The book is written for readers who are familiar with elementary stochastic models and statistical procedures. The goal is to present methods for the quantitative description of fuzzy observations of stochastic quantities and to introduce them into the foundations of statistical analysis of such data. The practical scope with the presented theories and methods is brought closer to the reader through numerous exercise problems. TOC:1 Uncertainty and Information. Fuzzy information and fuzzy data.

The Roman City : A Brief History ¤ Most Roman foundations are based on fixed patterns. Which ones these are and how they were partly considered in difficult terrain, although cleverly varied, are woven as a red thread through the presentation of rather limited scope. Nevertheless, sufficient information is provided. Concentration on the essential, accompanied by typical examples, demonstrates the great expertise of the author, former director of the German Archaeological Institute in Rome. He structures his writing chronologically according to the time of the Republic, Imperial era, and higher Imperial era. The difference between colonial foundations and the city of Rome itself is well worked out. On the one hand, the book is more than an archaeological guide to the ancient sites treated, on the other hand, it is certainly worth consulting before a trip, provided one is not bothered by the few Latin terms. Many understandable floor plans. For the city of Rome, F. Coarelli (ID-A 41/13) and even more specifically "The Roman Forum" (ID-G 15/12) are recommended.

CO2 Pricing, Energy Carrier Prices Reform: Paths to a Cross-Sectoral Market Design ¤ How should the market design be shaped to enable efficient climate protection in Germany and promote sector coupling? A comprehensive CO2 pricing and reform of taxes, levies, and charges are essential components. This statement incorporates the decisions from the Climate Package 2030 and shows options for how the revenue from CO2 pricing can be used to achieve a double dividend for climate protection. The following points are crucial: A uniform and comprehensive CO2 price in Europe forms the core of an efficient and effective market design. It is obvious that the European Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) should be extended to all sectors by 2030. For the national CO2 pricing in the transport and heat sector, which the federal government has decided on in the Climate Package 2030, Germany should win further member states as partners. Together, they can form a strategic CO2 alliance that, in the best case, leads to an extension of the EU-ETS. The revenue from CO2 pricing can be used to reform the system of taxes, levies, and charges – with the goal of relieving disproportionately heavily burdened energy carriers. This can achieve a double dividend and promote sector coupling. Particularly effective is replacing the EEG levy and reducing the electricity tax. In the transport sector, emissions are currently at the same level as in 1990. A better market design could significantly contribute to solving these climate policy challenges in the transport sector in a targeted and efficient manner. The federal government should initiate a process to develop suitable solutions.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1215284845> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547705-1>

Electrical Installation in Residential Buildings : Handbook for Installation Practice ¤ It is a very demanding handbook (guideline for electrical installation) and reference work (for standards, regulations, guidelines, each commented) for professionals (craftsmen, masters etc.), less for apprentices or laymen who want to perform small installations. Since 1984 it has been continuously expanded and above all updated, lastly in 2005 (BA 9/05). There are again some innovations (e.g. in the field of building system technology or through electronic household meters etc.) and fundamental changes in the standards, regulations and guidelines, The title is probably not a big borrower (in Wuppertal the aforementioned 6th edition was borrowed 11 times) compared to the guides for laymen by H.O. Häberle (BA 2/10), H. Schultke (BA 4/10), the even simpler one by B. Hanus (BA 3/07) or the overview for builders by A. Burgwitz (BA 5/09), to mention only the newer titles. In expanded holdings, however, the latest edition should be available at all times.

Research with Modern C++ : C++ 17-Intensive Course for Scientists, Engineers, and Programmers ¤ C++ is considered optimal in the context of scientific and technical software for developing large systems of high quality, high performance, and speed. In addition to a clear presentation of the fundamental definitions and concepts (e.g. object-oriented programming), the book focuses on simple interfaces between subsystems of the software and between subprograms (high-quality). Performance is provided by the Standard Library (new features such as parallelism with efficient use of multi-cores since C++ 11) and the Standard Template Library (efficient algorithms). Rapid development is enabled by the use of various types of abstractions (clear presentation of generic programming from simple function and class templates to variadic templates - i.e. templates with a variable number of arguments, and clear description of metaprogramming). Further books on the subject: U. Kirch and T.T.

Often practical reasons are decisive for their use and not, as often assumed, exhibitionist tendencies of video producers: It is easier to load a film on YouTube and distribute the URL by email than to burn a DVD multiple times. The title first describes the passive (search function, rating) and active use (user registration, upload) of the most well-known video communities, such as YouTube, Clipfish and MyVideo, and offers in the second part numerous tips and tricks, such as saving offered films or editing, converting and uploading own videos. The title's structure is clear and quickly usable, the descriptions are precise and sufficiently detailed, only some technical details are handled too briefly and superficially. Further background information is hardly provided. Although a software supplement is missing, references to the described tools are always offered. Conclusion: Quickly usable, unadorned introduction to the highly current topic of using current video portals.

Relativistic Quantum Theory : an Introduction to Quantum Field Theory ; with 7 Tables ¤ This sequel to N. Straumann's 'Quantum Mechanics' contains the relativistic part of a two-part lecture that the author has given many times. The material is worked out in detail and supplemented by chapters from quantum electrodynamics. The book is a thorough introduction to quantum field theory and its applications. The red thread of this textbook is the quantum theory of electromagnetic processes. The first chapter on the old Dirac radiation theory closes the material of 'Quantum Mechanics' and refers to applications in atomic and nuclear physics. Then, in the chapters on Dirac's wave equation for the electron and on the quantization of the Dirac field, the most important parts of relativistic quantum theory are presented. The remaining four chapters are devoted to quantum electrodynamics, e.g. the Born approximation, the systematic derivation of the Feynman rules up to the treatment of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177688-4>
Software Development for Embedded Systems: Fundamentals, Modeling, Quality Assurance ¤ Embedded systems take on complex control and regulation tasks for technical systems. Their functionality is realized through the interaction of special hardware, standard processors, peripherals, and software. Often the focus is on hardware aspects. In fact, software design plays at least an equally important role in designing these systems. This book starts here and provides a good overview of the topic. Classifications and topics such as concurrency, real-time, and real-time operating systems form the fundamentals. Programming embedded systems is explained using C++, Java, and examples from Esterel and Giotto. Selected software design techniques such as statecharts, hybrid systems, UML, and hardware-software co-design are presented in detail. Embedded systems are often used in safety-critical areas. Ensuring software quality is therefore of central importance and forms another important part of the book.

Control of Wind Energy through Regional Planning - Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow ¤ This contribution deals with the development of regional planning designations between 2009 and 2014. The evaluation of current draft plans provides further information on the scope of future zoning designations for wind energy. The investigation is based on the data of the BBSR-managed Regional Planning Monitor (ROPLAMO), whose vector data from zoning areas in binding regional plans have been supplemented with vector data of draft plans on the topic of wind energy. This allows for the first time a time series consideration of regional planning designations. Quoted are, inter alia, the judgments of the Federal Administrative Court of 13.12.2012 (Case No. 4 CN 1.11 and 4 CN 2.11), in which the methodological requirements for the planning control of wind energy use in the outside area were further developed, as well as OVG Schleswig-Holstein, 20.01.2015, 1 KN 18/13	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049040-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128839-7>
Brand and Digital Media: The Transformation of the Brand Concept in the 21st Century ¤ A stocktaking of what the digital age has in store for working with brands. Away from persuasion in all its (psychologically underpinned) forms (to turn non-buyers into buyers), which has long been generating massive resistance, towards dialogue communication. As media users increasingly exploit the technical possibilities for information and communication, their perception and reaction behavior changes. It requires a rethink in understanding the brand, nothing less than a completely new brand concept. This book provides an overview of the current state of debates on new brand strategies. New research on brand theory complements solution approaches and thus provides a well-founded basis for meeting the challenges of digitalization.

Mathematics - visually and entertainingly : [for preparation and accompaniment of studies] ¤ The title of this book could also have been the motto for similar publications that try to bring some color to this abstract art for a generally interested public: e.g. Georg Gläser: "The mathematical toolbox" (Spektrum; BA 9/06), Manfred Dobrowolski: "Mathematical excursions" (Oldenbourg; BA 6/10). Paech also presents a similar book with many colorful drawings, highlights, tables, marginalia, and caricatures, which represents a popular science approach in method, yet a serious textbook. It takes the reader from elementary mathematics to the beginning of a scientific study, and can therefore also serve as a bridge course. The representation appears lively through many examples (mostly from physics). Very helpful are the explanations of mathematical notations, which often become an unnecessary hurdle for beginners. - A mathematics book that fits into the gap between learning aids like "Basic knowledge of mathematics 5th to 10th grade" (BA 8/10) and textbooks like "Mathematics" (BA 12/08; Arens ...).

The Urban Code of China ¤ Cliff Notes: When reading Chinese cities, as this book does, it's not primarily about Beijing, Shanghai, Xi an, Shenzhen and other well-known addresses, but rather about the Chinese in the Chinese city, about those features that all Chinese cities more or less exhibit, about their core, about their syntax, in short: their code. Only the deciphering of this common code opens up a view of their inner structure and allows us to weigh and sensibly order the diversity of empirical impressions. Such a city reading provides the building blocks of the code of the Chinese city: the dualism of open and closed space, which decisively determines the basic structure of the Chinese city; the clear preference for private or community-related over public and social space; as well as the self-evident practice of interpreting and designing residential areas as exclusive, closed spaces and much more. With this code, the author can then also read new city foundations in China planned by European architects. The Urban Code of China thus also provides the reader with insights into China's booming urban development.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056730-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056795-3>
The World is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century ¤ More than two million copies have been sold in the English-language edition. Why? Friedman, Pulitzer Prize winner and columnist for The New York Times, explains globalization to his uncertain countrymen. And he formulates what they and all other inhabitants of the 'first world' can do to survive in a world that is becoming increasingly flat. The world bestseller in paperback, expanded and updated: Thomas L. Friedman's controversial assessment of the present is at the same time a gripping reportage and a concise introduction to what drives the world today at its core. Global value chains and insourcing, RFID and workflow: Friedman describes the background of the buzzwords, presents us with people whose visions determine our future, and takes us behind the scenes of the business world, whether in Bangalore, India, where the Asian boom peaks, or in Bentonville, Arkansas, where the heart of Wal-Mart beats, the largest company on earth. He shows what changes are coming for each of us - neither alarmist nor unreflectively enthusiastic.

Windows 7 for Dummies : [at a glance: create CDs, DVDs, and playlists with Media Center ; move data from an older PC to a new PC with Windows 7 ; customize Windows 7 to your needs ; understand Windows security warnings] ¤ Introduction to the new operating system with step-by-step instructions and numerous tips. (Sch) Review: The American author has been accompanying the various Windows versions within the "Dummies" series for a long time - the first guide to Windows 95 was discussed by us (cf. BA 1/96) - and of course, he does not leave the users of the latest release of the operating system in the lurch. The basis is the predecessor to Vista (BA 9/07), but although Windows 7 is often referred to as the better Vista, Rathbone has thoroughly renovated it. The structure is largely unchanged, but all innovations have been introduced, with many of the texts, step-by-step instructions, additional information, and tips having undergone more or less significant revisions. Completely replaced are the screenshots and the cartoons at the beginning of each of the 7 major chapters. Remaining are the familiar advantages, that beginners are offered here with solid, practical explanations and handbooks in a relaxed tone - and the recommendation.

Learning with Joy - a Lifetime : Why We Need a New Understanding of Learning ; Seven Theses on an Expanded Concept of Learning and a Selection of Contributions to Support It ¤ Why do most children want to have nothing more to do with learning by the end of their first year at school? Why do students, who as babies began to explore the world with such joy, use their creativity in schools and universities only to escape learning or at least to get through it as quickly as possible? Why do hardly any adults experience learning as an enrichment of their own lives and as deeply joyful and fulfilling? Gerald Hüther's answer: Because our understanding of 'learning' is only historically justifiable and, in light of our current state of knowledge, belongs in the trash. We have confined learning to a narrow framework that was prescribed to us by the knowledge transmitters from the institutions specifically created for this purpose. How could we forget that learning is essential to human life? And that we are not the only learning-capable living beings? But we can learn from our mistakes. Learning means nothing less than staying alive. And whoever loses their joy in learning has also lost their joy in life.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167413-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035408-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041871-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044321-8>
ecoControl : Design and Implementation of a Software for Optimizing Heterogeneous Energy Systems in Multi-Family Houses ¤ A decentralized energy supply is the first step towards an energy transition. In this context, various power and heat generators are increasingly being used in multi-family houses. In particular, in Germany, block heat and power plants are being used more and more frequently, as they can convert gas very efficiently into heat and power. In addition, they enable a continuous and decentralized energy supply in combination with other energy systems such as photovoltaic systems. When operating different energy systems, it is desirable that the systems work in sync with each other. However, it is currently difficult to operate heterogeneous energy systems efficiently together. As a result, potential savings are left unused. A central control can therefore improve the efficiency of the overall system. With ecoControl, we present an expandable prototype that optimizes the cooperation of energy systems and takes environmental factors into account. The software provides a uniform interface for configuring all systems. In addition, it offers the possibility of developing, testing, and executing optimization algorithms using a programming interface. Within such algorithms, predictions provided by ecoControl can be used. These predictions are based on the individual behavior of each energy system, weather forecasts, and energy consumption forecasts. Using a simulation, technicians can immediately test different configurations and optimizations without having to test them over a long period on real devices. ecoControl also helps housing associations and landlords with the management and analysis of energy costs. We have shown through case studies that optimization algorithms that improve the use of heat storage systems can significantly improve the efficiency of the overall system. Finally, we conclude that ecoControl must be tested under real conditions as soon as a suitable hardware component is available. Through this interface, measurement values are sent to ecoControl and control signals are forwarded to the devices.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4012002-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7708028-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4024257-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038373-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7660153-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140245-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055382-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064204-5>

Forest Soil Condition Report for Lower Saxony and Bremen: Results of the Second Forest Soil Condition Survey (BZE II) ¤ The Forest Soil Condition Survey (BZE) provides a comprehensive picture of the current state of forest soils and their changes over time. The BZE in Lower Saxony and Bremen is based on a grid network with a total of 272 sampling points. BZE I (1990-1991) showed clearly critical conditions of forest soils, especially due to atmospheric acid inputs. The repeated inventory (BZE II, 2006-2009) now provides insight into changes in forest soils against the background of decreasing acid loads, continued high nitrogen inputs, and the effects of compensation lime applications. In addition to the detailed analysis of chemical properties of various forest soils − from poorer sands in the lowland to rich limestone soils in the upland − the focus is on carbon and nitrogen storage, as well as results on tree nutrition, forest vegetation, and intensive forest environmental monitoring. The Forest Soil Condition Report for Lower Saxony and Bremen provides important decision-making bases for science, practice, and politics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132325-7>
Living and Renovating: Empirical Residential Building Data since 2002 ¤ Within the framework of the project, all the data of buildings that have been collected since 2003 by co2online GmbH have undergone a comprehensive and systematic statistical analysis. To this end, the database was edited according to scientific standards and in a detailed way in regards to heating energy consumption and the status of modernisation. In so doing, there was a special focus on findings relevant to updating both the renovation status and the energy consumption of residential buildings in Germany. To begin with, the data stock of co2online will be described, including details about the scope, origin and quality of the data. Accordingly, any data cleansing is going to be presented in a methodologically comprehensible way. Moreover, the description is going to be complemented by the inclusion and consideration of additional data sources as well as similar evaluations. Furthermore, corresponding indicators have been derived from the data; these indicators now provide an empirical foundation for information that has so far been based on estimation, like the renovation rate and depth. In this context, the aim is to make activities regarding residential buildings measurable and to derive statements on the extent to which the residential building stock is on a suitable way. The indicators that are to be derived for the development of residential buildings will be described on an aggregated and detailed level over time. In so doing, there will be a critical review of the question of which data sources are best suited for the determination of indicators in the long run. The evaluation and (part of) the data will be made publicly accessible in both a professional brochure and an internet database.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4023693-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137351-0>

Typenkompass Raumstationen : since 1971 ¤ The USA won the moon race during the Cold War, but only launched one manned space station, the "Skylab", with the "Spacelab" (ID 49/10 being a returning space lab). Here, the Soviet Union dominated with 7 "Saljuts", and today there is the international space station "ISS" and others. Like in the Typenkompass about the transporter "Space Shuttle" (Reichl: BA 8/09), the long-time EADS employee goes beyond a simple directory and writes a history of the numerous flights and research projects. The missions were often overshadowed by failures and catastrophes. In addition, astronauts from all over the world are presented in the text and the numerous tables and photos. A thoroughly excellent book that offers a lot of information for the money and, in addition to "Space-Shuttle" and Reichl's further catalogs "Manned Spacecraft" (BA 2/09) and "X-Planes" is recommended (BA 2/10, touches on space travel). With "Space Knowledge" (BA 1/07), the author also wrote an overview suitable for all libraries. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048597-3>
Garden Experts and Their Green Knowledge ¤ There are already some titles on the subject ("Flower Women and Their Extraordinary Gardens", ID-G 5/11; "Gardeners", BA 2/09), but no overlap. Here, after a brief look back at the great English garden ladies, 11 garden ambassadors are presented with their different training, experience, and professional competence in selected projects: e.g. Countess Bernadotte (Mainau Island), Victoria von dem Bussche (Ippenburg Castle), Heike Boomgaarden et al. with the innovative "urban farming" (the "edible city" Andernach), Sabine Reber and her mobile garden, the "tree finder" Katharina von Ehren. In this context, the editor, K. Lammerting, presents her garden in Cologne again (see "A Garden Full of Fantasy", ID-G 40/12). All provide practical advice on varieties and care. The gardens in this book are artistically and architecturally different, offer space for beauty, peace, and order, are "education in green matters". Finally, the address directory of the experts and their gardens. Despite the price, highly recommended next to the above-mentioned titles.

User- and Fuel Influences on Fine Dust Emissions from Small Combustion Plants ¤ Household heating systems contribute to a non-negligible share of fine dust emissions in Germany. The aim of the present project was therefore to investigate numerous influencing factors on the emission behavior at various wood chip boilers and to derive recommendations for action from this. For the test program, four heating systems were selected: two chimneys of different price categories, a tile stove heating system and a wood chip boiler. At the selected heating systems, basic methodological questions were first clarified, in order to subsequently quantify the various fuel-related and user-related influences on the emission phenomenon.[...] (Source: Author)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153891-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4332388-1>
Little 1 x 1 of the Theory of Relativity: Einstein's Physics with Middle School Mathematics ¤ The desire for a better understanding of the theory of relativity is often found among scientifically interested individuals, but it remains unfulfilled most of the time, as the literature is either too shallow or too demanding. This book deliberately and didactically takes a middle path. Formulas are not omitted, mathematics is used intensively, but, as the title honestly expresses, only up to the middle school level. Many theories are first presented in a thought experiment, then the relevant formulas are derived and explained in detail. There are a few calculation examples and graphical representations. Topics include the general and special theory of relativity, gravity, black holes, cosmology, especially redshift and the Doppler effect. This is one of the few books on the theory of relativity that you have to work through, but you really feel like you finally understand something, and it is certainly one of the best that has been published in the non-fiction section so far. Highly recommended! (1)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049363-5>
Virtualization and Cloud Computing : Concepts, Technology Study, Market Overview ¤ Virtualization and Cloud Computing are currently among the most important buzzwords for operators of IT infrastructures. There are a wide variety of different technologies, products, and business models for completely different application scenarios. The present study first provides a detailed overview of current developments in concepts and technologies of virtualization technology – from classical server virtualization to infrastructure for virtual workplaces to application virtualization and makes an attempt at classifying virtualization variants. When considering the Cloud Computing concept, its basic principles, as well as various architecture variants and application cases are introduced. The detailed examination of the advantages of Cloud Computing as well as possible concerns that must be taken into account when using Cloud resources in the company shows that Cloud Computing offers great opportunities, but is not suitable for every application and not for every legal and economic framework. The subsequent market overview for virtualization technology shows that the major manufacturers – Citrix, Microsoft, and VMware – each offer products for almost all virtualization variants and highlights decisive differences as well as the strengths of the respective providers. For example, Citrix's solution for Virtual Desktop Infrastructures is very mature, while Microsoft can only rely on standard technology here. VMware, as market leader, has found the greatest dissemination in data centers and offers as the only manufacturer true fault tolerance. Microsoft, on the other hand, scores with the seamless integration of its virtualization products into existing Windows infrastructures. In the area of Cloud Computing systems, some open-source software projects are shown, which are certainly suitable for productive operation of so-called private clouds.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7623494-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200434-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4839180-3>

E-Books with ePUB : from Word to E-Books with XML ¤ Publication for professionals in electronic publishing to create appealingly designed e-books in the ePUB format using Word files as source material. (Elke Nibbrig) E-books have become an important topic of discussion in the publishing and media world, since the beginning of 2010 the ePUB format has established itself as an open standard, but surprisingly there has been no professional literature in the German-speaking area except for weblogs. Victor Wang (expert in media-neutral publishing) closes this gap and offers a well-founded publication on the creation of appealingly designed e-books in the ePUB format using Word files as source material. After an introduction to the history of e-publishing, different reading devices, formats, and digital rights management, it deals with XML basics as the basis of the ePUB format and the production of Word-XML documents. In the 2nd half of the book, the different sub-standards of ePUB are presented in detail and the practical implementation of an e-book production is demonstrated using a sample workflow. With numerous examples, screenshots, listings, command references, further web addresses, etc. Recommended for larger computer stocks. No comparison title, to be reviewed is E.

Concrete structures for wind turbines ¤ This book deals with the fundamentals of planning, design, calculation, and construction of reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete towers as well as hybrid tower structures for wind energy applications. The focus is on the highly dynamic loads of onshore and, in particular, offshore wind energy applications. The wind industry in Germany takes a leading position worldwide in the development and manufacture of wind energy systems (WEA). With the progressive development of increasingly more efficient wind energy systems and the additional requirements for the design and execution of offshore foundation structures, the existing experience in the various fields of civil engineering is exceeded. In this book, the fundamentals for planning, design, calculation, and construction of wind turbine structures made of reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete, for onshore and offshore systems, are treated. Wind energy systems are highly dynamic structures. For the design of load-bearing structures, in addition to the maximum loads, fatigue loads are of great importance, especially in the connection and node areas of concrete and hybrid structures. There, multi-axial loading states occur that are not yet covered by the design regulations. The special influences and non-linear material behavior are detailed and the model formations for the calculations explained. Design and proof are treated under special consideration of fatigue. The chapter on production includes hybrid structures, the segment construction method for prestressed concrete towers, and the foundations for offshore WEA. Since 1906, Ernst & Sohn has accompanied the development of reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete construction with the Concrete Calendar. This book should accompany the progress of reinforced concrete construction annually, as long as the "stormy development", as the first editor Fritz von Emperger (1862-1942) put it, would find an end to the construction method. Selected chapters of the Concrete Calendar are made available to the international market in the new English-language series BetonKalender Series.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4203577-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144990-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128839-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055978-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060592-9>
Renewable Energies : Application Possibilities - Technologies - Economic Efficiency ; with 56 Tables ¤ In view of dwindling resources, it is urgently necessary to save energy costs and reduce emissions when building and renovating buildings. This can be achieved by using renewable energies such as photovoltaics, solar thermal, heat pumps, or by using conventional energy forms more efficiently and better insulation. Accurate analyses are necessary to ensure the economic efficiency of the investment. The professor of building management deals with the basics, advantages and disadvantages of individual plant forms as well as the legal situation and presents exemplary cost calculations. The specialist book convinces through systematicity, argumentative precision and a successful combination of text and images.

After a brief introduction to the basics of building physics and the presentation of the most important modern building and insulation materials, it is explained where, how and how much to insulate and how tight a house should be today. It is shown what must be considered for the most important elements of the construction from the window to ventilation and heating to the use of collectors and power-saving technology. In addition, he explains in detail the implementation of the current energy-saving ordinance (EnEV 2009) and the passive house standard	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4245918-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113437-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014733-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078517-8>
Technoscience: Recognize — Shape — Be Responsible ¤ Introduction -- From Engineering to Technoscience -- The Technoscience and its Place in the Sciences -- Recognize in the Technoscience -- Shape in the Technoscience -- Responsibility -- Further Reading. What are the technosciences? What are their characteristics and how do they differ from other sciences? How did the technosciences come into being and what role do technology and technoscience play in society? Despite their social significance, the technosciences have so far been largely neglected by traditional science research. They themselves have hardly reflected on their foundations and fundamental questions. acatech advises society and politics on technoscientific future issues. In order to be able to do this, the German Academy of Technological Sciences must also deal with its own discipline. This acatech IMPULS is intended to provide a stimulus to discuss technoscience as a knowledge system both within and outside of acatech, and to sharpen the self-awareness of the technosciences.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137304-2>

STEP 5-Crash Course: SPS Programming and Simulation for Users ¤ Publisher's text: STEP(c)5 is the most widely used SPS programming language in Europe. Knowledge of this language is of great benefit to anyone involved in electrical, control, and automation technology. Even small control tasks are now solved with SPSs, as the price difference between control systems implemented with conventional switching technology and those with small SPSs is small or no longer exists. In terms of flexibility and comfort of the systems, these are often equipped with SPSs. The book conveys STEP(c)5 in addition to the practical handling of a SIEMENS automation device. With the attached WinSPS software, the examples in the book can be programmed and simulated. The simulator is operated like an automation device of the S5 series from SIEMENS. The AGs up to the 135U series are simulative. The book is set up so that a topic is first conveyed and explained by examples.

The Security Society : Social Control in the 21st Century ¤ Social control is changing at a rapid pace. 'Online searches' of computers, storage of telecommunications data, video surveillance, as well as rising prison numbers and toughening of juvenile justice laws are just a few examples of this, which seem to stand independently of each other in the daily political discussion. In fact, they are however expressions of a fundamental change in social control and the societal understanding of security. The book presents this change and interprets it as the development of a new formation of social control, which works with techniques of self-leadership, control, and exclusion. This development is analyzed against the background of the economic, socio-cultural, and discursive changes of the past few years, which form the basis for the state and society to understand and react to crime and deviance differently today. From this, the outlines of a critique are sketched and a look at alternatives is given.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4318539-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117641-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127888-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055719-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134175-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113326-2>

There are no chapters, but "books", and each of these (between 50 and 135 page long) books deals with a specific important topic. They are: A 1. Orientation, Basics, Security, Customization, Internet, Hardware Installation, Multimedia, Video, and Networks. The Vista Beginner's Book by A. Rathbone (BA 9/07) aims to make it as easy as possible for beginners to get started, the present book is more suitable for looking up (this is mainly evidenced by the very strongly structured table of contents), also answers individual questions, the explanations are overall somewhat more concise. Both books have a high level of knowledge and a high information density, on the other hand, a relaxed, anxiety-reducing tone. A very useful duo.

Kunst-Gewerbeschule Zürich : Re-Restoration and Renovation for the Zurich General Vocational School ABZ ¤ ‘Shoemaking Factory’ and ‘Fashion Wit’ are just two of the nicknames given to the building, which was considered revolutionary when it was built for the Zurich Trade School and the City of Zurich’s Museum of Applied Arts between 1930 and 1933 by architects Adolf Steger and Karl Egender. Today, the spacious building is considered one of the few icons of the New Building in Zurich. The school wing, with its flat roof and grid façades, is the epitome of a modern ‘laboratory for industry’, where great teachers of applied art like Alfred Altherr, Johannes Itten, Hans Finsler, Willy Guhl, or Josef Müller-Brockmann shaped generations of designers and photographers. With a refined re-restoration and some innovative detail solutions, architects Silvio Schmed and Arthur Rüegg adapted the former site of the legendary Zurich Art School to the needs of the Zurich General Vocational School ABZ in 2016/17. This building monograph provides insight into the prototypical problems that need to be solved when adapting to current standards, presents the building from the perspective of monument conservation in its historical dimensions, and paints a vivid picture of the past and future life in this outstanding witness to modernity	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061577-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049600-4>
RiSKWa - RiskAGuA Consortium Project: Risks from Wastewater from Intensive Livestock Farming for Ground and Surface Water : Final Report : BMBF Research Project : Project Duration: 01.11.2011-31.04.2015 ¤ The RiskAGuA research project covers the following areas: - Screening program to determine the extent of the release and persistence of veterinary pharmaceuticals, pathogenic microorganisms, and their resistances through manure utilization and distribution in the environmental compartments soil, ground, and surface water. - Analysis of natural dispersal barriers (soil, ground, and surface water). - Creation of artificial barriers such as biogas, further wastewater and waste management facilities, which, in addition to energy generation, enable further retention and separation of water-hazardous substances and nutrient recycling. - Establishment, development, and optimization of decentralized biotechnological procedures, which reduce the load on soil, ground, and surface water with macropollutants, veterinary pharmaceutical residues, and pathogenic microorganisms originating from manure utilization (direct application, biogas production > application, further treatment > application). - Modeling of groundwater flow and substance transport processes in the unsaturated and saturated soil zone is intended to illustrate the cause-and-effect relationships between emission and consequences for the water cycle. - Derivation of risk management/action directives and their mediation to the agricultural sector.

Sandwich plates made of natural fiber reinforced bio-polyurethane and PU foam as a contribution to sustainable lightweight construction (NF-BioPUr) of the research unit(s) Faserinstitut Bremen e.V. - FIBRE - : Final report on the IGF project : the IGF project 17913N/1 of the Research Association Research Council Textile e.V was funded by AiF within the framework of the programme for the promotion of industrial collective research (IGF) by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy ¤ The book summarizes the results of a research project. It was possible in the project to produce sustainable lightweight materials from renewable raw materials, which have essential advantages over standard plates. Using bio-based polyurethane in combination with flax fabric or commercial furniture decorations as a surface layer, components were produced that have the following advantages compared to conventional plates: - Low density - Mechanical bending strength at the level of MDF or OSB plates - Extremely low and completely reversible water absorption - Low flammability at a level close to aerospace applications Another advantage of the plates is a thermal conductivity that is still twice as high as that of typical insulation materials, but only half as large as that of standard plates. The results of this project can thus establish a new product class in lightweight construction, which is sustainable in multiple ways (weight reduction, use of bio-based materials), and at the same time offers users an additional benefit in several areas. The sustainability aspect can be positively marketed at the same time and can also become a growing price advantage on the raw material side at expected increases in crude oil prices. Dr. Holger Fischer, born in 1961, is a chemist and has been active in the field of renewable raw materials, natural fibers, and sustainability at Faserinstitut Bremen e.V. since 1997. His areas of focus are enzymatic fiber modification, fiber characterization, natural fibers, surface modification of fibers, natural fiber reinforced composite materials, and biocomposites.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035165-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127568-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179068-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046304-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4175327-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7641320-2>
Mobility Management in Germany: A Critical Inventory ¤ The present contribution presents a (new) definition for the transport planning instrument mobility management for discussion. The starting point is the hypothesis that the existing, partly very different definitions, while enabling the application of the instrument, ultimately lead to a diffuse overall picture, which prevents successful agenda-setting. In order to overcome the diffuse concept and provide all involved actors with a uniform basis and ultimately achieve a satisfactory political marketing, the Institute of Integrated Transport Planning suggests a definition based on an object-oriented view of transport planning. Central to this understanding is that mobility management is equal to infrastructure- and traffic-management. Furthermore, measures can be assigned to the instrument based on their primary impact on the planning object, which is mobility. Therefore, mobility management has to be focused on its operational level while normative attributes are assigned to the guiding principle of integrated transport planning. The guiding principle of integrated transport planning is also superordinated to infrastructure- and traffic-management and regulates the capabilities of the three fields of transport planning (infrastructure, traffic and mobility).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4417126-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062954-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5>

Rock, Paper, Scissors : Game Theory in Everyday Life ¤ The English physicist and science author Fisher explains in this book some basic principles and key terms of game theory, an important subfield of mathematics, which has already brought the Nobel Prize (for economics) to some researchers. He explains common procedures, such as divisions ('one divides, the other chooses') or peaceful but often also conflict-laden strategies (e.g. 'do unto others as they do unto you'). His true or invented examples are taken from his own family history or his own tests at parties or other occasions. The book is free of mathematical formulas; psychological moments are highlighted. A whole chapter deals with trust. Although there are already titles on the subject that do not overwhelm an interested layman too much, such as the repeatedly published volume by M.D. Davis: 'Game Theory for Nonmathematicians' (ID 20/05) or the introduction by A. Mehlmann: 'Who Wins the Game?' (BA 3/98); the new work is just as interesting and well-readable due to numerous digressions and notes.

She tries to push back formalism, taking into account gaps in proofs, emphasizing applicability with visually illustrated patterns under the motto "better understanding without calculating than calculating without understanding" in selected areas. This is easily applicable to topics from geometry or graph theory, but also in fields such as, for example, stochastic or number theory, especially targeting cryptography, she leads with appealing ideas. As a supplement, also through moving images, a website is offered. The solutions to the embedded tasks can be found in the appendix. Like O. Deiser: "Basic concepts of scientific mathematics" (BA 7/10), this simpler text can also be recommended to students as a guide for finding a study subject.

QUANTAS 04, Measurements in the Arkona Basin from January 26 to February 13, 2004 ¤ In the winter of 2004, a research cruise was conducted in the Arkona Basin using the Helmsand multi-purpose boat. The research goal was to observe the inflow of salt-rich water from the North Sea and its mixing with the surrounding Baltic Sea water. The mutual penetration of water masses of equal density, but different in salt content and temperature, leads to complex sound speed structures in the near-bottom water layer. As a result, the sound channel loses its ability to transmit signals over long distances. Cruise documentation and data were already collected during the research cruise in a suitable file structure on a computer and written to DVD after the cruise. Due to the possibility of referring back to these data, this cruise report can be limited to main points. (AUT)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026309-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020252-5>
Ocean circulation and climate: observing and modelling the global ocean ¤ Ocean circulation and climate: "observing and modelling the global ocean" presents the findings of leading scientists on the knowledge of global ocean circulation after the completion of the "World Ocean Circulation Experiments (WOCE)" investigation phase. WOCE's physical and chemical measurements combined with satellite height measurements have created a data set of unprecedented breadth and accuracy. This data set provides the basis for the development of ocean circulation models and combined ocean-atmosphere circulation models, which serve to understand ocean fluctuations and climate fluctuations and project climate changes. The book leads through the analysis, interpretation, modeling, and synthesis of these data. (MOD)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031170-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130725-2>

Part 2 provides foundations for the description of random phenomena and probability theory as well as simulation using the freely available statistics software R. Each chapter closes with exercise problems, solutions, and further R programs are made available online. Suitable for accompanying lectures, self-study, and as a reference work. With further literature in the text and in the appendix. For professional collections. (3) (LK/SH: Preisler)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121729-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4705956-4>
Unknown Planet : the astonishing diversity of our animal world ¤ The diversity of the lesser-known animal world, captured in breathtaking photographs and numerous information. (LK/KI: Hagen) The promoted entomologist Ross Piper shows on more than 500 fantastic images the zoological diversity of this world and focuses his attention on the less noticed species such as jellyfish, starfish, arthropods or gill slits (only invertebrates in the marine environment). Ultimately, the familiar animals - mammals, birds, crocodiles, lizards, amphibians and fish - make up only about 4% of the approximately 1.5 million known animal species. This title clearly shows that the great diversity of animal species is due to a relatively small number of ancestral lines that share a common plan and a common evolutionary history. Great macro- and electron microscopic images show snails in bold patterns or the hidden beauty of a thick-shelled sea urchin egg. The text contains detailed information on physiognomy, lifestyle, origin and relationships as well as survival strategies. No comparable title known, so a worthwhile acquisition for larger libraries.

Refactoring : How to Improve the Design of Existing Software ¤ Refactoring means the restructuring of the source code of a computer program, where the original program function remains unchanged. The goal of refactoring is, among other things, to improve the testability and extensibility of the program. At the same time, the probability of errors should be minimized. Literature on refactoring has not been discussed so far. This book is the completely revised new edition of the German translation of the English original title by R. Johnson, in which the term "Refactoring" was introduced in 1990. The didactically well-designed book relies on many code examples in JavaScript, although refactoring is not limited to a specific programming language. Emphasis is placed on the general principles of refactoring and the improvement possibilities they offer for programming, the development of reliable tests for refactoring, and the detection of pitfalls in refactoring. Intensively, the simplification of conditions in programs is also treated. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4784343-3>
Health Purposes and Human Genetics: Medical Ethical Arguments for the Binding of Predictive Genetic Tests to Health Purposes ¤ With predictive genetic tests, it is possible to obtain information about individuals. The range of this information extends from hints for nutrition counseling to the diagnosis of severe genetic diseases. This spectrum of test forms ranges from those that do not appear to require regulation at first glance to those with a high potential for harm. Currently, the problem is primarily due to the expanding offers for genetic examinations on the internet. An assessment of the regulatory needs of predictive genetic diagnostics is therefore urgently required: The present volume examines the potential dangers and regulatory needs for predictive genetic tests. It does not present its own regulatory proposal, but develops medical-ethical criteria for such regulations. A comprehensive documentation presents existing national and international regulatory approaches and analyzes them.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074672-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4200230-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048737-4>
On the Go - with Navi, Handy & GPS : how to find your way everywhere ¤ The new, working with black-and-white illustrations, relatively affordable series "Digital lifeguide" (2 further titles for review planned: "Home-Media" and "Music digital & everywhere") offers well-understandable, inspiring and useful information on everything that is now possible with digital devices in everyday life and leisure. This volume shows, not too deeply but offering a comparative overview, how to comfortably plan routes with a GPS navigation device, mobile phone, smartphone or PC, navigate with various means of transport or on foot through the city or nature, or how to access your photo archive through geotagging, for example. Geocaching, the outdoor sport, is also treated. The volume is dotted with numerous tips and further web addresses. In principle, current individual titles are already available for all mentioned topics (e.g. lastly T. Bierl: "GPS on the bike", BA 8/10), but those who could not acquire all of them can compensate with this quick information. Not quite up-to-date, more device-related is J. Schieb (ID 48/09).

EDV-Grundwissen : an introduction to the theory and practice of modern computer science ¤ With the revision of the previous edition (BA 5/02) of this standard work, account is again taken of the rapid progress in the IT sector. In addition to numerous details (additions to operating systems and programming), new sections or chapters can also be identified (PCI Express, Instant Messaging, Computer and Security). The areas of networking and access to the Internet have been newly structured. To improve use, the table of contents has been further differentiated and the nomenclature has been adopted into the chapter headings. The also updated bibliography now also lists internet resources. Consequently, the scope of the book has also increased further (60 pages). The concept has not changed, however, as comprehensive and profound computer science knowledge is still conveyed. Also suitable for students in secondary education II. Desirable in many computer collections. Due to the significant changes, the previous edition should be discontinued.

Turbulence and microstructure studies at a shallow sill of a Norwegian Fjord ¤ In autumn 2002, intensive turbulence and microstructure studies were conducted in the Norwegian Sognefjord using a microstructure and turbulence probe (MST probe) to determine the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy in the vicinity of an underwater ridge at the entrance to the fjord. To capture the hydrographic background, accompanying high-resolution measurements were carried out in advance with a towed CTD chain and a shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler. The comparison with different regimes of oceanic turbulence shows that the measurements are also in line with those from other mixing areas with extreme topography (e.g. in the Strait of Gibraltar and at Stonewall Bank off the coast of Oregon).

The Best Tips & Tricks for Google Chrome : [the best apps for your Google Chrome ; Facebook, Twitter & Co. always perfectly in view ; error messages: here you will find the suitable solutions] ¤ Google's Chrome had to gain attention alongside the already established browsers Firefox, Opera, and Internet Explorer. This has been achieved. Many find the tidy, unadorned Chrome interface somewhat dull and only use it occasionally. In truth, it has it in itself. It can flourish if one gives it a different design. There are hundreds of them, created by users, but also by artists. The author not only shows where to find them, but has also discovered many other "Extensions" or "Apps", i.e. useful additional features, and leads them in screenshots. But Chrome itself also has many sensible properties that often hide in a context menu that one only finds when one is pointed out, which the author does commendably. The book can be an eye-opener - also for the reviewer - and will ensure that many surfers will now engage with Chrome for the first time and learn to appreciate this browser.

Data Analysis with SAS: Statistical Procedures and Their Graphical Aspects ¤ The "Statistical Analysis System" is a program package developed 30 years ago for statistical investigations, which now runs on all common operating systems for mainframe and PC computers. In this volume, which is an extended 2nd edition of the 2004 published work (not discussed), version 8.2 for Windows is taken as a basis. Initially, the authors provide a thorough introduction to the structures and operations of the system, placing great emphasis on the graphical possibilities. Following a brief summary of the core areas of descriptive and inductive statistics, the main part presents a basic and at the same time practical representation of various procedures and applications using SAS. A reader should be fairly familiar with the general mathematical foundations. In addition to students in higher semesters, this is particularly addressed to demanding users of statistical procedures in practice.

Beleuchtungstechnik for Practitioners : Fundamentals, Lamps, Lighting, Planning, Measurement ¤ Review of the 2nd ed. 1997:As one of the most innovative sectors (new lamps, equipment, etc.) within building equipment, and as an important topic in terms of economy, ergonomics, etc., the subject is actually rarely treated. Most comparable titles on the subject are older than the previous edition (BA 11/92), except for B. Weis (ID 18/96):"...after H.R. Ris...". This one seems to contain the most important information just as compactly, and also includes a diskette. The present 2nd edition is expanded by 40 pages, but smaller libraries do not necessarily have to replace the 1st edition, especially if Weis is available, larger ones should rather; an initial acquisition is recommended instead.

Divided into 7 thematic complexes, where according to copyright notices, existing "Dummies" titles were referred back to: PC construction and function (Dan Gookin: last BA 8/10), Windows 7 knowledge (Andy Rathbone: last BA 1/10), help with Win-7 problems and system control, music, film and photo management, internet and email use (John R. Levine: last BA 12/10), Google research on the internet as well as Office 2010 basics, Word 2010, Excel 2010 (Peter Weverka: "Office 2010 - everything in one book", to be reviewed). Compared to the previous edition (BA 3/09) consistently updated, adapted to Windows 7 and Office 2010, a few pages expanded at the same price. Recommended as a current supplement to the predecessor. The content-comparable introduction by G. Born: "Computer completely easy" (BA 5/10) relies on colorful visualization, is therefore 5 EUR more expensive.

The Hydrogen Boom : [Wish and Reality in the Climate Protection Race] ¤ Romm thoroughly and differentiated examines the possibilities and limitations of the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier in the face of dwindling oil reserves and threatening climate warming. He knows what he's talking about, because the trained physicist served the Clinton government as responsible for hydrogen and fuel cell research and is active in this field. The regional focus of the demanding, relatively easily understandable book is on the USA, which are both enormous energy consumers and major polluters involved in global problems and do too little about it. It becomes clear how difficult and complicated such a revolution in energy supply is to implement! After the easily readable H. Boethius: "The Hydrogen Turn" (BA 6/05) and alongside the mainly technically oriented Sven Geitmann: "Hydrogen & Fuel Cells" (last ID 51/05) as a comprehensive overview in content, highly recommended. A lot of interesting details can be found, such as the role of Iceland as a possible hydrogen pioneer.

Telecommunication in the new federal states : business and spatial effects since 1990 ¤ After German reunification, the significant infrastructural differences between the two state halves were the greatest obstacle to a rapid convergence of living conditions and economic structures between East and West. This also applied to telecommunications. With a large-scale investment program, the telecommunications infrastructure in eastern Germany is being expanded. The study deals with the spatial and economic effects of telecommunications in the new federal states, using selected economic branches in four case study regions as examples. Its results are based on literature analyses, expert interviews, oral and written surveys of the responsible Telekom service departments, a written survey of 459 companies, and in-depth interviews in 42 selected companies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059360-5>

Future Market Synthetic Biofuels : Case Study Commissioned by the Federal Environment Agency within the Research Project "Innovative Environmental Policy in Key Areas of Action" (Project Identification Number 206 14 132/05) ¤ Synthetic biofuels, together with bioethanol produced from lignocellulose fermentation, belong to the second generation of biofuels. Characteristic of these biofuels is that the entire plant mass is used for their production, including cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. In the fermentative biomass breakdown, ethanol is produced as a product. With the thermochemical biomass breakdown, the so-called BtL (Biomass-to-Liquid) process, synthetic biofuels are produced. In the first process step, the carbon-hydrogen framework of biogenic raw materials is thermally opened to syn gas. Syn gas is a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2). The second process step uses the purified syn gas for chemical fuel synthesis. The synthesis can be tailored to produce gasoline, diesel fuel, or designer fuels for advanced fuel-efficient and low-emission engines.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145658-0>
50 Key Ideas in Mathematics ¤ This 1st volume of a new textbook series follows a uniform schema. Each topic is treated on 4 pages, always with a striking headline, a text that often starts with a historical example, is often supported by some graphics, and closes with a guiding sentence for the topic, which is always rather ugly printed in the text "What it's about". The 4-page concept naturally leads to bite-sized information, which can lead to a basic understanding of many of the described ideas and can also lead to the reading of more specialized books in the library. This applies, for example, to the 4-color problem, the golden ratio, the normal distribution, fractals, or the importance of zero. The author is a renowned mathematician with a special interest in the history of mathematics and has presented here a nice box of pralines that contains many flavors and will please every reader with some background knowledge.

Android-Apps entwickeln : Concept, Programming and Marketing; from Design to Publishing on Google Play and Co.; so develop native Apps for Android; Developing is not enough: Marketing Apps correctly ¤ Apps for Android, an open-source operating system for mobile devices of market-dominating importance, are becoming increasingly important for the two major app stores of Apple and Google. A good introduction to programming these apps for beginners is given by D. Louis (ID-A 4/13); a comprehensive compendium is R. Meier (ID-A 49/13). The present book recommends itself through additional extensive explanations also for the marketing of these apps. Addressed are beginners without greater prior knowledge. The 1st chapter deals with the differences that need to be taken into account when programming for mobile devices compared to programming for desktop devices and servers. The 2nd chapter deals with the actual programming (in Java) and the tools required for this (Android Studio, Android SDK), supported by examples. The 3rd chapter is concerned with marketing (app store optimization, targeted advertising, search engine optimization). The testing on an emulator or the own smartphone is also well considered. Didactically well constructed. Many code excerpts and illustrations. (2) (Klaus Barckow) Introduction to programming Android apps with Java, which also provides hints for marketing these apps.

The Notebook Handbook : Mobile, Windows, Internet, Wireless, Multimedia, Software, Accessories ¤ Laptops are becoming increasingly powerful and are finding widespread use both as mobile PCs and as a space-saving desktop alternative. A comprehensive guide specifically for this purpose was recently presented (Jürgen Borngießer: BA 6/05), with the present one going even further in terms of content. In 8 chapters, everything is covered that needs to be known - hardware and software, basics, main areas of application and optimization and tuning options - where, in addition to the clear division, the understandable explanations, like the illustrative illustrations and the useful additional tips, convince. While there are always topics that apply to all types of computers, the experienced and versatile author (cf. BA 6/05; 9/05) has succeeded in highlighting the specifics of laptops in particular or incorporating them. A CD-ROM with a bootable rescue operating system, helpful tools and further information completes the suitable book for working through and looking up, which offers a comprehensive and useful guide for beginners and should stand alongside the aforementioned title.

MATLAB kompakt : [MATLAB and Simulink examples] ¤ MATLAB is widely used in the natural and engineering sciences as well as in industry for calculations and simulations with graphical representation of results, which is updated twice a year. The comprehensive handbook of experienced MATLAB trainer W. Schweizer (1st edition: ID-G 52/05, Release 7.0) is now available in a significantly expanded and updated version. The representation is now based on version 8.0 (Release 2012b), but also deviations that the previous versions brought with them are taken into account. On the subject recently: A. Bosl: "Introduction to MATLAB, Simulink" (ID-G 35/12, suitable for beginners, cheaper but also less comprehensive); the classic "MATLAB - Simulink - Stateflow" (7th edition: ID-G 4/12, gives greater space to graphical extensions); "MATLAB and Simulink" by O. Beucher (ID-G 24/13, presented as a cheaper, one-week introduction course).

Homer's Wild West: The Historical-Geographical Rebirth of the Odyssey ¤ Heinz Warnecke brings Homer's Odyssey back from 'literary abstraction' into historical reality and thereby initiates a paradigm shift in Homer philology. He resolves, taking into account all the statements of the Homeric epics, the question of Odysseus' homeland island and, on a solid philological basis, shows that Odysseus' fictional journey leads through geographical spaces that lose nothing of their reality in the form of mythologizing narration. Furthermore, the historical findings on the subject matter are groundbreaking for the solution of the Homeric question. Moreover, the historical personality of the Odyssey poet and his homeland can now be reliably fixed. In addition to a wealth of new arguments, Warnecke supplements the second edition with a chapter on the history of the Ithaka question.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195351-4>
The Golden Age of Aviation ¤ The airplane has become a mass transportation means today. With budget airlines, it is possible to reach distant destinations for little money. However, from the late 1940s to the 1970s, flying was an exclusive pleasure for wealthy people, who were also offered a perfect service, good food, comfortable seats, and in first class even a bar. Journalist Borgmann draws a comprehensive picture of this - also due to the good profits of the companies - "golden" era. He describes the transition from propeller planes to jets, legendary constructions such as the "Comet" or the "Caravelle", the development of Lufthansa and other companies, and much more. The very informative text is illustrated with excellent selected images of airplanes and airports, aircraft production, passengers and flight personnel, historical advertising, and more. Smoking was allowed! A remarkable aviation history that can be recommended even to small collections. Comprehensive, e.g. R. Niccoli: "Aviation" (ID-B 4/14). Querformat.

The Beetle: Ferdinand Porsche and the Development of the Volkswagen ¤ Over twenty years of research, including in the very early archives of Volkswagen and Porsche, a variety of previously unpublished photos and development plans, as well as the expertise of one of the most renowned international motor journalists and acknowledged Beetle connoisseurs, converge in "The Beetle" to form a fascinating car biography. Numerous books have thus far illuminated the Beetle's career, yet all only vaguely touch on its development history. Author Chris Barber, on the other hand, focuses exactly on this era of the cult car from Wolfsburg. He goes back seventy years and accompanies the genius car developer Ferdinand Porsche and his team on their mission to build a vehicle that should revolutionize the automotive market. The Volkswagen should be easy to use, it should provide enough space for a five-person family, it should be robust and producible in large series, and: it should be extremely affordable. Ferdinand Porsche succeeded in this feat in a politically diffuse and dangerous environment. Chris Barber's sovereign gaze is owed the fact that the description of the technical masterpiece does not become a blind tribute to the Führer state of Germany. Rather, he manages to place the unique development history of the Beetle without pathos into the prevailing times. Translated into this future standard work on the birth of the Volkswagen by Germany's most competent Beetle experts: Dr. Bernd Wiersch, who had already written his dissertation on the Beetle, led the Wolfsburg "Volkswagen Museum" for many decades.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063881-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139402-1>
Applied Statistics : Collection of Methods with R ¤ The freely usable program R is a learnable and flexible tool for data analysis. In the book, the application is illustrated by means of simple, but also more complex examples. Statistical procedures are explained and necessary details for data collection, analysis, and interpretation are conveyed. New in the 14th edition are, among other things, sections on Bayesian estimation and the evaluation of repeated measurements, further recommendations for planning and evaluating scientific studies and a more comprehensive index.

Elementary Particle Physics : From Fundamentals to Modern Experiments ; with 51 Tables and 88 Exercises with Solution Hints ¤ Elementary Particle Physics. This textbook offers, from the fundamentals to modern experiments, a systematic introduction up to the latest developments in the field. Experimental tools such as accelerators and detectors are discussed at the beginning. Then follow the symmetry principles and their applications. Subsequently, the Standard Model is developed, which largely dominates the current experimental and theoretical discussion. Essential areas of quantum electrodynamics, the quark model, quantum chromodynamics, and the electroweak theory are explained. Latest experimental results on neutrino physics and the violation of CP symmetry are treated, before the question of possible extensions of the Standard Model is raised. The textbook is attractively designed, 83 exercises with solution hints serve for deepening.

Are substances more persistent than the test systems believe? : Evaluation of test systems for persistence assessment by the example of hydrolysis ¤ Hydrolysis is an abiotic process that is crucial for the fate of many water-soluble substances in an aquatic environment. The ability of chemicals to undergo hydrolysis is currently tested in purified lab water in accordance with OECD guideline 111. It has been suggested that the addition of particles such as sediment or microplastic fibers may result in a change in the rate of hydrolysis or in the formation of different transformation products. This study therefore tested the hydrolysis of three environmen-tally relevant compounds with and without addition of microplastic, sediment, or humic acids.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4160918-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4173007-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136095-3>

Space-Oriented Risk Management in Technology and Environment: Catastrophe Prevention through Spatial Planning ¤ The volume contains the results of the working group "Space-Oriented Risk Management in Technology and Environment". With this, it has been possible for the first time to present the overlapping areas of catastrophe prevention and spatially oriented planning in important outlines. Because the spatial sciences have hardly paid attention to the large, catastrophe-prone risks in the environment and technology in the past. At the same time, the spatial dimension has often been neglected in the various scientific approaches to this topic. With a view to the state of scientific research, the regional or spatial implications of large risks in the environment and technology are therefore systematically brought to the forefront here. The effects on the human capital of a society are considered just as much as those on natural, real, and social capital. Often, it is an unadapted use of locations and institutional deficits in social systems that are responsible for outstanding risks. The working group has assumed that from the integrative perspective of spatial planning, the anthropogenic dimension of large environmental and technology risks is at the center of interest. Space-oriented prevention against environmental and technology risks a) Spatial risks and risk prevention b) Risk-oriented spatial planning policy: approaches and foreign experiences Case studies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4447164-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121555-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121590-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029932-6>
Nietzsche : Biography of his Thinking ¤ Like few others, Friedrich Nietzsche has shaped modern thought. He called himself dynamite. One can imagine his thinking as a laboratory where provocative, sometimes risky arguments are experimented with. His philosophy does not result in a system, but rather lives from its inner dynamics. Rüdiger Safranski called his significant and highly successful Nietzsche book, which appeared on the 100th anniversary of his death and was translated into many languages, a 'biography of his thinking'. On the 175th birthday on October 15, 2019, a new edition of this standard work appears, expanded with an afterword that highlights the unbroken topicality of Nietzsche's thinking.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045791-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3>
What is good work? Requirements for career entry from the perspective of the young generation: Results of a representative survey of career entrants between 18 and 34 years old with completed vocational training ¤ In the center of the representative survey "Requirements for career entry from the perspective of the young generation" are young people between 18 and 34 years old who can at least demonstrate completed vocational training. According to the Mikrozensus (2005), this group of trained young working people comprises approximately 9.77 million people. The investigation retrospectively illuminates the transition at the second threshold, i.e. the transition after completing an apprenticeship or a degree into working life.

Laterales Management : the success principle for companies in the digital age ¤ Lead, decide, work together: Why lateral management is the answer to the digitalization of the economy Digitalization will change the economy and society in the coming years as dramatically as electrification did a hundred years ago. While leadership and collaboration in the 20th century were still hierarchically organized, the digital future will be shaped by lateral management - by leading on an equal footing. Roland Geschwill and Martina Nieswandt analyze what this will mean for us and our working world in the future, but also show what opportunities the digitalization process offers for companies, people, and managers: The chance for more freedom, more individuality, more exciting jobs, more creativity, and more innovation.

Holz erkennen und benutzen : das Nachschlagewerk für die Praxis ; [over 200 wood species and their use] ¤ The title is about 30 pages more comprehensive and includes 17 new wood species compared to the previous edition "Holz bestimmen und benutzen". Nevertheless, the edition from 2006 can certainly remain in stock. After a brief introduction to the material wood with drying, cutting, grain and wood defects, 219 wood species, each presented on an A4 page, are listed alphabetically by botanical name. The always similarly structured pages contain a photo of the grain, the text includes the sections Description, Properties, Drying and Stability, Durability (including pests), Use, Origin and Health Risks. Partly supplemented by photos of workpieces. More processing-oriented and comprehensive than the otherwise comparable "Atlas of Wood Species" (ID 17/10). As a more affordable and sufficient material expert for DIYers, "Material Wood" (BA 2/03) is still recommended.

The Big Bang and Other Catastrophes ¤ Dramatis personae: God creating the world, several chaotic assistants including Schrödinger's cat and Laplace's demon, who always turns green when talking about quantum and probabilities. Furthermore: boxes and crates with elementary particles; explosions, smoke, and a lot of noise. In this way, the reader experiences the origin of the universe, learns something about the structure of matter, elementary particles, and forces, the periodic system, quantum mechanics, and relativity theory, electrical conductivity, insulators, semiconductors, crystals, nuclear fusion, etc. At the end: the quantum mechanical Santa Claus as an overlap of wave functions, which can deliver gifts everywhere at the same time. The book is based on physical short stories for "Physics in our Time". A cabaret-like ride through the basics of natural sciences and some technical aspects, which conveys a lot of solid knowledge despite the sometimes quite crazy presentation. Thinking is required, as it's about quite complex matters. Definitely worth getting. (1)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045956-1>
Viking Ships ¤ The author, who has been publishing in the GDR (after studying shipbuilding machinery until 1990, he was accordingly active; here lastly "Norman Ships", BA 9/87), describes after an introduction to the history of the Northmen and their shipbuilding craft the current state of knowledge about the recovery of long and transport ships in Norway, Denmark, and Schleswig-Holstein (e.g. the Oseberg ship as well as the vehicles presented in exemplary fashion in Roskilde, Denmark), their archaeological investigation and the insights gained into their construction and operation (each ship is introduced with a data sheet). The information in the factual, also well-readable text for non-specialists is well illustrated by precisely placed, partly double-page color images (also of replicas), drawings, and graphics.

Statistics and Intuition : Everyday Examples Critically Examined ¤ Verl.Beschr.: This non-fiction book shows how statistical thinking can be successful and lead to greater competence in dealing with uncertainty. Deeply ingrained thought habits make us intuitively search for truths and patterns in everyday life, not for probabilities, as statistics provides. The book clarifies how the thought patterns of statisticians and non-statisticians differ, what misunderstandings arise from this, and what statistics has to do with truth. It thus promotes active and responsible handling of statistics through practical examples from everyday life and shows how to correctly interpret and communicate statistical statements.

Unlimited Preemption of Criminal Law? ¤ Already, the legislator has considered it too risky to punish only the violation of rights under the law. And so, he penalizes behaviors that are likely to be dangerous, or which - further pre-empted - only carry the germ cell of future evil within themselves. The inevitable end of such pre-emption would be the punishment of evil thoughts - no mere thought experiment, as recent creations of criminal offenses show. This is one perspective on the unlimited pre-emption of criminal law mentioned in the title of this volume. The other is linked to the clearly defined threat scenarios of international terrorism or so-called organized crime, which seem to demand two things: a uniform and at the same time networked transnational approach. Here too, the inevitable consequence is an extension of the criminal law ...

El Niño : Climate Makes History ¤ Many think that El Niño is only a problem for Pacific coastal countries and would not affect us in Europe. Starting from El Niño phenomena on the South American Pacific coast, the American geographer Caviedes, who has been researching El Niño for over 30 years, shows that other continents and Central Europe have been feeling the consequences of El-Niño and La-Niña events for a long time. The content includes, among other things, the origin of El Niño and La Niña, remote and feedback interactions in the global weather machine, meteorological, ecological, economic, cultural, social, and political consequences. By evaluating archaeological and historical sources, he follows the traces of El Niño in world history. A demanding scientific book with a lot of theory, but also with many exciting examples, colorful diagrams, and overview maps. No glossary, but a detailed register, further literature, also in German. This fascinating non-fiction book presents many connections and opens up new perspectives and insights for interested laypeople. Highly recommended. (2) Fascinating non-fiction book about the origin and consequences of El-Niño and La-Niña events, remote and feedback interactions of large-scale weather systems, climate history of climate zones and continents, the influence of climate crises on civilizations and events in world history.

Ubuntu 18.04 : Practical Knowledge for New and Experienced Users ¤ The Linux operating system exists in various distributions and derivatives. A very popular derivative is Ubuntu, closely connected to the Debian distribution. M. Fischer is the author of a comprehensive handbook on this topic. Troche has written a very concise introduction, which is limited to essential basic knowledge. He has now updated his last title for the Ubuntu version 16.04. The LTS version 18.04 is dealt with, which again receives five years of support with updates. With this new version, the groundbreaking developments of the past few years are abandoned (Desktop system Unity and display manager Mir) and the Gnome/X-Window-Server pair returns for display and management of the work surface. Troche has incorporated corresponding changes. In addition, he has almost all chapters revised and partially expanded. A chapter that contained brief descriptions of Ubuntu programs has been omitted. There is again a DVD supplement for quick installation. Predecessors are still usable (updates until 2021)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1177398567>
The Global Surveillance : The Snowden Case, the American Intelligence Agencies and the Consequences ¤ In June 2013, Glenn Greenwald published the first NSA documents from the archive of whistleblower Edward Snowden. Since then, increasingly alarming details of the global surveillance system of the American intelligence agencies have been uncovered. Now, Greenwald presents the full extent of mass surveillance in light of a wealth of exclusive, never-before-published secret documents. Everything and everyone is being spied on, the population is under collective suspicion. Freedom of opinion is suppressed in the name of security, and there is no longer any privacy - anywhere. In May 2013, Edward Snowden met in Hong Kong with documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras and lawyer and journalist Glenn Greenwald, thus setting the NSA affair in motion. Glenn Greenwald has now written a book about the 'Snowden case', in which he reports extensively on the background. Chronologically, from Snowden's first, covert contact attempts, which almost failed due to Greenwald's lack of interest, to Snowden's flight to Moscow, he recounts the events once again and illustrates the enormous dimension that the surveillance drive and the collecting frenzy of the American security agency NSA have taken on. Based on the documents obtained by Snowden, Greenwald analyzes the NSA's actions and warns impressively of the possible consequences for society. In doing so, he writes so engagingly and incisively that the book reads like a novel - a first-class spy thriller at times. High media echo. (M.

Competition for Resources : Conflicts over Climate, Water, and Land ¤ Climate, water, and land are equally indispensable and endangered resources of humanity. What happens when a competition for their use breaks out? What conflicts can arise from this? Internationally renowned experts address the question of how resource conflicts and resource scarcity affect both domestic and global levels, and examine exemplary forms of cooperation and conflict resolution. Their contributions reflect the findings and perspectives of different disciplines: The book covers political science, economics, economic and social geography, international law, regional science, as well as theological-normative aspects - and thus opens up a highly topical field of peace and conflict research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020830-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177874-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4075236-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164266-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4007394-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055747-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115589-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064811-4>

C and Linux: Utilizing the Capabilities of the Operating System with Own Programs ¤ Practice aids for Linux system programming are relatively sparse. A standard work already appears in its 4th edition (the 2nd edition, ID 44/02, shown here last, must be replaced; only partially useful: 3rd edition 2005 not shown here), which mediates the obvious programming in C, as almost the entire operating system itself is written in ANSI-C. The source texts of the new edition have been adapted to the newly developed Linux Standard Base, and the topic of controlling devices via USB is also new. Examples of network programming have been expanded and new development environments are described. Offers advanced programmers with C basic knowledge further guidance under the use of the numerous Linux tools available and with the help of many detailed examples easily understandable instructions, inter alia, for creating hardware practice solutions, graphical user interfaces or own help pages. A meaningful addition to the LINUX literature, the previous edition is practically permanently borrowed in Munich. Currently, there are no current comparison titles!

E-World : Technologies for the World of Tomorrow ¤ The development of new information technologies is advancing very quickly. The working world and society will change like never before. The author introduces the most important IT trends of the coming years. He does not remain on the surface, but tries to explain the backgrounds and thus to awaken a better understanding of the consequences that can arise from these developments. Problematic effects are clearly named. The author's core statement is that control over the future E-World is indispensable. Only in this way can it be guaranteed that this E-World remains a human world. Interesting, lively, and easily understandable presentation. Extensive historical references. Partly, the leading employee Frank K., a typical product of the modern, post-capitalist, global economic order, is accompanied in his work and considerations. Helpful general understandable glossary in the scope of 13 pages. Good compilation of further information (also magazine articles and addresses in the World Wide Web).

I Pluck an Eyelash and Stab You with It ¤ Reisen, um heimatlos zu werden. Henri Michaux writes: "Reisen, um heimatlos zu werden". The Austrian Josef Winkler has repeatedly traveled to Italy during the writing of his novels about his homeland, Carinthia, later to India and then to Mexico, carrying with him the stories of other authors, from which he uses short quotes as inlays in his poetological reportages: from journeys that bring him back to his own surprise with variations of a picture from childhood - a child lying by the roadside, already wrapped in packing paper, run over. Last in Klagenfurt, where during roadworks in preparation for the 2008 European Football Championship a child is run over and dies. Story by story, death by death, Winkler draws closer to his state of being homeless. Erzählung für Erzählung, Todesfall für Todesfall rückt Winkler seiner Heimatlosigkeit näher.

Mathematical Modeling with MATLAB® : a practical introduction ¤ Dass vorausschauende Prognosen durch mathematische Modelle gestützt werden, erfolgt in sehr unterschiedlichen Bereichen, sei es in der Wirtschaft, bei Wettervorhersagen, in der Kosmologie oder auch nur, um die optimale Flugbahn eines Balles zu bestimmen. Dazu muss eine mathematische Struktur gefunden werden, in der die Ausgangsgrößen und die bestimmenden Naturgesetze interpretiert werden können. Die Resultate mathematischer Prozesse müssen dann wieder in die Realität übersetzt werden. The text introduces the problem with a detailed case study and then deals with the topic generally and fundamentally. The numerical calculations use the routines and possibilities of the MATLAB program system, which is explained again in the appendix. The book is aimed at students in the bachelor's program, who, however, must have some mathematical knowledge, as deeper lying proofs are mostly only hinted at.

Biomass in the Tension Field between Energy and Climate Policy: Strategies for Sustainable Bioenergy Use: Position Paper ¤ Bioenergy is the most versatile energy carrier among the Renewables and supplies more energy than wind and water power, solar energy, and geothermal energy combined. A consistent bioenergy policy must ensure that bioenergy use has no negative social and ecological consequences and makes the maximum contribution to climate protection.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014715-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547705-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145596-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006877-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5>
Economic Promotion through the Promotion of Renewable Energies? : An Empirical Comparison of the Renewable Energy Act with Conventional Economic Promotion ¤ The use of renewable energy sources for power generation has increased dramatically in recent years. As a rule, however, such use is still not economical and is therefore cross-subsidised. In Germany this support is provided largely on the basis of the Renewable Energy Act. The focus of the present analysis is the extent to which the Act can also be regarded as a successful instrument of business promotion. To find an answer to this question, an investigation was carried out into the amount of additional private investment generated by public subsidies for the wind and photovoltaic power generation subsidised by the Act, on the one hand, and conventional regional business and research promotion, on the other. The results show that the wind farm sector scored rather better than the traditional instruments of business promotion, whereas the photovoltaic power industry performed much worse. When interpreting the results, however, account must be taken of some of the special features of the subsidies provided by the Act, such as a guaranteed market for 20 years at fixed prices.

Stairs, Staircases ¤ The accessibility of buildings represents a crucial aspect in the design and detailed planning. In addition to constructive aspects and building physical requirements, the formal, safety-relevant boundary conditions are to be noted in particular. In this context, the aspects of barrier-free building acquire special importance. The construction forms are presented in detailed sections - depending on the building material. The present volume is rounded off by a representation of the planning criteria for the installation of elevators and escalators.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129902-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185995-9>
Artificial Intelligence in Plain Language ¤ The author provides a didactically well-structured and concise introduction to the field of 'Artificial Intelligence' (AI), which is well-suited for refreshing basic knowledge - for example, in preparation for an exam. The book is roughly comparable to J. Hövel (BA 5/03), a journalistic treatment of the subject. Readers seeking a comprehensive representation with a formal/scientific approach should be referred to G. Görz (ID 46/00). The author relies on many examples and algorithms that can be implemented in different languages. Prior knowledge in Prolog, however, significantly facilitates working with the book. The author presents typical AI problems and AI technologies and also provides a glimpse of what can be achieved with AI in the future. Very interesting are 3 case studies for medical expert systems (MYCIN, Internist, and Pathfinder). Glossary of important technical terms, which also provides the English equivalent for each German term. Tasks - with solutions on the internet. Current bibliography.

Handbook for Testing Web Applications: Testing Procedures, Tools, Best Practices; with 26 Tables ¤ A web application can be accessed from anywhere on the internet. The users, their work behavior, and their internet knowledge are unknown. It is not predictable how many people will access a web site at what times. Any kind of error drives customers directly to the competitor. The technical possibilities of the WWW are changing permanently. These circumstances make the quality of a business-relevant web application a critical success factor for a company. This book describes the measures that ensure sufficient quality of a web application. It explains how quality is defined and measured. It explains the necessary testing procedures and their support by test software. It provides concrete working aids in the form of checklists. Testers and webmasters receive the tools for their tests. Test managers and project leaders know how to evaluate quality risks correctly and plan all necessary quality assurance measures in time.

Electromobility in Urban and Traffic Planning : Practical Experiences from Model Regions and Further Knowledge Needs ¤ The brochure is a component of the accompanying research on the topic of "Urban Development and Traffic Planning". It provides a systematic review of previous approaches and highlights the fields of action that are essential for anchoring electromobility at the municipal level. In addition to the concrete application fields of electric vehicles (electric economy traffic, municipal utility vehicles, public transportation vehicles, car sharing, bike sharing), the integration of this new drive technology into municipal mobility strategies and urban development and urban planning is also included. The focus of the investigation was explicitly on urban planning and municipal relevant aspects of the considered projects, even if they often pursued other or more comprehensive research focal points.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019956-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046235-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1042006857>
Final Report of the TaBuLa-LOG Project ¤ The TaBuLa-LOG project was based on the results of the previous project »Test center for automated buses in the district Duchy of Lauenburg« (TaBuLa) and added the component of goods transport to the functioning automated shuttle service. The further development of pure passenger transport towards a combination of passenger and goods mobility was tested in order to examine the previous, often singular concentration on separate systems against the background of resource bundling for automated means of transport. In more rural regions, the linking of passenger and goods mobility can make a contribution to sustainability of transport, where concentration on separate systems has so far not promised any success from an economic point of view.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7714938-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4304075-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1024622754> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022492-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164101-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043176-9>

Hello world! : Programming for Kids and Beginners ¤ The book is aimed at children who have already made some experience with the computer and use it for various things. Programming experience is not, however, assumed. The authors Sande - father and son (not shown here yet) - show the way to programming using the free Python language in a child-friendly formulation, with many illustrations and small comics. Starting with general information about the programming language, it quickly goes into detail and you learn to program simple games yourself. Numerous examples can be found at the end of each chapter, and there are quiz questions for self-testing and practice. The accompanying CD contains, in addition to the Python software, all example files from the book as well as many links to the most important websites around Python. A comprehensive index rounds off the whole. A still highly sought-after topic, for which not too many current titles can be found on the market. Therefore, broad recommendation alongside "Learn to Program for Children" and "Game-Programming for Kids". From 11	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4010457-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076370-5>
Empörung : Novel ¤ He is young, decent, and diligent, he rebels once, and he pays for it with his life. Marcus Messner begins his studies at the conservative College of Winesburg in Ohio in 1951. As the Korean War enters its second year, Marcus experiences a story that deals with inexperience, resistance, sex, courage, and error. Barely is he in college when he encounters a first, completely disturbing experience with a fragile young girl, and he encounters a form of discrimination that enrages him. Against his will, Marcus becomes a rebel, against his fellow students, but also against his father - and he remains stubborn until the bitter end.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4503339-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058167-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148217-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4031110-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123212-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032467-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4522377-4>
Office 2010 for Dummies : [also for Home and Student Edition ; at a glance: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Access expertly use ; stylish layout for documents and presentations ; edit tables, create formulas and analyze data ; configure e-mail accounts and create databases] ¤ In the popular "Dummies" series, two titles appear in parallel to the current Microsoft Office package: a comprehensive "all-in-one" volume by Peter Weverka (in this number) and the present introduction by Wang Wallace (last BA 1/05). Three target groups are addressed: switchers from Office 2007 get a quick overview of the new features, users of older versions such as Office 2003 or XP learn the transition to the menu bar-controlled user interface, and Office newcomers receive an introduction to the most commonly used and useful menus, functions, buttons, commands from Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, and Access. The individual programs cover both the "Home and Business Edition" and the "Home and Student Edition". Formulated in a relaxed and understandable way, with good examples for private or professional use, numerous step-by-step instructions, and informative screenshots. Recommended alongside the two almost identical introductory titles by G. Born (both BA 9/10) and the more affordable practical handbook by G. Philipp (BA 8/10).

MySQL 5 for Dummies : [relational databases with MySQL develop ; the database server MySQL - perfect data organization ; examples and installations for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X] ¤ The MySQL database system belongs to the community of open-source products and is therefore available for free. In the fall, the new version MySQL 5 was released and as a result, the author revised his work (BA 8/02) from the introduced Dummies series. The significant changes of the version change have only minor effects on this introductory work. The deviations are rather formal in nature. Clearly improved step-by-step instructions, e.g. when creating a table, in the chapter on ODBC and in web programming. Additional subheadings provide for greater clarity. Some chapters also provide additional information and in the installation section, only hints for Windows XP and Windows 2000 are now found. The software on the accompanying CD-ROM contains current versions of MySQL, Perl, and PHP as well as additional useful tools. For updating the inventory, in addition to Michael Kofler (BA 3/05) and Rolf Däßler (BA 11/05), it is again usable, but an exchange of the preface is not yet required.

Poverty in Prosperous Societies ¤ In 11 scientific contributions on the latest state of the art, renowned experts (including Butterwegge, Hradil, Huster, Opielka) express themselves on the changed forms of relative poverty, public reaction, evaluation, and increasing social polarization. They make well-founded statements on child and old-age poverty, health, and irresponsible precarious classifications. Approaches to self-help in life management have also been identified. A contribution deals with European developments and threats. With some background knowledge, the individual contributions - also as a repetition - are well understandable, especially a comprehensive overview has emerged with everything that is relevant for social developments and problem situations. With literature lists and abstracts. (2) Poverty research has long been a field of research on marginalized groups, but poverty has long become a central theme of social structure and inequality research. It seems that poverty is becoming more entrenched in our society. At the same time, salaries and bonuses in executive boards are rising, and the extremely unequal distribution of wealth, real estate, and productive assets is increasing. In addition, the labor market is deeply divided. Not all employees benefit from economic prosperity, the low-wage sector is growing further, precarious employment relationships are increasing. Exactly this development makes the question of social justice louder and is discussed by the authors with different focus. A readable book that takes up the controversial positions of the poverty discourse.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066741-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002963-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128337-5>
Statistics for Dummies : [well advised with the data; at a glance: bias, samples and probability explained in a comprehensible way; calculate with median, arithmetic mean and correlation; learn about graphical representation possibilities; with exercise tasks and online solutions] ¤ Typically, the author introduces interested readers to the 'secrets' or the basics of statistics. Review (ex): Introduced series. The preface of the book was not available for direct comparison. However, the changes seem not to be of a deeper kind, so the preface can be discontinued. Nevertheless, exercises and their solutions are now available online. In earlier editions, there was a separate exercise book. The author, who has published further titles in the Dummies series, conveys general knowledge of statistics, especially descriptive statistics, in a comprehensible way and with the help of many everyday examples. She shows how statistics can be read and interpreted correctly. Without higher mathematics, she cannot get by. Anyone who wants to use the book meaningfully should already have solid mathematical knowledge, e.g. know sum formulas and also understand probability calculation. The title is conceivable as a 1st introduction like Günter Buttler's textbook in many libraries. The author has also written a sequel, 'Statistics II for Dummies' or 'Advanced Statistics for Dummies'. (2 S)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151278-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056995-0>
Flooded Alongside Us : The Externalization Society and Its Price ¤ Who pays the price for our prosperity? Sociologist Stephan Lessenich on the social failure of our world order. We're doing well in the West because most people elsewhere are doing badly. We systematically outsource poverty and injustice, on a small and large scale. And we all repress our share in this practice. Renowned sociologist Stephan Lessenich offers a brilliant, politically explosive analysis of the dependency and exploitation relationships in the globalized economy. He illustrates the social failure of our world order, because not all benefit somehow from free markets. The truth is: when one wins, others lose. Each of us is a responsible actor in this zero-sum game, whose losers are now knocking on our doors	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4300539-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055736-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4557997-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117286-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003677-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153414-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066438-7>
Algorithmic Mathematics ¤ Based on a basic lecture, this work provides students of mathematics, preferably in the first semester, a compact introduction to algorithmic mathematics. Review (ekz): With the increasingly presence of high-performance computers, the importance of algorithmic mathematics is constantly increasing. It deals with the design and analysis as well as the implementation of algorithms and the development and investigation of the underlying mathematical structures. The present work, based on an introductory basic lecture, now provides students of mathematics, preferably in the first semester, a compact introduction to algorithmic mathematics. The presentation, accompanied by numerous examples and illustrations, conveys the content in a mathematically sound manner and provides a small introduction to the programming language C++, in which the implementation of numerous algorithms also takes place. Knowledge beyond school knowledge is not necessary. Nevertheless, basic competences in dealing with algorithms and first solid experiences with university mathematics significantly facilitate reading. Very useful for the target group to acquire basic knowledge in the field of algorithmic mathematics. No tasks. (3)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193909-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4042805-9>

Refugees in the Company : Practical Guide for a Successful Hiring and Integration ¤ Through the euphoria of the welcome culture in 2015, mainly driven by politics and business associations, the difficulties of integration were completely overlooked. Since the integration of refugees into the labor market promotes social integration, the topic is treated comprehensively from various angles: labor shortages, social fears regarding competition for jobs, the need to consider cultural peculiarities in personnel acquisition and selection, the influence of respective denominations, the experiences of interviewed company representatives, proven concepts, practical examples, labor law questions regarding the employment of refugees, with current research results, extensive bibliography, and also helpful links to public institutions. In this sense, the book is more of a structured collection of materials, but it has been missing alongside socially/socially/theologically oriented books.

Post-War Modernity in Germany: Thinking an Epoch Further ¤ The architecture and urban planning of post-war modernity are increasingly understood as a cultural heritage of a young past. The quality of individual buildings and plans from the decades after 1945 is strongly disputed. At the same time, their value as a historical monument is a central theme. In local and regional debates, planning strategies and new guidelines for an adequate and contemporary handling of the post-war modern urban spaces are discussed. - - In the book, Jürgen Tietz, Christian Welzbacher, and other selected actors from architecture, society, and politics present the central facts, aspects, and positions and convey the background of the confrontation. Numerous illustrations and plans illustrate and document the topic, including the example of Hanover	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056795-3>
Electronic correlation mapping : from finite to extended systems ¤ The knowledge about the movement of electrons in solids and their interactions with their environment allows statements to be made about magnetic and optical material properties. With this book, the first independent and comprehensive publication on the description and prediction of electron movements in solids is presented. Volume 1 introduces the theoretical background (Coulomb scattering, 3-particle and many-particle systems), in the second volume a selection of possible applications is presented (electrons in the crystal, scattering, quantum dots)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4016918-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210527-4>
Personal Firewalls : 10 Customized Workshops ¤ The "Personal " in the title is certainly unnecessary, as it's not about personal protection. Furthermore: the, the, or the firewall? Tobor uses "the", Microsoft uses "the" in Encarta, "the" in the computer dictionary, Brockhaus uses "the" and Bertelsmann uses "the" (maybe the FAZ uses "the"?). Anyway, the protection against external attacks on one's own PC through such a firewall is important and is well described here in 10 chapters ("workshops"). 3 of them deal with available programs: ZoneAlarm 3, Outpost 1 and Sygate Personal Firewall 5.1 (all free and delivered on a CD-ROM; in March 2004 Sygate 5.5 is current). The following chapters deal with general questions and solutions that affect firewalls, as well as not quite so expensive professional solutions, but the last chapter deals with variants of encryption, an appendix describes hacker programs (also on the CD-ROM) with which one can check vulnerabilities of one's own computer. - Well-written and thought-out work, which can avert some harm.

SQL Server 2017 : the quick introduction ¤ For the latest edition of his handbook on the database management system Microsoft SQL Server, Konopasek has carried out a comprehensive revision of the content (lastly "SQL Server 2014"). Although the subtitle speaks of an introduction work, it goes far beyond what is required. This book, which has now grown to over 1,000 pages (formerly 747 pages), is not only based on version 2017, but also takes into account the recently published version 2016. Numerous innovations and improvements have been incorporated, affecting both the core of SQL Server and the framework products (analysis, service, and reporting services). There is also now availability for the Linux operating system. An additional chapter is devoted to this topic. In order to emphasize the introductory feature, the proportion of grey-set-off hint and info boxes has increased significantly. Code examples and practice tips have also been added. Examples can be found on the internet. All black-and-white illustrations have also been updated. In addition to the predecessor, which can be phased out.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1158534051> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4343204-9>
Elementary Analysis : from Intuition to Theory ¤ Like many other methodically similar titles from the publisher, e.g. G. Wittmann: "Elementary Functions and their Applications" (BA 2/08) or S. Krauter: "Experience Elementary Geometry" (BA 2/06), this text introduces elementary differential and integral calculus by leading from initially only intuitively supported concepts to a theoretically founded version. It begins with examples of functions and considerations of slope and surface determination. Then, real numbers are defined as interval enclosures and with a precise limit concept, the first central areas of infinitesimal calculus are extensively discussed. Didactic considerations and historical information are variedly integrated. Frequent references to the Internet concern not only the solutions to the tasks. Recommended especially for active and prospective mathematics teachers, but also for interested upper-level students. (2 pages)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072798-1>
Paths to Technological Fascination: Socialization Trajectories and Intervention Time Points ¤ The empirically designed study is part of the interdisciplinary acatech consortium project „Monitoring of Motivation Concepts for Technological Youngsters (MoMoTech)”. It investigates conditions and prerequisites for developing and promoting technological interest in children and adolescents. The study assumes that there are phases and time points in the socialization process of children and adolescents that are significant for their (technological) socialization. Whether young people begin to be interested in technology depends on various factors that can be described as condition constellations. The study aims to collect and describe such constellations. The study collects three content complexes: skills and abilities required for understanding and dealing with technology, attitudes that influence the view of technology and dealing with it, and socialization factors that promote or hinder interest in technology (with a focus on school and family). With a view to potential intervention time points, it is investigated how relevant technical skills and attitudes change in the socialization process; special interest is given to gender specificity.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144815-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028859-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059205-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013943-8>

Charging Electric Vehicles in Germany with Renewable Energy Contracts ¤ Based on a survey, it is analyzed how high the share of Plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) users in Germany is who obtain renewable energy for charging through corresponding supply contracts and how this is to be evaluated. The evaluation has shown that for all charging locations - at home, at work, and public fast and slow charging columns - the share of renewable energy contracts is very high (>75%). Especially when charging at home, which is the most common charging location, the share of renewable energy contracts among PEV users (84%) is far above that in German households (30%). The various renewable energy contracts, however, differ significantly in their ecological requirements. The knowledge about this seems to be rather low among PEV users.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068598-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151795-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1023745712>
Introduction to Constraint Programming: Foundations, Methods, Languages, Applications ¤ Constraint programming provides methods for efficient modeling of systems or solving problem statements where only incomplete information is available (e.g. decision systems, optimization problems, analysis of stochastic processes), as well as solving combinatorial problems (resource management) or developing complex deduction systems. This textbook provides a compact introduction to constraint programming. In addition to general theoretical foundations, languages, methods, and procedures for modeling and solving constraint problems are presented, as well as their application areas are considered and illustrated with typical examples such as scheduling, finance, optimization, simulation, and diagnosis. The book is aimed at students of computer science in their main studies. It is based on a one-semester lecture with exercises by the authors.

Statistics : Introduction for Economists and Social Scientists ¤ A thorough introduction to the central concepts and methods of both descriptive and inferential statistics as well as the required areas of probability theory with many examples. (Wolfgang Grölz) A thorough introduction to the central concepts and methods of both descriptive and inferential statistics as well as the required areas of probability theory with many examples. Review (ekz): The text, based on a 2-semester course commonly used at German universities, is aimed at students of fields with corresponding application requirements, but the detailed and thoroughly designed book can be recommended for self-study and practice in general. As usual, the first section introduces elementary accessible descriptive statistics. The subsequent presentation of the required areas from probability theory then requires at least basic knowledge of analysis, although deeper results are only presented and not proven. The most important estimation and test methods of inductive statistics are learned in the final part. Many examples are inserted throughout, which illuminate and make the theoretical concepts and methods come alive. Some tables in the appendix can help readers with independent applications. However, hardly any hints at suitable software are given. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066528-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056995-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055916-6>
Semiconductor Components ¤ This textbook, which can be used in addition to lectures (at FHs and universities) or for self-study, contains the basics and applications of components in electronic circuit technology. Numerous examples and sample solutions, as well as extracts from data sheets of selected components on CD-ROM, serve as support. This is new compared to the otherwise more comprehensive previous edition "Electronic Components" by Reisch (ID 6/98), from which the present title is an excerpt. Due to the more favorable price, already for medium-sized libraries. There was otherwise nothing new on the subject in recent times. (2) (LK/W: Weinheimer-Hartmann)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113826-0>
Collection of Tasks for Manufacturing Technology : with detailed solution paths and formula collection ¤ Collection of tasks with calculated examples for important areas of manufacturing technology.

Eckstein presents in this book classical and modern methods of descriptive and inductive statistics, exploratory data analysis, and econometrics in a compact manner. Using the SPSS software package, statistical methods are demonstrated through practical and real-data-based problem statements and the results are interpreted logically.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4070313-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1090802595> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7849953-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4247120-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123623-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056588-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056995-0>
Sandcastles, Traffic Jams, and Soap Bubbles ¤ The physicist Morsch offers in this volume of the (often) alliterative series (e.g. J. Emsley: "Perfume, Port, PVC ...," BA 4/98) a highly current and very stimulating overview of older and above all new research on granular matter. With computer simulations, one can not only investigate the properties of dry and wet sand, but also of foams - whether it be soap or beer foam - can be explored. That one can also simulate the behavior of crowds of people will surprise many. There are then also indications for avoiding mass panics and traffic jams. The author describes the wealth of results that also often recognize the self-organization of the considered systems. Morsch omits the technical details of the simulations. This increases the readability of this well-written non-fiction book. A comprehensive bibliography of mostly English and French literature can quench lasting thirst for knowledge. - Special recommendation for this highly interesting work!

Das Lexikon der PC-Fachbegriffe mit richtiger Aussprache : [all important computer terms and abbreviations specifically for PC beginners and seniors; new: terms for Windows 7 and blog language] ¤ In readable font, this PC dictionary lists 6,000 current technical terms from the computer environment. (LK/HB: Isigkeit) Updated edition of a PC dictionary that focuses primarily on desktop PCs and laptops. The 6-year-old prequel (BA 12/04) is outdated and should be deleted. For the 6,000-entry work, a larger font was provided to improve readability, and in addition, the English terms received a phonetic notation. Certainly a concession to the newly named target group of seniors. In addition to these formal improvements, numerous new technical terms have been introduced, including those from the environment of Windows 7 and blog language. The inconsistency in the selection noted in the prequel is also noticeable in this edition. The appendix provides, in addition to a list of file extensions, a table of top-level domains and a reference called Netlingo with commonly used abbreviations, which appear repeatedly in the blog, chat, news, and forensic scenes.

Food Process Engineering: Raw Materials, Processes, Products ¤ Publisher's text: Many food products must be processed in order to be palatable or to meet the sensory requirements of consumers. This book explains both the raw materials and their constituents as well as the process technology required to produce high-quality products from them. The aspects of healthy nutrition and Novel Food are also taken into account. It assumes basic knowledge in chemistry and process engineering and covers food science and process engineering, as it is offered as a lecture for engineers, business engineers, and food chemists as a main or secondary subject.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4167046-2>
Britain : Geographies of a European Neighbour ¤ A multitude of German and English scholars have taken on the topic of 'Grossbritannien' and scrutinized the island state from various aspects. The authors highlight the peculiarities of the United Kingdom in comparison to Continental Europe, but also point out the similarities. Topics include, among others, the multiculturalism of Grossbritannien, the decline of industry, the emerging service sector, and the transformation of British consumer society. This geographical 'read-and-learn book' is largely readable. Particularly interesting is the topic of British supermarkets and their impact on retail businesses in the high streets of villages and cities. The book is suitable for both students and upper-level students. Here, in a manageable scope, is compiled what one would have to painstakingly gather from the internet. The price is quite high. Suitable next to Stefan Schieren (BA 5/10). (2 S)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020216-1>
Basic Course in Function Theory: An Introduction to Complex Analysis and its Applications; [for Bachelor and Diploma] ¤ Hardly any of the standard lectures at German-speaking universities has remained unchanged in its core for many years like the one on complex analysis, which was clearly shown by the recently published new edition of a nearly 100-year-old lecture notes (H. Weyl: "Introduction to Function Theory", ID 50/08). Of course, the beginnings are now more thoroughly founded, and new application areas have been added. This volume is also characterized by its subtle treatment of algebraic and topological foundations, as well as by the many cross-references shown at the end of each section. However, the central theme remains the study of holomorphic and meromorphic functions with the instrumentarium built on the Cauchy's integral theorem. A substantial final chapter deals with the geometric environment of the Riemann's mapping theorem. Various problems without solutions are inserted. Highly recommended from 2nd year of study.

Opening up the residential quarter for the elderly: Development of a communicative information infrastructure to bridge structural gaps in the social space ¤ In focus are older people who live a reclusive private life, are little involved in local networks and have not been reached by information and offers from care providers for the elderly so far. For these people, the idea of a 'communicative information infrastructure' in the social space of the residential quarter and district was developed. With the infrastructure model, it should be avoided that such people fall into emergency situations unnoticed, but also ensured that they are continuously informed about opportunities for successful management of their life situation. The book describes the developed model and the experiences with its practical implementation. The model shows perspectives for social planning that can effectively mediate between private life management in old age and public care provision of the elderly care. Retired older people are supported from their local environment to inform themselves comprehensively and to realize opportunities for co-designing offers according to their needs.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066749-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117672-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141482-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134681-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001413-7>
Acoustic Phenomena ¤ Publisher's text: This book clearly shows that acoustics can be a very exciting field within physics. Its concern is to make acoustics more realistic and to enable active participation of students. Starting from an exemplary analysis and explanation of sounds and noises from nature and technology, they can record and investigate interesting sounds for themselves. Whether animal sounds, their own voice, musical instruments or the dentist's drill - the interdisciplinarity required by lesson plans can be successfully implemented with this book. Everyday, typical, but also curious sounds and noises are presented, analyzed and explained. In this sense, the book can also be seen as an encyclopedia, in which one can specifically search for information on a particular topic.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000988-9>
Drawing and designing with Windows 10 and Paint 3D: the digital drawing school for everyone ¤ Software for digital image processing does not have to be complicated or expensive. The formerly discredited "Paint" is now included as a new "Paint 3D" in all Windows 10 versions, is relatively easy to use, and significantly more powerful than its predecessor. This title on Paint 3D starts with a brief chapter on design basics, then deals with typical tasks (importing images into the PC, designing cards and posters, image presentation), and ends with a chapter on printers and printing images. The explanations are limited to the essentials, but are sufficiently detailed. The selection of topics, structure, and depth of explanations are geared towards a quick "problem-solving" and clearly aimed at occasional users without relevant prior knowledge. Good: All chapters are color-coded, the font is slightly enlarged, and all images are high-quality color printed. Conclusion: a well-balanced, easily usable title for software that many users already have on their PC and is sufficient for many tasks.

Neural Networks: Fundamentals: with Example Programs in Java ¤ Neural networks are computer simulations of the brain that are used to make decisions that a human should make, but where a human is too slow or too expensive. This book introduces neural networks; only knowledge of school mathematics is assumed of the reader. It is thus comparable to T. Rashid, but the example programs are implemented in Python there, not in Java as here. As a methodical introduction at the university level, reference is made to "Computational intelligence". The author begins with the early days of neural networks (Hebb's formula, Perceptron, Hopfield network and then comes over the basics of a bidirectional associative memory to the current backpropagation network. Subsequently, he presents application examples (of particular interest here is probably the support of the purchase decision for a PC) and provides hints for programming. The examples (code download from the Internet) show very well on the reader's own PC how neural networks react to different demands	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4401313-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4226127-2>
Mathematics for Life Scientists: Foundations with a Focus on Statistics for the Bachelor ¤ Introduction to mathematics and statistics for the bachelor's and teacher training studies with a focus on biology. Review (ekz): To describe observations and processes in biology quantitatively, the statistical and analytical methods of mathematics are used. Adolf Riede has updated his introductory textbook from 1993 (not shown here) after years of university experience and presents the 2nd edition. More than half of the book is dedicated to statistics. Elements of differential and integral calculus are embedded, which include a repetition of the secondary school material from level II. Despite the step-by-step and example-guided presentation form, the mathematical tone remains. This makes the book particularly relevant, even if elementary, theoretical concepts are of interest, such as in teacher training studies with natural science subject combinations. It can also be used for the biological bachelor. Titles with a stronger practical focus (e.g. "Biostatistics", ID-G 49/12) or with a focus on evaluation software ("Parametric Statistics", can not be replaced in this way.

Sustainable Settlement Ecosystems: Planning, Implementation, and Operation; a User Handbook ¤ The current human population and its activities have a tremendous impact on the planetary ecosystem, e.g. on climate change and biodiversity. Rural and especially urban settlements play a major role in this. The rapid urbanization continues unabated. More than half of humanity already lives in cities. How can these be sustainably designed? This handbook aims to make a contribution to this. The authors treat settlements in a comprehensive sense as ecosystems. These should function according to the model of mature natural ecosystems and are therefore planned in such a way that both the symbiosis of the two subsystems (technical-cultural and natural) of the settlement with each other and with the higher-level systems is possible. To this end, a comprehensive information and quality management is also used, which deepens and expands the usual process control and participation in planning. All this can support users and those affected in planning and designing sustainable settlement ecosystems. The handbook pursues and conveys a holistic and integrative approach that encompasses fields such as architecture and urban planning, landscape architecture and green planning, environmental protection, life and social sciences, ecology, management, etc. It deals with topics such as energy saving, cycles and reuse, renewable raw materials, land use and traffic, socio-cultural framework conditions, real participation, holistic information, material and quality management. The authors explain the overall concept, the steps of implementation and provide tools for the user. The information, recommendations and tools are directed at the following groups, among others: - local authorities (guidelines for procedure and participants) - planners, engineers (holistic approach, procedures, tools) - licensing authorities, financing institutions (requirements for procedure and procedure) - implementing companies and organizations (recommendations, working materials) - operators (guidelines for operation, checklists) The experiences are based, among other things, on a joint German-Ghanaian program at the Valley View University (VVU), the largest private university in Ghana, which serves as an example of how the vision of a comprehensive ecological university and its campus is implementable.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026152-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5>
Windows XP Home Tricks : compact, complete, competent ¤ The author has already published a collection of tuning tricks for Windows XP Home Edition some time ago (BA 5/03). The present volume of the Magnum series goes beyond this earlier collection of tips and sets other priorities. Almost half of the book is devoted to security issues. The reader will find extensive hints on how to proceed in case of a system crash and how a system crash can be avoided as far as possible. A smaller part of the book deals with tuning questions. Finally, it is about adapting Windows XP Home Edition to individual user needs and additional software that makes the computer easier to use. The book is also suitable for readers without extensive knowledge, as e.g. registry hacks are largely avoided. Microsoft tools are in the foreground; but also third-party providers (mostly freeware) are considered. The author's hints on realizing features that are only available in the Professional Edition, but also under the Home Edition, are also very helpful. (1)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4658152-2>
No Fear of Linux, Unix: A Textbook for Linux and Unix Users ¤ After an 11-year hiatus, a classic of UNIX literature is being re-released in a thoroughly revised form due to ongoing demand. The fact that Linux is now mentioned before UNIX in the title reflects the development that the related operating systems have undergone in the meantime. Compared to the 10th edition (BA 8/02; now replaced), a significant amount of updating was necessary, and a first introduction to system administration is now offered. In total, the scope has increased by about 50 pages. In essence, the introduction is designed as a basic and advanced course in computer science studies, but it is also very suitable as a first introduction for interested Linux users of all kinds who want to not only learn the basics of configuration and application, but also the various possibilities of shell programming or graphical user interfaces. The clear structure and good didactic design with summaries, tabular overviews, and examples have been retained.

Handbook of Measures, Numbers, Weights, and Timekeeping: With 99 Tables ¤ Compact reference work on measuring and various measures in history and present. It begins with a very interesting overview of the process of measuring and the used measurement systems (about 1/4 of the book) and then presents the widely used International System of Units SI in detail (with examples and tables). It follows a chapter on numbers and number systems and one on the control of measures and measuring (metrology), a comprehensive collection of old units (sorted by epochs and regions or countries), tables on material properties (chemical elements and compounds) and on standardized measures (e.g. paper formats, clothing sizes). Finally, a timeline of metrology and a bibliography. Compared to the licensed edition of 1996 (Bechtermünz; BA 8/97) only very slightly changed. Still highly recommended and very reasonably priced.

Ah, so that's it! : Fifty thermofluid-dynamic everyday phenomena explained fundamentally and scientifically ¤ Thermofluid mechanics is an interface for the known physical fields of thermodynamics and fluid mechanics as well as their technical applications. The author, a professor for this cross-sectional area at the TU Hamburg-Harburg and known through several relevant textbooks (e.g. "Technical Thermodynamics", BA 8/07), presents 50 everyday phenomena (e.g. about the dripping of the tea or coffee pot) that are grouped into 4 topics ("House and Garden", "Food and Beverages" ...) , explained in an illustrative way, supplemented by further considerations and illustrated by images and tables. The book is aimed at students, experts and technically interested laypeople and offers a comprehensible course of study that - at least in the further considerations - requires concentrated thinking and physical prior knowledge. In the appendix a glossary of physical technical terms. Without index. Recommended, widely applicable supplement to relevant textbook literature, e.g. to W. Bohl (ID-B 24/14), D.

River Landscapes : Interrelations between Regional Cultural Landscape Design, Preventive Flood Protection and Low Water Management ; a Project of the Research Programme "Model Project of Spatial Planning (MORO)" of the Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development (BMVBS), managed by the Federal Institute for Building, Urban and Spatial Research (BBSR) in the Federal Office for Building and Spatial Planning (BBR) ¤ The present publication deals with the consideration of interrelations between preventive flood protection and regional cultural landscape design in river landscapes. The focus is here on a social and political science perspective. So laws, planning documents and informal documents are analyzed, to what extent relationships between flood protection and low water management and cultural landscape design exist. Furthermore, it is investigated whether synergy potentials exist and to what extent these gain importance in the course of a climate adaptation policy. Exemplarily, the increasing linking of various policy fields is investigated in four regional case studies: the urban-shaped Emscher region, the tourism region of Franconian Lake District, the city region of Cologne/Bonn with the Regional 2010 and the Havel region as the venue of the BUGA 2015.[...] (Source: Publisher)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4025290-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033573-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132857-7>
Introduction to Mathematical Work ¤ Revised edition of a methodical and content-related introduction to abstract mathematical thinking and working. Review University mathematics differs massively methodically and in terms of content from school mathematics. This induces significant problems at the beginning of the mathematics study. The proven and in a 3rd, revised edition (1st edition: 2009) available introduction to mathematical work originates from the teaching practice of an introductory phase of study. It provides, taking into account the problematic initial situation, preferably first-year mathematics students with a competent methodical and content-related introduction to abstract mathematical thinking and working and conveys, in addition to central basic techniques, conventions, and knowledge for the representation of mathematical facts, also some contents of the 1st study section. With numerous examples and tasks. Very helpful for a successful university entry. References to explanatory videos round off the 3rd edition.

Wood Chips from Short Rotation Crops: Fuel Quality and Combustion Behavior ¤ The fuel quality of wood chips from short rotation crops (KUP) often differs from that of forest wood chips. Notably - in addition to a typically higher water content for KUP - there is a high content of combustion-critical substances, particularly nitrogen, cadmium, zinc, and aerosol-forming elements. Fresh KUP wood chips can be expected to produce higher emissions of CO, NOX, and total dust during combustion in small furnaces. Report 56 of the TFZ includes results on the fuel quality and combustion behavior of KUP wood chips from two projects supported by the Bavarian State Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Forestry. The analyses were carried out by the Technology and Promotion Center (TFZ) and the Bavarian State Institute for Forestry and Forest Management (LWF). The focus of the work was, inter alia, on the influence of tree species, rotation time, processing, or location. Combustion tests were carried out in both a commercially available small furnace (50 kW) and the 1.3 MW heating plant of the TFZ.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008186-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179311-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4306823-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4507769-1>
Beggars and Vagabonds in Modern Times (1500-1933) : a commented source edition ¤ Alms-collecting and wandering poor were considered a grave problem by the European elite at least since the onset of modern times. They disrupted good police order, violated work morals, and even appeared as a threat to public safety. This edition brings together 257 documents from the German area, which reflect the social handling of beggars, vagabonds, gypsies, and rascals during the nearly four centuries between 1500 and 1933. They show astonishing continuities in the perception of these groups, but also transformations in their composition as well as in the way they were described, explained, and disciplined. Above all, they illustrate the persistent relevance of the phenomenon across all historical turning points. Again and again, up to the Great Depression of the 1930s, contemporary comments spoke of a threatening proliferation of begging and vagabondage. By documenting not only norms and abstract discourses, but also placing a strong emphasis on social practice and media representations, the volume highlights the ambivalences in social reactions: In everyday life, different interpretations of begging and wandering poverty were always possible, and the boundaries between repression and tolerance remained fluid	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145087-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112701-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076308-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057561-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002963-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166660-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145090-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4257314-2>
So funktioniert the Railway Locomotive Depot ¤ In BA 8/99 the book "The Steam Locomotive in the Railway Locomotive Depot" and in BA 12/01 the title "Diesel- and Electric Loks in the Railway Locomotive Depot" (both written by M. U. Kratzsch-Leichsenring) were recommended for purchase. If these two books are available and not yet worn out, they can be used further. Transpress has incorporated the new volume into its "So funktioniert ..." series (so far: D. Endisch: "So funktioniert the Steam Locomotive", BA 4/04; S. Alkofer: "So funktioniert the Diesel Locomotive", BA 8/05 and E. Preuß: "How Railway Signaling Systems Work", BA 1/06), but offers little new compared to the two comparison volumes. Some sections are even based on the older books, with steam locomotives dominating the content. Not even the facilities of train depots, which differ significantly from those for locomotives, for example in S-Bahn or ICE trains, are addressed. Therefore, the book is only recommended if the books mentioned at the beginning are not in stock or replacement purchases are necessary. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014027-1>

Strategies of State and Regional Planning for Coping with Demographic Change: A Project of the Research Programme "General Departmental Research" of the Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development (BMVBS) and the Federal Office for Building and Regional Planning (BBR) ¤ In the end, the effects of demographic change play a special role in most federal states in the preparation, revision or reorientation of the spatial development plans. The intensity of dealing with demographic change and the orientation of the strategies and instruments of state planning on the consequences reflect the pressure to act in the countries. The states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, Saxony and Saarland, as well as in partial regions of Rhineland-Palatinate and Lower Saxony, have newly set up or are in the process of setting up their state development plans/programs, all with the explicit goal of reacting to the consequences of demographic change in the form of population decline and aging.[...] (Source: BBR)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034268-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049040-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006292-2>

The Universe and I: The Philosophy of Astrophysics ¤ A learned and fascinating philosophical journey into the world of astrophysics and a love letter to the exploration of the universe. Astrophysicists know a lot: that the universe consists of 26 percent dark matter and that the black hole at the center of the galaxy M87 weighs as much as 6.6 billion suns. But how do they actually come to this knowledge? Could the universe in truth not look quite different? The philosopher and astrophysicist Sibylle Anderl tells captivatingly about the work of astronomers who conclude from smallest indicators such as the light spectrum or the movement of stars what planets consist of and what mass black holes possess. Her book is a love letter to the exploration of the universe. And a fascinating philosophical journey to the limits of our knowledge. „Sibylle Anderl has studied philosophy and physics and currently works as an editor for the science section of the FAZ. The book – her first – is aimed at scientifically interested readers who are willing to question the common observations and theories... A rather personal book has emerged. This is already shown by the chosen first-person form and the self-drawn cartoons (as the only illustrations). Scattered throughout are scenes of a phone call with the father, in which it is about black holes, their observations in Chile and many fundamental questions of astronomy. The father represents the readers with their many questions – an interesting concept. The text is fluid and easily understandable“ (spektrum.de)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003326-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4189606-3>
Photoshop CS3 for Dummies : [everything about pixels, paths, and palettes] ¤ New edition of Peter Bauer's Photoshop introduction to the current version CS3 of the widely used image editing software (previous edition: BA 2/06). The structure is largely the same as the previous edition, with additional chapters on the Extended version and the use of a graphics tablet. The differences to CS2 are not explicitly addressed. As usual with titles in the Dummies series, the explanations are well understandable (no "jargon") and written in a relaxed style. The functions that the average user most often needs are explained, and technical backgrounds are omitted. The target group are beginners with some basic knowledge of digital image editing - but also somewhat advanced users will certainly benefit from the many tips and tricks. A successful introduction title, still highly recommended. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7574913-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4763160-0>

Lenin's Train : The Journey to the Revolution ¤ The author describes one of the most consequential train journeys in world history, the legendary journey of Lenin with some companions from Zurich to Petrograd. She reconstructs the journey with filigree and corrects many errors in the previous literature, including the route. Review: We follow the author (lastly 2014) on one of the most consequential train journeys in world history, Lenin's journey with some companions from Zurich over Germany to Petrograd. It was a world war and so a tour was difficult to organize. All sorts of strings had to be pulled, visas and stamps had to be prepared punctually and the financing had to be clarified. The English historian reconstructs the journey with filigree and corrects many errors in the previous literature, including the route. She describes the intermediate stations of the train journey and repeatedly brings the revolutionary events, which Lenin is heading towards, to the forefront as a framework action. Thus, a kind of historical travel guide to the way to the October Revolution has arisen. German politicians and officers hoped that the revolutionary would overthrow the Tsar and get Russia out of the war. So both sides could agree on the conspiratorial 'journey in the sealed carriage'. In the last chapter, the tragic fate of Lenin's companions is depicted. Bibliography, illustrations and index.

Objektorientierte Programmierung mit Python 3 : Einstieg, Praxis, professionelle Anwendung ; [Klassen, Objekte und Vererbung praktisch angewendet ; Datenbanken, grafische Benutzungsoberflächen und Internet-Programmierung ; Übungen mit Musterlösungen zu jedem Kapitel] ¤ The freely usable object-oriented language Python is no longer downward compatible with earlier versions from version 3 (currently version 3.1 is treated) and has numerous innovations. Therefore, the last shown preface to version 2.4 (BA 7/05) had to be completely revised and updated. As a result, and due to the inclusion of two new chapters (on XML and special data structures), the scope has increased by 130 pages. The focus remains on practical work with Python, less on concepts of object-oriented programming. Beginners with limited prior knowledge are addressed. Numerous exercises, pattern solutions, and source code examples on the useful supplement CD-ROM increase the usability. A more concise introduction to Python 3 is offered by T. Theis (BA 7/09), similar in scope and level is J. Ernesti (BA 11/09). The preface and other Python titles for version 2 should soon be out of print.

Astrophysics: An Introduction to Theory and Fundamentals ¤ Karl-Heinz Spatschek, Professor of theoretical physics, has revised his 2003 first published university textbook (ID-G 7/04) and published it in an extended form (double page count, which also nearly doubles the price) anew. In addition, a 100-page "Introduction to General Relativity" and an equally long "Introduction to Cosmology" have been added. In the most comprehensive 1st part, fundamental aspects of modern astrophysics, such as gravitational collapse, thermonuclear fusion, and star models, are in the foreground. With numerous z.T. colored illustrations, literature references, and a glossary in the appendix. Although astrophysics is a small field of study that is only taught at a few universities, the book can also be of interest to university libraries that offer the physics program (Bachelor). Suitable alongside titles such as those by Alfred Weigert (ID-G 52/09) and Arnold Hanslmeier (last ID-G 50/07).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4003326-0>

Introduction to Python ¤ From the well-known and productive author, an updated and revised edition of his introduction to the platform-independent programming language Python is available. The differences compared to the predecessor are quite modest. Now, no deviations between the underlying version 3.6 and Python 2 are mentioned in each section. Misunderstandable formulations have been corrected, occasional minor additions have been made, and the typography has been improved, but for the most part, the content comes from the previous edition. Only in the last chapter, where it's about the interaction with the Raspberry PI (Python is available on every device as the primary language), there are clearer changes. In addition to considering the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, Theis omits 3 example programs and offers a new one instead (fan control). Furthermore, a well-suited introductory work, primarily for initial acquisition and as a replacement for worn-out editions. Before the more comprehensive M.

Spatial Planning Coordination in Eastern Bavaria's Border Region: Legal and Practical Perspectives ¤ The ordering and development of connected spaces across existing but increasingly permeable borders in the EU area pose great challenges for regional and state planning. This is particularly true for EU expansion. The border obstacles are overcome in an integrative approach by coordinating national and regional approaches across disciplinary boundaries. In this context, material and procedural regulations on both sides of the border must be established, which also follow the specifications of EU law. The legal forms of transnational coordination of spatial planning are presented in their current state, their previous proven track record, and their future prospects. National and regional spatial planning in the European context (Council of Europe and EUREK) is also addressed. Two maps illustrate institutionalized transnational and multilateral cooperation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4021993-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048590-0>

As therapy remains only to spin the missing autobiographical thread anew.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049275-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078868-4>

Tourism Architecture Basics ¤ Where the next holiday goes, depends not only on the climate, the landscape and the service in the hotel, but also on the architecture on site. Besides the picturesque old town, the experiential architecture of hotels, museums and shopping malls is primarily in the focus. The book sketches architecture as an economic factor in tourism and addresses the tension between destination management and architecture. The staging and artificial experience worlds, such as in leisure parks, are also taken into account. Urban planning opportunities and risks are also highlighted. Interviews with a hotel manager, an architect of a hotel and a tourism manager convey the practical perspective to the reader.(Publisher's text)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018406-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047704-6>

Guide to Optical 3D Metrology ¤ The "Guide to Optical 3D Metrology" provides an overview of optical 3D metrology. Initially, typical procedures and methods, such as stripe projection, light cutting or white light interferometry, are presented. Subsequently, the practical application spectrum of optical 3D metrology, particularly in quality assurance in production, is described, taking into account standards and guidelines. Knowledge and expertise about application possibilities, performance, and limitations of modern measurement and testing technology with image processing are an essential prerequisite for the successful use of these systems and technologies in industrial production and quality assurance. The Guide Series of the Fraunhofer Business Area Vision aims to make a contribution to this. A volume appears annually on a relevant complex of topics from the field of image processing, in which the current state of the art is presented in a generally understandable and illustrative manner. Potential users are thus facilitated to gain their first entry into the topic. The "Guide to Optical 3D Metrology" is now published as an updated and expanded new edition. Procedures and methods such as stripe projection, light cutting or white light interferometry are dealt with, and hints are given to software and algorithmics. Subsequently, typical fields of application and use of optical 3D metrology are presented, particularly for quality assurance in production. An overview of standards and guidelines rounds off the guide.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4172667-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4321722-9>
The Me-Senders : the Social Media Principle ; Twitter, Facebook & Communities successfully apply ¤ The Me-Senders - they tweet, blog, and present to a million-strong audience details from their lives. Social Media are as self-evident to the Upload Generation as breathing air - but what about companies? The commercial use of Facebook, Twitter, XING, and Co. for targeted marketing, group communication, or PR is still not a reality for many companies. Communications expert Wolfgang Hünnekens shows in his new e-book how the Web 2.0 with its communication forms offers possibilities. Having outgrown their baby shoes, social media are developing into a serious, serious form of communication. This e-book shows, by means of many examples, what potential these new media offer. Whether social media experts or newcomers who intend to get into the subject, they all find in this e-book many new aspects for the targeted use of social media.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061963-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120697-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7550143-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117714-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7660487-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7679337-0>
The impact of digitisation and big data analysis on the sustainable development of tourism and its environmental impact : final report ¤ The impact of digitisation on sustainable tourism development in its environmental and social dimensions will be investigated. In a first step, current developments in the digitisation are systematically identified and their current and future contribution to sustainable tourism devel-opment is examined. In doing so, both the digitialisation on the part of the customers (tourists) and the providers is taken into account, with an emphasis on Big Data-Analyses. The focus is on the use of digital applications during the trip, while the attention will not be on travel prepara-tion or follow-up.In a second step, the opportunities and risks arising from the analysis are identified and evaluat-ed. Special consideration is given to the behaviour of different user groups with influences on resource use, environment and climate. The aim is to analyse possible environmental damage as well as opportunities forclimate, resource and environmental protection and social sustainabil-ity aspects (e. g.avoidance of overtourism).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123065-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018406-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061619-8>

What is Art Nouveau? : An Analysis of Art Nouveau Architecture; 1890 - 1910 ¤ All too quickly today, any more elaborately decorated facade of the turn of the century is referred to as Art Nouveau. However, the special stylistic features and characteristics of this short architectural fashion around 1900 are rarely taken into account. - - Stefanie Lieb therefore describes in the first, systematic part of her book the general conditions and characteristics of Art Nouveau architecture and explains its history of origin as well as its interactions with handicraft and design. In the second part, she presents the high points of European Art Nouveau and their most striking buildings. The Glasgow School, the Vienna Secession, and Parisian Art Nouveau, Brussels by Victor Horta and Barcelona by Antoni Gaudí are equally impressive through their variety of forms and richness of fantasy	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028939-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072819-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138356-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>
AJAX : History, Technology, Future ¤ The idea behind the "Computer Science in Focus" series, from which this title also originates, is not a bad one: New technologies should be viewed from a "bird's eye view" to convey to the reader as quickly as possible what it's all about. Details to know or to be able to apply the technologies in practice is explicitly not the goal. The implementation, however, is at least with this title on AJAX not really convincing. That on 170 pages the various AJAX technologies such as JavaScript, DOM or XML cannot be discussed in detail, is clear. So the authors would have been well advised to concentrate even more strongly on analysis and evaluation than to hold back with code listings and overview tables that must remain arbitrary and are rather unnecessary in a book of this type. For a critical evaluation of AJAX, the chances for the future, and the sustainability of the technological approach, which would be of interest to decision-makers, it is then lacking in substance.

Evaluation of Internet Subject Gateways : (EJECT) ¤ The scope and heterogeneity of the information offer require always differentiated methods and tools for the targeted and as possible ballast-free finding of information sources in the context of a specific field of study or a scientific discipline. In order to achieve this goal, a series of so-called subject gateways have been developed in recent times. So far, neither many investigations on the quality of such tools are available nor has a differentiated methodology for such evaluations been developed. The EJECT project (Evaluation of Internet Subject Gateways) therefore pursued the following goals:1) through analysis of already realized subject gateways to show the versatility of the term and to contribute to a clarification of the term formation;2) to show a methodical way to qualitative evaluation of subject gateways;The results of the evaluation are presented in detail in this study and it is shown to what extent a transfer to the evaluation of other gateways is possible.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4634625-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071034-8>

Bioeconomy for Beginners ¤ It is likely to be the first book in the German-speaking region that can be considered a comprehensive guide for entering the bioeconomy. Bioeconomy - this is connected with nothing less than the long-term survival of humanity on this earth. It's about the transition from the age of fossil raw materials to a world economy based on renewable resources. The scientific, ideology-free, and understandable discussion of the natural scientific, economic, and ecological challenges and backgrounds is presented. The numerous authors discuss the questions of biomass and its use, biotechnology and innovation, circular economy and sustainability in the 10 chapters and also discuss problems of economic and consumption growth. The abundance of information makes the reading exciting and interesting, numerous illustrations clarify the relationships.

Chemical Delicacies ¤ Not boring - chemistry is exciting, clever, extremely useful and by no means incomprehensible, as Klaus Roth shows us in an entertaining way. One could almost suspect that chemistry goes through the stomach? Chemical processes give crusty bread its fragrant crust and without the chemical exchange between egg yolk, oil and water, a three-star chef's entire refinement is useless, if he wants to create heavenly mayonnaise or hollandaise sauce. Even the Sunday morning egg only succeeds with a portion of chemistry. And it makes champagne tingle on our tongues, but also blesses us with a hangover after excessive indulgence. Chemistry also protects us from deadly diseases like scurvy - honor to the discoverer of vitamin C! Chemistry increases our quality of life in many areas that we do not associate with this natural science at first glance. Enjoy the beautiful sound of music from our CD player or watch a funny video on DVD, we actually owe that to chemistry. What do you think? Does chemistry also have its hands in the game when it comes to the unparalleled sound of a rare Stradivari? Interesting, treasures, from serious to absurd, presented by Klaus Roth in a wonderfully understandable and humorous way - read and enjoy! The original articles on the importance of chemistry in everyday life by Klaus Roth, Professor of Chemistry at the Free University of Berlin, have been known and appreciated by readers of Chemistry in Our Time and Chemical Delicacies for years. For these publications, he was awarded the Writer's Prize of the German Chemical Society in 2008. Furthermore, Klaus Roth convincingly shows in numerous lectures that chemistry is a fascinating science that can not only be studied dryly, but also enjoyed with great pleasure.

Artificial Intelligence ¤ Excerpt from the contents: "Jerry Kaplan discusses in this book the most important social, legal, and economic aspects for the current and future significance of Artificial Intelligence. In doing so, he deals with fundamental questions such as: Will machines one day be smarter than humans? How will learning, flexible robots affect the job market? Can one hold a machine accountable for its actions? The author makes it clear how progress in terms of the intellectual and physical capabilities of machines will fundamentally change our society. In doing so, he shows that this continuous development of machines will play an increasingly important role and will be inseparably connected with many areas of our daily lives."

Measure and Integral ¤ This textbook is a compact and lecture-tested introduction to the theory of measure and integration for mathematics students after the introductory lectures. The concentrated presentation provides a consistent and transparent system of the most important results, also for readers who need the theory as a basis for other areas and therefore require a concise compilation of the central facts. The presentation is focused on the bachelor's degree program, in which the theory of measure and integration is increasingly considered a compulsory event in the study plans. The work is well suited for conveying the basics, but cannot replace more comprehensive works such as those by Heinz Bauer (last ID 19/91) or Jürgen Elstrodt (last ID 15/03).

SAP - the Technical Introduction ¤ The SAP world is large and difficult to overview for beginners. Anyone who wants to succeed as a technical expert in this field needs a broad and systematically built introduction to the architecture of this leading platform for Business-IT. This title offers this introduction to the future consultant, administrator, or developer. It helps to understand, use, and adapt the various products, modules, application, and configuration scenarios. This title is not suitable for clerks and users of SAP modules in operation. However, those who possess technical basic knowledge are offered the opportunity to master the whole world of this complex and powerful software from the basics (SAP modules and architecture layers, tenants, roles, and authorizations) through configuration and customization (HANA, database connection, workflows, and processes) to self-developments and evaluations (objects, warehouse, reporting, APIs).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4841146-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/104188639X> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4801683-4>
Python for Dummies ¤ The Python programming language has a clear, easy-to-learn code and can be used on various platforms, which is why it belongs to the most popular languages. It serves as a scripting language for applications such as Gimp or Scribus and also for the Raspberry Pi. The author quickly gets to the point and explains how beginners and those switching can write their first Python programs with the free distribution "Anaconda" and the development environment "Jupyter Notebook". After the introduction of the basics, everyday examples follow, before more challenging tasks such as saving data in files are addressed. The previous edition was based on Python 3.4.2, the current one on 3.6.3; in the meantime, there is 3.7.1, but this does not limit the usefulness in any way. There are a number of differences between the editions, especially in the chapter structure, yet the 1st can still remain in stock and/or be supplemented by the current one. After T.

An Anatomy of Power : The Chomsky Reader ¤ A great collection of unpublished basic texts: Noam Chomsky is worldwide considered as one of the most important intellectuals of our days. In the past thirty years he published books that became standard works of language as well as of political science. As one of the sharpest critics of US-American world power politics he has long since become a leading figure also outside the academic circles. To his lectures people of all social classes and age groups stream today. It is effortless for the now seventy-year-old to fill halls with up to ten thousand seats. And the way Noam Chomsky spreads his thoughts is unique: calm, yes quiet, with great consideration. In this way the speaker often leaves room for intermediate questions, so that the lectures often arise from the dialogue between Chomsky and his audience. "An Anatomy of Power" brings together for the first time the most important of these speeches of the last ten years, which, due to their particularly easy-to-understand dialogical form, offer the best introduction to the thoughts of Noam Chomsky and represent an indispensable supplement to his other, "more academic" books.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113450-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126263-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037877-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4252093-9>
In Focus: Natural Resources: In Search of Raw Materials ¤ The collection, created in collaboration with the newly established 'German Raw Materials Agency' and the 'Federal Institute for Geosciences', contains 17 essays and interviews that deal with the impending scarcity of energy raw materials, minerals, and ores. The authors also analyze how Germany, as a country with limited raw materials, can ensure its supply. Although it is not a systematic representation, a wide range of topics are covered. They range from the increasingly important rare earths (with 'We're consuming ourselves to death', ID-A 50/11) to the search for unconventional gas fields (on gas 'Energy in 60 minutes', ID-B 46/11) to manganese nodules, diamonds, copper, salt, and coal. In comparison to the conference proceedings 'Energy and Raw Materials' (ID-G 40/11), the essays are easier to read and take into account environmental policy aspects. A color section offers maps and photos. Despite the very high price, the small book, suitable for students, can be recommended after 'We're consuming ...', but before the other two titles.

The Fixation Code : What We Need to Know About the Internet to Survive ¤ Our computer is our travel agency, our bank, our shopping advisor, our leisure planner, our stereo system, and our TV. We play, email, blog, tweet, and above all, we Google, what the stuff holds. The machines we use are becoming more beautiful and more and more a part of ourselves. Without a doubt, we are extremely fixated on the digital cosmos behind our devices, unfortunately often equipped with a very fragmented knowledge. Who already has an overview of all the services with which Google comes to our data and most secret wishes? Who has more than a vague idea of the dependencies into which one can fall? Ibrahim Evsan explains in a way that everyone can understand, what is hidden behind all the terms, some of which are only known by hearsay, how one protects oneself (and one's children!) from the dangers, how one maintains one's reputation in the network, what enormous changes we can still expect from its vastness, and how we can also as a national economy survive in the digital future.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308416-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120814-6>
Innovationsfinancing for SMEs: Special Features and Opportunities in Eastern Federal States; Summary of the Research Project 2009-2012 ¤ The present study deals with the business economic special features of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Eastern Germany, which are generally also shown in financing. The research proves that the insufficient innovation dynamics in Eastern Germany is not just a cyclical or even mental, but a structural phenomenon. The analysis emphasizes a special need for action in the eastern federal states, as there are on the one hand a large number of small companies, and the middle class is largely established overall, but in comparison to the West, established large companies are less frequently found as partners and have a positive impact on medium-sized supplier companies. Also, in Eastern Germany, the financing conditions are special, i.e. the proportion of external financing is differentiated.

The Moravian Night : A Tale ¤ In this novel-length tale, Peter Handke increasingly assumes the oppressive form of the reality of our present. Location: the Balkans, the Morava, a tributary of the Danube, a houseboat on the river. Time: a night, from late evening to the dawn breaking. People: An author, a former one, summons his friends, seven in number, to the hotel ship, his enclave, to which he had retreated a decade earlier. For one night, a boat owner, the former author, tells seven listeners about his round trip through Europe, a round flight, a wandering, a death trip, or a 'rampage'.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4159233-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076645-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4053309-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132270-8>
Culture as Intermediate Realm: An Evolutionary Biological Perspective ¤ No serious adherent of the biological perspective will deny the importance of culture for human behavior. And no serious adherent of the cultural scientific perspective will deny the importance of evolution for human behavior. But both tend to trivialize the importance of the other side as quickly as possible in order to return to their own perspective. For Karl Eibl, human cultural ability is not in contrast to biological equipment, but he understands it as a product of biological evolution. Only the objectification function of human language makes it possible to refer to non-present things: past, future, absent, or even just invented. It also allows for coherent own worlds to be designed: intermediate realms. Cultures as intermediate realms are relatively autonomous, huge relay stations, in which the variably changing environment of humans is adjusted to their old, evolved nervous system over millions of years. The book presents the most important biological conditions and cultural internal mechanisms of such constructions and also makes the biological conditions of high cultural phenomena such as religion, philosophy, and the arts visible. "In the ability of decoupling lies the specificity of human problem-solving. By introducing a second level into our information inventory, we gain the possibility of managing huge amounts of information without these directly influencing our actions. We can note where an information is valid, when it is valid, who it comes from (and how reliable it is), how often it is relevant, which information may compete and so on. Each information can be so to speak marked with a small yellow sticky note that informs about the conditions of its validity."	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002230-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125698-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071050-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062860-7>

Federal Funding Programs and Projects with Robotics Reference since 2010: Short Study ¤ The focus of this study was on the research funding of Germany with reference to robotics. Initially, an overview of current specialist and funding programs of the German federal government was given, as they are designated by the funding ministries. For a detailed examination of the funding projects contained in the programs, access was made to the funding catalog (FÖKAT) of the BMBF. The authors point out the restrictive notes on the statement value of this data basis. Within the scope of the study, a distinction was made as far as possible between industrial and service robotics. This distinction is not to be made sharply in the practice of funding - it is noticeable above all that service robotics is increasingly being used in industrial contexts. The funding volumes of individual programs are therefore not to be assigned to industrial and service robotics in proportion. Nevertheless, the presented programs and projects give an impression of the thematic priorities and order of magnitude of the federal government's robotics project funding.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125049-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4261462-4>

AWUSYS : Development of a High-Precision and Time-Efficient Industrial Ejection System ¤ Within the scope of the project "Awusys", a high-precision and time-efficient industrial ejection system was developed in a cross-disciplinary approach, which can simultaneously perform unbalance determination and unbalance corrections with the highest accuracy. In comparison to existing systems, an accuracy of +/- 0.1 g for unbalance determination should be achieved, which was reduced to +/- 0.01 g. The same applied to the necessary mass addition and subtraction, which should be realized with an accuracy in the 1/100 range. The development of such a system was successfully implemented through the elaboration and development of different approaches from the fields of construction, software technology, measurement technology, handling technology, and manufacturing technology, and was brought together in the form of a computer-controlled test stand.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4127326-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187136-4>

A European Model? : National Minorities in the German-Danish Borderland 1945 - 2005 ¤ After the excitement about the impending SSW government participation, interest in the minority theme is likely to have grown. Just in time, this book on minorities in the borderland appears in the series of the Institute for S.-H. Time and Regional History. Following the collection on the NS time ("Between Hope, Adaptation and Persecution"), German and Danish historians, lawyers, theologians, and politicians are devoting themselves to the question of how the relationship between the German, Danish, and Frisian minorities has developed since 1945 and whether it can be considered a European model. The contributions deal with various individual aspects, such as parties, church life, cross-border cooperation, legal issues, organizations of the three ethnic groups, etc. Excellent appendix with the wording of the important political documents (e.g. the Bonn-Copenhagen Declaration), timeline, and a comprehensive source and bibliography.

Rock Identification in the Field ¤ Rock identification in the field has established itself in a short time as a standard textbook in the geoscientific basic studies and among enthusiasts of geology and mineralogy. A second edition was required sooner than expected, and now a third edition. This book is thoroughly practice-oriented. Roland Vinx explains the necessary basics in a readable and easily understandable way. The readers learn to understand the characteristic features of the rocks without requiring prior knowledge of petrography. The book fills a gap between textbooks of petrography and petrology on the one hand and rock and mineral guides on the other hand.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144949-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4157152-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019869-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020734-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020740-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153918-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143419-5>

We Have Rebuilt : Women of Hour Zero Tell Their Stories ¤ In today's Germany, the landscapes of ruins can no longer be imagined, on which the rebuilding began after the war - by women of a generation that will no longer exist in a few years. Their life paths dictated the unthinkable today, all the more touching when they emaciated and hardworking yet smile into the cameras. The image-text volume documents an impressive piece of our history. It tells of flight, expulsion and death, of survival in the winter of hunger 1946/47, 'stubble' on harvested fields, of unimaginable housing shortage, smuggled coal in briefcases, imaginative clothing recycling and food (liver sausage made of flour and marjoram! When eating gruel, one imagined Kassel sausage) and of disappointment over returned, foreign husbands. Shocking, touching stories of hardship and departure and very different experiences and social developments in East and West.

Perspectives of Biotechnology Communication: Controversies — Boundary Conditions — Formats ¤ Biotechnology, particularly genetic engineering, has been at the focus of public debates in Germany for nearly 40 years. However, it is not biotechnology as a whole that causes controversy in society and science, but rather individual applications. To interpret public controversies as a lack of acceptance that can be alleviated by increased information is too short-sighted. The development and introduction of new technologies require a successful dialogue between science and the public. This acatech POSITION analyzes experiences from controversies and communication strategies for green genetic engineering and other fields of biotechnology from a communication and social science as well as historical perspective. acatech provides recommendations on how biotechnology can be communicated in a fact-based and balanced manner in the future.

Superintelligence : Scenarios of a Coming Revolution ¤ Genius that is more developed than human intelligence is called superintelligence. How likely is the construction of machines and computers that are superintelligent, and how could these be controlled by humans? (Harald Pilzer) What happens if scientists one day succeed in developing a machine that surpasses human intelligence in almost all important areas? Clearly: Such a superintelligence would be extremely powerful and would pose us control and management problems, compared to which tackling climate change is child's play. Moreover: Probably, the future of the human species would be in the hands of this superintelligence, just as the future of gorillas depends on us today. Futurism?

Hauspark_Parkplatz : Parking Garages and Parking Ideas in the 21st Century ¤ Parking plays a central role in our automotive society, but is currently often neglected in planning. Pushed into invisible underground garages or pushed to the edge, it is only an unwanted side effect of maximum individual mobility. However, architects, planners, and artists are repeatedly dealing with the stationary traffic and trying to give it a new perspective. In the contributions, both the changeable history of parking is presented, as well as the current problem described.

Moral in Times of Crisis ¤ Autobiographical overview of the outstanding representative of political psychoanalysis Horst-Eberhard Richter (born 1923) about his diverse engagement. Life balance, criticism of the decline of values in politics and economy, plea for the regeneration of morality and encouragement to resistance. (Dieter Altmeyer) Autobiographical overview of the well-known psychoanalyst (born 1923) about his professional and private engagement. Personal experiences and experiences are connected by the 'Father of the German Peace Movement' and author of 'The God Complex' (latest BA 4/01) with analytical reflections, so in his reports on his encounters with Brandt, Gorbachev, Sakharov, Mandela or Ustinov, so also in his statements on the nuclear threat, climate destruction, social injustice or the 'gambling evil' of banks, as he holds the boundless egoism, the lack of empathy and the general decline of values responsible for their common causes. He sees the only way out of the current crisis in the 'strengthening of a new moral sense of responsibility'. - The book can be read equally as a kind of life balance of the now 87-year-old outstanding representative of political psychoanalysis, as criticism of the decline of values in politics and economy, as plea for the regeneration of morality and as encouragement to resistance.

Child Abuse : Recognize, Help, Prevent ¤ Deegener, who has been active in child and adolescent psychiatry in Homburg/Saar for many years, is one of the most important experts on the topic of "child abuse". His fundamental title is now in its 5th edition. Based on 21 typical questions and statements, the topic is approached in its entirety in a combination of factual and practical knowledge. A complete revision, however, cannot be recognized. The text is largely identical to the previous edition. Current developments (e.g. the scandal at the Odenwald School) are mentioned in addition. In addition to a few address changes (the sorting by postal codes instead of alphabet as in the previous edition is irritating at first glance) only the bibliography has been revised. Now titles up to 2009 are considered, some older literature is no longer listed. In public libraries, the 4th edition of the title, which is also suitable for laypeople, can be consumed. Furthermore, it is still valid: "good to read, understandable and scientifically sound" (BA 5/09).

Databases : Data Models, Objects, WWW, XML ¤ Recently, A. Heuer (BA 1/04) has informed about databases. The present book differs from this work by a holistic view. So, various data models are not placed side by side without any connections; cross-references are established. The practical representation is oriented towards a large, continuous case study, the "Ceramic Workshop" with its customer, order, and product data. Both relational databases and object-oriented and object-relational databases are treated. Here, comparisons and the presentation of commonalities are also made. Databases on the web are described under the aspect of dynamically generated HTML pages. XML (Extensible Markup Language) is also well considered in its elementary techniques and its use in conjunction with databases. The practical relevance is finally made clear again with explanations of knowledge acquisition in databases in a process of (semi-)automatic extraction. Little prior knowledge is required, e.g. about HTML. Also suitable for self-study. Exercises (with solutions on the WWW).

Methods of Empirical Social Research ¤ Textbook with the focus of presentation on the attempt to mediate a connection between sociological theory and empirical social research. (LK/GÖ: Vetter) Introduced textbook (last ID-G 10/05), which focuses the presentation on the attempt to mediate a connection between sociological theory and empirical social research. For this edition, the subchapter "Critical Psychology" was removed, the chapter "Theory of Science" was reorganized and the part on "Content Analysis" was completely revised. Internet links were updated, cited data were rewritten and newer literature was incorporated. More detailed, but also more theoretical than Michael Häder: "Empirical Social Research" (here last BA 3/07), which conveys corresponding basic knowledge through numerous examples. "Very clear design and good opportunity to look up specific methods. - For students" (Silke Reimers, ID-G 7/99). - Exchange of the previous edition is desirable, but not mandatory.

Circuit Simulation with SPICE: Experiments in the Virtual Electronics Laboratory ¤ The hobby electronics enthusiast is first introduced to the most important components; he is then introduced to working with the SPICE simulator Multisim. (Rita Weinheimer-Hartmann) With such software for simulating the behavior of electronic circuits (this is the modern way of developing and experimenting with circuits, and also of electronics tinkering) the user saves a lot of time (e.g. he does not have to solder) and money (expensive measuring instruments do not have to be purchased, nor can they be destroyed, nor can the required components). This is particularly of interest to the hobby electronics enthusiast, and that is why SPICE, which is actually more of a simulation program for professionals, is explained in a very understandable and practical way after some basic statements about the most important components, based on Multisim, a module that is available for free as a full version with a time limit. This booklet is highly recommended, in addition to an earlier book by the author (BA 6/08) in which he deals with virtual experimenting in a similar way.

Conflict Regulation and Peacekeeping in the International System ¤ The bloody collapse process of the former Yugoslav multi-ethnic state is a good example of the limitations of common explanation models for intra- and inter-state conflicts. In the prevention, management, and aftercare of this conflict, the international community has clearly failed, which ultimately led to a regional protracted crisis that requires a peacekeeping engagement (KFOR) for the time being. Against this background, the authors analyze the possibilities of political peacekeeping in a very differentiated manner, taking into account the challenges of a future multipolar world system. Recommendation for developed policy areas. (3)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164958-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056618-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4264286-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019411-5>
Data Analysis with SAS: Statistical Procedures and Their Graphical Aspects ¤ The program package "Statistical Analysis System" developed around 40 years ago runs on all common operating systems for mainframe and PC computers. For this 3rd, completely updated edition of the work published in 2004, the current version 9.3 for Windows is now used as a basis. At a few places, subchapters have been added, otherwise the basic concept remained the same. "Initially, the authors provide a thorough introduction to the structures and operations of the system, where they place great emphasis on the graphical possibilities. Following a brief summary of the core areas of descriptive and inductive statistics, the main part presents a basic and at the same time practical representation of various procedures and applications using SAS. A reader should be familiar with the general mathematical foundations. In addition to students in higher semesters, this is particularly addressed to demanding users of statistical procedures in practice" (Wolfgang Grölz). If needed, the current version should be offered. (3)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4195685-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056995-0>

Lou Andreas-Salomé : "... how I love you, Riddle Life" : a Biography ¤ The 1861-born Petersburg-born literary figure, companion of Nietzsche, Rilke and Freud, was a versatile personality of 'wonderful clarity of mind', who drew the 'outline of her life according to her own ideas'. In the radicality of this decision unusual for her time - fascinating for biographers. After the lively portrayal by W. Ross (BA 11/97) and the more comprehensive biography by I. Hülsemann (BA 1/99) this volume by two authors is presented, which was first published in 1988 (not discussed here). A clearly structured text, divided into 4 chapters, from 'Childhood' to 'Old Age' the biographical and spiritual stages of life, supported by quotes, are exactly outlined. Especially the close relationship to the sensitive Rilke gains contours in the portrayal by M. Wiesner-Bangard, while U. Welsch highlights Lou's engaged work with Freud, who paid her 'respectful recognition'. A thorough, supplemented with an extensive appendix, work, to be recommended to readers interested in literary history, before or next to the mentioned titles.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006804-3>

Seven Molecules: The Chemical Elements and Life ¤ To say it right from the beginning - reading this book is simply fun! This already starts with the very cleverly chosen title, which makes a potential reader much more curious than, for example, a simple "Introduction to Biochemistry". The authors, who both describe themselves as "enthusiastic chemists", have done an excellent job of didactically bringing the chemical processes that take place in an organism to life in a fascinating way. They use such artistic names as "WaGluLe TyAtOhRe" for the molecules water, glucose, lecithin, tyrosine, ATP, oxyhem and retinal, as well as the verb "CREATE", which serves as a mnemonic aid for the 7 elements sulfur S, carbon C, hydrogen H, oxygen O, phosphorus P, iron Fe and nitrogen N. Throughout colorfully illustrated and equipped with numerous control questions. By J.-H. Fuhrhop, lastly 2 titles on chemistry for medical professionals (BA 8/89 and ID 31/89).

Defend Freedom: How We Can Win the Fight for an Open Society ¤ We are in a crisis of liberal democracy. The widespread fear of social decline, of a runaway globalization and uncontrolled immigration creates an aggressive mood. Trust in democratic institutions is falling, populist demagogues are gaining traction. What lies behind this revolt and how can we respond to it? These questions are addressed by the Green pioneer Ralf Fücks in his book. He follows the long lines of opposition to liberal modernity and shows that retreating into a national fortress and abandoning an open society will lead to hell. In contrast, Fücks advocates for the renewal of the democratic republic: We need strong public institutions that secure social cohesion - and citizens who stand up for the same freedom for all. "This book is particularly recommended for those who are discouraged and resigned, also because it contains a to-do list at the end: Go to the polls, join a party, do not despise democratic institutions, support critical journalism through newspaper subscriptions, support civil society organizations through donations, distrust simple solutions, defend the constitution, never justify violence. Freedom is defended by each individual" (deutschlandfunk.de). "In other passages, Fücks again emphasizes that a free society can only be defended if there is also social security for all and, in particular, more participation for workers. The green economic liberalism proposed by Fücks remains somewhat vague at the end. However, the Green pioneer argues strongly when he presents the fight for open societies as a cultural confrontation, for example with Islam. Fücks does not confuse Islam with Islamism, unlike many right-wing populists. However, he makes it clear that all religions - and especially radical currents - must remain equally criticizable" (ndr.de)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033203-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123879-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132695-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011413-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4135889-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018326-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129521-3>

Forest Soil Condition Report for Saxony-Anhalt: Results of the Second Soil Condition Survey in the Forest (BZE II) ¤ The forest soil condition survey (BZE) provides a comprehensive picture of the current state of forest soils and their changes over time. The BZE in Saxony-Anhalt is based on a grid network with a total of 76 sampling points. BZE I (1992-1994) showed clearly critical conditions of forest soils, especially due to atmospheric inputs. The repeated inventory (BZE II, 2006-2008) now provides insight into changes in forest soils against the background of decreasing acid and fly ash inputs and continued increased nitrogen inputs. In addition to the detailed analysis of chemical properties of various forest soils – from unleached sands in the lowland, loess soils in the hilly country and bedrock in the Harz – the focus is on carbon and nitrogen storage, as well as results on tree nutrition, forest vegetation and intensive monitoring. The forest soil condition report for Saxony-Anhalt provides important decision-making bases for science, practice and politics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132325-7>
Technological Futures : Anticipate - Create - Evaluate ¤ Representations of the future development of technology and society play a central role in societal technology debates and decision-making processes. The technological futures are communicated in the form of scientific expert opinions, among other things. As such, they receive great attention from political decision-makers, the economy, and the media. In particular, in scientific policy advice, the authors of technological futures are responsible for disclosing the premises and value decisions that form the basis of these technological futures. In order to enable open communication about the future living conditions in society, technological futures must be designed transparently.

The Math Practice Book: How Engineers Apply Mathematics - Projects for the Bachelor Phase ¤ Clarification of the practical relevance of mathematics for solving problems from everyday engineering at 4 applications from the fields of control engineering, thermodynamics and building physics for students of engineering subjects in the first semester. Review (ekz): Mathematics also has a central importance in engineering sciences. It provides numerous methods, concepts, and instruments here. Corresponding basic lectures on mathematics convey comprehensive basic competences, which are often quite abstract. The practical relevance of these for the actual field of study is usually only recognized late. The work now clarifies at 4 applications from the fields of control engineering, thermodynamics, and building physics for students of engineering subjects in the first semester the practical relevance of mathematics for everyday engineering. The very transparent presentation leads to the successive transition from the practical problem to the final mathematical modeling based on the mathematics knowledge conveyed in the first two semesters through varied working instructions. Helpful hints and detailed solutions complete the work, which is based on an interdisciplinary university program for the production of an early application-related mathematics for engineers. Extremely useful for the target group. (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4827059-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142443-8>
Mythos Cyberwar : about digital espionage, sabotage and other dangers ¤ We have learned to fear the Cyberwar: For decades, Hollywood has fed us images of dark powers that, with the help of secret and highly complex computer networks, blackmail states and detonate nuclear warheads. The myth of the cyber war has sunk deep into our worldview. Politics and the military are making use of this fear. It's high time to ask: Does the cyber war really exist? The political scientist Thomas Rid is sure: The cyber war does not take place. The documented cyber attacks cannot be described as a war, because the targeted violence against humans, the brutal destruction, which is inextricably linked with the idea of war, is missing. We cannot relax yet, however. Because Thomas Rid also makes it clear that real dangers such as espionage, sabotage, and subversion can indeed threaten from cyberspace. He tells in detail and knowledgeably about espionage attacks, sabotage acts, and attempts to destabilize governments and trigger revolutions using information technology. However, these are not military actions for Rid, and it's about more than just rhetorical disarmament: We must understand who profits from the myth of Cyberwar. And we must define the real dangers we are exposed to, in order to be well prepared to meet the security requirements. "A strength of his work on the 'Mythos Cyberwar' lies in the variety of examples of cyber attacks and their analysis. Not every one of Rid's conclusions may be desirable to follow, to be sufficiently proven or plausible, but the value of this book also lies in the fact that the author knows how to move between different worlds: computer science, political science, technology history" (deutschlandfunk.de)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4051131-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056287-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4461975-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4817534-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1075612675> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131194-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308416-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213485-7>

Digitalization in Care: Supporting Better Work Organization ¤ This book systematically focuses on the approaches of digitalization that improve work organization in care and thus have the potential to contribute to higher job satisfaction of care workers. Digitalization in care is currently being very controversially discussed. "Will care workers in the future be replaced by care robots?" Such and similar headlines raise far-reaching ethical questions and do not contribute to making the potential that digitalization offers for the care industry visible. This book deals with approaches to digitalization that support care workers in their daily work or also increase the quality of life of care recipients. The presented approaches were scientifically founded and have proven themselves in practice. The book also shows how the process of digital transformation in care can be successfully implemented - namely in a way that the employees in care are designers of their own change process from the beginning. The editors Dr. Vanessa Kubek is a Diplom-Politologin, graduated in economics at the TU Kaiserslautern and is a systemic consultant (DGSF), systemic coach and organizational developer (SG/DGSF).

Roof Stages ¤ Publisher's text: The roof is the primal form of human dwellings, where wood as a building material for roof constructions still holds an enormous significance in residential construction. Due to its low weight, fast assembly, elementarity, and modern connection technology, wooden roof stages will also be used in the future. The book provides an overview of the common construction systems used in old and new buildings, up to special forms, roof dormers, and modern constructions. Similarly, constructive approaches are shown and explained, as well as hints given to analyze the inventory and set constructive measures to enable later roof space use. Furthermore, the principles of roof stiffening are explained and construction proposals are given.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148724-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4148729-1>
Der Brockhaus Astronomie : Planets, Stars, Galaxies ¤ The new standard work for amateur astronomers. 3,300 entries contain all important information on astronomy, famous astronomers, and spaceflight achievements. 500 illustrations, including specially prepared graphics of the most important star charts, in which the individual star brightness is also indicated. There are numerous general introductions to astronomy at all levels, with the market being significantly narrower for lexicons. So, the Brockhaus Astronomy closes the broad gap between the very popular "Dictionary of Astronomy" (H.-U. Keller: BA 5/05) as the first reference work and the 6,000 term explaining "ABC Lexicon of Astronomy" (BA 1/97) for a scientifically pre-trained audience (Spectrum; BA 1/97). Approximately 3,300 entries, accompanied by 12 special articles, many information boxes, tables, and instructive color graphics, offers the present reference work, which, compared to the Brockhaus Encyclopedia (20th edition: from BA 5/97) and the 3-volume "Brockhaus Natural Sciences and Technology" (BA 1/03), contains significantly more extensive biographical and subject articles. These are clearly organized and partially already very helpful for student presentations. - Library-worthy title, to be acquired for smaller collections if possible.

Excel 2010 for Dummies : [at a glance: create and safely edit worksheets ; sort, analyze, and present data ; enhance tables and conjure up diagrams ; make life easier with formulas] ¤ Review: In the introduced series, the author, known for numerous publications on the spreadsheet calculation Excel, presents the necessary basic knowledge for the new version Excel 2010 (further programs of the Office package within this series see in this issue). Both the structure and the majority of the text are based on the predecessor to Excel 2007 (BA 9/07). At a few places where innovations come into play (e.g. Sparklines, screenshot integration, Web App) or the terminology has changed (e.g. menu bar instead of multifunctional toolbar), the text has been revised and updated. The numerous illustrations have also been replaced to a large extent. If there are deviations due to different operating systems (XP, Vista, Windows 7), this is explicitly addressed. Beginners also receive a competent guide to the widely used program with this introduction from the popular series. For many libraries for updating the holdings after Rainer Schwabe (BA 10/10).

Individual Environmental Action and Climate Protection (IndUK) – Final and Completion Report: Result Integration and Transdisciplinary Utilization of Findings from SÖF Research on the Social Dimensions of Climate Protection and Climate Change: Project Period: 01.04.2014-31.12.2014 ¤ „It is foreseeable that strategies for dealing with climate change cannot be derived from scientific research results alone. How people perceive this, what consequences it has for them, and whether and how they are willing to implement corresponding strategies depends strongly on the respective social and cultural environment“ (BMBF 2015; http://www.fona.de/de/9874). Against this background, numerous research projects were funded within the framework of social-ecological research in the focus area of social dimensions of climate protection and climate change from 2010 to 2014, with a focus on individual environmental action. Following the funding phase, the IndUK project exemplarily tested with several research consortia the synthesis and utilization of results. „Utilization projects“ are an important instrument of transdisciplinary research to increase the societal impact of research results and to provide stronger feedback between research results and strategies (Defila et al. 2011). Through a subsequent transfer phase, the societal valuation of research results can be improved by supporting the acquisition of knowledge generated up to the project's completion by decision-makers, stakeholders, or users. IndUK aimed at the transdisciplinary integration and knowledge transfer of research results from the consortia projects: REBOUND – The social dimension of the rebound effect (e.g. ZEW); KlimaAlltag – Climate change and everyday action (e.g. ISOE); EMIGMA – Empowerment of migrants for climate protection (e.g. FH Dortmund); SPREAD – Scenarios of perception and reaction to adaptation (e.g. CESR).Purpose and objectives of the investigationThe subject of the project was the integration and transdisciplinary utilization of findings from the four SÖF research projects on the social dimensions of climate protection and climate change. The process of knowledge integration was structured by three sub-goals: 1. Integration of results on individual environmental action for climate protection from the four participating projects in a matrix. 2. Further discussion and processing of the matrix regarding the interdisciplinarity of the connection and transferability of results. 3. Transdisciplinary integration and utilization of action knowledge in two thematic fields. The objective of the IndUK project was accordingly to bundle the results in two essential points: statements on the form of possibly future more frequent follow-up project processing in the German research landscape and the development of a matrix that converts project results into understandable action options.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055759-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078517-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164199-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547705-1>
The Betrayed Generation : What We Demand of Women in Midlife ¤ The women of birth years 1955 to 1970 - the Baby Boomers - started as the first generation of women in Germany with a good education and a lot of enthusiasm in a life that promised them equal opportunities and rights like men. Today, good thirty years later, the balance is far from positive for all. The careers of many of these women ended abruptly when they had children. Subsequently, they had a significantly more difficult access to the labor market - and after a divorce, they bore the financial responsibility for themselves and the half-grown children. Today, hundreds of thousands of these women are facing old-age poverty. Christina Bylow and Kristina Vaillant write about the discrimination of Baby Boomer women in a society that is obsessed with sexiness, about pension injustice, the alienation between men and women - and about what this women's generation has achieved nonetheless.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002733-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002963-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124931-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4050129-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4018202-2>

Perl : Fundamentals, Advanced Techniques, Exercises ; [Operators, Functions, Regular Expressions, Hashes, References ; User Interfaces, Persistence, CGI Programming, AJAX ; Exercises with Pattern Solutions for each Chapter] ¤ Perl is a free, platform-independent programming language. Perl is used today not only in system and network administration, but often also in the development of web applications. The author is known for a comprehensive introduction to Perl 5.6 (BA 11/02). In the present book, he devotes himself to the current version 5.8.8, but often also uses Perl 6-compatible modules (the next version Perl 6 is already in development). The book is based on lectures at the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences. Extensive prior knowledge is not expected; however, experience with a higher programming language is very helpful when reading. Fundamentals of Perl are briefly summarized. Based on this, selected Perl concepts are explained and shown what can be done with them. As a result, a collection of solutions to typical problem statements is created, which the reader can easily generalize for their own applications. Summaries of the individual chapters. Many examples and exercises. Interesting alternative to J. Schröter (BA 9/07). (2)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4307836-9>
Praxis Wärmepumpe : Technology, Planning, Installation ¤ Due to rising energy prices and CO-2 reduction measures, the use of environmental heat is gaining more importance. For the author (energy advisor/renewable energies) heat pumps, together with thermal solar systems, wood heating systems, and ventilation systems, offer the optimal combination for using domestic energy sources. If the heat pump is operated with "eco-power", the CO-2 emission is reduced to a minimum. Starting from energy policy considerations, this book clearly and comprehensibly conveys the technology of heat pumps, the planning of a heat pump system, as well as the installation and commissioning with practical examples. With numerous, illustrative colored images, photos, and graphics, economic considerations, cost comparisons of heating systems according to VDI, standards, and regulations, glossary, manufacturer directory, and examples of applications, offers. The target group are skilled craftsmen, energy advisors, architects. High price of a professional book. After Michael Baumann (BA 8/07), alongside K. Ochsner (BA 9/07), before I.

Englisch für Architekten und Bauingenieure : ein kompletter Projektablauf auf Englisch mit Vokablen, Redewendungen, Übungen und Praxistipps : all project phases in English with vocabulary, idiomatic expressions, exercises and practical advice ¤ The author is an English native speaker and works as an architect, translator, and lecturer, among other things, for English for architects. The textbook, intended for self-study or also course-related, builds on existing school English and prepares through technical texts, typical dialogues, and business letters for work as a planner in and with the English-speaking abroad. In this way, the 12 chapters are practically oriented to the individual planning and implementation phases of a construction project. Each chapter also includes grammar and vocabulary parts and exercises, and special skills, such as letters, emails, phone calls, applications, etc. are treated. The solutions and 2 separate dictionaries end the book. The target group of this textbook are architects, civil engineers, students of both fields, translators, interpreters, and building owners.

Learning from failure : a history-based, lightweight test prioritization technique connecting software changes to test failures ¤ Regression testing is a widespread practice in today's software industry to ensure software product quality. Developers derive a set of test cases, and execute them frequently to ensure that their change did not adversely affect existing functionality. As the software product and its test suite grow, the time to feedback during regression test sessions increases, and impedes programmer productivity: developers wait longer for tests to complete, and delays in fault detection render fault removal increasingly difficult. Test case prioritization addresses the problem of long feedback loops by reordering test cases, such that test cases of high failure probability run first, and test case failures become actionable early in the testing process. We ask, given test execution schedules reconstructed from publicly available data, to which extent can their fault detection efficiency improved, and which technique yields the most efficient test schedules with respect to APFD? To this end, we recover regression 6200 test sessions from the build log files of Travis CI, a popular continuous integration service, and gather 62000 accompanying changelists. We evaluate the efficiency of current test schedules, and examine the prioritization results of state-of-the-art lightweight, history-based heuristics. We propose and evaluate a novel set of prioritization algorithms, which connect software changes and test failures in a matrix-like data structure. Our studies indicate that the optimization potential is substantial, because the existing test plans score only 30% APFD. The predictive power of past test failures proves to be outstanding: simple heuristics, such as repeating tests with failures in recent sessions, result in efficiency scores of 95% APFD. The best-performing matrix-based heuristic achieves a similar score of 92.5% APFD. In contrast to prior approaches, we argue that matrix-based techniques are useful beyond the scope of effective prioritization, and enable a number of use cases involving software maintenance. We validate our findings from continuous integration processes by extending a continuous testing tool within development environments with means of test prioritization, and pose further research questions. We think that our findings are suited to propel adoption of (continuous) testing practices, and that programmers' toolboxes should contain test prioritization as an existential productivity tool.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133869-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132652-0>
Southeast Asia: Societies, Spaces, and Development in the 20th Century ¤ This collection of essays originated from a lecture series at the University of Vienna. In 14 challenging articles, renowned experts present the politically, ethnically, and culturally very heterogeneous region of Southeast Asia. The large area is distinguished by an insular-Malaysian part from a continental part and from the mountain regions in the northern border areas. The focus of the representation is on historical developments up to independence as well as physical and anthropogeographic aspects. Several authors deal with contemporary problems, i.e., deforestation of the rainforest, the development of megacities like Manila and Bangkok, the politicization of Islam, and the precarious position of ethnic minorities, especially the Chinese. The enormous dynamics of economic and political transformation since the beginning of the 20th century are clearly visible, making Southeast Asia one of the most interesting regions in the world. Supplementing, for example, J. Rüland (BA 8/98) and the East Asia volume from the same series (see BA 6/99). Also suitable for smaller libraries. (2) (Andreas Ufen)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073972-7>
Sustainable Logistics : Answers to a Global Challenge ¤ Logistics and Supply Chain Management will have to adapt to completely new boundary conditions and requirements in the foreseeable future. Starting from very ambitious target specifications for reducing pollutant emissions, policy will contribute to a significant increase in transport costs through various instruments such as tolls, consumption taxes, and a trade in tightly held emission certificates. In the same direction, rising oil prices and increasing productivity losses in freight traffic, which will have to cope with an increasingly overburdened traffic infrastructure, will also work. Against this background, logistics will make a strong contribution to the preservation of mobility and the environment and will have to reinvent itself in part. Starting from a description of the future boundary conditions, adaptation strategies are developed in this book that enable a less pollutant-intensive exchange of goods and can contribute to preserving mobility as a prerequisite for any division of labor economy. In this process, not only logistical process and network architectures are put to the test, but also the overarching marketing strategies and business models, from which modern logistics has emerged.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7660153-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4484317-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4326464-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4022492-2>
Stochastics : Theory and Applications ¤ Stochastic methods have high relevance in many parts of technology and computer science. For example, most modern procedures for digital data transmission, circuit simulation, but also process engineering and financial engineering are based on stochastic principles. The book offers a comprehensive and application-oriented introduction to probability theory and statistics. At the center are stochastic processes, especially Poisson processes, martingales, and Brownian motion, after a basic treatment of measure and integration theory and the foundations of probability theory. All results are thoroughly motivated and exactly proven. This makes the book an excellent choice for self-study and as accompanying literature for lectures.

Parasite Biology ¤ This volume, not yet displayed, is a biology of parasites for biologists and medical doctors (also veterinarians), now available in an expanded and above all adapted to the current state of science second edition (first edition 1997). General questions on definition, characteristics, co-evolution of parasite and host, etc. are treated in the first part. In the following three parts, single-celled parasites, worms, ticks and mites, crustaceans and insects are described. The book appears at Springer as study literature. Understanding questions follow each chapter, which are answered at the end of the book. The book is primarily aimed at students or practitioners of the above-mentioned disciplines. In addition to P. Wenk's "Parasitology" (ID 28/04), it can be used. It can replace D. Matthes: "Animal Parasites" (ID 41/88). Although frequent pests of humans (worms, lice, ticks) are also treated, looking up without certain familiarity with the terminology is little rewarding. Widely usable on the subject, lastly Marlene Zuk: "What would life be like without parasites?" (BA 8/08). (3) (Olaf Kaptein)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122308-1>
Digital Technology - a Practical Introduction ¤ Digital technology is omnipresent today. It combines many disciplines: physics, mathematics, electrical engineering, computer science, etc. This book brings both the necessary theory and a consistent reference to practice. Each chapter contains numerous tasks (unfortunately without solutions) and detailed literature references. On the internet, you can find additional exercises, examples, animations, and slides for lecturers. Worth mentioning is also an important aspect that is not often treated, namely verification. The lecture material serves mainly bachelor students as an introduction, especially beginners due to its applications tailored to them. Now it's not the 1st textbook; here only the newer ones: H.G.

Simplified Flow Zone Theory : on the basis of the Zarka Method ¤ For a life prediction of variable loaded structures, such as plant and machine construction as well as civil engineering, the cyclically accumulated distortions and possibly also the elastic-plastic extension wave widths are required. The Simplified Flow Zone Theory (VFZT) is a direct method that provides estimates of these and all other mechanical quantities in the elastic and plastic operating state. The present book presents the VFZT in detail and attaches importance to the fact that not only scientists, but also practicing engineers and students of higher semesters can form an image of the possibilities and limitations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4306794-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4311399-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7579569-3>
Cooperations between Science and Economy: Mechanisms and Barriers in Knowledge and Technology Transfer ¤ The knowledge and technology transfer from science (universities and research institutions) to the economy is one of the central sources for innovations. Its importance has increased again in view of the great proximity to science of the new high-tech fields such as artificial intelligence or biotechnology. Against this background, the state of the literature on knowledge and technology transfer in the context of cooperations between science and economy is critically examined in the framework of the study. For this purpose, an investigation grid was developed to examine the state of the literature. Central topics are the theoretical foundation of the research field, forms of cooperations, expectations of the participating actors, transfer barriers, political measures to promote knowledge and technology transfer and their effectiveness, the transfer of experiences from abroad and existing research gaps. The results show that the research field is very diverse. In the past decades, a wide range of results have been achieved, but there is still a wealth of open research questions, for example, with regard to the long-term effects of funding measures.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059277-7>

Mass Media in Germany ¤ The established standard work on the structure and system of media in Germany has been consistently revised and updated. A new chapter on global communication has been added. The crisis of the media industry since the beginning of the century, the rapid structural change of classical media press, radio, and television through the digitalization of communication are further important topics. The basic overview of the media landscape in Germany should be available in many libraries in the latest edition. (I. Müller-Boysen) General understandable, basic introduction to the political, legal, and technical development of mass media in Germany. (I. Müller-Boysen) The consistently updated new edition of the established standard work on "functions, structures, and developments" of mass media in Germany is characterized by the perception of a media landscape that is in the deepest crisis of the post-war period. Declining sales figures and dramatic declines in advertising revenue lead to bankruptcies, mergers, and mass layoffs. Many hopes that the industry, for example, in pay-TV and online offers, have proven to be an illusion. Hermann Meyn, who was chairman of the German Journalists' Association for over a decade and has been teaching as an honorary professor at the University of Hamburg since 2001, also addresses these current developments, which have left no media area untouched.

Future Energy Grid : Information and Communication Technologies for a Sustainable and Economical Energy System ¤ Germany's energy transition can only succeed with Smart Grids. By 2022, Germany wants to exit nuclear energy and switch to an energy supply based on renewable energies. These can only be integrated into the power grid to a large extent with the help of information and communication technologies (ICT). In a so-called Smart Grid, ICT and energy technology merge and provide sustainable, reliable, and affordable electricity – to the benefit of electricity customers, energy producers, and the German economy. But with the rebuilding of the electricity infrastructure, immense challenges also come to politics, economy, science, and the population. With eight theses, acatech sketches the future of energy supply in Germany and provides concrete action recommendations for the construction of the Future Energy Grids.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7708028-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014736-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068598-6>

The Discovery of the Indivisible: Quarks, Quantum, and the Discovery of the Higgs Particle ¤ When the first edition of the book appeared (BA 12/10), the Large Hadron Collider had just been brought into operation. Shortly thereafter, in July 2012, the discovery of the long-sought Higgs particle was reported, which finally completed the Standard Model of particle physics. Reason enough to revise and expand the text for a second edition, particularly in this section, as well as to make further minor updates and corrections. In the meantime, however, a whole series of books on the discovery of the Higgs particle and the way there have appeared (e.g. R. Vaas: "From God Particle to World Formula", ID-A 6/14, "The Discovery of the Higgs Particle", ID-A 50/13, B. Lemmer: "Into the Proton's Interior"), so that the offer of comparable titles is larger. The topics here are the development of atomic physics from antiquity to the 20th century, the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, the Standard Model of particle physics, the theory of gravity, and string theory. Thanks to the latest findings, it is almost unavoidable to replace the first edition. (2) (Michael Mücke) The author deals with the topics of ancient atomism, atomic physics, the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, and the discovery of the Higgs particle.

Planning of Public Passenger Transport ¤ Millions of people are transported daily in Germany alone by buses, trains, and airplanes. Public passenger transport (ÖV) is of great importance for the quality of life of individuals but also for the performance of entire regions. The quality and efficiency of ÖV systems depend on political framework conditions (state-planned, competitively organized) and the suitability of the infrastructure (railway systems, airport locations), the available traffic offer (schedules and flight plans), the use of suitable technologies (information, control, and booking systems) and the optimal use of operational resources (energy, vehicles, and personnel). The decision-making, planning, and optimization problems that arise in this context are sometimes gigantic and scream for support from mathematics due to their high complexity. This article outlines the current state and importance of the use of mathematics in planning and implementing public passenger transport, describes existing challenges, and suggests forward-looking measures.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045298-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062954-5>

Islam in the Media: Journalistic Quality in the Struggle over the Mohammed Cartoons ¤ Islam has become a top theme in the media in Germany. Almost daily, the German press reports on the integration of Muslims or developments in Muslim-dominated countries. The reporting thus determines the social discourse and decisively influences political debates. Reports without tendentious representations and evaluations are therefore urgently needed. Is there a need for action here? Based on journalistic quality criteria, Fabian Wahl examines the reporting in three German daily newspapers using the example of the dispute over the Mohammed cartoons. With the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the BILD-Zeitung, and the Bonner General-Anzeiger, he covers the entire spectrum from the nationwide quality newspaper to the opinion-forming tabloid to the independent regional newspaper. Empirically, the author checks the aspects of diversity, impartiality, accuracy, transparency, and understandability.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4351632-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4126889-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029670-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067510-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005709-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047966-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4028779-8>

Also considered are the programs iLife '09 and iWork '09 as well as the topic iPhone. (Klaus Barckow) Many books have already been discussed for the new Snow Leopard operating system, including Th. Armbruster (BA 2/10), Sc. Kelby (BA 2/10) and A. Cherif (BA 12/09). The authors are mostly known through books for previous operating system versions. The present video training is an interesting alternative in non-print form. It offers a practice-oriented introduction that familiarizes the reader with all important work processes on the Mac under Snow Leopard. Emphasis is placed on installation and system configuration, file management, and work simplification through Dock, the digital desk. But also the work with the Mac in networks and on the internet is well considered. Error detection and error correction are not forgotten either. The explanations on the programs iLife '09 and iWork '09 offer a look beyond the horizon. Important for iPhone owners is the demonstration of control functions for this special Apple smartphone. - Easy retracing of the material using the live mode on one's own computer.

Richard Neutra in Berlin : the History of the Zehlendorf Houses ¤ As soon as his name is mentioned, they come to mind: generously composed into nature, light-filled bungalows that shape the architectural style of the American West Coast around Los Angeles. That Richard Neutra's (1892?1970) career began in Berlin-Zehlendorf is sometimes overlooked. However, it is precisely the Zehlendorf houses that represent an extremely fascinating chapter in Neutra's work. They reveal not only the experimental and radically innovative design with their complex color concept and extravagant interior design. Rather, one can already see hints in this little-known aspect of his building that can be found in subsequent projects. The present publication honors the early work of one of the main representatives of classical modernism and presents, in addition to historical sources, new, previously unpublished documentation of the houses and their first inhabitants	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4256216-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>

Long-term Environmental Balance and Future Potential of Alternative Drive Technologies ¤ The aim of the present study is to perform an economic and ecological evaluation for alternative fuels and drives for passenger cars in the compact class in Germany for 2020 and 2030. The economic evaluation is carried out according to a Total-Cost-of-Ownership approach, without taxes, levies and subsidies being taken into account. The ecological evaluation is carried out according to the Life-Cycle-Assessment approach. In the context of drive change in passenger cars, battery-electric mobility will probably play the most important role by 2030 and beyond. It is already available on a larger scale commercially today. It is the most economical and energy-efficient of the available reduction options with high potential. The challenge lies in the fact that certain limits are set by the speed of market penetration. Plug-in hybrids can take on a bridging function. Other options, in particular biogas and also synthetic fuels, can contribute to a reduction in THG emissions in passenger car traffic by 2030 at highest in a small extent due to potential limitations and high costs. In the long term, fuel cell passenger cars could still represent an addition.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4299127-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4144126-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073757-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1021591971> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125883-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4008195-3>
Cruise and Data Report of the Research Cruise KERNE 2000 with WFS Planet from 25.4. - 28.4.2000 ¤ From 25 to 28 April 2000, a research cruise with WFS Planet took place in the central Baltic Sea. The aim of the cruise was to identify suitable deployment positions for the FWG research projects RADIS (Reverberation, Attenuation and Detection in the Sediment) and EXSESO (Experimental Sediment Sonar), as well as to conduct bottom investigations for mine hunting in the Baltic Sea. Investigations with side-looking sonar, video recordings, and core sampling were carried out in possible deployment areas west of Warnemünde and northeast of Darßer Ort. Within the framework of the bottom investigations, several core positions between Kiel and Darßer Ort were sampled. In total, 14 vibrocores with core lengths between 5 cm and 180 cm were retrieved, 3 box corer samples and 1 gravity corer (gain 290 cm) were taken.

Computeralgebra ¤ Computeralgebra refers to the boundary between algebra and computer science, which deals with the design, analysis, implementation, and application of algebraic algorithms. In line with this view, the author presents some computer algebra systems and demonstrates their capabilities through examples. Basic techniques, such as computing with large integers, are investigated. For complex questions like polynomial factorization, several algorithms are offered, as they have different strengths. Often, the apparent detour through other mathematical structures is the fastest way. In the first chapters, the necessary mathematical foundations are provided. The following chapters can then be read largely independently of each other. All presented algorithms are justified and partly presented in a pseudocode language. The book is equally aimed at students of mathematics and computer science. TOC:Introduction.- What is computer algebra? Literature. Computer algebra systems.- Foundations.

It covers almost the entire range of topics and addresses both experienced RaspPi enthusiasts and beginners equally. In addition to special RaspPi knowledge, the book also conveys basics on the topics of electrical engineering, hardware, and programming. The now available 4th edition shows only minor differences from the predecessor. A comprehensive update led to adjustments in some subchapters and subheadings. Now the Raspberry Pi Zero W is taken into account (update of the stripped-down Raspberry Pi Zero), there are changes in SSH configuration, and new hardware components (fingerprint and fine-tipped sensors, Pimoroni Zero LiPo expansion board, etc.) have been added. Numerous circuit diagrams, graphics, and project descriptions. Well suited, but primarily for the first-time purchase and for stocking. (1)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1027903738>
Privacy in the Internet : Seizing Opportunities, Assessing Risks, Shaping Trust ¤ Basic Values -- Privacy in the Internet: a Challenge -- Theses on the Development of a Culture of Privacy in the Internet -- Recommendations for Action -- The Next Step. With its digital marketplaces, search engines, social networks, and many other services, the Internet can contribute to the realization of fundamental European values: free self-determination, political participation, and economic well-being of people. However, users often pay for Internet services with data rather than money, which puts their privacy at risk. In view of this tension, acatech shows how an Internet culture can be developed that allows the opportunities of the Internet to be seized while protecting the privacy of people. This acatech position contains concrete recommendations for action, how education, economy, law, and technology can contribute to such a culture.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4308416-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4011134-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123980-5>

Report of the Federal Ministry of Health and the Federal Environment Agency to consumers on the quality of water for human consumption (drinking water) in Germany (2014 - 2016) : Reporting period: 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016 : in accordance with § 21 Drinking Water Ordinance based on the format for reporting by the competent highest state authorities (Bundesgesundheitsblatt 2013·56:1191-1215) ¤ The present report is based on the reports of the federal states to the Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) and the Federal Environment Agency (UBA) for the period from 2014 to 2016. The form of the report is based on the report format prescribed by the European Commission, which is binding for the annual reports of the state authorities. In 2016, 72.4 million people, approximately 88% of the population of Germany, were supplied with 4,350.8 million m³ of drinking water (from central facilities) in 2,490 water supply areas (distribution of more than 1,000 m³ of drinking water per day or supply of more than 5,000 people). The raw water for the treatment of the drinking water supplied in these areas came from 69.1% groundwater, 15.6% surface water, 8.2% bank filtration, 7.0% artificially enriched groundwater, and 0.1% from other resources. The drinking water in these water supply areas is of very good quality. More than 99.9% of the examined samples met the requirements of the Drinking Water Ordinance, i.e., the limit values were complied with.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4060916-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047966-3>
Relief of the Environment and Traffic through Regional Economic Circuits : Research Report 29896151 ¤ The traffic performance has increased more strongly over the past few decades than the real gross domestic product. Compared to 1997, a further increase in road traffic performance of 50 and 79% is forecasted until 2015. Regional economic circuits are seen as a means to counteract the trend of disproportionately increasing traffic flows structurally and in the long term. In the study, the relationships between economic and traffic development on a regional level were explored. Furthermore, possibilities are discussed to promote regional economic circuits and thus reduce the volume of interregional transport.

Small Sewage Treatment Plants Today ¤ Comprehensive overview for professionals and planners in water management, but also for homeowners on small sewage treatment plants, i.e. small plants with biological wastewater treatment. The number of building permits for small sewage treatment plants has doubled in the last 2 years and the German standard DIN 4261 has been replaced by the European standard DIN EN 12566. These reasons led to a rapid update to the latest state of the art and standardization, a stronger consideration of plant-based sewage treatment plants and almost a doubling of the scope compared to the 1st edition (ID 36/04 - must be replaced). In addition, chapters on biological processes of wastewater treatment, on the hygienization of wastewater, on alternative solutions for wastewater treatment, on tightness tests and wastewater disposal obligations have been newly taken up. Following the generally understandable guide by W. Lack: "Wastewater treatment with plants" (BA 1/07) and in addition to F. Wissing (ID 29/03) primarily recommended for libraries in East and North Germany, respectively libraries with corresponding specialist readership. (3) (Elke Nibbrig)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164150-4>

Eurotopians : Fragments of Another Future ¤ How do we want to live? How will we build? Where can we find ideas for the houses and cities of the future? Niklas Maak and Johanna Diehl dedicate themselves to these pressing questions in their joint project "Eurotopians". In times of upheaval, the book casts a look back at the work of European utopians to find visions for the present. - In the 1960s and 1970s, visionary architectures emerged in Europe, fundamentally questioning common notions of living. Many of these buildings have fallen into disrepair, their architects forgotten - although they still live there. Maak has visited them and created an "Archaeology of the Utopian", which shows that in the ruins, crucial ideas for the world of tomorrow can be found. Johanna Diehl has created impressive photographs of great intensity there. In the ruins of utopian modernity, she discovers images of revolutionary life concepts that seem surprisingly up-to-date.

F0rb1dd3n Network : Anatomy of a Hack ¤ This book on information technology security is primarily aimed at somewhat inattentive administrators. Their interest is to be sparked by a thriller story that occupies the first 40 percent of the book. Two young hackers get entangled with sinister other hackers, giving the authors the opportunity to describe a series of attacks on WLANs and PCs, which are then commented on in the second part of the book. These chapters contain a lot of information about common methods and tools used by hackers, but also about countermeasures that a prudent IT department can take. Many links and further literature references can be found, but almost only US sources. There are also descriptions of some programs used by hackers, but also by network administrators, e.g. to detect attacks from the outside for the first time. This is the translation of the 2nd edition with a completely new factual part (the 1st US edition contained many plagiarisms and was withdrawn).

Logical Foundations of Mathematics ¤ The book conveys basic logical knowledge, fundamental proof principles, methods, and insights that every mathematician should possess. The following questions are addressed: What distinguishes finite from infinite sets? How can the whole, rational, and real numbers be constructed from natural numbers and the latter from pure sets? Which fundamental set-theoretic constructions are used for this and in mathematics in general? What are the basic topological properties of the set of real numbers? What is the continuum hypothesis? Why is the axiom of choice needed? Can the natural or real numbers be completely axiomatically described? With the help of the ultrapower method, non-standard numbers are constructed. Furthermore, a readily accessible proof of Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem is provided. Written for: Students of mathematics.

Introduction to Visual Basic 2017 ¤ Visual Basic is an object-oriented programming language from Microsoft. The author of the book is known for a variety of introductions to computer science topics under the title "Introduction to ...". His introduction to an earlier version ("... in Visual Basic 2013" has already been discussed. W. Doberenz also introduces the current version of the language, but assumes more prior knowledge from the reader. The present book relies on numerous tasks and exercises (with solutions in the appendix). The reader is thus introduced to programming with Visual Basic under the development environment Visual Studio 2017 in small steps. Emphasis is placed on basics (variables and data types, operators, controls, branching, loops, ...) and error handling. Database applications with ADO.NET and Internet applications with ASP.NET are also well considered, as well as creating drawings with the GDI+ library. At the end, there are 2 large example projects, the game Tetris and a vocabulary trainer. - Also suitable for self-study	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4265875-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1144526825>
IT Architectures : Planning, Integration, Maintenance ¤ In the present book, the authors show how IT systems can be structured and deal with the question of how different IT systems communicate with each other and how the complexity of IT environments can be mastered using suitable structuring. These questions gain greater importance in the age of increasing networking. The considerations made are independent of whether the considered elements are software or hardware components. It becomes clear that an IT architecture is always composed of various hierarchical levels (starting from individual components to systems and up to domains of interacting systems) and can only be understood in the interplay of the hierarchical levels. Methodical representation with many key statements, which often work with drastic comparisons to the tasks of an architect in house construction. Clearly highlighted are the benefits of an IT architecture and the need for a separate education of IT architects. (3)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072806-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139374-0>
High-Frequency Technology : Fundamentals of Mobile Communication Technology ; with 54 Examples and 39 Exercise Tasks ¤ HF applications can be found in many - also non-specialist areas, e.g. in electrical, information and communication technology, mechatronics, vehicle electronics, etc. It is such a broad field that it can hardly be treated comprehensively in a book. The focus here is on processes during wave propagation, i.e. on their description, consequences, and utilization in circuits and systems. This is described here in a comprehensible and mathematically sound manner for students and an insight is given into modern design tools (circuit and field simulation). At the end of each chapter, there are exercise tasks; the solutions can be found on the book's web site next to an animated 3D simulation. This is suitable for libraries with a student audience and in addition to basic literature on the subject, e.g. H. Heurmann (ID 37/09), J. Detlefsen (ID 5/07).

Foundations of Digital Signal Processing: A Mathematical Approach ¤ With the widespread introduction of digital signal processors and computers, a universally available means of processing signals from coffee machines to cars is now available today. The digital signal processing used here is presented as the processing of deterministic and also stochastic signals in this book. Initially, physical and mathematical signals and signal parameters are described, followed by a consideration of analog continuous-time systems. Subsequently, discrete-time, linear, time-invariant systems and the processing of discrete-time signals are presented in detail. The necessary mathematical procedures for solving difference equations and the discrete Fourier transform are treated in detail. Stochastic signal processing follows. After a chapter on estimating the autocorrelation function, the book devotes itself to the increasingly used model systems. Literature references close the book. In contrast to other works, this book on digital signal processing is readable without additional mathematical reading. Necessary mathematical knowledge is presented in an understandable way and refreshed. The book is therefore aimed at students, but also practicing engineers, computer scientists, and natural scientists who want to acquire the foundations of digital signal processing independently.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113314-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4401311-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4139058-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4469723-5>

Juristischer Gutachtenstil : a textbook and workbook ¤ A textbook and workbook that introduces law students not only to the style of writing expert opinions, but also informs them about the structure and composition of expert opinions. Review: The book by the lecturer at the University of Bielefeld is, in the best sense, a textbook and workbook. It introduces students not only to the style of writing expert opinions, but also illuminates the content of expert opinions. It deals with questions such as: 'Why do I draw a syllogistic conclusion?', 'Why do I form a superordinate sentence?', 'How do I develop a definition?'? In the end, the author draws attention to the special features of expert opinions in criminal law, civil law, and public law. Students are directly encouraged to work on the short exercise tasks in the book. Therefore, entries are to be expected. The solutions to the tasks can be found in the appendix. The title should be offered everywhere where law students belong to the clientele. A comparable title is not known.

Information systems are the basis of Building Information Modelling, BIM. Connected information and continuously connected model data are the basis of collaborative building. They allow transparent control and reliable risk management. Multimodels are connected information. The basics and methods of BIM and multimodels are explained, and it is shown how a process-oriented management with multimodels brings new quality to the planning and control of construction processes. The continuous BIM working method with connected information allows construction process simulations to be performed in the shortest time. In addition to the virtual building, a virtual construction site in virtual reality also provides important new impressions for construction management. Construction management information becomes transparent, comprehensible, and graspable at once. Volume 1 focuses on the basics of the models and their extension through link models, on the methods for BIM and multimodel data such as filtering, visualizing, and on the processes, their fast configuration, and process-based planning and management, as well as information logistics, which is already gaining new approaches and qualities through multimodels, while Volume 2 shows illustrative applications in construction site planning, construction process simulation, construction project, and risk management.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4072806-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4353072-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4004704-0>

Recommendations for Cycling Infrastructure : ERA ¤ After 15 years, the "Recommendations for Cycling Infrastructure" (ERA 95) are being replaced by the new ERA, Edition 2010. This makes the central rulebook for cycling in Germany available in its current form. The ERA form the basis for planning, design, and operation of cycling infrastructure. They apply to new construction and major changes to roads. Their application is recommended for existing roads. The ERA apply to cycling connections of connection function levels II to V in accordance with the RIN (Guidelines for Integrated Network Design) within and outside built-up areas. The ERA complement and deepen the relevant planning and design guidelines, in particular the - Guidelines for Integrated Network Design (RIN) (FGSV 121), - Guidelines for the layout of urban streets (RASt) (FGSV 200), - Guidelines for the layout of country roads (RAL) (FGSV 201) [expected to be published in the course of 2011] and the - Guidelines for traffic signal control (RiLSA) (FGSV 321) to provide concrete details on cycling. They replace the "Guidelines for the signage of cycling infrastructure in accordance with the General Administrative Regulation on Road Traffic Regulations" (FGSV 241) from 1998 at the same time. The ERA deal with the following topics: - Cycling concept, - Design fundamentals, - Cycling guidance on inner-city main roads, - Cycling guidance at intersections, - Crossing facilities, - Cycling in access roads, - One-way streets with cycling in the opposite direction, - Cycling in pedestrian areas, - Cycling on country roads, - Self-contained cycle paths, - Construction and operation of cycling infrastructure, - Effect control and quality assurance.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076473-4>
Sectoral Innovation Processes and the Discussion of German Innovation Weaknesses ¤ In the "Location Debate", Germany is often attributed with innovation weaknesses in a general manner. In the discussion of varieties of capitalism, the view is represented that "liberal market economies" like the USA favor radical innovations more than "coordinated market economies" like Germany. A more precise analysis of sectoral innovation processes in the pharmaceutical industry, the telecommunications industry, and the automotive industry, however, shows that reality is more complex: The juxtaposition of "radical" and "incremental" innovations is just as problematic as their identification with specific industries and institutional systems. National innovation systems are not closed units, but condition each other in their strengths and weaknesses. State regulation plays a central role in innovation processes everywhere, albeit in different ways. A historical analysis is indispensable to understand changes in innovation conditions. In the German pharmaceutical industry and telecommunications industry, a relative decline is to be recorded, which, however, has very different reasons that cannot be subsumed under a simple explanation schema. The German innovation debate is still too focused on technology promotion and largely ignores questions of the social and ecological quality of innovations and their diffusion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4711541-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4045696-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4345404-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032690-1>

Smart-TV with Kodi : the understandable guide ¤ Kodi is a free available media center software that can control and play, record, or archive all digital media available on connected audio and video devices (TV, stereo system) in the home network. No full-fledged PC is required, a low-cost, fanless mini PC (e.g. Raspberry) is sufficient. The title describes the installation and operation of Kodi in a well-structured, detailed, and easy-to-understand manner, lists suitable hardware in an up-to-date overview, and explains important special functions (youth protection settings, control via smartphone, integration of network storage). High-quality, predominantly colored illustrations complement the text well, the subtitle "The understandable guide" is completely accurate. The only drawback: impatient people without a strong interest in theory have to get through page 61 before it gets to the installation and operation of the software. Conclusion: Clearly and understandably designed and conceived title for the setup and operation of the open-source media center software Kodi	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1139197290>

Technical Acoustics ¤ This classic introduction is unique in its subject selection and structure, and has proven itself, its thematic selection is dedicated to engineering education. Above all, emphasis is placed on the most important measures to calm the acoustic environment. All chapters have the question directly and indirectly as the subject, how the loudness can be reduced in the most practically important acoustic environments (in buildings and outdoors). The so-called measures chapters are preceded by the media chapters, which convey the required basic knowledge about the nature of sound and vibrations. Compared to the previous edition, the scope has increased by a fifth. Noteworthy is a new chapter on the fundamental questions and facts of "active noise control". The following have been added, among other things: - the consideration of wave propagation has been extended to moving media - when discussing sound absorption, the oblique sound incidence is also discussed - the references to standardization have been updated - a brief and concise summary of the essential facts has been added at the end of each chapter. TOC: Perception of sound.- Basic concepts of wave propagation .- Sound propagation and sound radiation.- Body sound.- Elastic isolation.- Sound absorption.- Fundamentals of room acoustics.- Soundproofing.- Sound dampers.- Diffraction.- Electroacoustic converters for air sound.- Fundamentals of active noise control. - Appendix A: Calculating with decibels.- Appendix B: Complex pointers.- Index	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059219-4>

Feedback : how feedback determines our lives and dominates nature, technology, society, and the economy ¤ Self-reference and coupling are universal mechanisms in the behavior of systems. Only when one has the feedback of a structural element on itself in view, can one gain true understanding and predictions - whether it is a pocket watch, the amount of money, or the political circumstances. This applies to natural sciences and technology just as much as to psychology, economics, and politics. The ongoing everyday reference makes the representation vivid, which could have been enhanced with additional illustrations. Anecdotes, the hypothetical dialogue with the reader, and the author's humor ensure a pleasant reading experience. An interdisciplinary non-fiction book that also enriches smaller collections.

How, so is asked in the contributions, can such a far-reaching thesis be justified, and how is it to be theoretically re-implemented under the changed circumstances?	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143413-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4073840-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055876-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020643-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020517-4>
Kreativ! : generating ideas systematically at the touch of a button ¤ In the book of the Creative Director of an advertising and marketing agency, it initially deals with basic settings, curiosity, and thought patterns, etc. Then the creative process is described - what is at the beginning, what conditions and rules are needed, how are the right questions found, how is it evaluated, developed, and implemented. A whole extremely helpful chapter is dedicated to idea killers. Chapter 4 deals with creative methods: brainstorming and writing, mind map, morphological matrix, synektics, and also with the lesser-known ones like cross-innovation, collective notebook, brain station, brain running, world café, and others. Creative techniques, such as combining, breaking down, exaggerating, and changing perspectives, and many more, are the focus of chapter 5. Finally, it is applied practically. Here, marketing and staging play a role, as well as the design of products and services. Everything is very clear and well-explained, with many concise graphics to illustrate it.

An Introduction to Statistics and its Applications ¤ The content and structure are similar to many introductory titles on the same topic (e.g. D. Griffiths: "Statistics from Head to Toe", ID 22/09, or R. Leonhart: "Statistics Textbook", ID 13/09). An elementary treatment of descriptive statistics with its most important indicators follows the representation of probability theory in sufficient scope for the final section on the closing statistics of estimation and testing procedures. This volume convinces before many others through its clean, methodically pursued mathematical style. Building on general knowledge of analysis, in particular of integrals, the reader is introduced to the theory and to deeper lying results, such as the central limit theorem, from illustrative examples. More complex arguments are always given a particularly broad space. Each section ends with a task. Highly recommended for the basic study, but also already for interested students of the upper secondary level. (2 pages)	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056995-0>
Cooperation of Central Places in Shrinking Regions: Practical Experience Study; a Project of the Research Program "Aufbau Ost" of the Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development (BMVBS) and the Federal Office for Building and Regional Planning (BBR) ¤ The practical experience study "Cooperation of Central Places in Shrinking Regions" addresses the question of how functional divisions in the central urban system (city associations) and other forms of cooperation are suitable for contributing to the security of basic supply in shrinking regions. The publication is directed as a compact action guide both at municipalities and at state and regional planners. From the comparative examination of ten case studies from the new federal states, which take over a pioneering role due to their early exposure to the effects of demographic change, targeted action recommendations for the successful implementation of central urban city associations in various cooperation phases can be derived. The results of the investigation provide insight into which fields a center cooperation is sensible, which factors are decisive for the successful implementation of the cooperation and which obstacles exist. City associations represent an important instrument in the sense of the guiding image "Securing Basic Supply" of the new guiding images for regional development adopted by the MKRO in the summer of 2006. The results and the derived action recommendations form a basis for information for the further development of central places concepts in the state plans and provide important pointers for the implementation of new or existing central urban cooperation in the partner municipalities (Source: BBR).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4067619-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032386-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4194892-0>

Collective dynamics of nonlinear and disordered systems ¤ Phase transitions in disordered systems and related dynamical phenomena are a topic of intrinsically high interest in theoretical and experimental physics. This book presents a unified view, adopting concepts from each of the disjoint fields of disordered systems and nonlinear dynamics. Special attention is paid to the glass transition, from both experimental and theoretical viewpoints, to modern concepts of pattern formation, and to the application of the concepts of dynamical systems for understanding equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of fluids and solids. The content is accessible to graduate students, but will also be of benefit to specialists, since the presentation extends as far as the topics of ongoing research work.

Pattern matching for an object-oriented and dynamically typed programming language ¤ Pattern matching is a well-established concept in the functional programming community. It provides the means for concisely identifying and destructuring values of interest. This enables a clean separation of data structures and respective functionality, as well as dispatching functionality based on more than a single value. Unfortunately, expressive pattern matching facilities are seldomly incorporated in present object-oriented programming languages. We present a seamless integration of pattern matching facilities in an object-oriented and dynamically typed programming language: Newspeak. We describe language extensions to improve the practicability and integrate our additions with the existing programming environment for Newspeak. This report is based on the first author&rsquo;s master&rsquo;s thesis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4233947-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4307192-2>

Pro-poor macroeconomics : potential and limitations ¤ Economists increasingly agree on the nature of the development and social policies needed to halve poverty over the next ten years. A similar convergence is nowhere in sight in the case of macroeconomic policies. Disagreements in this area remain significant, exacerbated by rising financial instability and a string of banking and currency crises that impacted negatively on poverty, growing macro imbalances in some industrialized countries and the rapid development of difficult-to-regulate international financial markets. This volume presents a pro-poor macroeconomic policy allowing countries to recapture policy space, help promote growth, reduce inequality and diminish poverty in a sustainable way.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002963-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037174-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4112701-8>

Spatial implications of the European Monetary Union ¤ With the beginning of the year 1999, a further important step towards deeper integration of Europe took place: The European Monetary Union (EMU) was put into force. Undoubtedly, this has, beside other effects, also considerable effects on the economic geography of the integrating area. Possible and probable spatial effects of EMU was the motive to establish an international working group within the ARL-DATAR (Délégation à l'Aménagement du Territoire et à l'Action Régionale) cooperation agreement in order to shed some light on these effects. The present volume consists of papers having been elaborated by members of the working group. Considerations are made with regard to - consequences for the regions of a changed relationship in which countries being members of the euro-zone stand to each other, - macroeconomic consequences for regions of their being a member of EMU, - effects of the possible concentration of industrial activities in regions and of trends towards specialisation of regions in certain industries, - effects of EMU using a multiregional general equilibrium model, - distinguishing between static and dynamic effects of the Euro. Based on these deliberations recommendations are formulated and spatial orientated policy conclusions are given even though one fear seems to be unfounded: the aim of territorial cohesion in the EU seems not to be touched systematically by the common currency in a negative way.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4188829-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049043-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076605-6>

Architecture and cityscapes : tips and techniques for drawing on location ¤ Award-winning illustrator Gabriel Campanario first introduced his approach to drawing in The Art of Urban Sketching, a showcase of more than 500 sketches and drawing tips shared by more than 100 urban sketchers around the world. Now, he drills down into specific challenges of making sketches on location, rain or shine, quickly or slowly, and the most suitable techniques for every situation, in The Urban Sketching Handbook series. It's easy to overlook that ample variety of buildings and spaces and the differences from city to city, country to country. From houses, apartments and shopping malls to public buildings and places of worship, the structures humans have created over the centuries, for shelter, commerce, industry, transportation or recreation, are fascinating subjects to study and sketch.In The Urban Sketching Handbook: Architecture and Cityscapes, Gabriel lays out keys to help make the experience of drawing architecture and cityscapes fun and rewarding. Using composition, depth, scale, contrast, line and creativity, sketching out buildings and structure has never been more inspirational. This guide will help you to develop your own creative approach, no matter what your skill level may be today. As much as The Urban Sketching Handbook: Architecture and Cityscapes may inspire you to draw more urban spaces, it can also help to increase your appreciation of the built environment.

Investigation of TMP Fiber Quality for MDF Production: Final Report on the FNR Project "Fiber-Impact" (FKZ: 22013211) ¤ Project description: Despite its importance for the production process and properties of fiberboard, the quality of thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP) is principally determined with a haptic and visual inspection by skilled personnel, as adequate measurement systems are currently not available. This approach depends greatly on the person testing the material, and the results obtained are only quantifiable to a limited extent. Results are therefore unsuitable for objective product and process optimization. While the hardware and software of the automated image-based fiber analysis system applied were developed in the context of two previous projects, the current project aimed to investigate the influence of fiber composition and process parameters, particularly the refining parameters, on the fiber quality and the impact of the fiber quality on the properties of medium-density fiberboard (MDF). With this objective, characteristic values have been developed in order to quantify the fiber quality. Various fibers were produced and characterized. The obtained results were correlated with the parameters of the fiber production process as well as the mechanical properties of MDF made from these fibers. The scientific-technical results were verified in industrial trials when the measuring device was installed in the production process of an MDF manufacturer ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4560637-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4047968-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4255886-4>

Industrial case study on the integration of SysML and AUTOSAR with triple graph grammars ¤ During the overall development of complex engineering systems different modeling notations are employed. For example, in the domain of automotive systems system engineering models are employed quite early to capture the requirements and basic structuring of the entire system, while software engineering models are used later on to describe the concrete software architecture. Each model helps in addressing the specific design issue with appropriate notations and at a suitable level of abstraction. However, when we step forward from system design to the software design, the engineers have to ensure that all decisions captured in the system design model are correctly transferred to the software engineering model. Even worse, when changes occur later on in either model, today the consistency has to be reestablished in a cumbersome manual step. In this report, we present in an extended version of [Holger Giese, Stefan Neumann, and Stephan Hildebrandt. Model Synchronization at Work: Keeping SysML and AUTOSAR Models Consistent. In Gregor Engels, Claus Lewerentz, Wilhelm Schäfer, Andy Schürr, and B. Westfechtel, editors, Graph Transformations and Model Driven Enginering - Essays Dedicated to Manfred Nagl on the Occasion of his 65th Birthday, volume 5765 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 555–579. Springer Berlin / Heidelberg, 2010.] how model synchronization and consistency rules can be applied to automate this task and ensure that the different models are kept consistent. We also introduce a general approach for model synchronization. Besides synchronization, the approach consists of tool adapters as well as consistency rules covering the overlap between the synchronized parts of a model and the rest. We present the model synchronization algorithm based on triple graph grammars in detail and further exemplify the general approach by means of a model synchronization solution between system engineering models in SysML and software engineering models in AUTOSAR which has been developed for an industrial partner.

Non-standard spatial statistics and spatial econometrics ¤ Despite spatial statistics and spatial econometrics both being recent sprouts of the general tree "spatial analysis with measurement"—some may remember the debate after WWII about "theory without measurement" versus "measurement without theory"—several general themes have emerged in the pertaining literature. But exploring selected other fields of possible interest is tantalizing, and this is what the authors intend to report here, hoping that they will suscitate interest in the methodologies exposed and possible further applications of these methodologies. The authors hope that reactions about their publication will ensue, and they would be grateful to reader(s) motivated by some of the research efforts exposed hereafter letting them know about these experiences.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4386767-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121557-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043212-9>
Fatigue life prediction of composites and composite structures ¤ The use of composites is growing in structural applications in many industries including aerospace, marine, wind turbine and civil engineering. There are uncertainties about the long term performance of these composites and how they will perform under cyclic fatigue loading. Fatigue Life Prediction of Composites and Composite Structures provides a comprehensive review of fatigue damage and fatigue life prediction methodologies for composites and how they can be used in practice. After an introductory chapter, Part one reviews developments in ways of modelling composite fatigue life. The second part of the book reviews developments in predicting composite fatigue life under different conditions including constant and variable amplitude loading as well as multiaxial and cyclic loading. Part three then describes applications such as fatigue life prediction of bonded joints and wind turbine rotor blades as well as health monitoring of composite structures. With its distinguished editor and international team of contributors, this book will be a standard reference for industry and researchers working with composites and those concerned with the long-term performance and fatigue life of composite components and structures. -- Book Description	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4074631-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4134341-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062670-2>

Contrails : observations, formation mechanisms, atmospheric impacts, uncertainties ¤ Rez.: Aviation emissions represent one particular source sector that may contribute to climate change via contrail formation and increased cirrus cloudiness. However, these factors - aviation particulates and their impact on aerosols and clouds - are among those with the largest uncertainty. In terms of reducing these uncertainties, contrails and contrail-induced cirrus represent a scientific research priority area. This contribution reviews the current knowledge of contrail formation mechanisms, microphysical properties of contrails, potential atmospheric impacts, and major uncertainties, addressing observations and theory. This review has been written in cooperation with colleagues from the UK Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, the Hadly Centre for Climate Prediction, and the UK Meteorological Office.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4474072-4>

Optimal siting of onshore wind turbines: Local disamenities matter ¤ The deployment of onshore wind power is an important means to mitigate climate change. However, wind turbines also produce local disamenities to residents living next to them, mainly due to noise emissions and visual effects. Our paper analyzes how the presence of local disamenities affects the socially optimal siting of onshore wind power. The analysis builds on a spatial optimization model using geographical information system (GIS) data for Germany. Our results indicate a major spatial trade-off between the goals of minimizing electricity generation and disamenity costs. Considering disamenity costs substantially alters - and in fact dominates - the socially optimal spatial allocation of wind power deployment. This is because in Germany a) the spatial correlation between generation costs and disamenity costs is only moderately positive, and b) disamenity costs exhibit a larger spatial heterogeneity than the generation costs. These results are robust to variations in the level and slope of the disamenity cost function that we assume for the modeling. Our findings emphasize the importance of supplementing support schemes for wind power deployment with approaches that address local disamenties, e.g., compensation payments to local residents or minimum settlement distances.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137553-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4153414-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1176538543>

Squimera : a live, Smalltalk-based IDE for dynamic programming languages ¤ BEGIN Software development tools that work and behave consistently across different programming languages are helpful for developers, because they do not have to familiarize themselves with new tooling whenever they decide to use a new language. Also, being able to combine multiple programming languages in a program increases reusability, as developers do not have to recreate software frameworks and libraries in the language they develop in and can reuse existing software instead. However, developers often have a broad choice with regard to tools, some of which are designed for only one specific programming language. Various Integrated Development Environments have support for multiple languages, but are usually unable to provide a consistent programming experience due to different features of language runtimes. Furthermore, common mechanisms that allow reuse of software written in other languages usually use the operating system or a network connection as the abstract layer. Tools, however, often cannot support such indirections well and are therefore less useful in debugging scenarios for example. In this report, we present a novel approach that aims to improve the programming experience with regard to working with multiple high-level programming languages. As part of this approach, we reuse the tools of a Smalltalk programming environment for other languages and build a multi-language virtual execution environment which is able to provide the same runtime capabilities for all languages. The prototype system Squimera is an implementation of our approach and demonstrates that it is possible to reuse development tools, so that they behave in the same way across all supported programming languages. In addition, it provides convenient means to reuse and even mix software libraries and frameworks written in different languages without breaking the debugging experience.

Embedding New Administrative Methods into the Hierarchical File System View ¤ The hierarchical organization of files has dominated computer systems for many years and this will probably not change in the near future. However, with the rapid annual growth of new data this classical hierarchical file system management method reaches its limitations, even when the user consistently sets up and continually expands an elaborated directory structure with well-disciplined naming. This paper introduces new management methods to maintain an overview of all files which can be embedded in the hierarchical file system. A metadata-based file system, which is based on the hierarchical file system, offers, in addition to hierarchical access, a more flexible and associative access to files via virtual objects by providing query capabilities of index- and metadata which are stored in a database. The query results are presented in a clearly-arranged form of virtual directories and virtual files so that the intuitive hierarchical view continues to be maintained ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4256353-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4464537-5>

A review of spatial econometric models for count data ¤ Despite the increasing availability of spatial count data in research areas like technology spillovers, patenting activities, insurance payments, and crime forecasting, specialized models for analysing such data have received little attention in econometric literature so far. The few existing approaches can be broadly classified into observation-driven models, where the random spatial effects enter the moments of the dependent variable directly, and parameter-driven models, where the random spatial effects are unobservable and induced via a latent process. Moreover, within these groups the modelling approaches (and therefore the interpretation) of spatial effects are quite heterogeneous, stemming in part from the nonlinear structure of count data models. The purpose of this survey is to compare and contrast the various approaches for econometric modelling of spatial counts discussed in the literature.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043212-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4588029-3>

Guidance for packing, shipping, holding and release of sterile flies in area-wide fruit fly control programmes : Joint FAO/IAEA Programme of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture ¤ The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) is the international treaty under which the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) are adopted. ISPMs enable the development of technically justified measures for imported plants and plant products, and are intended to harmonize phytosanitary measures applied in international trade. These standards are the accepted reference under the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement). The use and transboundary shipment of sterile insects was not part of ISPM No. 3, "Code of Conduct for the Import and Release of Exotic Biological Control Agents" adopted in 1995, because biological control agents had been defined as self-replicating organisms. Since the implementation of the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) has largely been dominated by the public sector, this did not represent a problem for the transboundary shipment of sterile insects. However, the lack of regulatory framework did discourage private investment in the production and shipment of sterile insects.Over the last three years (2002-2005) ISPM No. 3 has undergone a major revision to update and broaden its scope. In particular, we have been involved in explicitly including sterile insects as beneficials in the revised standard. The revised ISPM No.3 "Guidelines for the Export, Shipment, Import, and Release of Biological Control Agents and Other Beneficial Organisms" was drafted in 2004 and submitted for country consultation. The revised ISPM No. 3 was adopted by the governing body of the IPPC, the Interim Commission for Phytosanitary Measures (ICPM), in April 2005 at FAO headquarters in Rome. Thus sterile insects are considered in parallel to other beneficial organisms by the IPPC through the adoption of the revised ISPM No. 3 and this should facilitate their use, especially in terms of commercialization of the SIT and international trade of sterile insects.--Publisher's description	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071480-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4057338-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063118-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4155333-0>
Magnificent buildings, splendid gardens ¤ Magnificent Buildings, Splendid Gardens returns to print some of the most important works of David Coffin, a leading authority on Renaissance architecture who, as one of the first scholars to apply the tools of art history to the study of gardens, became a founder of the discipline of garden and landscape studies. These essays span the wide range of Coffin's work, from Italian Renaissance architecture, garden design, sculpture, and drawings to English gardens and landscape designers of the seventeenth to early nineteenth centuries. Coffin's approaches are as varied as his subject matter. Some of these essays present the results of his archival research, including his discovery of crucial documents on the Emilian architect Giovan Battista Aleotti and the only documentary evidence identifying Vignola as the architect of the Villa Lante at Bagnaia. Other essays take a much broader cultural view, investigating, for example, the phenomenon of public access to private Renaissance gardens, elucidating the evolving meaning of images of the goddess Venus in English gardens, and identifying the significance of the decorative programs of monuments as diverse as the Villa Belvedere in Rome and the eighteenth-century gardens at Rousham in Oxfordshire.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4044394-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138356-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4019311-1>

Decreasing costs of renewables : insights on energy sector planning and climate policy from three country case studies ¤ This study builds on three case studies in Argentina, Indonesia and Mexico which analyse the implications of falling costs for renewable energy systems on the countries' energy sector planning and climate policy. Each case study consists of two country specific reports. The first report analyses how falling costs of renewable energy could impact country specific power sector development. The second report analyses the process of climate and renewable energy target setting, as well as the prevalent narrative around renewable energy integration. Finally, the present report provides a cross-country synthesis of all case studies, providing insights into the question of how falling costs of renewable energy systems might support the achievement of the goals of the Paris Agreement. Globally falling cost figures for solar PV and wind energy do not naturally translate into increased ambition in planning. The integration of these technologies to the energy system still face substantial barriers in our case study countries: The integration of higher shares of renewable energy goes along with investments into transmission and distribution network modernisation, network expansion and interconnections between power grids. Though an important element, falling costs for renewable energy projects alone do not necessarily translate into overall reduced power system costs. While globally falling costs for wind and solar PV are indicative for learning curve effects in the manufacturing of these technologies, the LCOE of renewable projects is highly sensitive to financing costs. These are largely determined by the local political and regulatory framework and remain high in our case countries, representing a barrier. We find that a number of regulatory and administrative barriers hinder higher integration of solar PV and wind. Frequently changing regulations and ill-designed support schemes often prevail over welldesigned renewable energy auction schemes that are followed over several years. We find the political economy fossil fuels to be pivotal in the energy sector and climate planning and target setting processes. Fossil fuel endowments and a long history of natural resource exploitation lead to strong vested interests towards sustaining the use of fossil fuels to satisfy a growing electricity demand...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032594-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068598-6>
Nonholonomic manipulators ¤ This focused monograph on nonholonomic manipulators builds upon an increasing interest in nonholonomic mechanical systems in robotics and control engineering. The scope of this book is the definition and development of new nonholonomic machines which are designed on the basis of nonlinear control theory for nonholonomic mechanical systems. A key feature of the work is the possibility to exploit nonholonomic theory to design innovative mechanical systems with a reduced number of actuators without reducing the size of their controllable space. The book offers a comprehensive treatment of the problem from the theoretical development of the various control schemes to prototyping new types of manipulators, while testing their performance by simulation and experiments in a number of significant cases	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171735-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037349-6>
Investigating safety impact of center line rumble strips, lane conversion, roundabout, and J-turn features on Louisiana highways ¤ Over the past several years, Louisiana has installed quite a few relatively new crash countermeasures, such as center line rumble strips (CLRS) on rural two-lane highways, restriping four-lane undivided roadways to three-lane or five-lane roadways with center lane for left turns, restricting median openings on high speed corridors (RCUT), and roundabouts. Evaluating the effectiveness of these crash countermeasures is crucial for the state highway safety improvement programs. According to the results of this study, these four countermeasures are generally cost-effective and successful in reducing crashes, particularly severe crashes. Estimated crash modification factors (CMFs) for total crashes are 0.83 for CLRS by the Empirical Bayes (EB) method. The CMF for the lane conversion to three and five-lane highways are 0.61 and 0.70 by EB method for segment, and 0.69 and 0.76 by Improved Prediction Method for segment plus intersection. The CMF for RCUT is 0.86 and 0.69 by Improved Prediction Method for RCUT section and intersection only. The CMF for RCUT intersection only is 0.80 by EB method. The CMF for roundabout with stop-sign on minor street (without layout change) is 0.32 and 0.28 by Improved Prediction and EB method. Except roundabout, the ratio of benefit to cost (B/C) is bigger or much bigger than one. Being the most expensive countermeasure, the B/C ratio of roundabout is less than one, but that estimation did not count the benefit from the improved traffic flow performance (reduced delay or saving in travel time) and long-time safety benefits (only three after years).	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062962-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7727649-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4331587-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4197414-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4222416-0>

Equation of state of uranium dioxide : data collection ¤ The monograph deals with the thermodynamic properties of fluid uranium dioxide, one of the most investigated materials of the last century, up to its critical point. It presents an exhaustive theoretical introduction to 'quasi-chemical' models of liquids, as well as their behaviour under non-congruent vaporisation conditions. Particular emphasis is given to the properties of pure Coulombic systems and to the pseudoparticle approach, which enables the partition function to be expressed in a simple, but physically rigorous formulation. The construction of the equation of state of stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric uranium dioxide is described in distinct steps, from a critical assessment of the theoretical fundamentals to a thorough review of the pertinent thermochemical and thermophysical data. Calculations of the thermodynamic properties of UO2+x are performed for temperatures up to 11,000 K both for the condensed and gas phase. More than one hundred tables are collected in the Appendix containing all relevant thermodynamic data	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068158-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4017690-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4187163-7>

Industrial case study on the integration of SysML and AUTOSAR with triple graph grammars ¤ During the overall development of complex engineering systems different modeling notations are employed. For example, in the domain of automotive systems system engineering models are employed quite early to capture the requirements and basic structuring of the entire system, while software engineering models are used later on to describe the concrete software architecture. Each model helps in addressing the specific design issue with appropriate notations and at a suitable level of abstraction. However, when we step forward from system design to the software design, the engineers have to ensure that all decisions captured in the system design model are correctly transferred to the software engineering model. Even worse, when changes occur later on in either model, today the consistency has to be reestablished in a cumbersome manual step. In this report, we present in an extended version of [Holger Giese, Stefan Neumann, and Stephan Hildebrandt. Model Synchronization at Work: Keeping SysML and AUTOSAR Models Consistent. In Gregor Engels, Claus Lewerentz, Wilhelm Schäfer, Andy Schürr, and B. Westfechtel, editors, Graph Transformations and Model Driven Enginering - Essays Dedicated to Manfred Nagl on the Occasion of his 65th Birthday, volume 5765 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 555–579. Springer Berlin / Heidelberg, 2010.] how model synchronization and consistency rules can be applied to automate this task and ensure that the different models are kept consistent. We also introduce a general approach for model synchronization. Besides synchronization, the approach consists of tool adapters as well as consistency rules covering the overlap between the synchronized parts of a model and the rest. We present the model synchronization algorithm based on triple graph grammars in detail and further exemplify the general approach by means of a model synchronization solution between system engineering models in SysML and software engineering models in AUTOSAR which has been developed for an industrial partner. In the appendix as extension to [19] the meta-models and all TGG rules for the SysML to AUTOSAR model synchronization are documented.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7616754-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7537632-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132847-4>

High-frequency averaging in semi-classical Hartree-type equations ¤ We investigate the asymptotic behavior of solutions to semi-classical Schröodinger equations with nonlinearities of Hartree type. For a weakly nonlinear scaling, we show the validity of an asymptotic superposition principle for slowly modulated highly oscillatory pulses. The result is based on a high-frequency averaging effect due to the nonlocal nature of the Hartree potential, which inhibits the creation of new resonant waves. In the proof we make use of the framework of Wiener algebras.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4278277-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4190133-2>

A new fictitious domain method in shape optimization ¤ The present paper is concerned with investigating the capability of the smoothness preserving fictitious domain method from [22] to shape optimization problems. We consider the problem of maximizing the Dirichlet energy functional in the class of all simply connected domains with fixed volume, where the state equation involves an elliptic second order differential operator with non-constant coefficients. Numerical experiments in two dimensions validate that we arrive at a fast and robust algorithm for the solution of the considered class of problems. The proposed method keeps applicable for three dimensional shape optimization problems.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4329076-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1103156357> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1148581448>

Beyond the Bubble : the new Japanese architecture ¤ Beyond the Bubble examines two contrasting, but equally extraordinary, phases in the recent history of Japanese architecture: the explosive 'Bubble' era of the 1980s and early 1990s, and the post-Bubble years leading up to the present day. The first period - often referred to as the 'new golden age of Japanese architecture' - witnessed a spectacular proliferation of unusual buildings and urban complexes in Japan's major cities, while the latter has seen work demonstrating a sense of modesty, restraint and environmental innovation. Botond Bognar's fascinating study of this remarkable period is divided into two parts. The first section, an essay entitled 'The Bubble Years: The Epitome of Japanese Postmodernism' discusses and illustrates the elaborate architectural projects produced during the 1980s and 90s. More recent projects, mainly from the twenty-first century, are introduced in the second part - 'After the Bubble: New Realities, New Priorities' - as detailed individual studies, accompanied by a wide range of plans, drawings and photographs.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>

Climate change and crops ¤ Climate change is directly linked to the human activities, according to the Fourth Assessment Report of IPCC (2007). In last two decades of 20th Century, accelerated anthropogenic activities pushed up the atmospheric abundance of greenhouse gases, mainly CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O, alarmingly which enhanced the radiative forcing of the Earth's surface and thus perturbed its heat radiation balance. As a consequence, atmospheric characteristics, such as temperature, rainfall pattern, levels of CO₂ and O₃ have changed significantly, affecting the farm productivity. Although rising level of CO₂ may have fertilizing effect on C₃ crops, but concomitant rise in atmospheric temperature, O₃ level and extreme weather conditions can not only nullify the fertilizing effect of CO₂, but also drastically reduce the crop production, threatening food security to burgeoning world population. Agricultural crops are not only victim of climate variability and extreme whether conditions, but also serve as a potential source of CH₄ and N₂O. Therefore, in changed scenario, Kyoto Protocol (1997) has sought all signatory developed nations to cut down their emission levels as per their differential commitments to UNFCCC and developing nations to invest in less carbon emission projects to avert the process of global warming process. In this context, the present edition, which compiles latest findings of studies carried out by the scientists on climate change and crops around the world, serves as a ready reckoner to crop scientists, atmospheric scientists, ecologists, environmentalists, research scholars and post- graduate students to update their knowledge and understanding on this issue. -- Book jacket	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117626-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4290733-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4015358-7>

A quasilinear differential inclusion for viscous and rate-independent damage systems in non-smooth domains ¤ This paper focuses on rate-independent damage in elastic bodies. Since the driving energy is nonconvex, solutions may have jumps as a function of time, and in this situation it is known that the classical concept of energetic solutions for rate-independent systems may fail to accurately describe the behavior of the system at jumps. Therefore, we resort to the (by now well-established) vanishing viscosity approach to rate-independent modeling and approximate the model by its viscous regularization. In fact, the analysis of the latter PDE system presents remarkable difficulties, due to its highly nonlinear character. We tackle it by combining a variational approach to a class of abstract doubly nonlinear evolution equations, with careful regularity estimates tailored to this specific system relying on a q-Laplacian type gradient regularization of the damage variable. Hence, for the viscous problem we conclude the existence of weak solutions satisfying a suitable energy-dissipation inequality that is the starting point for the vanishing viscosity analysis. The latter leads to the notion of (weak) parameterized solution to our rate-independent system, which encompasses the in uence of viscosity in the description of the jump regime.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128900-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4193856-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4221363-0>

An abstraction for version control systems ¤ Version Control Systems (VCS) allow developers to manage changes to software artifacts. Developers interact with VCSs through a variety of client programs, such as graphical front-ends or command line tools. It is desirable to use the same version control client program against different VCSs. Unfortunately, no established abstraction over VCS concepts exists. Instead, VCS client programs implement ad-hoc solutions to support interaction with multiple VCSs. This thesis presents Pur, an abstraction over version control concepts that allows building rich client programs that can interact with multiple VCSs. We provide an implementation of this abstraction and validate it by implementing a client application.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4520996-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4254804-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4303846-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4202033-5>

Laser sintering with plastics : technology, processes, and materials ¤ Laser Sintering (LS) with plastics is one of the most promising additive manufacturing technologies: it is currently regarded as the process most likely in the future to permanently cross the border between prototyping and the production of functional parts. This step is challenging because it means that the technology must meet certain requirements that are also valid for traditional and established production processes. Only by succeeding at this step can a wide industry acceptance of LS be expected in the future. In this context, this book covers all levels of the LS process chain, including: - Current state of the machine technology - Essential process steps, both before and during sintering - Specific demands of the materials, powder production methods, and evaluation of powder properties - Mechanical properties and density of the parts produced by LS Examples of LS-produced parts are given, including those with special design features, to illustrate the characteristics and also the limitations of the LS method. In particular, the distinct advantages of LS parts over parts produced with other plastics processing methods (e.g., injection molding) are discussed--	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4166071-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4803022-3>
Geometric optics on phase space ¤ Symplectic geometry, well known as the basic structure of Hamiltonian mechanics, is also the foundation of optics. In fact, optical systems (geometric or wave) have an even richer symmetry structure than mechanical ones (classical or quantum). The symmetries underlying the geometric model of light are based on the symplectic group. Geometric Optics on Phase Space develops both geometric optics and group theory from first principles in their Hamiltonian formulation on phase space. This treatise provides the mathematical background and also collects a host of useful methods of practical importance, particularly the fractional Fourier transform currently used for image processing. The reader will appreciate the beautiful similarities between Hamilton's mechanics and this approach to optics. The appendices link the geometry thus introduced to wave optics through Lie methods. The book addresses researchers and graduate students.

Nanoindentation ¤ There has been considerable interest in the last two decades in the mechanical characterisation of thin film systems and small volumes of material using depth-sensing indentation tests. Usually, the principal goal of such testing is to obtain values for elastic modulus and hardness of the specimen material from experimental readings of indenter load and depth of penetration. But other properties such as residual stress, fracture toughness, and visco-elastic behavior may also be measured. The indentation technique can be used on both brittle and ductile materials where conventional testing may result in premature specimen fracture. The forces involved are usually in the millinewton range and measured with a resolution of a few nanonewtons while the depths of penetration are in the order of nanometres, hence the term	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4136925-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4217961-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4703729-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151691-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4327473-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037934-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038852-9>

Introduction to the mathematics of subdivision surfaces ¤ This is an introduction to the mathematical theory which underlies subdivision surfaces, as it is used in computer graphics and animation. Subdivision surfaces enable a designer to specify the approximate form of a surface that defines an object and then to refine it to get a more useful or attractive version. A considerable amount of mathematical theory is needed to understand the characteristics of the resulting surfaces, and this book explains the material carefully and rigorously. The text is highly accessible, organising subdivision methods in a unique and unambiguous hierarchy which builds insight and understanding. The material is not restricted to questions related to regularity of subdivision surfaces at so-called extraordinary points, but gives a broad discussion of the various methods. It is therefore an excellent preparation for more advanced texts that delve more deeply into special questions of regularity	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4129864-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156717-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4753239-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182391-6>

Complexity theory : exploring the limits of efficient algorithms ¤ Complexity theory is the theory of determining the necessary resources for the solution of algorithmic problems and, therefore, the limits what is possible with the available resources. The results prevent the search for non-existing efficient algorithms. The theory of NP-completeness has influenced the development of all areas of computer science. New branches of complexity theory react to all new algorithmic concepts. This textbook considers randomization as a key concept. The chosen subjects have implications to concrete applications. The significance of complexity theory for todays computer science is stressed.

Designing public policies : an approach based on multi-criteria analysis and computable general equilibrium modeling ¤ This book presents a methodological approach for the joint design of economic and environmental policies. The starting point is the observation that, in practice, policy makers do not usually have a well-defined objective, but they are typically concerned about a number of economic and environmental indicators that conflict with each other. In view of this, policy making is addressed by combining two separate analytical approaches: multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) and computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling. The aim is to come up with a methodological framework for policy design which is both operational and consistent with economic theory. In short, this book offers a unified view of this novel approach, paying special attention to the connections between economic and environmental objectives. The methodological foundations are presented as well as some real applications that illustrate the pragmatic value of the theoretical proposal.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4210294-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138606-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4610682-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7651795-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113446-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071876-1>

Echinodermata ¤ Members of the phylum Echinodermata are among the most familiar marine invertebrates. Forms such as the sea star have become virtually a symbol of sea life. Used in ancient oriental medicine as a source of bioactive compounds, sea cucumbers, sea stars and sea urchins are now used for the extraction and purification of cytotoxic, haemolytic, antiviral, antifungal, antifouling, antimicrobial and even anti-tumoural activities. In addition, of the five extant classes, sea urchins and sea cucumbers are important economic resources for current fishery and aquaculture. Molecular and cell biological techniques described in this book are, on the one hand, indicative of the improvements made over the years and, on the other, stress the need of their further exploitation for the sustainable production of bioactive compounds and their application in biomedicine.

Sequential disaster forensics : an application to floods in the city of Grimma ¤ Disaster risk and losses have been steadily rising in the past decades, highlighting the need to learn from past events. Only a better understanding of the fundamental causes of natural disasters and its impacts on societies can lead to an effective prevention and reduction of disaster risk. In this context, disaster forensics focuses on the analysis and interaction of risk factors (i.e. hazard, exposure, vulnerability and coping capacity) and the identification of underlying risk drivers, in order to tackle them through dedicated action. Results from forensic analysis are twofold: On the one hand, context-specific knowledge to decide on appropriate and evidence-based Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) measures to mitigate current risk and prevent future one. On the other hand, more generalizable knowledge and evidence on how disaster risk is generated and on the effectiveness of applied DRR measures. In this work, we explore results of disaster forensics through a case study of subsequent floods in 2002 and 2013 in the city of Grimma, Saxony, in Germany. Risk factors are investigated to identify their contribution in increasing or reducing disaster damage, in conjunction with socio-economic impacts on age structure and migration in the mostly affected inner city of Grimma. In particular, we analyse: (i) How much the sequential application of disaster forensics contributes to a better understanding of risk and the identification of the causes of disasters impacts; and (ii) what data are required for performing a disaster forensic analysis.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4202680-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137042-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4186634-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124897-1>

Babelsberg : specifying and solving constraints on object behavior ¤ Constraints allow developers to specify desired properties of systems in a number of domains, and have those properties be maintained automatically. This results in compact, declarative code, avoiding scattered code to check and imperatively re-satisfy invariants. Despite these advantages, constraint programming is not yet widespread, with standard imperative programming still the norm. There is a long history of research on integrating constraint programming with the imperative paradigm. However, this integration typically does not unify the constructs for encapsulation and abstraction from both paradigms. This impedes re-use of modules, as client code written in one paradigm can only use modules written to support that paradigm. Modules require redundant definitions if they are to be used in both paradigms. We present a language – Babelsberg – that unifies the constructs for en- capsulation and abstraction by using only object-oriented method definitions for both declarative and imperative code. Our prototype – Babelsberg/R – is an extension to Ruby, and continues to support Ruby’s object-oriented se- mantics. It allows programmers to add constraints to existing Ruby programs in incremental steps by placing them on the results of normal object-oriented message sends. It is implemented by modifying a state-of-the-art Ruby virtual machine. The performance of standard object-oriented code without con- straints is only modestly impacted, with typically less than 10% overhead compared with the unmodified virtual machine. Furthermore, our architec- ture for adding multiple constraint solvers allows Babelsberg to deal with constraints in a variety of domains. We argue that our approach provides a useful step toward making con- straint solving a generic tool for object-oriented programmers. We also provide example applications, written in our Ruby-based implementation, which use constraints in a variety of application domains, including interactive graphics, circuit simulations, data streaming with both hard and soft constraints on performance, and configuration file Management.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4567206-4>

Metric temporal graph logic over typed attributed graphs ¤ Various kinds of typed attributed graphs are used to represent states of systems from a broad range of domains. For dynamic systems, established formalisms such as graph transformations provide a formal model for defining state sequences. We consider the extended case where time elapses between states and introduce a logic to reason about these sequences. With this logic we express properties on the structure and attributes of states as well as on the temporal occurrence of states that are related by their inner structure, which no formal logic over graphs accomplishes concisely so far. Firstly, we introduce graphs with history by equipping every graph element with the timestamp of its creation and, if applicable, its deletion. Secondly, we define a logic on graphs by integrating the temporal operator until into the well-established logic of nested graph conditions. Thirdly, we prove that our logic is equally expressive to nested graph conditions by providing a suitable reduction. Finally, the implementation of this reduction allows for the tool-based analysis of metric temporal properties for state sequences.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4021842-9>

Modeling spatial and economic impacts of disasters : with ... 40 tables ¤ This book brings together a collection of innovative papers on strategies for analyzing the spatial and economic impacts of disasters. Natural and human-induced disasters pose several challenges for conventional modeling. For example, disasters entail complex linkages between the natural, built, and socio-economic environments. They often create chaos and economic disequilibrium, and can also cause unexpected long-term, structural changes. Dynamic interactions among agents and behavioral adjustments in a disaster become complicated. The papers in this volume make notable progress in tackling these challenges through refinements of conventional methods, as well as new modeling frameworks and multidisciplinary, integrative strategies. The papers also provide case study applications that afford new insights on disaster processes and loss reduction strategies	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4029929-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043212-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121557-6>

Multiscale analysis and nonlinear dynamics : from genes to the brain ¤ Since modeling multiscale phenomena in systems biology and neuroscience is a highly interdisciplinary task, the editor of the book invited experts in bio-engineering, chemistry, cardiology, neuroscience, computer science, and applied mathematics, to provide their perspectives. Each chapter is a window into the current state of the art in the areas of research discussed and the book is intended for advanced researchers interested in recent developments in these fields. While multiscale analysis is the major integrating theme of the book, its subtitle does not call for bridging the scales from genes to behavior, but rather stresses the unifying perspective offered by the concepts referred to in the title. It is believed that the interdisciplinary approach adopted here will be beneficial for all the above mentioned fields.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4809615-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7555119-6>

Solid-state physics : introduction to the theory ¤ Learning Solid State Physics involves a certain degree of maturity, since it involves tying together diverse concepts from many areas of physics. The objective is to understand, in a basic way, how solid materials behave. To do this one needs both a good physical and mathematical background. One definition of Solid State Physics is it is the study of the physical (e.g. the electrical, dielectric, magnetic, elastic, and thermal) properties of solids in terms of basic physical laws. In one sense, Solid State Physics is more like chemistry than some other branches of physics because it focuses on common properties of large classes of materials. It is typical that Solid State Physics emphasizes how physics properties link to electronic structure. We have retained the term Solid State Physics, even though Condensed Matter Physics is more commonly used. Condensed Matter Physics includes liquids and non-crystalline solids such as glass, which we shall not discuss in detail. Modern Solid State Physics came of age in the late thirties and forties, and had its most extensive expansion with the development of the transistor, integrated circuits, and microelectronics. Most of microelectronics however is limited to the properties of inhomogeneously doped semiconductors. Solid State Physics includes many other areas of course; among the largest of these are ferromagnetic materials, and superconductors. Just a little less than half of all working physicists are in Condensed Matter. A course in Solid State Physics typically begins with three broad areas: (1) How and why atoms bind together to form solids, (2) Lattice Vibrations and Phonons, and (3) Electrons in Solids. One would then typically apply the above to (4) Interactions especially of electrons with phonons, (5) Metals, the Fermi Surface and Alloys, (6) Semiconductors, (7) Magnetism, (8) Superconductivity, (9) Dielectrics and Ferroelectrics, (10) Optical Properties, (11) Defects, and (12) Certain other modern topics such as layered materials, quantum Hall effect, mesoscopics, nanophysics, and soft condensed matter. In this book, we will consider all of these. TOC:1. Crystal Binding and Strucgture.- 2. Lattice Vibrations and Thermal Properties.- 3. Electrons in Periodic Potentials.- 4.

(Dis)Obedience in digital societies : perspectives on the power of algorithms and data ¤ Algorithms are not to be regarded as a technical structure but as a social phenomenon - they embed themselves, currently still very subtle, into our political and social system. Algorithms shape human behavior on various levels: they influence not only the aesthetic reception of the world but also the well-being and social interaction of their users. They act and intervene in a political and social context. As algorithms influence individual behavior in these social and political situations, their power should be the subject of critical discourse - or even lead to active disobedience and to the need for appropriate tools and methods which can be used to break the algorithmic power	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4123065-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151276-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033229-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020588-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4046514-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037348-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4001183-5>

Parts without a whole? : the current state of Design Thinking practice in organizations ¤ This explorative study gives a descriptive overview of what organizations do and experience when they say they practice design thinking. It looks at how the concept has been appropriated in organizations and also describes patterns of design thinking adoption. The authors use a mixed-method research design fed by two sources: questionnaire data and semi-structured personal expert interviews. The study proceeds in six parts: (1) design thinking¹s entry points into organizations; (2) understandings of the descriptor; (3) its fields of application and organizational localization; (4) its perceived impact; (5) reasons for its discontinuation or failure; and (6) attempts to measure its success. In conclusion the report challenges managers to be more conscious of their current design thinking practice. The authors suggest a co-evolution of the concept¹s introduction with innovation capability building and the respective changes in leadership approaches. It is argued that this might help in unfolding design thinking¹s hidden potentials as well as preventing unintended side-effects such as discontented teams or the dwindling authority of managers.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4165549-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1052824455> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027089-0>

Basics of aerothermodynamics ¤ The basics of aerothermodynamics are treated in this book with special regard to the fact that outer surfaces of hypersonic vehicles primarily are radiation cooled. The implications of this fact are different for different vehicle classes. In any case the properties of both attached viscous and separated flows are of importance in this regard. After a discussion of flight environment and transport phenomena in general, the most important aerothermodynamic phenomena are treated. Thermal surface effects are particularly considered, taking into account both radiation cooling and/or active cooling, for example of inner surfaces. Finally the simulation means of aerothermodynamics are discussed. Computational methods and their modelling problems as well as the problems of ground facility and flight simulation, including the hot experimental technique, are treated.

Evaluation of design flood frequency methods for Iowa streams ¤ The objective of this project was to assess the predictive accuracy of flood frequency estimation for small Iowa streams based on the Rational Method, the NRCS curve number approach, and the Iowa Runoff Chart. The evaluation was based on comparisons of flood frequency estimates at sites with sufficiently long streamgage records in the Midwest, and selected urban sites throughout the United States. The predictive accuracy and systematic biases (under- or over-estimation) of the approaches was evaluated based on forty-six Midwest sites and twenty-one urban sites. The sensitivity of several watershed characteristics such as soil properties, slope, and land use classification was also explored.

Retrospective Analysis of Larger Planning Procedures in the Coastal Zone under the Perspective of "ICZM Suitability" ¤ The objective of the interdisciplinary RETRO project, supported by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF), was to analyze current practice in planning procedures in terms of their ICZM compatibility by means of a retrospective analysis of 10 large-scale project approval and planning procedures in the German coastal zone so as to be able to provide guidelines for the implementation of ICZM in Germany on this basis. Since the requirements for good ICZM practice have not been adequately specified to date, we developed 17 criteria for good ICZM practice using, in particular, the existing EU ICZM papers as the basis. The focus here is on the procedural aspects of negotiation and integration as well as the material aspects of a relative strengthening of ecological sustainability. We operationalized the criteria through formulation of 55 assessable indicators. This set of indicators for good ICZM practice can be used beyond the RETRO framework as a basis for discussion in connection with the implementation of ICZM. The analysis of planning practice and of the underlying legal tools, which was conducted with an eye to ICZM compatibility on the basis of the indicators, shows in a synopsis that the set of planning tools established in the German coastal region meets in part the ICZM demands for negotiation, integration and appropriate consideration of the ecological aspects of sustainability. In view of this background, the implementation of ICZM in Germany should, in our view, be carried out on the basis of the existing legal planning framework. However, the analysis also revealed substantial deficits. Therefore, implementation of ICZM in Germany is not possible without a number of adaptations and extensions of the planning tools, which are designated as recommendations for action. In addition to the required broadening of the opportunities for participation, the recommendations focus especially on significant strengthening and extension of regional planning in general and of the regional planning procedure in particular. A number of recommendations, such as that for relative reinforcement of the ecological aspect of sustainability and for improvement of territorial integration, also refer beyond planning processes to more fundamental aspects of the governmental and political decision-making system.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4261540-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4346301-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121387-7>

Set-valued mappings and enlargements of monotone operators ¤ Set-valued analysis is an essential tool for the mathematical formulation of many real-life situations, e.g., equilibrium theory in mathematical economics. This work offers the first comprehensive treatment in book form of the fairly new subdiscipline of enlargements of maximal monotone operators, including several important new results in the field. In the last decades, with the development of nonsmooth optimization, effective algorithms have been developed to solve these kinds of problems, such as nonsmooth variational inequalities. Several of these methods, such as bundle methods for variational problems, are fully developed and analyzed in this book. The first chapters provide a self-contained review of the basic notions and fundamental results in set-valued analysis, including set convergence and continuity of set-valued mappings together with many important results in infinite-dimensional convex analysis, leading to the classical fixed point results due to Ekeland, Caristi and Kakutani. Next, an in-depth introduction to monotone operators is developed, emphasizing results related to maximality of subdifferentials and of sums of monotone operators. Building on this foundational material, the second part of the monograph contains new results (all of them established during the last decade) on the concept of enlargements of monotone operators, with applications to variational inequalities, bundle-type methods, augmented Lagrangian methods, and proximal point algorithms	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4137027-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4401290-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4138566-4>

Health as a Social System : Luhmann's theory applied to health systems : an introduction ¤ While it has become fashionable in the arena of international health to think about health systems, the theoretical underpinning of Niklas Luhmann's vast and productive theory has been given too little consideration in the field. It is rich in concepts that can facilitate a fuller understanding of what health systems are. João Costa applies these concepts and shows the analytical possibilities they open up. He argues concisely how Luhmann's Social Systems Theory offers an integrated theoretical body as well as a consistent articulation of concepts that can lay the groundwork for a vastly improved health systems thinking	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4020775-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058812-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055764-9>

Classical circuit theory ¤ Classical Circuit Theory provides readers with the fundamental, analytic properties of linear circuits that are important to the design of conventional and non-conventional circuits in modern communication systems. These properties include the relations between phase and gain, between the real and imaginary parts, and between phase and group delay. They also include the fundamental limitations on gain and bandwidth, which are important in broadband matching in amplifier design. The idea that an impedance function is a positive real function and that a transfer function is bounded-real, forms the basis for analytic design of all conventional filters. At the same time, mathematical programming tools are now widely available so that design of non-conventional circuits by optimization is but a few mouse clicks away. Every new concept within the material is illustrated with one or more examples. There are exercises and problems at the end of the chapters. Some may be suitable for term projects. The design techniques presented are also illustrated step by step with easy-to-follow examples.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041066-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4179392-4>

A tangential regularization method for backflow stabilization in hemodynamics ¤ In computational simulations of fluid flows, instabilities at the Neumann boundaries may appear during backflow regime. It is widely accepted that this is due to the incoming energy at the boundary, coming from the convection term, which cannot be controlled when the velocity field is unknown. We propose a stabilized formulation based on a local regularization of the fluid velocity along the tangential directions on the Neumann boundaries. The stabilization term is proportional to the amount of backflow, and does not require any further assumption on the velocity profile. The perfomance of the method is assessed on a twoand three-dimensional Womersley flows, as well as considering a hemodynamic physiological regime in a patient-specific aortic geometry.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4024665-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4690080-9>

The endless city : the urban age project by the London School of Economics and Deutsche Bank's Alfred Herrhausen Society ¤ At the turn of the twenty-first century, the world is faced with an unprecedented challenge. It must address a fundamental shift in the world's population towards the cities, and away from mankind's rural roots. Over the course of two years, a group of internationally renowned professionals from a variety of different disciplines and backgrounds gathered together in six world cities to take stock of the new urban condition and to offer an approach to dealing with it. The result was a sometimes passionate, always challenging and informed debate on how architects, urbanists, politicians and policy makers can constructively plan the infrastructure and development of the endless city, to promote a better social and economic life for its citizens.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056730-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125924-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4064115-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063234-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056723-0>

Timelining experiment for the MIR'97 mission : Final Report ¤ The international character of future manned space missions will compel the involvement of several international space agencies in mission planning tasks. Additionally, the community of users requires a higher degree of freedom for experiment planning. Both of these problems can be solved by a decentralized mission planning concept using the so-called "envelope method", by which resources are allocated to users by distributing resource profiles ("envelopes") with define resource availabilities at specified times ...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4475739-6>

Embedded systems design : the ARTIST roadmap for research and development ¤ This extensive and increasing use of embedded systems and their integration in everyday products mark a significant evolution in information science and technology. Nowadays embedded systems design is subject to seamless integration with the physical and electronic environment while meeting requirements like reliability, availability, robustness, power consumption, cost, and deadlines. Thus, embedded systems design raises challenging problems for research, such as security, reliable and mobile services, large-scale heterogeneous distributed systems, adaptation, component-based development, and validation and tool-based certification. This book results from the ARTIST FP5 project funded by the European Commision. By integration 28 leading European research institutions with many top researchers in the area, this book assesses and strategically advances the state of the art in embedded systems. The coherently written monograph-like book is a valuable source of reference for researchers active in the field and serves well as an introduction to scientists and professionals interested in learning about embedded systems design	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4116522-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131397-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4396978-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4159103-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4496068-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4261480-6>

Expert forecast on emerging chemical risks related to occupational safety and health ¤ INTRODUCTION -- Methodology -- Expert participation -- Main emerging chemical risks identified -- Complete results of the survey -- Conclusion It is estimated that about 74,000 work-related deaths may be linked to hazardous substances at work each year in the EU - about 10 times more than workplace accidents. About 15% of European workers report handling chemical products for a quarter of their working time and 19% report breathing in dust, fumes and smoke in their workplaces. The 49 experts from 21 European countries who participated in this forecast highlighted particles and dusts as major emerging concerns and put nanoparticles at the top of the list of emerging risks. Other main groups of emerging risks identified were carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances, and the increasing use of allergenic and sensitizing substances. Specific occupations of emerging concerns were also highlighted and include the increasing waste management industry, construction, and service activities such as cleaning or home nursing. In addition, there is a growing number of workers in SMEs and sub-contracted jobs, where the management of chemical risks is generally poorer. Concern about multiple exposures is increasing as it was also shown in the three other forecasts on emerging biological, physical and psychosocial emerging risks.--Publisher's description	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4009833-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002741-7>
Analytical ultracentrifugation of polymers and nanoparticles : 5 tables ¤ Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) is a powerful method for the characterization of polymers, biopolymers, polyelectrolytes, nanoparticles, dispersions, and other colloidal systems. The method is able to determine the molar mass, the particle size, the particle density and interaction parameters like virial coefficients and association constants. Because AUC is also a fractionation method, the determination of the molar mass distribution, the particle size distribution, and the particle density distribution is possible. A special technique, the density gradient method, allows fractionating heterogeneous samples according to their chemical nature that means being able to detect chemical heterogeneity. The book is divided into chapters concerning instrumentation, sedimentation velocity runs, density gradient runs, application examples and future developments. In particular, the detailed application chapter demonstrates the versatility and power of AUC by means of many interesting and important industrial examples. Thus the book concentrates on practical aspects rather than details of centrifugation theory. Both authors have many years of experience in an industrial AUC research laboratory of a world leading chemical company.

A perturbation result for dynamical contact problems ¤ This paper is intended to be a first step towards the continuous dependence of dynamical contact problems on the initial data as well as the uniqueness of a solution. Moreover, it provides the basis for a proof of the convergence of popular time integration schemes as the Newmark method. We study a frictionless dynamical contact problem between both linearly elastic and viscoelastic bodies which is formulated via the Signorini contact conditions. For viscoelastic materials fulfilling the Kelvin-Voigt constitutive law, we find a characterization of the class of problems which satisfy a perturbation result in a non-trivial mix of norms in function space. This characterization is given in the form of a stability condition on the contact stresses at the contact boundaries. Furthermore, we present perturbation results for two well-established approximations of the classical Signorini condition: The Signorini condition formulated in velocities and the model of normal compliance, both satisfying even a sharper version of our stability condition.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4063621-5>

Policy vision for sustainable rural economies in an enlarged Europe ¤ Implemented by a joint initiative of ARL and DATAR (Délégation à l'Aménagement du Territoire et à l'Action Régionale) an international group of experts elaborated the Vision encompassing the shift from a sectoral, i.e. pure agricultural policy of today, to a territorial policy for rural regions to be implemented over a 25 year time horizon. This policy constitutes a desired vision for Europe's rural areas which requires: (1) appropriate institutions, (2) diversifying the economic activities in rural areas, and (3) integrating agricultural and rural policy. To achieve that shift to an integrated policy we need - new institutional frameworks, both on European and national levels, - effective instruments to guarantee the sustainable use of natural resources in agriculture, - the care for the rural population as a whole not only for farmers, - the improvement of quality products and production processes meeting the required environmental and animal welfare standards guaranteeing international competitiveness, - compatibility of the single European market for agricultural products with respect to prices and safety standards with commitments under the WTO, - a policy design and implementation at a decentralised level, and - a coordination of that policy at European and national levels for the benefit to implement the principles of solidarity and cohesion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4000771-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034450-2>

Fuzzy logic and the internet ¤ The unrestrainable explosion of the world wide web is not bereft of troubles and drawbacks, especially for inexpert users. Therefore there is a strong need of new research approaches in term of theories and systems. The main objective of this book is to provide new tools and ideas to enhance the power of the internet and search engines. Among these new research trends an important role is played by technologies that enable to process imprecise information, and to perform approximate reasoning capability. This book written by leading experts in their field demonstrates the ability of Fuzzy Technology to exploit the tolerance for imprecision to achieve tractability, robustness, and low solution costs and it shows that soft computing methods are a good choice to face complex Web problems.

Handbook of nonlinear partial differential equations ¤ PREFACE TO THE NEW EDITION The Handbook of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations, a unique reference for scientists and engineers, contains over 3,000 nonlinear partial differential equations with solutions, as well as exact, symbolic, and numerical methods for solving nonlinear equations. First, second, third, fourthand higherorder nonlinear equations and systems of equations are considered. Equations of parabolic, hyperbolic, elliptic, mixed, and general types are discussed. A large number of new exact solutions to nonlinear equations are described. In total, the handbook contains several times more nonlinear PDEs and exact solutions than any other book currently available. In selecting the material, the authors gave the highest priority to the following fivemajor types of equations: - Equations that arise in various applications (heat and mass transfer theory, wave theory, nonlinear mechanics, hydrodynamics, gas dynamics, plasticity theory, nonlinear acoustics, combustion theory, nonlinear optics, theoretical physics, differential geometry, control theory, chemical engineering sciences, biology, and others). - Equations of general form that depend on arbitrary functions; exact solutions of such equations are of principal value for testing numerical and approximate methods. - Equations forwhich the general solution or solutions of quite general form, with arbitrary functions, could be obtained. - Equations that involve many free parameters. - Equations whose solution is reduced to solving linear partial differential equations or linear integral equations. The second edition has been substantially updated, revised, and expanded. More than 1,500 new equations with exact solutions, as well some methods and many examples, have been added	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128900-6>

Java for bioinformatics and biomedical applications ¤ The science and practice of medicine has undergone a fundamental change as a result of large-scale genome projects that led to the sequencing of a number of important microbial, plant and animal genomes in the last 5 years. This book aims to combine industry standard software engineering and design principles, genomics and bioinformatics and cancer research. It focuses on creating and integrating practical, useful tools for the scientific community in the context of real-life, real-value biomedical problems that researchers face on a routine basis, rather than being just a didactic exercise in learning a programming platform. The book leverages technologies for molecular biology, genomics and bioinformatics and cancer research developed by the NIH, NCI-Center for Bioinformatics (NCICB), the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, a division of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the NIH) and Stanford University.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4611085-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4401313-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4120906-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4647152-2>

History of Banach spaces and linear operators ¤ Named for one of the great mathematicians of the twentieth century, Banach spaces figure prominently in the study of functional analysis, having applications to integral and differential equations, approximation theory, harmonic analysis, convex geometry, numerical mathematics, analytic complexity, and probability theory. This work, written by a distinguished specialist in functional analysis, is devoted to a comprehensive treatment of the history of Banach spaces and (abstract bounded) linear operators. While other comprehensive texts on Banach spaces focus on developments before 1950, this one is mainly devoted to the second half of the twentieth century. Banach space theory is presented as a part of a broad mathematics context, using tools from such areas as set theory, topology, algebra, combinatorics, probability theory, logic, etc. Equal emphasis is given to both spaces and operators. Numerous examples and counterexamples elucidate the scope of the underlying concepts. As a stimulus for further research, the text also contains many problems which have not been previously solved. The book may serve as a reference and introduction for graduate students and researchers who want to learn Banach space theory with some historical flavor.

Nonlinear theory of pseudodifferential equations on a half-line ¤ This book is the first attempt to develop systematically a general theory of the initial-boundary value problems for nonlinear evolution equations with pseudodifferential operators Ku on a half-line or on a segment. We study traditionally important problems, such as local and global existence of solutions and their properties, in particular much attention is drawn to the asymptotic behavior of solutions for large time. Up to now the theory of nonlinear initial-boundary value problems with a general pseudodifferential operator has not been well developed due to its difficulty. There are many open natural questions. Firstly how many boundary data should we pose on the initial-boundary value problems for its correct solvability? As far as we know there are few results in the case of nonlinear nonlocal equations. The methods developed in this book are applicable to a wide class of dispersive and dissipative nonlinear equations, both local and nonlocal. For the first time the definition of pseudodifferential operator on a half-line and a segment is done A wide class of nonlinear nonlocal and local equations is considered Developed theory is general and applicable to different equations The book is written clearly, many examples are considered Asymptotic formulas can be used for numerical computations by engineers and physicists The authors are recognized experts in the nonlinear wave phenomena	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121533-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4251279-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4158789-3>

Metric structures in differential geometry ¤ This text is an elementary introduction to differential geometry. The only prerequisites are a solid background in Calculus, linear algebra, and basic point-set topology. The first chapter covers the fundamentals of differentiable manifolds that are the bread and butter of differential geometry. All the usual topics are covered, culminating in Stokes? theorem together with some applications. The following chapters are devoted to fiber bundles, homotopy theory of fibrations, vector bundles, Euclidean bundles and Riemannian connections, and then a brief excursion into the realm of Riemannian geometry. The final chapter concludes with Chern-Weil theory, introducing the Pontrjagin, Euler, and Chern characteristic classes of a vector bundle. This book can be used for a one-semester course on manifolds or bundles, or a two-semester course in differential geometry.

A direct simulation Monte Carlo method for the Uehling-Uhlenbeck-Boltzmann equation ¤ In this paper we describe a DSMC algorithm for the Uehling-Uhlenbeck-Boltzmann equation in terms of Markov processes. This provides a unifying framework for both the classical Boltzmann case as well as the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein cases. We establish the foundation of the algorithm by demonstrating its link to the kinetic equation. By numerical experiments we study its sensitivity to the number of simulation particles and to the discretization of the velocity space, when approximating the steady state distribution.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1150802073>

Electron scattering in solid matter : a theoretical and computational treatise ¤ Addressing graduate students and researchers, this book gives a very detailed theoretical and computational description of multiple scattering in solid matter. Particular emphasis is placed on solids with reduced dimensions, on full potential approaches and on relativistic treatments. For the first time approaches such as the Screened Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method are reviewed, considering all formal steps such as single-site scattering, structure constants and screening transformations, and also the numerical point of view. Furthermore, a very general approach is presented for solving the Poisson equation, needed within density functional theory in order to achieve self-consistency. Special chapters are devoted to the Coherent Potential Approximation and to the Embedded Cluster Method, used, for example, for describing nanostructured matter in real space. In a final chapter, physical properties related to the (single-particle) Green's function, such as magnetic anisotropies, interlayer exchange coupling, electric and magneto-optical transport and spin-waves, serve to illustrate the usefulness of the methods described.

FS Poseidon Fahrtbericht/Cruise report POS316 : Carbonate mounds and aphotic corals in the NE-Atlantic ; Reykjavik - Lisbon 03.08. - 17.08.04 ¤ POSEIDON No 316 was a multidisciplinary cruise addressing biological, geological and hydrographical scientific objectives in the carbonate mound and aphotic coral province west of Ireland in the eastern Porcupine Seabight and at the western Rockall Bank. The main objective was to investigate the interrelation between the rich aphotic coral ecosystems found in these regions and diurnal and seasonal processes in the ambient hydro-dynamical and depositional regime as these factors seem to bias the conditions of coral growth and reproduction. The cruise started in Reykjavik and ended in Lisbon and continued the 2004 investigations in the Irish carbonate mound province with FS METEOR (M61 leg 1, 20040418 - 20040505). The scientific work is embedded in the "ESF-DFG" Moundforce project of the EUROMARGINS Programme. Together with the previous M61 cruise, the POSEIDON activities document Germany's strong scientific and logistic support for the success of this challenging programme. Investigations are also designed as a preparatory cruise for the EU-project HERMES (Hotspot Ecosystem Research on the Margins of European Seas; start 20050401). The institutions participating in POSEIDON 316 are partners in HERMES Work Package 2 "Coral Reef and Carbonate Mound Systems".

Electron beam curing of composites ¤ Electron beam curing technology for advanced composites has emerged as a credible and attractive alternative to thermal curing for most composite products. Technical advantages, such as aerospace structures, include curing at room temperature, using low-cost tooling, and the ability to fabricate large integrated structure including structures too large to fit inside autoclaves. Studies by aerospace companies have shown potential cost savings of 10-60% by using electron beam curing. In this book, both theoretical and practical aspects of electron beam curing of composites are presented, intending to build a bridge between the academic knowledge and the industrial applications.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4238062-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4033676-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062670-2>
Biomedical inorganic polymers : bioactivity and applications of natural and synthetic polymeric inorganic molecules ¤ This book summarizes the present state of knowledge on a number of inorganic polymers with respect to their potential biomedical applications. In recent years, inorganic polymers have attracted much attention in nano-biomedicine, in particular in the areas of regenerative medicine and drug delivery. The growing interest in these polymers has been further accelerated by the development of new synthetic and analytical methods in the field of nanotechnology and nanochemistry. Examples of biomedical inorganic polymers that have been proven to exhibit biomedical effects and/or have been applied in preclinical or clinical trials are polysilicate / silica glass (such as naturally formed biosilica and synthetic bioglass) and inorganic polyphosphate. Some biomedical inorganic polymers have already been applied e.g. as bioglass for bone repair and bone tissue engineering, or are used in food processing and in dental care (inorganic polyphosphates). However, there are a number of further biological and medicinal properties of these polymers that have been elucidated in the last few years but not yet been applied for treatment of humans. In addition to polysilicates and polyphosphate, there are a series of other inorganic polymers including polyarsenate and polyvanadate, the biological / biomedical properties of which have been only marginally studied so far. Moreover, the combined application of inorganic polymers and organic polymeric molecules (formation of organic-inorganic hybrid materials) provides a variety of new materials with novel property combinations and diverse applications in nanomedicine	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4145589-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4142565-0>
Modular and incremental global model management with extended generalized discrimination networks ¤ Complex projects developed under the model-driven engineering paradigm nowadays often involve several interrelated models, which are automatically processed via a multitude of model operations. Modular and incremental construction and execution of such networks of models and model operations are required to accommodate efficient development with potentially large-scale models. The underlying problem is also called Global Model Management. In this report, we propose an approach to modular and incremental Global Model Management via an extension to the existing technique of Generalized Discrimination Networks (GDNs). In addition to further generalizing the notion of query operations employed in GDNs, we adapt the previously query-only mechanism to operations with side effects to integrate model transformation and model synchronization. We provide incremental algorithms for the execution of the resulting extended Generalized Discrimination Networks (eGDNs), as well as a prototypical implementation for a number of example eGDN operations. Based on this prototypical implementation, we experiment with an application scenario from the software development domain to empirically evaluate our approach with respect to scalability and conceptually demonstrate its applicability in a typical scenario. Initial results confirm that the presented approach can indeed be employed to realize efficient Global Model Management in the considered scenario.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4300400-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4832365-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4367653-4>

Nanostructures : theory and modeling ¤ Progress in nanoscience is becoming increasingly dependent on simulation and modeling.This is due to a combination of three factors: the reduced size of nano-objects, the increasing power of computers, and the development of new theoretical methods. This book represents the first attempt to provide the theoretical background needed by physicists, engineers and students to simulate nano-devices, semiconductor quantum dots and molecular devices. It presents in a unified way the theoretical concepts, the more recent semi-empirical and ab initio methods, and their application to experiments. The topics include quantum confinement, dielectric and optical properties, non-radiative processes, defects and impurities, and quantum transport. This guidebook not only provides newcomers with an accessible overview (requiring only basic knowledge of quantum mechanics and solid-state physics) but also provides active researchers with practical simulation tools.

Light in architecture: the intangible material ¤ Light in Architecture explores the role and use of light in and around buildings from the time that Stonehenge was built through to the present day, illustrating how a greater understanding of this intangible and free material will lead us to better architecture and, ultimately, improve our quality of life. Translated and carefully updated from the best-selling Spanish book, La Materia Intangible, this full colour edition explains why light is so fundamental to human perception, how its nature and use are influenced by time and place, and how it has come to be used as a tool for abstract architectural design. Drawing on centuries of thinking and over 40 real-life, international exemplars, the book explores the different ways that light can be harnessed and manipulated to achieve particular objectives, emotions or experiences, as well as how the technologies and techniques for doing so have developed over time. Importantly for today's cities, Light in Architecture also looks at what happens when we build in, on or around our pre-existing architecture, identifying how we can improve, restore or even destroy light in the process.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035596-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002851-3>

Integrated chemical microsensor systems in CMOS technology ¤ Beginning with a comprehensive survey of existing semiconductor-based chemical microsensors and microsystems, this book proceeds to describe in detail CMOS technology-based chemical microsensor systems. The benefits of using CMOS-technology for developing chemical microsensor systems and, in particular, monolithically integrated sensor systems comprising transducers and associated circuitry are laid out. Several successful realizations of such microsensor systems are presented. First, the fundamentals of the chemical sensing process itself will be elucidated followed by a short description of microfabrication techniques and the CMOS substrate. Thereafter, a comprehensive overview of semiconductor-based and CMOS-based transducer structures and their applications is given. It is shown that CMOS-technology can be successfully used as platform technology to integrate microtransducers with the necessary driving and signal conditioning circuitry, and, in a next step, to develop monolithic multisensor arrays and fully developed microsystems with on-chip sensor control and standard interfaces. The book concludes with a brief outlook to future developments such as interfacing cells with CMOS microelectronics.

Babelsberg/RML : Executable semantics and language testing with RML ¤ New programming language designs are often evaluated on concrete implementations. However, in order to draw conclusions about the language design from the evaluation of concrete programming languages, these implementations need to be verified against the formalism of the design. To that end, we also have to ensure that the design actually meets its stated goals. A useful tool for the latter has been to create an executable semantics from a formalism that can execute a test suite of examples. However, this mechanism so far did not allow to verify an implementation against the design. Babelsberg is a new design for a family of object-constraint languages. Recently, we have developed a formal semantics to clarify some issues in the design of those languages. Supplementing this work, we report here on how this formalism is turned into an executable operational semantics using the RML system. Furthermore, we show how we extended the executable semantics to create a framework that can generate test suites for the concrete Babelsberg implementations that provide traceability from the design to the language. Finally, we discuss how these test suites helped us find and correct mistakes in the Babelsberg implementation for JavaScript.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4293502-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4680186-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4141876-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4122144-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4545513-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4653817-3>

Effective field theories in flavour physics ¤ The book constitutes a compact review of the applications of effective field theory methods in flavour physics, with emphasis on heavy quark physics. Some of the relevant applications are discussed to illustrate the method. It covers the full range of theoretical tools related to the application of the effective field theory idea: Starting from the weak interactions as an effective theory derived from the standard model, well-established methods such as heavy quark effective theory, the heavy quark mass expansion and chiral perturbation theory are addressed. Also more recent ideas such as QCD factorization and soft collinear effective theory are outlined. Finally the standard model itself is viewed as an effective theory, allowing a model-independent look at the results of the new physics. The book should be useful for the advanced graduate student as well as for scientists who are interested in the theoretical toolkit used in the context of flavour physics. It is not meant as a complete review of the subject, rather it should be useful as an introduction to the basic ideas.

Spatially structured evolutionary algorithms : artificial evolution in space and time ; with 21 tables ¤ Evolutionary algorithms (EA) today are a mature problem-solving family of heuristics that has found its way into many practical important real-life problems and into leading-edge scientific research. Spatially structured EA have different properties than standard mixing EA. By virtue of the structured disposition of the population members they bring about new dynamical features that can be harnessed to solve difficult problems faster and more efficiently. This book describes the state of the art in spatially structured EA by using graph concepts as a unifying theme. The models, their analysis, and their empirical behavior are presented in detail. Moreover, there is new material on non-standard networked population structures such as small-world networks. The book should be of interest to advanced undergraduate and graduate students working in evolutionary computation, machine learning, and optimization. It should also be useful to researchers and professionals working in fields where the topological structure of populations and their evolution plays a role	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4366912-8>

Computational methods for physicists : compendium for students ¤ This book helps advanced undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students in their daily work by offering them a compendium of numerical methods. The choice of methods pays significant attention to error estimates, stability and convergence issues as well as to the ways to optimize program execution speeds. Many examples are given throughout the chapters, and each chapter is followed by at least a handful of more comprehensive problems which may be dealt with, for example, on a weekly basis in a one- or two-semester course. In these end-of-chapter problems the physics background is pronounced, and the main text preceding them is intended as an introduction or as a later reference. Less stress is given to the explanation of individual algorithms. It is tried to induce in the reader an own independent thinking and a certain amount of scepticism [skepticism] and scrutiny instead of blindly following readily available commercial tools. --	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4273564-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4037952-8>

Angle and spin resolved Auger emission : theory and applications to atoms and molecules ¤ The Auger effect must be interpreted as the radiationless counterpart of photoionization and is usually described within a two-step model. Angle and spin resolved Auger emission physics deals with the theoretical and numerical description, analysis and interpretation of such types of experiments on free atoms and molecules. This monograph derives the general theory applying the density matrix formalism and, in terms of irreducible tensorial sets, so called state multipoles and order parameters, for parameterizing the atomic and molecular systems, respectively. Propensity rules and non-linear dependencies between the angular distribution and spin polarization parameters are included in the discussion. The numerical approaches utilizing relativistic distorted wave (RDWA), multiconfigurational Dirac-Fock (MCDF), and Greens operator methods are described. These methods are discussed and applied to theoretical predictions, numerical results and experimental data for a variety of atomic systems, especially the rare gases, and to simple molecules. The book was written for graduate and post-graduate students and researchers working in this field and/or trying to get a closer insight into the theoretical description of multistep scattering processes in atomic and molecular physics.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4143465-1>

The design methodology proposed is able to reproduce and outperform the major current design approaches, where this superior performance stems from the following properties: uncertainty on the input period is explicitly accounted for, periodic performance being traded-off against conflicting design objectives and controller design being translated into a convex optimization problem, guaranteeing the efficient computation of its global optimum.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043664-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035819-7>

When states fail : causes and consequences ¤ Verlagsinfo: Since 1990, more than 10 million people have been killed in the civil wars of failed states, and hundreds of millions more have been deprived of fundamental rights. The threat of terrorism has only heightened the problem posed by failed states. When States Fail is the first book to examine how and why states decay and what, if anything, can be done to prevent them from collapsing. It defines and categorizes strong, weak, failing, and collapsed nation-states according to political, social, and economic criteria. And it offers a comprehensive recipe for their reconstruction. This book comprises fourteen essays by leading scholars and practitioners who help structure this disparate field of research, provide useful empirical descriptions, and offer policy recommendations. Robert Rotberg's substantial opening chapter sets out a theory and taxonomy of state failure. It is followed by two sets of chapters, the first on the nature and correlates of failure, the second on methods of preventing state failure and reconstructing those states that do fail. Economic jump-starting, legal refurbishing, elections, the demobilizing of ex-combatants, and civil society are among the many topics discussed.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4049012-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056618-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4065449-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4035043-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4264286-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128497-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/7687452-7>

Alleviating urban traffic congestion ¤ In 2000, the average driver in US metropolitan areas endured 27 hours of traffic delays, a rise from 7 hours in 1980. In many other countries, traffic delays are considerably worse than in the United States, and in developing countries urban traffic congestion is increasing with alarming rapidity. For fifty years, economists have been advocating congestion pricing as the way to deal with urban traffic congestion; but today, even after some successes, congestion pricing is encountering considerable political resistance. The authors of Alleviating Urban Traffic Congestion advocate active consideration of more microscopic policies that attack the problem at the scale at which actual policy decisions are made. Microscopic models, rather than macroscopic models that are too simplified and too aggregated, they argue, will lead to the analysis of a wider and more creative range of policies, at least some of which should work well and be politically acceptable. After developing the themes of the book, the authors illustrate them by examining some areas of urban transport policy that have been neglected by the macroscopic approach. These include downtown parking policy, the encouragement of bicycling, the staggering of work hours by dominant employers, and the use by medium-sized cities of a "multimode" ticket that charges cars entering the city center a toll equal to the transit fare. The reorientation of urban transport analysis that they advocate will by no means eliminate traffic delays but should speed up the adoption of a richer, more flexible, and ultimately more effective set of policies to alleviate urban traffic congestion.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056783-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4272352-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062955-7>
Solitary waves in dispersive complex media : theory, simulation, applications ¤ This book is devoted to one of the most interesting and rapidly developing areas of modern nonlinear physics and mathematics - the theoretical, analytical and advanced numerical study of the structure and dynamics of one-dimensional as well as two- and three-dimensional solitons and nonlinear waves described by Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP), nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) and derivative NLS (DNLS) classes of equations. Special attention is paid to generalizations (relevant to various complex physical media) of these equations, accounting for higher-order dispersion corrections, influence of dissipation, instabilities, and stochastic fluctuations of the wave fields. The book addresses researchers working in the theory and numerical simulations of dispersive complex media in such fields as hydrodynamics, plasma physics, and aerodynamics. It will also be useful as a reference work for graduate students in physics and mathematics.

Network evolution, success, and regional development in the European aerospace industry ¤ The success breeds success hypothesis has been mainly applied to theoretical network approaches. We investigate the European aerospace industry using data on the European Framework Programmes and on Airbus suppliers, focusing on the success breeds success hypothesis at four levels of analysis: the spatial structure of the European aerospace R&D collaboration network, its topological architecture, the individual actors that make up the network, and through a comparison of the Airbus invention and production networks. On the spatial level, SBS is favored: successful regions maintain their position and grow on a large scale, especially so for regions that have strongly participated from the very beginning. The regional hub structure is mirrored in the architecture of the European aerospace R&D collaboration network, where well-connected hub organizations play a key role in shaping the structure of the network through their many collaborative partnerships and do so in a way that strategically positions themselves with greater ability to access and regulate knowledge flows, as assessed by several centrality measures. Only successful organizations have the ability to form so many ties, with success thus breeding success in the European aerospace R&D collaboration network. The importance of the core organizations made clear through the centrality analysis is further supported by the analysis of weak ties, where we observe that the core organizations are connected to the rest of the network with many weak ties, thereby confirming their outstanding positions in the European aerospace R&D collaboration network as being able to access knowledge or other resources. With the combination of the R&D collaboration network and the Airbus production network on a spatial level, we see additional support for SBS, as those regions whose actors are frequent participants in both networks show the greatest share of successful actors. The European aerospace industry shows an ambidextrous character as a whole, which is nonetheless insufficient to avoid recent and future challenges demanding a strong emphasis on production skills.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4076601-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048576-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4171529-9>
Membrane transport mechanism : 3D structure and beyond ¤ This book provides a molecular view of membrane transport by means of numerous biochemical and biophysical techniques. The rapidly growing number of atomic structures of transporters in different conformations and the constant progress in bioinformatics have recently added deeper insights. The unifying mechanism of energized solute transport across membranes is assumed to consist of the conformational cycling of a carrier protein to provide access to substrate binding sites from either side of a cellular membrane. Due to the central role of active membrane transport there is considerable interest in deciphering the principles of one of the most fundamental processes in nature: the alternating access mechanism. This book brings together particularly significant structure-function studies on a variety of carrier systems from different transporter families: Glutamate symporters, LeuT-like fold transporters, MFS transporters and SMR (RND) exporters, as well as ABC-type importers. The selected examples impressively demonstrate how the combination of functional analysis, crystallography, investigation of dynamics and computational studies has made it possible to create a conclusive picture, or, more precisely, a molecular movie. Although we are still far from a complete molecular description of the alternating access mechanism, remarkable progress has been made from static snapshots towards membrane transport dynamics. --	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4038575-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4183784-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4213127-3>

Progress towards the European 2010 biodiversity target ¤ As the first indicator-based assessment of progress towards the European target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010, this report serves two purposes. First, it takes stock of the state of biodiversity and its loss in Europe based on the most recent data available. Second, it functions as a bridge to a comprehensive assessment of the 2010 target to be done in 2010. As such, the indicators in this report do not only show what is currently known. They also show where information is missing and what more needs to be measured and examined to enable a comprehensive assessment in 2010	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4131912-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4115348-0>

Tree rings and natural hazards : a state-of-the-art ¤ The initial employment of tree rings in natural hazard studies was simply as a dating tool and rarely exploited other environmental information and records of damage contained within the tree. However, these unique, annually resolved, tree-ring records preserve valuable archives of past earth-surface processes on timescales of decades to centuries. As many of these processes are significant natural hazards, understanding their distribution, timing and controls provides valuable information that can assist in the prediction, mitigation and defence against these hazards and their effects on society. Tree Rings and Natural Hazards provides many illustrations of these themes, demonstrating the application of tree rings to studies of snow avalanches, rockfalls, landslides, floods, earthquakes, wildfires and several other processes. Several of the chapters are 'classic studies', others represent recent applications using previously unpublished material. They illustrate the breadth and diverse applications of contemporary dendrogeomorphology and underline the growing potential to expand such studies, possibly leading to the establishment of a range of techniques and approaches that may become standard practice in the analysis of natural hazards in the future.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041387-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4149072-1>

Stability and transition: theory and application : efficient numerical methods with computer programs ; with 14 tables and a CD-ROM ¤ This book addresses transition from laminar to turbulent flows and considers solutions, mainly with the help of the linear stability theory and the ways in which it can be implemented accurately by numerical procedures. The main concern is transition of wall boundary layers, although one chapter is devoted to an approach based on the Navier-Stokes equations. The first three chapters summarize physical knowledge of the transition process, consider the stability equations and methods for predicting transition by linear stability theory, and describe efficient and accurate numerical methods for the solution of stability equations. Chapters 4 to 7 describe computer programs based on stability-theory approach to identify the location of transition in two- and three-dimensional incompressible and compressible flows, respectively, and Chapter 7 describes a computer program within the framework of parabolized stability equations. These programs are provided on a CD-ROM.

The Cambridge encyclopedia of space : missions, applications and exploration ¤ Offers a history of space exploration by missions from around the world. Annotation. Since the lift-off of Sputnik in 1957, over 8,000 satellites and spacecraft have been launched from over thirty countries, costing hundreds of billions of dollars. While only about 350 people have made the incredible journey beyond our atmosphere, we all benefit in countless ways from the missions. An authoritative and accessible source that collects information on man's quest to explore the Universe, The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Space, provides a global perspective of our occupation and use of space, whether for scientific, industrial, commercial, technical, or military purposes. The authors set the stage by describing the space environment, orbits and ground tracks, launchers and launch sites. Subsequently, they discuss the main space applications (telecommunications, navigation and Earth observation, military), plus science missions, planetary exploration, and space stations. Extensively illustrated with more than 300 illustrations, maps, and graphs, The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Space will be an invaluable resource for everyone interested in our use of space, and the perfect reference for those working in the space arena	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4048574-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177061-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4117629-7>
Organic mechanisms : reactions, stereochemistry and synthesis ¤ This English edition of a best-selling and award-winning German textbook Reaction Mechanisms: Organic Reactions, Stereochemistry, Modern Synthetic Methods is aimed at those who desire to learn organic chemistry through an approach that is facile to understand and easily committed to memory. Michael Harmata, Norman Rabjohn Distinguished Professor of Organic Chemistry (University of Missouri) surveyed the accuracy of the translation, made certain contributions, and above all adapted its rationalizations to those prevalent in the organic chemistry community in the English-speaking world. "Throughout the book fundamental and advanced reaction mechanisms are presented with meticulous precision. The systematic use of red "electron-pushing arrows" allows students to follow each transformation elementary step by elementary step. Mechanisms are not only presented in the traditional contexts of rate laws and substituent effects but, whenever possible, are illustrated using practical, useful and state-of-the-art reactions. The abundance of stereoselective reactions included in the treatise makes the reader familiar with key concepts of stereochemistry. "The fundamental topics of the book address the needs of upper-level undergraduate students, while its advanced sections are intended for graduate-level audiences. Accordingly, this book is an essential learning tool for students and a unique addition to the reference desk of practicing organic chemists, who as life-long learners desire to keep abreast of both fundamental and applied aspects of our science. In addition, it will well serve ambitious students in chemistry-related fields such as biochemistry, medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry."--BOOK JACKET	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4043793-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177123-0>

Nanobiomaterials handbook ¤ The Nanobiomaterials Handbook aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the field of nanobiomaterials with a broad introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the subject and as a useful reference for advanced professionals. Nanobiomaterials are poised to play a central role in nanobiotechnology and make significant contributions to biomedical research and health care. This assessment is based on numerous demonstrations that nanobiomaterials can exhibit distinctive nanoscopic characteristics (e.g., mechanical, electrical, and optical properties) suitable for a variety of biological applications. Advances in nanobiomaterials require a multidisciplinary approach spanning fields in physical sciences (e.g., chemistry), biological sciences (e.g., molecular biology), engineering (e.g., chemical engineering), and medicine with considerable interaction and collaboration among ethicists, regulatory bodies, and industry. The introduction defines the field of nanobiomaterials and discusses its scope, current status, and future prospects. This is followed by an in-depth survey of nanobiomaterials. It also provides a comprehensive overview of the various synthesis and processing techniques important for developing bionanomaterials and explores the unique nanoscopic physicochemical properties of nanobiomaterials. Next, a detailed survey of potential applications of nanobiomaterials is presented. Here the emphasis is on the unique challenges in the design, fabrication, and evaluation of biomaterials for a particular application/field. For instance, key physical properties necessary for developing bionanomaterials for molecular imaging applications are completely different than those for gene therapy.--Provided by publisher	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7657744-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4267769-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006882-1>

The role of ecosystems in disaster risk reduction ¤ The increasing worldwide trend in disasters, which will be aggravated by global environmental change, urges us to implement new approaches to hazard mitigation, as well as exposure and vulnerability reduction. Ecosystem management is a well-tested solution to sustainable development that is being revisited because of its inherent “win–win” and “no-regrets” appeal to address rising disaster and climate change issues. It is one of the few approaches that can impact all elements of the disaster risk equation – mitigating hazards, reducing exposure, reducing vulnerabilities and increasing the resilience of exposed communities. Yet, the uptake of ecosystem-based approaches for disaster risk reduction (DRR) is slow despite some very good examples of success stories. Reasons for this are multiple: ecosystem management is rarely considered as part of the portfolio of DRR solutions because the environmental and disaster management communities typically work independently from each other; its contribution to DRR is highly undervalued compared to engineered solutions and thus not attributed appropriate budget allocations.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7675980-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4041387-1>

Probability matching priors : higher order asymptotics ¤ Probability matching priors, ensuring frequentist validity of posterior credible sets up to the desired order of asymptotics, are of substantial current interest. They can form the basis of an objective Bayesian analysis. In addition, they provide a route for obtaining accurate frequentist confidence sets, which are meaningful also to a Bayesian. This monograph presents, for the first time in book form, an up-to-date and comprehensive account of probability matching priors addressing the problems of both estimation and prediction. Apart from being useful to researchers, it can be the core of a one-semester graduate course in Bayesian asymptotics. Gauri Sankar Datta is a professor of statistics at the University of Georgia. He has published extensively in the fields of Bayesian analysis, likelihood inference, survey sampling, and multivariate analysis. Rahul Mukerjee is a professor of statistics at the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta. He co-authored three other research monographs, including A Calculus for Factorial Arrangements in this series. A fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, Dr. Mukerjee is on the editorial boards of several international journals.

Energy release rate for cracks in finite-strain elasticity ¤ Griffith's fracture criterion describes in a quasistatic setting whether or not a pre-existing crack in an elastic body is stationary for given external forces. In terms of the energy release rate (ERR), which is the derivative of the deformation energy of the body with respect to a virtual crack extension, this criterion reads: If the ERR is less than a specific constant, then the crack is stationary, otherwise it will grow. In this paper, we consider geometrically nonlinear elastic models with polyconvex energy densities and prove that the ERR is well defined. Moreover, without making any assumption on the smoothness of minimizers, we derive rigorously the well-known Griffith formula and the $J$-integral, from which the ERR can be calculated. The proofs are based on a weak convergence result for Eshelby tensors.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/1120622891> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4204381-5>

A dynamic material flow model for the European steel cycle ¤ Steel is of extraordinary importance for the European economy as well as society, but is responsible for enormous energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, steel flows are an obvious subject for the European climate protection. The quantification of steel stocks and flows is useful to be included in discussions regarding Circular Economy, energy system transformation and resource efficiency. Therefore, we developed a retrospective and dynamic material flow model covering the entire European steel and iron cycle from 2002 to 2019. Based on data by Worldsteel and assumptions mainly adopted by Cullen et al. (2012), the value and production chain of steel and iron products is covered by the model. It appears that the European steel and iron use reached a saturation from 2007 on, where the stock of steel in anthropogenic use phase reached around 5,600 Mt. In 2019, around 140 Mt of steel left the use phase, of which circa 6 Mt dissipated or are abandoned in place. Out of the remaining scrap, 110 Mt were collected as secondary raw materials for recycling. Recycling of steel in Europe reached a peak of approx. 140 Mt in 2007, from where on recycling declined equally to overall steel production leading to an almost constant recycling input rate of 57 %. The decline of steel recycling did not significantly affect the collection of steel scrap, but led to an increase of iron and steel scrap export. In 2019, 110 Mt of steel and iron were recycled in Europe, 65 % via EAF, 25 % via BOF and the remaining via ironmaking. Post-consumer waste is by mass more important than new scraps from production and manufacturing as evident in an old scrap ratio of 73 %. Further research could examine the effect of steel scrap prices on their use, further trace these export flows or analyse the potentials of secondary steel production for industry decarbonisation.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056834-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4014002-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4451877-8>

Based upon studies conducted by the European Forecasting Network, this book analyses key aspects of the impact of this recent enlargement with reference to eight of the ten new Member States, namely the Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs). It demonstrates that the enlargement could have profound consequences on both the new Member States and on the pre-accession members of the Union, given the unparalleled magnitude of the enlargement, the fact that the CEECs have levels of prosperity and economic development well below the Union average, and their history of participation in centrally planned regimes. The contributions examine regional policy, the debate about accession to the EMU, the macroeconomic trajectories of the Central and Eastern European economies to date and their likely future development.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4170174-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4066493-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4071013-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4128080-5>

Model-based engineering of an automotive adaptive exterior lighting system : realistic example specifications of behavioral requirements and functional design ¤ Model-based engineering is a well-established approach to cope with the complexity of today's embedded systems. Furthermore, model-based engineering can address industry needs for highly automated development solutions to foster correctness of safety-critical systems. In contrast, there is a vital lack of accessible specification documents for researchers for evaluation purposes. Evaluation of proposed engineering methods often relies on academic examples, automatically created unrealistic artificial models, or simple industrial specification excerpts. This research report aims at supporting researchers with model-based specifications of a real-world system on a competitive level of complexity. Therefore, a model-based specification of an Adaptive Exterior Lighting System (ELS) is presented that is part of an Automotive System Cluster (ASC). An ELS provides fundamental and additional functionalities for the well-known turn signal and low / high beam headlights. The specification documents the behavioral requirements and the functional design of the ELS, which are important artifacts in function-centered engineering. As modeling languages ITU Message Sequence Charts, Function Network, and Function Behavior Diagrams are used.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4832365-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4140467-1>

Do smart adaptive systems exist? : best practice for selection and combination of intelligent methods ¤ ‚Do Smart Adaptive Systems exist?’ is intended as a reference and a guide summarising and focusing on best practices when using intelligent techniques and building systems requiring a degree of adaptation and intelligence. It is therefore not intended as a collection of the most recent research results but a practical guide for experts from other areas and industrial users who are interested in building solutions to their problems using intelligent techniques. One of the main issues covered is an attempt to answer the question of how to select and/or combine suitable intelligent techniques from a large pool of potential solutions. Another attractive feature of the book is that it brings together experts from neural network, fuzzy, machine learning, evolutionary and hybrid systems communities who will provide their views on how these different intelligent technologies have contributed and will contribute to creation of smart adaptive systems of the future.

The MeDUSA reference manual, second edition ¤ BEGIN MeDUSA (Method for UML2-based Construction of Embedded & Real-Time Software) is a model-based software construction method targeting the domain of small embedded & real-time software. MeDUSA was developed by the Research Group Software Construction of the RWTH Aachen University in close cooperation with the German ABB Corporate Research Centre. It incorporates various practical experiences gained during the industrial development of embedded software in ABB Business Unit Instrumentation. Being Use Case-driven, MeDUSA systematically covers the software construction lifecycle phase from the early requirements up to implementation. Models are successively developed and employed throughout all activities. By enforcing a class-based rather than an object-oriented design, a smooth transition of the resulting design model towards an implementation in a procedural programming language is facilitated. This is essential, as procedural programming languages as the C language are still state-of-the-art in the domain of small embedded & real-time software.

Integrated Assessment of Instruments and Fiscal and Market-Based Incentives of International Climate Policy and Their Impacts (IACCP) : Study funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research : within the framework of FONA - Economy of Climate Change - BMBF ¤ In the existing literature the estimation of the effect of unilateral climate change policy measures and their effectiveness is done primarily in ”Computable General Equilibrium“ (CGE) models or based on “Integrated Assessment Models” (IAM). The selection of parameter values for the required calibration of the models is often ad hoc and based on various studies that are neither consistent to each other nor with the theoretical modeling. The objective of this project is to develop consistent and integrated approaches to enhance climate change policy advice. For this purpose, the structure of the estimated equations is derived from research results and based on theoretically modeling and thus links the estimated and micro-founded results with consistently constructed CGE-models which are then employed for the analysis of climate policy scenarios. This represents a significant methodological development to existing Integrated Assessment Models and in particular combines the research in the international trade area with that of climate debate. The results of the project include: • Construction of well suited databases to be used for the analysis of international climate policy • Evaluating the instruments of international climate change policy • Development of indices for international climate change policies • Prognosis of the welfare effects of climate change policy objectives with a special focus on the long term consequences • Conveying the findings to a wide audience	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7547705-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4224214-9> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4125152-0>
Addressing the gaps in market diffusion modeling of electrical vehicles : a case study from Germany for the integration of environmental policy measures ¤ Electric vehicles (EVs) can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of the transportation sector. Therefore, the German government has defined various measures and targets to promote the diffusion of EVs. However, factors influencing the market diffusion of EVs as well as interdependencies between policy measures and vehicle diffusion are often unclear and hence, diffusion simulations are probably inaccurate. At the same time, a precise simulation of EV diffusion is a relevant parameter in travel demand models building the base for transportation planning. This paper addresses the gaps in current market diffusion models for EVs with a particular focus on environmental effects as additional influencing factors of the market diffusion. Results will be drawn for the German car market with a market diffusion simulation until 2050. The market diffusion model ALADIN is applied and energy prices are extended by a CO2 price to improve the consideration of environmental factors in the market diffusion modelling. The effectiveness of environmental policy measures is assessed in scenarios with three different CO2 prices and their impact on the diffusion of EVs. The results show that the market diffusion is highly dependent on the evolution of external factors. A CO2 price of at least 150 €/t of CO2 by 2030 can have a significant impact on the market diffusion of EVs and may as well lead to changes in the drive mix for both, electric and conventional drives within the German passenger car fleet. The German government’s target of seven to ten million EVs registered by 2030 seems in general achievable, if currently adopted purchase bonuses and expected cost degression for EVs also take effect. Until 2050, we find large effects with CO2 prices up to 500 €/t, yet limited growth in market share above that threshold.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4161820-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4055072-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4078523-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4059277-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4062954-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151795-7>
The share of renewable electricity in electric vehicle charging in Europe is higher than grid mix ¤ Plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) are widely considered a promising option to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in transport. The electricity used for charging is decisive for the environmental assessment of PEV. Most studies assume the average grid mix for charging. This article provides a systematic overview of existing studies and additional data on the electricity contracts of users and charge point operators (CPO) as well as the share of renewables in the charged electricity for PEV in Europe. We combine survey data with existing studies and cover a noteworthy share of the European PEV market and CPO. Our results show that the actual share of renewables in electricity contracts for home and work charging as well as for public CPO is much higher than in the European grid mix. Despite discussions around the methodological use of contracted renewable electricity, our findings imply that many previous studies underestimated the well-to-wheel life-cycle benefits of PEV.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4013585-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4164507-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4177306-8> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/1313251569>

Infinite-horizon optimal control in the discrete-time framework ¤ In this book the authors take a rigorous look at the infinite-horizon discrete-time optimal control theory from the viewpoint of Pontryagin's principles. Several Pontryagin principles are described which govern systems and various criteria which define the notions of optimality, along with a detailed analysis of how each Pontryagin principle relate to each other. The Pontryagin principle is examined in a stochastic setting and results are given which generalize Pontryagin's principles to multi-criteria problems. Infinite-Horizon Optimal Control in the Discrete-Time Framework is aimed toward researchers and PhD students in various scientific fields such as mathematics, applied mathematics, economics, management, sustainable development (such as, of fisheries and of forests), and Bio-medical sciences who are drawn to infinite-horizon discrete-time optimal control problems	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4121428-6>

Hartree-Fock-Slater method for materials science : the DV-X [Alpha] method for design and characterization of materials ; with 33 tables ¤ Molecular-orbital calculations for materials design such as alloys, ceramics, and coordination compounds are now possible for experimentalists. Molecuar-orbital calculations for the interpretation of chemical effect of spectra are also possible for experimentalists. The most suitable molecular-orbital calculation method for these purpose is the DV-Xa method, which is robust in such a way that the calculation converges to a result even if the structure of the molecule or solid is impossible in the pressure and temperature ranges on earth. This book specially addresses the methods to design novel materials and to predict the spectralline shape of unknown materials using the DV-Xa molecular-orbital method, but is also useful for those who want to calculate electronic structures of materials using any kinds of method.

Stochastic optimization methods ¤ Optimization problems arising in practice involve random model parameters. For the computation of robust optimal solutions, i.e., optimal solutions being insensitive with respect to random parameter variations, appropriate deterministic substitute problems are needed. Based on the probability distribution of the random data, and using decision theoretical concepts, optimisation problems under stochastic uncertainty are converted into appropriate deterministic substitute problems. Due to the occurring probabilities and expectations, hence, multiple integrals, approximative solution techniques must be applied. Several deterministic and stochastic approximation methods are provided: Taylor expansion methods, regression and response surface methods (RSM), probability inequalities, First order reliability methods (FORM), convex approximation/deterministic descent directions/efficient points, stochastic gradient methods, stochastic approximation procedures, differentiation formulas for probabilities and expectations. The mathematical properties of the approximative problems and iterative solution procedures (e.g. rate of convergence) are described.

Innovation, industrial dynamics and structural transformation : Schumpeterian legacies ; with 45 tables ¤ This book provides a account of work in the Schumpeterian and evolutionary tradition of industrial dynamics and the evolution of industries. It is shown that over time industries evolve and change their structure. In this dynamic process change is affected and sometimes constraint by many factors: knowledge and technologies, the capabilities and incentives of actors, new products and processes, and institutions. All these elements and their relations drive innovative activities and affect economic performance in an industry. Investigations into these complex phenomena show a deep interdependence between empirical work delivering a rich account of regularities and stylized facts in the structure of industries and their change, and theoretical analyses ranging from theoretical work to formal modeling.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4027089-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4061949-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4058136-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4431027-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133311-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032134-4> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4026822-6>

Measuring varieties of industrial relations in Europe : a quantitative analysis ¤ Previous Eurofound research has identified four key dimensions of industrial relations: industrial democracy, industrial competitiveness, social justice, and quality of work and employment. This report seeks to build a set of indicators to measure country performance in industrial relations in terms of these four dimensions and to develop a typology of industrial relations systems, enabling a cross-country analysis of trends. The report focuses particularly on industrial democracy, seen in this context as the core dimension of industrial relations and the most desirable model of work and employment governance.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4002617-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4056995-0>
Chemical evolution and the origin of life ¤ Up to now, we do not have a generally accepted theory about the origin of life and about the process of development of life, we only have a great number of - to some extent even contradictory - hypotheses.

Horst Rauchfuss is comparing the different theories from the view of the latest results and is giving an exciting and easy understandable insight into the present state of research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4156614-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4006799-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4113602-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4034831-3> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4147631-1>
Successful test management : an integral approach ; with 44 tables ¤ For change projects to succeed, organizations must carry out targeted risk management. This certainly applies to the complex IT projects that are taking place under current market conditions! An important success factor in this is the continuous involvement of the client and other stakeholders. This is often entirely lacking or inadequate. However, a sound test management approach based on Risk & Requirement Based Testing helps to increase that involvement. It is aimed at identifying risks in connection with the development and implementation of an IT system, such as the loss of market share, compensation claims, damage to reputation or high maintenance costs. Test Management is not something that a Project Leader does 'on top of everything else'. There are countless activities that the Test Manager has to carry out. To provide insight into these activities and their relationship with each other, LogicaCMG has developed the Test Management Model. This model describes the Test Manager's activities from the start of a test project up to the moment of the information system's implementation, thus creating an integral whole. On the principle of Test Management = Risk Management, this book equips the reader to set up test projects, to manage them and to communicate with the stakeholders. Besides a description of the theory of each activity, the chapters provide as many hints and tips as possible: what works best in the Test Manager's working practice and what he should guard against. The appendices contain checklists and templates that support the chapters, and with these, the reader is able to set to work immediately. TOC:1. Testing and Test Management 2.

A comparison of the Bayesian and frequentist approaches to estimation ¤ This monograph contributes to the area of comparative statistical inference. Attention is restricted to the important subfield of statistical estimation. The book is intended for an audience having a solid grounding in probability and statistics at the level of the year-long undergraduate course taken by statistics and mathematics majors. The necessary background on decision theory and the frequentist and Bayesian approaches to estimation is presented and carefully discussed in Chapters 1-3. The 'threshold problem'--identifying the boundary between Bayes estimators which tend to outperform standard frequentist estimators and Bayes estimators which don't--is formulated in an analytically tractable way in Chapter 4. The formulation includes a specific (decision-theory based) criterion for comparing estimators. The centerpiece of the monograph is Chapter 5, in which, under quite general conditions, an explicit solution to the threshold is obtained for the problem of estimating a scalar parameter under squared error loss. The six chapters that follow address a variety of other contexts in which the threshold problem can be productively treated. Included are treatments of the Bayesian consensus problem, the threshold problem for estimation problems involving of multidimensional parameters and/or asymmetric loss, the estimation of nonidentifiable parameters, empirical Bayes methods for combining data from 'similar' experiments, and linear Bayes methods for combining data from 'related' experiments. The final chapter provides an overview of the monograph's highlights and a discussion of areas and problems in need of further research.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4182963-3>

Spectral properties of noncommuting operators ¤ Forming functions of operators is a basic task of many areas of linear analysis and quantum physics. Weyl's functional calculus, initially applied to the position and momentum operators of quantum mechanics, also makes sense for finite systems of selfadjoint operators. By using the Cauchy integral formula available from Clifford analysis, the book examines how functions of a finite collection of operators can be formed when the Weyl calculus is not defined. The technique is applied to the determination of the support of the fundamental solution of a symmetric hyperbolic system of partial differential equations and to proving the boundedness of the Cauchy integral operator on a Lipschitz surface.

Fuzzy statistics ¤ This monograph introduces elementary fuzzy statistics based on crisp (non-fuzzy) data. In the introductory chapters the book presents a very readable survey of fuzzy sets including fuzzy arithmetic and fuzzy functions. The book develops fuzzy estimation and demonstrates the construction of fuzzy estimators for various important and special cases of variance, mean and distribution functions. It is shown how to use fuzzy estimators in hypothesis testing and regression, which leads to a comprehensive presentation of fuzzy hypothesis testing and fuzzy regression as well as fuzzy prediction.

Inductive invariant checking with partial negative application conditions ¤ Graph transformation systems are a powerful formal model to capture model transformations or systems with infinite state space, among others. However, this expressive power comes at the cost of rather limited automated analysis capabilities. The general case of unbounded many initial graphs or infinite state spaces is only supported by approaches with rather limited scalability or expressiveness. In this report we improve an existing approach for the automated verification of inductive invariants for graph transformation systems. By employing partial negative application conditions to represent and check many alternative conditions in a more compact manner, we can check examples with rules and constraints of substantially higher complexity. We also substantially extend the expressive power by supporting more complex negative application conditions and provide higher accuracy by employing advanced implication checks. The improvements are evaluated and compared with another applicable tool by considering three case studies.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4274073-3>

Modeling solvent environments : applications to simulations of biomolecules ¤ While much attention has been given to the development of realistic macromolecular models, this book focuses on latest advances in modeling the equally important solvent environment in an accurate and efficient manner. A comprehensive view of the current methods for modeling solvent environments is presented in contributions from the leading researchers in the field. Throughout, the emphasis is placed on the application of such models in simulation studies of biological processes, although the coverage is sufficiently broad to extend to other systems as well. The book presents a comprehensive account of the many recently developed new methods and contrasts their different strengths. As such, this monograph treats a full range of topics, from statistical mechanics-based approaches to popular mean field formalisms, coarse-grained solvent models, more established explicit, fully atomic solvent models, and recent advances in applying ab initio methods for modeling solvent properties.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4168032-7> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4265444-0>

Adiabatic perturbation theory in quantum dynamics ¤ Separation of scales plays a fundamental role in the understanding of the dynamical behaviour of complex systems in physics and other natural sciences. A prominent example is the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in molecular dynamics. This book focuses on a recent approach to adiabatic perturbation theory, which emphasizes the role of effective equations of motion and the separation of the adiabatic limit from the semiclassical limit. A detailed introduction gives an overview of the subject and makes the later chapters accessible also to readers less familiar with the material.

Econometric Theory and Methods ¤ Econometric Theory and Methods provides a unified treatment of modern econometric theory and practical econometric methods. The geometrical approach to least squares is emphasized, as is the method of moments, which is used to motivate a wide variety of estimators and tests. Simulation methods, including the bootstrap, are introduced early and used extensively. The book deals with a large number of modern topics. In addition to bootstrap and Monte Carlo tests, these include sandwich covariance matrix estimators, artificial regressions, estimating functions and the generalized method of moments, indirect inference, and kernel estimation. Every chapter incorporates numerous exercises, some theoretical, some empirical, and many involving simulation. Econometric Theory and Methods is designed for beginning graduate courses. The book is suitable for both one- and two-term courses at the Masters or Ph.D. level. It can also be used in a final-year undergraduate course for students with sufficient backgrounds in mathematics and statistics. FEATURES BLUnified Approach: New concepts are linked to old ones whenever possible, and the notation is consistent both within and across chapters wherever possible. BLGeometry of Ordinary Least Squares: Introduced in Chapter 2, this method provides students with valuable intuition and allows them to avoid a substantial amount of tedious algebra later in the text. BLModern Concepts Introduced Early: These include the bootstrap (Chapter 4), sandwich covariance matrices (Chapter 5), and artificial regressions (Chapter 6). BLInclusive Treatment of Mathematics: Mathematical and statistical concepts are introduced as they are needed, rather than isolated in appendices or introductory chapters not linked to the main body of the text. BLAdvanced Topics: Among these are models for duration and count data, estimating equations, the method of simulated moments, methods for unbalanced panel data, a variety of unit root and cointegration tests, conditional moment tests, nonnested hypothesis tests, kernel density regression, and kernel regression. BLChapter Exercises: Every chapter offers numerous exercises, all of which have been answered by the authors in the Instructor's Manual. Particularly challenging exercises are starred and their solutions are available at the authors' website, providing a way for instructors and interested students to cover advanced material.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4132280-0> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4431358-5>

Models in cooperative game theory : crisp, fuzzy, and multi-choice games ¤ This book investigates models in cooperative game theory in which the players have the possibility to cooperate partially. In a crisp game the agents are either fully involved or not involved at all in coperation with some other agents, while in a fuzzy game players are allowed to cooperate with infinite many different participation levels, varying from non-cooperation to full cooperation. A multi-choice game describes the intermediate case in which each player may have a fixed number of activity levels. Different set and one-point solution concepts for these games are presented. The properties of these solution concepts and their interrelations on several classes of crisp, fuzzy, and multi-choice games are studied.

Fuzzy logic in financial analysis ¤ In today's increasing complex and uncertain business environment, financial analysis is yet more critical to business managers who tackle the problems of an economic or business nature. Knowledge based on formal logic and even experience becomes less sufficient. This volume systematically sets out the basic elements on which to base financial analysis for business in the new century. It incorporates a previous work that can serve as the basis and foundation to the new contributions that are now being made in the field of financial economy and intend to provide business with instruments and models that are suitable for the treatment of the new economic context. In dealing with rapid and unpredictable changes in technological and business conditions, it postulates a growing reliance on the opinions of experts instead of past data or probabilistic forecasts, which is a radical change but may yield fruitful results. For this reason, much emphasis is devoted to the problem of aggregation of the opinion of experts in the financial field, with the object of limiting, wherever possible, the subjective component of the opinions and making sure that the decisions have the best guarantee of reaching the desired objectives	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4133000-6> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4341284-1>
The valuative tree ¤ This&nbsp;volume is devoted to a beautiful object, called the valuative tree and designed as a powerful tool for the study of singularities in two complex dimensions. Its intricate yet manageable structure can be analyzed by both algebraic and geometric means. Many types of singularities, including those of curves, ideals, and plurisubharmonic functions, can be encoded in terms of positive measures on the valuative tree. The construction of these measures uses a natural tree Laplace operator of independent interest. TOC:Introduction.- 1. Generalities.- 2. MacLane's Method.- 3. Tree Structures.- 4.

Rational modeling of electrochemical double-layers and derivation of Butler-Volmer equations ¤ We derive the boundary conditions for the contact between an electrolyte and a solid electrode. At first we revisit the thermodynamic consistent complete model that resolves the actual electrode–electrolyte interface and its adjacent boundary layers. The width of these layers is controlled by the Debye length that is typically very small, leading to strongly different length scales in the system. We apply the method of asymptotic analysis to derive a simpler reduced model that does not resolve the boundary layers but instead incorporates the electrochemical properties of the layers into a set of new boundary conditions. This approach fully determines the relation of bulk quantities to the boundary conditions of the reduced model. In particular, the Butler-Volmer equations for electrochemical reactions, which are still under discussion in the literature, are rational consequences of our approach. For illustration and to compare with the literature, we consider a simple generic reaction.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4151761-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4185141-9>
Decreasing costs of renewables : analysis of energy sector planning and climate policy in Indonesia ¤ This study analyses the processes and assumptions underlying the development of Indonesia's NDC and its revision in 2020. The assumptions underlying the related energy sector documents (KEN, RUEN, RUKN, RUPTL) and their relationships are also assessed. The study is completed by giving a snapshot of the current state of discussion around constraints related to renewable energy. The unconditional target of Indonesia's NDC foresees a reduction of GHG emissions of 29% relative to a Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario (41% conditional to international support). It specifies that electricity generation shall reduce emissions by 18.8% relative to BAU. The overall target of a 29% and 41% have been set by a non-public process. The sectoral shares of GHG reductions are determined by the responsible ministries (ESDM in case of the energy sector), with modelling performed by academic institutions (e.g. BTI for energy). This modelling is partly based on existing plans of the energy sector. Data underlying this modelling is not public, but underlying socio-economic assumptions suggest that the BAU scenario overestimates emissions. The NDC has no influence on planning in the energy sector but should be considered a by-product of existing planning documents. The process underlying the current revision is repeated for the current revision of the NDC and likely also for creation of the LTS. The ambition under the revised NDC will not be increased. The share of renewable energy in the NDC follows from a cascade of energy planning documents (KEN, RUEN, RUKN, RUPTL), which pass the target from the most overarching energy plans to the NDC. Arguably the most important target related to renewable energy planning in Indonesia set down by the countries' energy strategy KEN, to reach 23% renewable energy in each sector in total primary energy supply in 2025. The assumptions underlying this target are not known and can therefore not be contested. The national energy plan RUEN makes this target more specific in terms of technology. The power sector plan by the ministry of energy RUKN and the power sector plan by the utility RUPTL all consider 23% renewable energy target. Besides that, these plans remain largely disconnected from each other...	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4032594-5> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4068598-6>

Classical topics in discrete geometry ¤ This multipurpose book can serve as a textbook for a semester long graduate level course giving a brief introduction to Discrete Geometry. It also can serve as a research monograph that leads the reader to the frontiers of the most recent research developments in the classical core part of discrete geometry. Finally, the forty-some selected research problems offer a great chance to use the book as a short problem book aimed at advanced undergraduate and graduate students as well as researchers. The text is centered around four major and by now classical problems in discrete geometry. The first is the problem of densest sphere packings, which has more than 100 years of mathematically rich history. The second major problem is typically quoted under the approximately 50 years old illumination conjecture of V. Boltyanski and H. Hadwiger. The third topic is on covering by planks and cylinders with emphasis on the affine invariant version of Tarski's plank problem, which was raised by T. Bang more than 50 years ago. The fourth topic is centered around the Kneser-Poulsen Conjecture, which also is approximately 50 years old. All four topics witnessed very recent breakthrough results, explaining their major role in this book.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4130271-0>

On the strength of cut-based inequalities for capacitated network design polyhedra ¤ In this paper we study capacitated network design problems, differentiating directed, bidirected and undirected link capacity models. We complement existing polyhedral results for the three variants by new classes of facet-defining valid inequalities and unified lifting results. For this, we study the restriction of the problems to a cut of the network. First, we show that facets of the resulting cutset polyhedra translate into facets of the original network design polyhedra if the two subgraphs defined by the network cut are (strongly) connected. Second, we provide an analysis of the facial structure of cutset polyhedra, elaborating the differences caused by the three different types of capacity constraints. We present flow-cutset inequalities for all three models and show under which conditions these are facet-defining. We also state a new class of facets for the bidirected and undirected case and it is shown how to handle multiple capacity modules by Mixed Integer Rounding (MIR).

Hardy operators, function spaces and embeddings ¤ Classical Sobolev spaces, based on Lebesgue spaces on an underlying domain with smooth boundary, are not only of considerable intrinsic interest but have for many years proved to be indispensible in the study of partial differential equations and variational problems. Many developments of the basic theory since its inception arise in response to concrete problems, for example, with the (ubiquitous) sets with fractal boundaries. The theory will probably enjoy substantial further growth, but even now a connected account of the mature parts of it makes a useful addition to the literature. Accordingly, the main themes of this book are Banach spaces and spaces of Sobolev type based on them; integral operators of Hardy type on intervals and on trees; and the distribution of the approximation numbers (singular numbers in the Hilbert space case) of embeddings of Sobolev spaces based on generalised ridged domains. This timely book will be of interest to all those concerned with the partial differential equations and their ramifications. A prerequisite for reading it is a good graduate course in real analysis.

Automatic sequences : theory, applications, generalizations ¤ The authors develop the theory of automatic sequences and their generalizations, such as Sturmian words and [kappa]-regular sequences. Further, they discuss applications to number theory (particularly formal power series and transcendence in finite characteristic), physics, computer graphics, and music. Results are presented from first principles wherever feasible, and the book is supplemented by a collection of 460 exercises, 85 open problems, and more than 1600 citations to the literature. Thus, this book is suitable for graduate students or advanced undergraduates, as well as for mature researchers wishing to know more about this subject.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4615919-8>
Bryce DeWitt`s lectures on gravitation ¤ Bryce DeWitt, a student of Nobel Laureate Julian Schwinger, was himself one of the towering figures in 20th century physics, particularly renowned for his seminal contributions to quantum field theory, numerical relativity and quantum gravity. In late 1971, DeWitt gave a course on gravitation at Stanford University, leaving almost 400 pages of detailed handwritten notes. Written with clarity and authority, and edited by his former student Steven Christensen, these timeless lecture notes, containing material or expositions not found in any other textbooks, are a gem to be discovered or re-discovered by anyone seriously interested in the study of gravitational physics--P. 4 of cover	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/4021908-2> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4124012-1> <https://d-nb.info/gnd/4158117-9>

Lower central and dimension series of groups ¤ A fundamental object of study in group theory is the lower central series of groups. Understanding its relationship with the dimension series, which consists of the sub-groups determined by the augmentation powers, is a challenging task. This monograph presents an exposition of different methods for investigating this relationship. In addition to group theorists, the results are also of interest to topologists and number theorists. The approach is mainly combinatorial and homological. A novel feature is an exposition of simplicial methods for the study of problems in group theory.	<https://d-nb.info/gnd/7635869-0>
