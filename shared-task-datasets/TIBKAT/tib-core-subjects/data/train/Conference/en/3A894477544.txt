34th Applied Imagery and Pattern Recognition Workshop : [multi-modal imaging] : proceedings : October 19-21, 2005, Washington, D.C
Annotation, AIPR brings together researchers from government, industry, and academia to discuss their imaging and pattern recognition techniques with the theme of multi-modal applications. In a cross disciplinary manner, a common theme shows the interrelationship between imagery products and the direct relevance of physics-based modeling and reconstruction to the development of both multiple modes and high dimensionality for pattern recognition applications. This theme was explored in homeland defense and military imagery as well as biomedical and commercial applications. The contents of AIPR 2005 will hopefully be a valuable resource to all those wishing to show how physical imaging and multi-modal applications improve the state of the art in automatic pattern recognition
