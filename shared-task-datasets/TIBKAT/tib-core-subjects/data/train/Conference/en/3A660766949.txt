Risk analysis VII - simulation and hazard mitigation & Brownfields V - prevention, assessment, rehabilitation and development of brownfield sites : [proceedings of two international conferences: Risk Analysis 2010 and Brownfields 2010 ; Seventh International Conference on Computer Simulation in Risk Analysis and Hazard Mitigation & Fifth International Conference on Prevention, Assessment, Rehabilitation and Development of Brownfield Sites]
This book contains the papers presented at two conferences organized by the Wessex Institute of Technology. The first conference is the Seventh International Conference on Computer Simulation in Risk Analysis and Hazard Mitigation, being held in Algarve, Portugal, September 13-15. This biennial conference is the latest in a successful series that began in 1998 and that includes many practical applications, demonstrating how to analyze and manage risk and mitigate hazards. The applications cover man-made as well as natural hazards, the importance of which is becoming increasingly evident in our modern world. These problems have become a priority for all governments, as well as a cause for public concern. The second conference is the Fifth International Conference on Prevention, Assessment, Rehabilitation and Development of Brownfield Sites, also being held in Algarve, September 14-16. The biennial conference was first held in 2002 and covers the challenges the public and private sectors must face in seeking to reuse brownfield sites and to capitalize on the opportunities--
