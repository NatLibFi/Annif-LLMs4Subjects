Stochastic geometry, spatial statistics and random fields : asymptotic methods
This volume provides a modern introduction to stochastic geometry, random fields and spatial statistics at a (post)graduate level. It is focused on asymptotic methods in geometric probability including weak and strong limit theorems for random spatial structures (point processes, sets, graphs, fields) with applications to statistics. Written as a contributed volume of lecture notes, it will be useful not only for students but also for lecturers and researchers interested in geometric probability and related subjects
