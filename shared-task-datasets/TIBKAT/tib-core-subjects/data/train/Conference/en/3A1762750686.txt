This book includes papers on intelligent expert systems and sustainability applications in the areas of data science, image processing, wireless communication, risk assessment, healthcare, intelligent social network mining, and energy. The recent growth of sustainability leads to a progressively new era of computing, where its design and deployment leverages significant impact on the intelligent systems research. Moreover, the sustainability technologies can be effectively used in the progressive deployment of various network-enabled technologies like intelligent sensors, smart cities, wearable technologies, robotics, web applications and other such Internet technologies. The thrust of this book is to publish the state-of-the-art research articles that deals with the design, development, implementation and testing of the intelligent expert systems and also to provide an overview of the sustainable management of these systems. .
