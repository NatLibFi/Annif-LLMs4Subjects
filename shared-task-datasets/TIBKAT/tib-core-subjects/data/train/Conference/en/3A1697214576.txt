Fluids under pressure
Primitive Equations for Oceanic and Atmospheric Dynamics -- Viscous Compressible Flows under Pressure -- Global Well-posedness for Incompressible-Incompressible Two Phase Problem -- The Role of Pressure in the Theory of Weak Solutions to the Navier-Stokes Equations -- Pressure Dependent Material Coefficients -- FE Pressure Stabilizations for Incompressible Flow Problems -- Finite-Volume Methods for Navier-Stokes Equations.
This contributed volume is based on talks given at the August 2016 summer school “Fluids Under Pressure,” held in Prague as part of the “Prague-Sum” series. Written by experts in their respective fields, chapters explore the complex role that pressure plays in physics, mathematical modeling, and fluid flow analysis. Specific topics covered include: Oceanic and atmospheric dynamics Incompressible flows Viscous compressible flows Well-posedness of the Navier-Stokes equations Weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations Fluids Under Pressure will be a valuable resource for graduate students and researchers studying fluid flow dynamics.
