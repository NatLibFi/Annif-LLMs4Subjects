Based on a NATO Advanced Summer Institute, this volume discusses physical models, mathematical formalisms, experimental techniques, and applications for ultrafast dynamics of quantum systems. These systems are used in laser optics, spectroscopy, and utilize monochromaticity, spectral brightness, coherence, power density, and tunability of laser sources.
