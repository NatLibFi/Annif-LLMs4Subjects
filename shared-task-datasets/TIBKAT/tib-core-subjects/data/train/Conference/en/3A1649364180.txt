This book is devoted to models and tools for managing development processes in the fields of software engineering and mechanical and chemical engineering. The author evaluates the state of the art in the area and presents an integrated approach addressing the limitations of the presently available tools and systems. The models introduced for managing development processes cover products, activities, and resources in a systematic and coherent way; moreover, the models are designed to cope with the dynamics of the development processes. The tools and the management system developed by the author provide customized environments for different classes of users. The management environment supports managers in coordinating managerial activities; developers use the work environment in order to perform technical activities; finally, the modeling environment is used to adapt the management system to specific application domains
