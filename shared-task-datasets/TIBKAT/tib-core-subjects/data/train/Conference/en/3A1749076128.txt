Accelerated pavement testing to transport infrastructure innovation : proceedings of 6th APT Conference
This volume gathers the latest advances, innovations, and applications in the field of accelerated pavement testing (APT), presented at the 6th International Conference on Accelerated Pavement Testing, in Nantes, France, on September 27-29, 2021. Discussing APT, which involves rapid testing of full-scale pavement constructions for structural deterioration, the book covers topics such as APT facilities, APT of asphalt concrete and sustainable/innovative materials, APT for airfield pavements, testing of maintenance and rehabilitation solutions, testing of smart and multi-functional pavements, data analysis and modeling, monitoring and non-destructive testing, and efficient means of calibrating/developing pavement design methods. Featuring peer-reviewed contributions by leading international researchers and engineers, the book is a timely and highly relevant resource for materials scientists and engineers interested in determining the performance of pavement structures during their service life (10+ years) in a few weeks or months
