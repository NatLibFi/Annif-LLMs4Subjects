Supramolecular Structure and Function 9
The book is based on International Summer Schools on Biophysics held in Croatia which, contrary to other workshops centered mainly on one topic or technique, has very broad scope providing advanced training in areas related to biophysics. This volume presents papers in the field of biophysics for studying biological phenomena by using physical methods and/or concepts. Its scope should be of interest for students at doctoral or postdoctoral level and to experienced scientists.

This volume is presenting papers in the field of biophysics for studying biological phenomena by using physical methods (NMR, EPR, FTIR, Mass Spectrometry, etc.) and/or concepts (predictions of protein-protein interactions, virtual ligand screening etc.). The interrelationship of supramolecular structures and there functions is enlightened by applications of
