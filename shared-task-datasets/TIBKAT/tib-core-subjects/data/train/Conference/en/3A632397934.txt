Exploring Services Science : First International Conference , IESS 2010, Geneva, Switzerland, February 17-19, 2010. Revised Papers
This book contains the refereed post-proceedings of the First International Conference on Exploring Services Science (IESS) in Geneva, Switzerland, in February 2010. The goal of the conference was to build upon the growing community to further study and understand this emerging discipline, which leverages methods, results and knowledge stemming from management, social and cognitive science, law, ethics, economics, and computer science towards the development of own concepts, methods, techniques and approaches and thus creating the basis for the production of transdisciplinary results. The 19 full and 8 short papers accepted for IESS were selected from 42 submissions and cover a wide spectrum of issues related to service design, service creation, service composition, service management, and service networks as well as their applications in businesses and public administration.
