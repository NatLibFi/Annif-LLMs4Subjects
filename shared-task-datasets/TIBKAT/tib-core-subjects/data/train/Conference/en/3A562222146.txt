Engineering of crystalline materials properties : state of the art in modeling, design and applications ; [proceedings of the NATO Advanced Study Institute on Engineering of Crystalline Materials Properties: State of the Art in Modeling, Design and Applications, New Materials for better Defence and Security, Erice, Italy, 7 - 17 June 2007]
This volume collects the state of the art in molecular materials. It collects the lecture notes of a series of lectures given by some of the best specialists in the field at the 2007 Erice International School of Crystallography -and also a NATO-ASI course-. The school developed along two parallel lines. First we stablished ???where we are??? in terms of modeling, design, synthesis and applications of crystalline solids with predefined properties. Second, we attempted to define current and possible futuristic lines of development in the quest for novel molecule-based materials with potential a
