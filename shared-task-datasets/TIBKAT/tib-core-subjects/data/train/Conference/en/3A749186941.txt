Software Engineering for Multi-Agent Systems II : Research Issues and Practical Applications
This book presents a coherent and well-balanced survey of recent advances in software engineering approaches to the development of realistic multi-agent systems (MAS). In it, the concept of agent-based software engineering is demonstrated through examples that are relevant to and representative of real-world applications. The 15 thoroughly reviewed and revised full papers are organized in topical sections on requirements engineering, software architecture and design, modeling, dependability, and MAS frameworks. Most of the papers were initially presented at the Second International Workshop on Software Engineering for Large-Scale Multi-Agent Systems, SELMAS 2003, held in Portland, Oregon, USA, in May 2003; three papers were added in order to complete the coverage of the relevant topics
