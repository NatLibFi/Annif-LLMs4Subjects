Advances in multiresolution for geometric modelling : [papers presented at the MINGLE 2003 workshop held in Cambridge, UK, 9 - 11 September 2003]
Multiresolution methods in geometric modelling are concerned with thegeneration, representation, and manipulation of geometric objects atseveral levels of detail. Applications include fast visualization andrendering as well as coding, compression, and digital transmission of3D geometric objects. This book marks the culmination of the four-year EU-funded researchproject, Multiresolution in Geometric Modelling (MINGLE). The bookcontains seven survey papers, providing a detailed overview of recentadvances in the various aspects of multiresolution modelling,and sixteen additional research papers. Each of the seven parts ofthe book starts with a survey paper,followed by the associated research papers in that area. All papers wereoriginally presented at the MINGLE 2003 workshop held at EmmanuelCollege, Cambridge, UK, 9-11 September 2003
