Einstein Equations: Local Energy, Self-Force, and Fields in General Relativity : Domoschool 2019
This volume guides early-career researchers through recent breakthroughs in mathematics and physics as related to general relativity. Chapters are based on courses and lectures given at the July 2019 Domoschool, International Alpine School in Mathematics and Physics, held in Domodossola, Italy, which was titled “Einstein Equations: Physical and Mathematical Aspects of General Relativity”. Structured in two parts, the first features four courses from prominent experts on topics such as local energy in general relativity, geometry and analysis in black hole spacetimes, and antimatter gravity. The second part features a variety of papers based on talks given at the summer school, including topics like: Quantum ergosphere General relativistic Poynting-Robertson effect modelling Numerical relativity Length-contraction in curved spacetime Classicality from an inhomogeneous universe Einstein Equations: Local Energy, Self-Force, and Fields in General Relativity will be a valuable resource for students and researchers in mathematics and physicists interested in exploring how their disciplines connect to general relativity.
Part I. Main Lectures -- Introduction to the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy -- Gravitational self-force in the Schwarzschild spacetime -- Geometry and analysis in black hole spacetimes -- Study of fundamental laws with Antimatter -- Part II.
