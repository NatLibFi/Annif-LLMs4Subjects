Trapped charged particles : a graduate textbook with problems and solutions
"Taken as a whole, the book gives an overview of why traps for charged particles are important, how they work, their special features and limitations, and their application in areas such as precision measurements, mass spectrometry, optical clocks, plasma physics, antihydrogen creation, quantum simulation and quantum information processing. Chapters from various world experts include those on the basic properties of Penning traps and RF traps, as well as those covering important practical aspects such as vacuum systems, detection techniques, and different types of particle cooling including laser cooling. Finally, individual chapters deal with the different area of application listed above. Each chapter is complemented by fully worked problems, making Trapped Charged Particles perfect for advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students new to this topic"--
