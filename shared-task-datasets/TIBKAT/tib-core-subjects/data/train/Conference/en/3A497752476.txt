Environmentally harmful subsidies : challenges for reform ;  [OECD Workshop on Environmentally Harmful Subsidies held in Paris on 3 - 4 November 2003]
Subsidies are pervasive throughout OECD countries and much of this support is potentially harmful environmentally. This report presents sectoral analyses on agriculture, fisheries, water, energy and transport, proposing a checklist approach to identifying and assessing environmentally harmful subsidies. It also identifies the key tensions and conflicts that are likely to influence subsidy policy making. The book concludes with a discussion of politically feasible subsidy reform strategies.--Publisher's description
