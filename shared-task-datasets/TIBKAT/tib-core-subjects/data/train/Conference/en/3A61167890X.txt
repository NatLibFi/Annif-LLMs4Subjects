Proceedings of the international conference on microstructure and texture in steels and other materials : february 5-7, 2008, Jamshedpur, India
Microstructure and Texture in Steels and Other Materials comprises a collection of articles pertaining to experimental and theoretical aspects of the evolution of crystallographic texture and microstructure during processing of steels and some other materials. Among the topics covered is the processing-microstructure-texture-property relationship in various kinds of steels, including the latest grade. Special emphasis has been given to introduce recent advances in the characterization of texture and microstructure, as well as modeling. The papers included are written by well-known experts from academia and industrial R and D, which will provide the reader with state-of-the-art, in-depth knowledge of the subject. With these attributes, Microstructure and Texture in Steels and Other Materials is expected to serve the cause of creating awareness of current developments in microstructural science and materials engineering among academic and R and D personnel working in the field.
