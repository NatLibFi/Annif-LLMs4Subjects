Advances in representation theory of algebras : Conference in Honor of José Antonio de la Peña’s 60th birthday : Advances in Representation Theory of Algebras (ARTA VII) : September 24–28, 2018, Instituto de Matemáticas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico
The Seventh ARTA (“Advances in Representation Theory of Algebras VII”) conference took place at the Instituto de Matemáticas of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, in Mexico City, from September 24–28, 2018, in honor of José Antonio de la Peña's 60th birthday. Papers in this volume cover topics Professor de la Peña worked on, such as covering theory, tame algebras, and the use of quadratic forms in representation theory. Also included are papers on the categorical approach to representations of algebras and relations to Lie theory, Cohen–Macaulay modules, quantum groups and other algebraic structures.
