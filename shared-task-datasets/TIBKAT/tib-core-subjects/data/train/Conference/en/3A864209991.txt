Designing new heterogeneous catalysts : London, United Kingdom, 4-6 April 2016
This volume focuses on the fundamental understanding of key aspects of catalytic science, especially relating to catalyst preparation and production, the determination of atomic-architectures of active, reactive and de-activated catalysts and modelling of the active site -- knowledge which is essential for the design of new catalysts. Catalysis is a core area of contemporary science posing major fundamental and conceptual challenges, while being at the heart of the chemical industry. This volume explores the modern methods used to design new catalysts and how the approaches can bridge across the disciplines of physical sciences and chemical engineering
