Building sustainable urban settlements : approaches and case studies in the developing world ; [selection of the papers presented at the 15th Inter-Schools Conference on Development held in Cardiff from 29 - 31 March, 1998]
In this collection of studies, environmental, institutional, social and cultural aspects of sustainability are considered in a variety of towns and cities in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central and South America. Many of the contributors focus particularly on meeting the needs of the urban poor. The main themes are: urban environmental management with particular reference to economic activities and housing; achieving institutional, social and cultural sustainability; and managing urban development processes to reduce their environmental impacts, to improve the produced built environments and sustain improved practices. Drawing on case studies of individual cities (Lahore, Shanghai, Medellin, Florianopolis, Hofuf, Cairo) and countries (South Africa, Mozambique, Iran) as well as comparative research and analytical procedures, the international group of contributors evaluate government policies and practices and make suggestions for improvements.
