Proceedings of the First Seattle Symposium in Biostatistics : Survival Analysis
The papers in this volume discuss important methodological advances in several important areas, including multivariate failure time data and interval censored data. The book will be an indispensable reference for researchers and practitioners in biostatistics, medical research, and the health sciences.
Some remarks on the analysis of survival data -- Multivariate failure time data: Representation and analysis -- Analysis of multivariate survival times with non-proportional hazards models -- Analysis of mean and rate functions for recurrent events -- Extending the Cox model -- Model-based and/or marginal analysis for multiple event-time data -- Artificial insemination by donor: discrete time survival data with crossed and nested random effects -- Interval censored survival data: A review of recent progress -- Singly and doubly censored current status data with extensions to multistate counting processes -- Additive hazards regression models for survival data -- Some exploratory tools for survival analysis -- Survival analysis in the regulatory setting -- Proposed strategies for designing and analyzing sepsis trials -- Coarsening at random: characterizations, conjectures, counter-examples -- Sequential models for coarsening and missingness -- Addresses for Contact Authors -- List of Referees.
