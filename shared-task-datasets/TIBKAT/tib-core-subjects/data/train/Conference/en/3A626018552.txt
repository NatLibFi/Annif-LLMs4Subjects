Competitive interaction between airports, airlines and high-speed rail : Round Table 145
How should airports be regulated to contain market power? This round table proceedings&nbsp;first examines whether they need to be regulated at all. It concludes that because regulation is inevitably imperfect and costly, policy makers should establish conditions for competition to emerge between airports in preference to comprehensive regulation, whenever possible. Economic regulation is sometimes necessary, such as when airports are heavily congested. The&nbsp;proceedings determines which approaches are likely to work best and also assesses strategies for managing greenhouse gas emissions.&n
