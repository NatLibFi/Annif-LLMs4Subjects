Applied mathematics and omics to assess crop genetic resources for climate change adaptive traits
Genetic diversity of crop plants is being further explored and exploited to generate higher crop yield, better disease resistance, and more nutritional value. This book focuses on using genetic resources to mitigate the effects of climate change and increase crop production. It emphasises recent advances in mathematics and omics technologies addressing issues related to adaptation of crops to changing climatic conditions.--
