Science with the VLT in the ELT Era
The Workshop 'Science with the VLT in the ELT era' was organised by ESO as a forum for the astronomical community to debate its expected future use of ESO's Very Large Telescope ( and its VLTI interferometric mode) when other facilities such as ALMA, JWST and, hopefully, at least one extremely large 30-40m class telescope will be operating. VLT/I science highlights were presented, future science priorities argued, synergies between the VLT and the future facilities confirmed and specific new VLT/I instruments proposed.
