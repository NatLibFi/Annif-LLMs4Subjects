This book concentrates on the modern theory of dynamical systems and its interactions with number theory and combinatorics. The greater part begins with a course in analytic number theory and focuses on its links with ergodic theory, presenting an exhaustive account of recent research on Sarnak's conjecture on Möbius disjointness. Selected topics involving more traditional connections between number theory and dynamics are also presented, including equidistribution, homogenous dynamics, and Lagrange and Markov spectra. In addition, some dynamical and number theoretical aspects of aperiodic order, some algebraic systems, and a recent development concerning tame systems are described
