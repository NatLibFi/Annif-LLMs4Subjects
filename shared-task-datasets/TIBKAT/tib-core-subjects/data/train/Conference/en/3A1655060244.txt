Algebraic Cycles and Hodge Theory : Lectures given at the 2nd Session of the Centro Internationale Matematico Estivo (C.I.M.E.) held in Torino, Italy, June 21-29, 1993
The main goal of the CIME Summer School on "Algebraic Cycles and Hodge Theory" has been to gather the most active mathematicians in this area to make the point on the present state of the art. Thus the papers included in the proceedings are surveys and notes on the most important topics of this area of research. They include infinitesimal methods in Hodge theory; algebraic cycles and algebraic aspects of cohomology and k-theory, transcendental methods in the study of algebraic cycles
