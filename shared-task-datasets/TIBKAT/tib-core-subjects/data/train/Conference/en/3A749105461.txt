Geometry, Morphology, and Computational Imaging : 11th International Workshop on Theoretical Foundations of Computer Vision Dagstuhl Castle, Germany, April 7-12, 2002 Revised Papers
This book constitutes the thoroughly refereed post-proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Theoretical Foundations of Computer Vision, held in Dagstuhl Castle, Germany in April 2002. The 27 revised full papers presented went through two rounds of reviewing and improvement and assess the state of the art in geometry, morphology, and computational imaging. The papers are organized in sections on geometry - models and algorithms; property measurement in the grid and on finite samples; features, shape, and morphology; and computer vision and scene analysis
