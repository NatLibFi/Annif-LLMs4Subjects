Generic programming : advanced lectures ; [lectures presented at a Summer School on Generic Programming held at the University of Oxford in August 2002]
Generic programming attempts to make programming more efficient by making it more general. This book is devoted to a novel form of genericity in programs, based on parameterizing programs by the structure of the data they manipulate. The book presents the following four revised and extended chapters first given as lectures at the Generic Programming Summer School held at the University of Oxford, UK in August 2002: Generic Haskell: Practice and TheoryGeneric Haskell: ApplicationsGeneric Properties of DatatypesBasic Category Theory for Models of Syntax
