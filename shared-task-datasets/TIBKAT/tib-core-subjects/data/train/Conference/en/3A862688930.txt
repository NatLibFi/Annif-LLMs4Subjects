Nanomedicine : basic and clinical applications in diagnostics and therapy ; 11 tables ; Second Else Kröner-Fresenius-Symposium September, 3rd - 5th 2010
Nanomedicine - the application of nanotechnology to human health - is a promising field of research at the interface of physical, chemical, biological, and medical science. Recent advances have made it possible to analyze biological systems at cellular and subcellular levels, offering numerous promising approaches to improve medical diagnosis and therapy. It is expected that nanomedicine will have a great impact especially on drug delivery and imaging. In this context, the development of targeted, highly specific nanoparticles is of pivotal importance. The results of these advances will offer personalized diagnostic tools and treatments in the future. Based on the 2nd Else Kröner-Fresenius-Symposium, this book presents a broad spectrum of topics ranging from nanoscale drug delivery/drug design to nanotoxicity and from diagnostics and imaging to therapeutic applications including antibody therapies. The contributions are authored by leading experts in the field and provide an excellent overview of the current knowledge in nanomedicine. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the subject area this volume will be of special interest to physicians, biologists, chemists, engineers, and physicists as well as to students in the respective fields.
