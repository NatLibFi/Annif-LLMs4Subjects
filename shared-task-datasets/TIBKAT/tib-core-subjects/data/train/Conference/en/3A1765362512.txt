The urbanism of Metabolism : visions, scenarios and models for the mutant city of tomorrow
"This edited book explores and promotes reflection on how the lessons of Metabolism experience can inform current debate on city making and future practice in architectural design and urban planning. Sixty years on from when the Metabolist manifesto was published, the authors' original contributions highlight the persistent links between present and past that can help to re-imagine new urban futures as well as the design of innovative intra-urban relationships and spaces. The essays are written by experienced scholars and renowned academics from Japan, Australia, Europe, S. Korea and the US and expose Metabolism's special merits in promoting new urban models and evaluate the current legacy of its architectural projects and urban design lessons. They offer a critical, intellectual, and up-to-date account of the Metabolism projects and ideas in the context of current evolution of architectural and urbanism discourse in a global context"
