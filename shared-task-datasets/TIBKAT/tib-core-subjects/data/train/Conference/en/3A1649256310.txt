Machine Learning and Data Mining in Pattern Recognition : Second International Workshop, MLDM 2001 Leipzig, Germany, July 25â€“27, 2001 Proceedings
This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Machine Learning and Data Mining in Pattern Recognition, MLDM 2001, held in Leipzig, Germany in July 2001. The 26 revised full papers presented together with two invited papers were carefully reviewed and selected for inclusion in the proceedings. The papers are organized in topical sections on case-based reasoning and associative memory; rule induction and grammars; clustering and conceptual clustering; data mining on signals, images, and spatio-temporal data; nonlinear function learning and neural net based learning; learning for handwriting recognition; statistical and evolutionary learning; and content-based image retrieval
